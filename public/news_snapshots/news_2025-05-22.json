    "title": "Former MLB player suing ex-division rival over career-ending injury: 'Obvious and avoidable risk'",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Anex-Major League Baseballplayer is blaming a former opponent for his career-ending injury. Darin Ruf played first base for theMilwaukee BrewersJune 2, 2023, in a game against the NL Central rival Cincinnati Reds. Little did he know it would be the final game of his career. In the third inning, Ruf was chasing a pop-up in foul territory when his knee crashed into the end of the field tarp roller. Ruf badly cut his knee and limped off the field with the help of a trainer.

The TV broadcast of the game said there was a \"significant hunk of metal … that doesn't give very much.\" Ruf went on the 60-day injured list and never played in the major leagues again. His initial injury, aside from the laceration, was ruled a non-displaced fracture of his patella. But, according to Ruf's complaint, he suffered \"permanent and substantial deformities to his knee.\" \"This didn't need to happen,\" Ruf said in a statement. \"I wish it didn't happen. Players shouldn't have to worry about hidden hazards like that on a major league field.\" Milwaukee Brewers designated hitter Darin Ruf (25) hits a single during the eighth inning against the Houston Astros May 22, 2023, at American Family Field in Milwaukee, Wis.(Mark Hoffman/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel/USA Today Network) MAN CHARGED WITH GIVING BOOZE TO UNDERAGE PIRATES FAN WHO FELL ONTO FIELD: REPORTS \"This was an obvious and avoidable risk,\" Tad Thomas, Ruf's attorney, said in a release announcing the lawsuit. \"There are basic safety protocols every MLB team should follow. Leaving an unpadded metal roller on the edge of the field is inexcusable.\" The Reds did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The situation is similar toDustin Fowler's.In his major league debut in 2017, he injured a knee in Chicago after running into an electrical box while chasing down a pop fly. Fowler, who would have led off the next inning for his first plate appearance in the majors, sued the White Sox for negligence. The Yankees traded him roughly a month after the injury for Sonny Gray, and Fowler's first MLB hit came against Gray the next year. Ruf, 38, played in the majors from 2012 to 2023 with the Philadelphia Phillies (2012-16), San Francisco Giants (2020-22, 2023), New York Mets (2022) and Brewers (2023). He batted .239 with a .329 on-base percentage, 67 homers and 205 RBI in 582 career games.

    "title": "New Orleans district attorney blasts sheriff over botched prison escape investigation",
    "article_text": "Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams says Sheriff Susan Hutson failed to investigate the crime scene where Friday’s jailbreak took place. The Orleans Parish district attorney torched the county's sheriff for failing to order a crime scene investigation after 10 inmates escaped from theNew Orleansprison on Friday. District Attorney Jason Williams said in a Thursday afternoon press conference that he learned from New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick that Sheriff Susan Hutson never requested a formal crime scene investigation from the jail cell the10 inmates used to escape. \"Time is also of the essence when trying to get good DNA samples or collect fingerprints to make sure those areas are not molested or destroyed in any way,\" he told the media. \"So I am deeply concerned that there was not an immediate request by the sheriff to our local crime lab to get in there and examine, document, preserve and collect all of the forensic evidence that was available there so that we could already have it tested.\" Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson arrives for a City Council meeting at City Hall in New Orleans on Tuesday after 10 inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center last week.(Sophia Germer/The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate) He has also demanded that the sheriff's office preserve and turn over all surveillance footage from the jail from April 1 until Wednesday, as well as any other pertinent investigatory materials. It has been nearly a week since 10 inmates, some wanted for violent crimes like murder, brazenly escaped from their cell and over the jail's fence into the New Orleans community. They taunted authorities on the way out with written messages on the cell wall, including one that read, \"To easy LOL.\" Five of those inmates, including Derrick Groves, who is a convicted killer of four people, are still on the loose. AUNT URGES CONVICTED MURDERER TO SURRENDER AS ORLEANS PARISH JAIL MANHUNT CONTINUES Williams even suggested that members of the sheriff's department could be under investigation in the escape. \"We've also asked, we've sent letters out to the sheriff asking that she and all members of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office and any maintenance workers or crew members submit to voluntary samples of DNA, and provide fingerprints so that they can be included or excluded from this investigation,\" he said. A photo of the hole left behind by violent inmates who escaped the Orleans Parish Jail.(Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office) He also said that if the sheriff's office, which runs the jail, had followed protocol, it is likely that all 10 fugitives would have been captured by now. \"Time is of the essence in terms of catching escaped fugitives,\" Williams said. \"If they escape at 12:30 [a.m.], immediately upon awareness of that, we need to make sure that the public is notified, the media is notified, because if that had happened, in all likelihood, all 10 of these individuals would be in custody by now.\" Since a proper inquiry was never made, members of the NOPD crime lab and Williams himself on Thursday scoured the jail cell, the hole behind the removed toilet and the corridor through which the inmates escaped, in an attempt to collect evidence. Photos provided by Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office show, from top left, DKenan Dennis, Gary C. Price, Robert Moody, Kendell Myles and Corey E.

Groves and Leo Tate Sr.(Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office via AP) LOUISIANA ATTORNEY GENERAL EXPECTS MORE ARRESTS IN NEW ORLEANS JAIL ESCAPE INVESTIGATION He described his Thursday visit to the crime scene as \"very unusual.\" \"But we have to make sure that we are focusing on this crime scene, the destruction of those bars, of that toilet, who could have assisted these individuals in getting out, whether they were in a uniform or not in a uniform,\" said Williams. \"And obviously fingerprints, DNA, these pieces of evidence tell a story. And that's the type of evidence that a jury is going to be looking for when it's time to hold somebody accountable. And we need to make sure we're holding the right people accountable.\" Hutson earlier this week suspended her campaign for re-election as sheriff, saying her priority was to focus solely on catching the fugitives. One person from inside the jail has already been charged withaiding the inmatesin the escape. Sterling Williams, 33, who was an employee of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, has been arrested and charged with 10 counts of principal to simple escape and one count of malfeasance in office for allegedly turning off the water in the cell from which the escapees fled. He is being held on $1.1 million bond, $100,000 per count, in the Plaquemines Parish Jail. Sterling Williams is accused of helping 10 inmates escape from the Orleans Parish Jail.(Louisiana Department of Justice) LOUISIANA GOVERNOR BLASTS 'PROGRESSIVE PROMISES' AFTER NEW ORLEANS JAIL ESCAPE On Wednesday, the Louisiana State Police (LSP) announced that two more people werearrested for aidingthe inmates after they escaped. Cortnie Harris, 32, of New Orleans and 38-year-old Corvanntay Baptiste of Slidell were arrested for assisting the fugitives. They are also being held at the Plaquemines County Jail. On Thursday afternoon, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrillannounced on Xthat Harris' bond was set at $2.5 million and Baptiste's at $1 million. \"You will be arrested and prosecuted if you assist these escapees in any way,\" she warned in the post. Sources close to the investigation told Fox News that Baptiste wasCorey Boyd's girlfriend. She allegedly did not cooperate with the police and said she did not participate in the escape.

Instead, Texas and Penn State both had to play in the first round and won convincingly.

    "article_text": "During a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, President Trump said relations with North Korea will happen. North Korean dictatorKim Jung Unwas left fuming this week when he attended the botched launch of a new 5,000-ton naval destroyer. The launch, at the northeastern port of Chongjin, was intended to tout the communist nation’s military advancement, but ended in embarrassment for Kim after the ship slid off a ramp and became stuck, state media reported. The flatcar failed to move alongside the ship, throwing it off balance and crushing parts of the ship’s bottom, North Korean news agency KCNA reported. Its stern slid down the launch slipway, while its bow section failed to leave the ramp. North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un was left fuming this week when he attended a botched launch of a new 5,000-ton naval destroyer.(Contributor/Getty Images | Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP) KIM JONG UN SUPERVISES NORTH KOREA'S AIR DRILLS, PUSHES FOR ENHANCED WAR PREPARATION The total extent of the damage was unclear and it isn’t known if there were any injuries. North Korea did not release photos from the scene, although satellite imagery released by South Korea on Thursday indicated that the ship was lying on its side in the water after the failed launch. According to KCNA, Kim, who was present at the ceremony on Wednesday, blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators for a \"serious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism.\" Kim warned that the errors caused by the \"irresponsibility of the relevant officials\" would need to be investigated at a ruling Workers’ Party meeting slated for late June. He said that restoring the destroyer before the meeting was directly related to the prestige of the state and the restoration should be completed unconditionally. This satellite image from Planet Labs PBC shows a blue tarp covering a North Korean destroyer after it suffered a failed launch while it was being put to sea in Chongjin, North Korea, on Thursday.(Planet Labs PBC via AP) Moon Keun-sik, a navy expert who teaches at Seoul’s Hanyang University, said that despite the embarrassment, Kim still wanted to publicly report on the mishap. \"It's a shameful thing, but the reason why North Korea disclosed the incident is it wants to show it's speeding up the modernization of its navy forces and expresses its confidence that it can eventually build,\" he toldThe Associated Press. Moon suspected that the incident likely happened because North Korean workers aren't yet familiar with such a large warship and had been rushed to put it in the water. It was the second naval destroyer the secretive nation launched in a month after Kim attended the successful launch of another 5,000-ton destroyer from Nampo, a port on the west coast of North Korea. Kim later watched missiles fired from the ship, with experts saying that it appeared to have been built with Russian technology. Experts said that both ships are likely designed to carry weapons systems including nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. 600 NORTH KOREAN TROOPS KILLED WHILE FIGHTING UKRAINE, SOUTH KOREA SAYS A report by the North Korea-focused 38 North website assessed last week that the destroyer in Chongjin was being prepared to be launched sideways from the quay, a method that has rarely been used in North Korea. The report said the destroyer launched in Nampo, in contrast, used a floating dry dock. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un talks to military members as he inspects projectiles during a visit to an airfield in this photo released by the Korean Central News Agency on Friday.(KCNA via Reuters) Kim has framed the arms buildup as a response to perceived threats from the U.S. and South Korea, which have been expanding joint military exercises in response to the North’s advancing nuclear program. In March, Kim oversaw tests of newly developedAI-powered suicide dronesand called for their increased production. He was seen walking with aides on what appeared to be an unmanned surveillance aircraft that resembled the U.S. RQ-4 Global Hawk high-altitude surveillance aircraft parked on the tarmac in the background. Other images showed a fixed-wing drone zeroing in on a tank-shaped target then exploding in flames. Kim has said that unmanned control andAI capabilitymust be the top priorities in modern arms development. Kim was also seen walking to a large aircraft with four engines and a radar dome mounted on the fuselage. Analysts have previously reported thatNorth Koreawas converting the Russian-made Il-76 cargo aircraft for an early-warning role to help augment the North's existing land-based radar systems, which are sometimes limited by the peninsula's mountainous terrain, London's International Institute for Strategic Studies said in a report in September.

The South Korean military assessed that around 4,700 of them have been killed or wounded. The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.

However, since the war in Gaza began, the ICRC has faced criticism from some for not pushing to visit the hostages and for its volunteers taking part in Hamas-led hostage release ceremonies. When asked by Fox News Digital about the ceremonies, Kurtzer said that ICRC workers in Gaza have \"very little ability to dictate the terms and the protocols of therelease operations.\" However, he added that the organization believes these hostage release operations \"must be done in dignity and should be done privately.\" \"So, certainly there were things that we saw that we didn't like. We conveyed our views about those directly through what we call our bilateral and confidential dialogue,\" Kurtzer said. Despite facing mounting pressure and obstacles, the ICRC seems to be sticking to its mission.

Fox News Digital then pressed Kurtzer on whether the ICRC saw the situation of hostages in Gaza and Palestinians being held in Israel as equivalent. Kurtzer later clarified the comments in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"The ICRC recognizes the distinction between hostages and detainees enshrined in international humanitarian law (IHL). Hostages are captured or held with the threat of being harmed or killed to pressure another party into doing something, as a condition for the hostage’s release or safety.

It provided hope for families on all sides. It provided hope to families of the hostages. It provided hope for people living inside Gaza,\" Kurtzer said.

(Credit: The Associated Press) Noteven wild animalsare safe from Mexico’s cartel violence. Tigers, elephants, lions and monkeys were evacuated this week from a wildlife refuge in Culiacán, Sinaloa, a cityoverrun by cartel gunmen. The animals, some of which were once kept as pets by drug lords, were moved to another facility after staff faced threats and gunfire — a total collapse of law and order. The Associated Press reports that the Ostok Sanctuary, which housed over 700 animals, was forced to pack up and flee after months of violence and intimidation from rival factions of the Sinaloa Cartel. WEALTHY SUBURB ROCKED BY SUSPECTED CARTEL MURDER-FOR-HIRE SHOWS DRUG LORDS' REACH ACROSS US: EXPERT A lion sits in a cage waiting to be transported to Mazatlan, Sinaloa state, at the Ostok Sanctuary, on the outskirts of Culiacan, Sinaloa state, Mexico, on Tuesday.(AP Photo/Felix Marquez) Some animals went days without food. Others began shedding fur from stress. Two big cats died. \"We’ve never seen violence this extreme,\" sanctuary Director Ernesto Zazueta told the AP. This is what happens when cartels run the show and the government steps aside. For years, Culiacán was under firm control of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the world’s most powerfuldrug trafficking organizations. That \"order\" shattered when a son of El Chapo Guzmán kidnapped a rival cartel leader and handed him over to U.S. authorities. MEXICO OFFERS PROTECTION TO FAMED SINGER AFTER DRUG CARTEL DEATH THREATS An elephant arrives at its new home in Mazatlan, Sinaloa state, after being transported from Ostok Sanctuary in the outskirts of Culiacan, Mexico, on Tuesday.(AP Photo/Felix Marquez) Now, the cartels are fighting each other for turf. And civilians, including children and families, are paying the price. Security analyst David Saucedo told the AP that the two warring factions are \"extorting, kidnapping and robbing\" to fund their war. Roads are blocked. Shootings happen almost daily. Parents check the news each morning to see if it’s safe to send their kids to school. When night falls, the streets go dark. Bars close. Businesses shut down. The police? Mostly absent. The animal refuge sat near Jesús María, a stronghold of the Chapitos, a faction run by El Chapo’s sons. That made it a dangerous place to operate. According to the UK’s Mirror, exotic animals were being caught in the crossfire. Tigers, lions, even elephants were showing signs of trauma from hearing gunfire and helicopters nearby. A lioness is carried to a transport cage at the animal refuge Ostok Sanctuary, on the outskirts of Culiacan, Mexico, on Monday.(AP Photo/Felix Marquez) Some of the animals were once owned by cartel bosses. One tiger was found chained in a plaza during a shootout. Locals whisper that drug lords feed enemies to their pet lions — a disturbing rumor that reflects just how broken things are. Staff say they received threats to burn down the sanctuary and kill the animals unless payments were made. \"There’s no safe place left in this city these days,\" rescuer Diego García told the AP. After months of pleading for help, the sanctuary got nothing from the government. Not a single authority stepped in to protect the animals or the workers. The last straw came when one of the sanctuary’s elephants, Bireki, injured her foot.No vet in Mexicoor even the U.S. was willing to travel to cartel territory to treat her. \"We asked ourselves, ‘What are we doing here?’\" Zazueta told the AP. \"If we don’t leave, who will treat them?\" That led to the quiet decision to evacuate: not just the elephant, but every animal on site. Trucks with white flags were loaded with sedated tigers, lions, jaguars and elephants. Some workers whispered calmly to the animals, trying to ease their stress. The convoy rolled out of Culiacán, past masked cartel lookouts on motorbikes, and into Mazatlán. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It took months of training and planning. But the animals made it. For now. Sanctuary staff are praying that Mazatlán will be a true refuge. But they know cartel violence has spread like a disease. And the fear is that it could follow them.

A former aide toLos AngelesMayor Karen Bass who served as the deputy mayor of public safety has agreed to plead guilty to threatening to bomb City Hall last year, the Justice Department said Thursday. Brian Williams, 61, of Pasadena, agreed to plead guilty to a single-count of \"information with threats regarding fire and explosives\", which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. \"In an era of heated political rhetoric that has sometimes escalated into violence, we cannot allow public officials to make bomb threats,\" said U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli. \"My office will continue its efforts to keep the public safe, including from those who violate their duty to uphold the law.\" LA COUNTY DA NATHAN HOCHMAN PROMISES CRACKDOWN ON CRIMINALS: ‘THE FUN IS OVER’ A view of Los Angeles City Hall.(Getty Images) The threat was carried out on Oct. 3, 2024 during a virtual meeting with Williams and others related to his duties, federal prosecutors said. During the call, Williams used theGoogle Voiceapplication on his personal cellphone to place a call to his city-issued cellphone. He then left the meeting and called the chief of staff of the Los Angeles Police Department, in which he falsely stated that he had just received a call on his city-issued cellphone from an unknown man who threatened to bomb Los Angeles City Hall. Ten minutes after the call, Williams texted Bass and several high-ranking city officials in the mayor’s office and falsely reported, \"Bomb threat: I received phone call on my city cell at 10:48 am this morning. The male caller stated that ‘he was tired of the city support of Israel, and he has decided to place a bomb in City Hall. It might be in the rotunda.’ I immediately contacted the chief of staff of LAPD, they are going to send a number of officers over to do a search of the building and to determine if anyone else received a threat.\" Investigators determined that Williams never received a call and had made the bomb threat himself.

None were found, prosecutors said. Williams described the threatening call he claimed to have received to police and showed them the record of an incoming call that appeared as a blocked number on his city-issued cellphone. That incoming call record was the call Williams had placed to himself from the Google Voice application on his personal cellphone, investigators determined. Williams then texted Bass and other city officials. \"At this time, there is no need for us to evacuate the building, I’m meeting with the threat management officers within the next 10 minutes,\" he allegedly wrote. \"In light of the Jewish holidays, we are taking this thread a little more seriously.

When White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about Massie and Davidson voting against the bill, she said the president believes they should be primaried. \"I don't think he likes to see grandstanders in Congress. What's the alternative? I would ask those members of Congress. Did they want to see a tax hike? Did they want to see our country go bankrupt?

    "article_text": "After signing into law Republican-backed bills banning sanctuary cities in New Hampshire and allowing for law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities, GOP Gov. Kelly Ayotte says she wants to ‘make sure we keep our state safe.’ CONCORD, N.H. — New Hampshire on Thursday became the first state in New England to ban so-calledsanctuary cities. \"There will be no sanctuary cities in New Hampshire, period, end of story,\" Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte said at a bill signing ceremony at the state Capitol. Speaking with Fox News Digital minutes later, Ayotte noted that the measures she signed \"ban sanctuary cities in New Hampshire but also allow cooperation between all of our law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.\" New Hampshirejoins a growing number of states in banning sanctuary cities, which is a term used to describe jurisdictions that put some limits on cooperating with efforts by federal authorities to deport illegal immigrants. TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER CRACKING DOWN ON SANCTUARY CITIES Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire signs into law two bills that ban sanctuary cities at the Statehouse in Concord, N.H., on Thursday.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) Ayotte, a former state attorney general who later served six years representing New Hampshire in the U.S. Senate, made banning sanctuary cities a key element in her successful 2024 run for governor. Ayotte's campaign slogan was \"Don't Mass up New Hampshire,\" as she took aim at neighboring Massachusetts' more lenient migrant policies. \"I campaigned on making sure we would not have sanctuary cities here in New Hampshire, and we don’t want to go the way of Massachusetts that has had a billion-dollarillegal immigration crisis,\" the governor said in her national digital exclusive interview with Fox News. Ayotte noted that she supports \"legal immigration, but when people aren’t following our laws, we need to enforce our laws and this is about public safety.\" \"New Hampshire is ranked the safest state in the nation, and I was glad I was able to sign the bill banning sanctuary cities to make sure we remain that way,\" the governor added. HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING AND COVERAGE OF THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE The two bills were passed in the GOP-dominated state legislature mostly along party lines. State Sen. Bill Gannon, the top sponsor in the state Senate, said that the measures would \"make us an even safer place to work, live, and raise a family.\" And state Rep. Joe Sweeney, the lead House sponsor, said that \"we are taking the handfcuffs off our law enforcement officers, and hopefully they’ll be able to work with our federal government, ICE, to put the handcuffs on the criminal illegal aliens that are violating and disobeying our laws.\" PresidentDonald Trumprepeatedly took aim at sanctuary cities as he made the issue of illegal immigration a key component to his successful 2024 campaign to win back the White House. And Trump last month signed an executive order putting some muscle behind his threat to pull federal funding from sanctuary cities. Some Democrats in New Hampshire, who opposed the measure, pointed to Trump's efforts in the nation's capital. WHAT AYOTTE TOLD FOX NEWS ABOUT SECURITY THE NATION'S NORTHERN BORDER \"What this bill does, under the guise of enabling New Hampshire law enforcement to support federal immigration efforts, is to make our state a willing accomplice in a politically manufactured campaign of state terrorism against a group of people, the vast majority of whom came here not to victimize America, but because they love America and they believe America is good,\" state Rep. David Meuse told reporters. Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire highlights her state's status as the safest in the nation as she signs into law two bills that ban sanctuary cities, at the Statehouse in Concord, N.H., on Thursday.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) But Ayotte, asked about the lack of support from across the political aisle for the two bills, said, \"I don’t understand where the Democrats are on these policies.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to the New Hampshire Municipal Association, there are nosanctuary citiesin the state, while a handful of cities and towns in the state have described themselves as \"welcoming cities\" that encourage a welcoming environment for all people, regardless of their race, ethnicity or origin. But state Republican lawmakers pointed to between nine and 12 cities and towns in New Hampshire that they have identified over the years as welcome or sanctuary cities.

FIRST ON FOX: Republican senators John Cornyn and Chuck Grassley and Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar are rolling out a bipartisan measure to protect sensitive genetic data in response to privacy concerns sparked by23andMe's bankruptcy, Fox News Digital has learned. Cornyn, R-Texas; Grassley, R-Iowa; and Klobuchar, D-Minn., are introducing the Don’t Sell My DNA Act, which would safeguard customers’ sensitive genetic information when an entity that maintains data files for bankruptcy. The bill would add genetic information to the definition of \"personally identifiable information\" in the bankruptcy code. PROTECT YOUR GENETIC DATA: URGENT STEPS AFTER 23ANDME BANKRUPTCY Under current law, the bankruptcy code provides protections for personally identifiable information in bankruptcy court proceedings to prevent the possibility of identity theft, harm or other unlawful injury. Senate aides told Fox News Digital the current definition of personally identifiable information includes an individual's name, address, email, phone number, Social Security number, credit card numbers and other information that could be used for identification purposes. Those aides said the definition is \"outdated\" and does not include a reference to genetic information, leaving the information vulnerable. A 23andMe saliva collection kit(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) \"This legislation would solve this problem by updating the definition of ‘personally identifiable information’ in the bankruptcy code to include genetic information,\" a Senate aide said. The bill also addresses consumerprivacy concernsby having consumers affirmatively consent to the sale or lease of their genetic information after a bankruptcy case commences and requiring companies to provide prior written notice of the use, sale or lease of their genetic information during bankruptcy. The bill also requires the trustee or debtor in possession to delete any genetic information not subject to a sale or lease. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas(Reuters) \"Advances in DNA testing have allowed Americans to have unprecedented access to important insights about their genetics, but these companies must have a plan to protect this data in the event of bankruptcy,\" Cornyn told Fox News Digital. \"By updating the bankruptcy code, this legislation would safeguard Americans’ sensitive genetic information to ensure it cannot be weaponized against them or made public without their knowledge and consent.\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, at the U.S. Capitol after a senate luncheon Sept. 24, 2024.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) And Klobuchar said companies \"have profited off of Americans’ data while consumers have been left in the dark, which is especially concerning in light of reports that 23andMe plans to sell customer genetic data assets to a large pharmaceutical company.\" \"This bill will put new protections in place to safeguard Americans’ privacy while giving consumers greater control over how their sensitive health data is shared,\" Klobuchar said. Grassley told Fox News Digital consumers should \"feel confident that any personalinformation shared with a public company isn't up for grabs when that company files for bankruptcy.\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.(Screenshot/ABC/TheView) Grassley told Fox News Digital the bill \"would fill gaps in current law to help safeguard consumers' genetic information and ensure Americans' DNA isn't treated like any other financial asset.\" On Monday, 23andMe announced Regeneron Pharmaceuticals would purchase 23andMe through a bankruptcy auction. Senate aides said Regeneron promises to \"protect consumer information, but the data privacy concerns for future bankruptcies remain.\" REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS TO BUY BANKRUPT 23ANDME IN $256M DEAL The genetic testing company 23andMe, once a pioneer in consumer DNA testing, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March amid financial struggles, a leadership shakeup and growing concerns about the security of its customers' genetic data. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals announced it will acquire \"substantially all\" of genetic testing company 23andMe's assets. The pharmaceutical company said it won the court-supervised auction of the genetic testing company, with Regeneron agreeing to pay $256 million for the assets. The auction for 23andMe was part of theChapter 11 bankruptcyprotection it filed in March to arrange a sale of its business. In its bankruptcy petition, the company estimated a range of $100 million to $500 million for its assets. Estimated liabilities were the same. The pharmaceutical company is buying 23andMe’s personal genome service and its health and research services segments, according to 23andMe.

    "article_text": "Secretary of Education Linda McMahon pushed back against allegations of lawlessness from Democrat Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman during a House Committee hearing on Wednesday. One of the nation's most highly ranked high schools is once again in the spotlight over its admissions policies after the U.S. Department of Education announced it would be launching an investigation into the matter. The announcement comes after the state's Republican Attorney General,Jason Miyares, said his office has found reasonable cause after a multi-year investigation determining that Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST), which is overseen by Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) system, operates an admissions process that discriminates against applicants of Asian heritage. \"The Fairfax County School Board made clear its intended outcome was to reduce opportunities for Asian American students—and that’s exactly what occurred,\" Miyares said. \"These students are not statistics. They are sons and daughters, neighbors, classmates and Virginians who deserve equal protection and opportunity under the law.\" The controversy began in 2020 when TJHSST made changes to its admissions policies to sensibly promote diversity. This was done through the elimination ofstandardized testingand application fees for interested students, implementing a holistic review process that considers factors like socioeconomic status and geographical location, and seething aside a certain number of spots for students from each middle school in the county. FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP ADMIN MOVES TO DISMANTLE DEPT OF EDUCATION Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology is located in the Washington, D.C., suburbs in Northern Virginia. It has consistently ranked among the best schools in the nation.(Google Maps) In response, parents filed a lawsuit against the district, alleging that the new admissions policy discriminated against asian students. Afederal district courtsubsequently ruled in favor of the parents, but that ruling was later overturned by a federal appeals court. TheU.S. Supreme Courteventually declined to hear the case, effectively cementing the appeals court's ruling. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented and warned of the possible implications the appeals court's ruling could have for other admissions policies at other schools across the country. BIDEN EDUCATION DEPT PUT PRIORITY ON PRONOUNS, LEFT BACKLOG OF NEARLY 200 ANTISEMITISM COMPLAINTS: OFFICIAL Miyares has been investigating TJHSST's admissions policies since 2023, concluding this week that there was reasonable cause to determine FCPS was \"discriminating against Asian American students.\" According to Miyares, when TJHSST first implemented its new admissions policy, Asian American students made up over 65% of the school's admitted classes. But over a period of just one year, Asian American admissions dropped 19 points, he noted. Attorney General of Virginia Jason Miyares sits in his office in Richmond, Virginia.(Photo by Julia Rendleman for The Washington Post via Getty Images) \"Internal communications confirm that this outcome was intentional. The Board reviewed proposal after proposal until it could guarantee the racial ‘diversity’ the Board was after,\" Miyares office said. \"And in the zero-sum game of school admissions, achieving the Board’s preferred racial balance meant that fewer Asian American students would be accepted.\" SPARKS FLY BETWEEN EDUCATION SECRETARY LINDA MCMAHON AND DEM REP. WATSON COLEMAN: 'YOU SHOULD FEEL SHAMEFUL' The Department of Justice said Wednesday it would work with theDepartment of Educationto probe the potential Title VI violation, after Miyares' office referred the matter to them for investigation. The Trump administration has threatened to withhold funding from schools over potentially discriminatory diversity, equity and inclusion programs. In a statement to Fox News Digital, FCPS said the matter has already been settled by courts that have said there is no merit behind allegations its admissions policies are discriminatory.(Getty Images) In a statement to Fox News Digital, FCPS said the matter has already been adjudicated bythe courts,which it said have determined there is no merit behind the allegations that its admissions policies are discriminatory. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Nonetheless, the statement said the district was reviewing materials from the Attorney General and will issue a more detailed response in the near future. \"This matter has already been fully litigated. A federal appellate court determined there was no merit to arguments that the admissions policy for Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology discriminates against any group of students,\" the statement read. \"Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) division leadership and counsel are currently reviewing the documents released today by the Attorney General and will issue a more detailed response in the coming days.

The White House pushed back against questions from a reporter challenging statements by the Trump administration regarding the treatment of White South African farmers — after PresidentDonald Trumpshowed a video allegedly depicting burial sites of them at the White House on Wednesday. While hosting South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Trump aired a video in the Oval Office that showed white crosses that Trump said were approximately 1,000 burial sites of White Afrikaner South African farmers. Trump has claimed these farmers are being killed and forced off of their land. But Yamiche Alcindor with NBC News questioned White House press secretaryKaroline Leavitton the credibility of the video, amid reports that the crosses were from a memorial demonstration following the murder of a White farming couple, not actual burial sites.

(Instagram/@shinewithisrael) Two youngIsraeli Embassystaffers were shot and killed in an antisemitic attack in Washington D.C. Wednesday night. It was the latest incident being investigated by federal authorities asdomestic terrorism. The U.S. has seen an increase in antisemitic attacks and violentpro-Palestine protestsamid the war between Israel and Hamas. But the incidents of domestic terrorism aren’t limited to antisemitism. Extremists who hold anti-American sentiment have attempted attacks on vehicles, military bases and more. Here is a breakdown of the domestic terrorism incidents in the U.S. this year: On Wednesday, May 21, a pro-Palestinian man opened fire outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, two staffers of the Embassy of Israel to the U.S.—a couple set to be engaged—were shot and killed as they left the museum’s event focused on finding humanitarian solutions for Gaza. Lischinsky was born in Israel and grew up in Germany. His father is Jewish, and his mother is Christian. Milgrim was an American employee of the embassy. TWO ISRAELI DIPLOMATS SHOT, KILLED DURING EVENT AT CAPITAL JEWISH MUSEUM IN WASHINGTON, DC Authorities took Elias Rodriguez, a 31-year-old man from Chicago, into custody. Upon being taken into custody, Rodriguez began shouting, \"Free, free Palestine!\" This image shows Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky, who were the latest victims in a long history of attacks on Israeli embassy staff members.(Image of police vehicle: Photo by Tom Brenner for the Washington Post via Getty Images. Image of Sarah and Yaron: Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs) The FBI is investigating the incident as a possible hate crime and investigating any ties to terrorism. Steven Jensen, the assistant director in charge of the FBI Washington field office, said in a news conference that the federal law enforcement entity is working alongside the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) to \"look into ties to potential terrorism or motivation based on a bias-based crime or ahate crime.\" On May 17, a bombing took place at a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, Calif. The bombing killed the suspect and injured four others. Authorities identified the perpetrator of the incident as a 26-year-old suspect motivated by a fringe ideology known as \"pro-mortalism.\" \"Pro-mortalism,\"a radical offshootof anti-natalism, views human reproduction as inherently immoral and embraces death as a moral corrective. According to federal and local law enforcement, the suspect targeted the American Reproductive Centers facility specifically to destroy human embryos stored on-site. FBI IDENTIFIES IVF CLINIC BOMBER AS 'PRO-MORTALIST' WHO OPPOSED BIRTH WITHOUT CONSENT Surveillance footage and online postings suggest he parked in the rear of the building to remain unnoticed, ingested drugs and then detonated an explosive device – killing himself in the process. The FBI has classified the bombing as an act of domestic terrorism, citing the ideological motivation behind the violence. Officials have said that it is the first high-profile case linked to the pro-mortalist ideology and are now monitoring it as a potential emerging threat. Authorities have urged families and communities to remain vigilant for signs of ideological extremism, especially among those who may feel disenfranchised. Earlier this month, a former Michigan Army National Guard member,Ammar Abdulmajid-Mohamed Said,19, was arrested for allegedly planning a mass shooting near the U.S. Army’s Tank-Automotive & Armaments Command (TACOM) center at the Detroit Arsenal in Warren, Michigan. Said planned to carry out the attack on behalf of ISIS.

More than 4,700 international students had their permission to study in the U.S. canceled this spring as the Trump administration cracked down on foreign nationals protesting on Americanuniversity campuses. Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through an FBI-run database that contains the names of suspects and people who have been arrested, even if the charges were dropped or they were never charged with a crime. Some students have left the U.S. rather than risk arrest or deportation. RUBIO FIRES BACK AFTER DEM SENATOR SAYS HE REGRETS VOTING FOR HIM OVER VISA REVOCATIONS The government contends it was exercising its ability to enforce the Immigration and Nationality Act. DHS officials said the students don't need the court's protection because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reinstated legal status and was mailing status reactivation letters to affected students. However, White said the erroneous revocations remained on the students' record, impacting their ability to obtain a new visa or change theirnonimmigrant status.

Noem offered Harvard 72 hours to provide the information requested for an opportunity to regain its visa program for the next school year. She called the move the \"direct result of Harvard’s epic failure to comply with simple reporting requirements.\" Harvard, meanwhile, asserted the termination was \"unlawful.\" \"The government’s action is unlawful.

This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard’s academic and research mission,\" university spokesperson Jason Newton told Fox News Digital. The records requested include any footage of protest activity involving students on visas and the disciplinary records of all students on visas in the last five years.

Two aides who grew closer to Biden during lockdown, Annie Tomasini and Anthony Bernal, \"loaded a written Q&A into a prompter ahead of a local interview – a document that the campaign had used in prep with Biden,\" according to the book.

Aides privately noted that they couldn't rely on him to stay on message, and he often had a very short attention span.\" Tapper and Thompson describe a turning point during the 2020 campaign when Biden struggled to follow virtual conversations with American voters through a series of monitors for the Democratic National Convention. \"It was like a different person. It was incredible. This was like watching Grandpa who shouldn't be driving,\" one Democrat told the journalists. After watching the short, overly edited videos of Biden struggling to interact with voters, Democrats told Tapper and Thompson that they did not think Biden could be president. They said Democrats became angry imagining his aides seeing him like this every day. A Biden spokesperson, however, pushed back on the narrative of the book, telling Fox News Digital that \"there is nothing in this book that shows Joe Biden failed to do his job, as the authors have alleged, nor did they prove their allegation that there was a cover-up or conspiracy.\" \"Nowhere do they show that our national security was threatened or where the President wasn’t otherwise engaged in the important matters of the Presidency,\" the spokesperson continued. \"In fact, Joe Biden was an effective President who led our country with empathy and skill.\" Then-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden arrive in New York.(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) However, those close to Biden told Tapper and Thompson that the \"first signs he was deteriorating emerged after the death of his beloved son Beau in 2015.\" \"Beau's cancer treatment also demonstrated the Bidens' capacity for denial and the lengths they would go through to avoid transparency about health issues, even when the person in question is an elected official, in this case the sitting attorney general of Delaware.\" Tapper and Thompson described how the Biden family went through great lengths to downplay or mislead the media about then-vice president Biden visiting his son in the hospital. \"Beau's wife, Hallie, told people she didn't understand why they had to keep his illness a secret.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital has written extensively dating back to the 2020 presidential campaign about Biden's cognitive decline and his inner circle’srole in covering it up.

Rep.Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., avoided answering questions from reporters regarding the shooting in Washington, D.C., that killed two Israeli Embassy staffers departing the Capital Jewish Museum on Wednesday evening. \"I’m going to go for now,\" Omar, the first Somali American elected to Congress, told reporters Thursday when asked if she would react to the shooting. A spokesperson for Omar did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Later, Omar said she was \"appalled\" by the shooting and said that violence is not welcome in the U.S. \"I am appalled by the deadly shooting at the Capital Jewish Museum last night,\" Omar said in a post on X on Thursday. \"Holding the victims, their families, and loved ones in my thoughts and prayers.  Violence should have no place in our country.\" Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim were departing an event at the museum on Wednesday evening when they were gunned down and killed.

    "title": "Winners, losers and grab-bags from House GOP's narrow passage of 'big, beautiful bill'",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram breaks down the House vote on President Donald Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill.’ House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., discusses getting the votes needed. With the narrow 215-214 passage of House Republicans’\"Big, Beautiful Bill,\" (BBB)there were noted winners and losers, and some entities who felt mixed results from the midnight-oil-burning negotiations and vote. The House Freedom Caucus (HFC) within the GOP conference appeared to be a key player in BBB talks, as Chairman Andy Harris of Maryland voted \"present,\" while two other HFC members, Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, voted \"nay.\" The HFC was initially very concerned about the bill’s spending levels and how quickly — or not — some of the reduction measures would be implemented. Ultimately, the HFC won out in terms of shifting Medicaid Work Requirementsin the billto take effect by 2027 rather than the originally proposed 2029 deadline. MIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL’ WIN AS BUDGET BILL PASSES HOUSE On the other GOP flank, moderates and lawmakers from blue states had expressed concern over the State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT) — which helps Democrat-run state residents lessen their tax burden. Originally, SALT was capped at $10,000, but the budget bill raised it to $30,000 for individuals earning up to $400,000. Rep. Michael Lawler, R-N.Y., and other blue-state Republicans clashed with PresidentDonald Trumpon the matter — with the president retorting that he knew Lawler’s Rockland County district better than he did. Lawler was seen as a winner in the budget bill’s passage, as his work — along with that of Long Island Republicans like Rep. Nick LaLota — secured the deduction for their constituents. Another blue-state Republican, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, was one of two nonvoting members — the other being Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., according to the official roll. Residents of such high-tax states as New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland and California won out in that respect, ensuring that they would be able to continue to utilize SALT. Outright winners from the bill were Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who saw some version of their original effort come to pass. Trump also saw his sweeping middle- and upper-class tax cuts preserved from expiration, which in turn rendereddebt-and-deficit hawks proverbial losers. ADAM SCHIFF TELLS EPA'S LEE ZELDIN HE'LL CAUSE CANCER AFTER SHOUTFEST Passage of the bill in the House comes as the national debt currently sits at $36,214,475,432,210.84, according to FOX Business'National Debt Tracker.The federal deficit will grow by about $2 trillion over 10 years, according to reports, while the tax cuts’ preservation will reduce gross federal revenue. But Medicaid and SNAP work requirements funding cuts are expected to lessen that blow. Other winners included illegal immigration hawks, with the bill allocating billions for the Pentagon and for homeland security, including at the U.S.-Mexico border. Energy interests also won out in the bill’s passage. The American Petroleum Institute applauded the House for taking another step to \"restore American energy dominance.\" \"By preserving competitive tax policies, beginning to reverse the ‘methane fee,’ opening lease sales and advancing important progress on permitting, this historic legislation is a win for our nation’s energy future,\" the group said in a statement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., left, and President Donald Trump.(Getty) Losers included Democratic leadership, as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., saw his caucus vote as a bloc, but just shy of the partisan force necessary to block the bill. One particularly upset \"loser\" in the bill’s passage was House Homeland Security Committee ranking member Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. \"You can’t shovel s--- and call it sugar,\" Thompson fumed in a Thursday statement. \"This horrific bill is one of the most shameful grifts I have ever seen played on the American public,\" he added. Abortion providers alsolost out via the bill, as it reportedly bans Medicaid disbursements to Planned Parenthood for one year, which could lead to decreased revenue for such organizations. Opponents of SALT, including members of the HFC, also essentially lost out, given the fact the deduction remained intact and was somewhat bolstered. The bill’s slashing of green energy tax credits also renders that particular corporate sector — including wind, solar and EV concerns — another potential loser in the BBB.

    "article_text": "'Genius Foods' author Max Lugavere discusses Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., taking on big food on 'The Will Cain Show.' Blood and urine tests have been found to detect the amount ofultraprocessed foods(UPFs) a person eats, according to new research. Using machine learning, scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) identified hundreds of metabolites (molecules produced during metabolism) that correlated with processed food intake. The team developed a \"biomarker score\" that predicts ultraprocessed food intake based on metabolite measurements in blood and urine, according to Erikka Loftfield, Ph.D., M.P.H., of the National Cancer Institute in Maryland. PREMATURE DEATH LINKED TO CERTAIN TYPE OF FOOD, STUDY REVEALS The researchers drew baseline data from 718 older adults who provided urine and blood samples and reported their dietary habits over a 12-month period, as detailed in a press release from NIH. Next, they conducted a small clinical trial of 20 adults. For two weeks, the group ate a diet high in ultraprocessed foods, and for another two weeks they ate a diet with no UPFs. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health have developed the first test to objectively measure ultraprocessed food intake through blood and urine.(iStock) \"In our study, we found that hundreds of serum and urine metabolites were correlated with percentage energy fromultraprocessed food intake,\" Loftfield told Fox News Digital. The findings were published in the journal PLOS Medicine. THE WORST FOODS TO BUY IN THE SUPERMARKET AND THE BETTER CHOICES INSTEAD Large-scale studies investigating the health risks of ultraprocessed foods often rely on self-reported dietary questionnaires, which can be prone to errors, per the NIH. Using machine learning, the team identified hundreds of metabolites that correlated with processed food intake.(iStock) The new blood and urine test helps to reduce human error by usingobjective biomarkers, a growing area of interest among researchers. Loftfield added, \"It was surprising to find that UPF-correlated metabolites are involved in numerous and diverse biological pathways, underscoring the complex impact of diet on the metabolome.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ultraprocessed foods are defined as \"ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat, industrially manufactured products, typically high in calories and low in essential nutrients,\" according to the NIH. Chronic diseases, obesity andvarious forms of cancerhave been linked to diets that are heavy in UPFs. Despite promising results, the researchers emphasized that the new method will requirefurther validationbefore broader use. Since the current trial focused mainly on older adults, researchers say more research is needed across various age groups and diets. Ultraprocessed foods are defined as \"ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat, industrially manufactured products, typically high in calories and low in essential nutrients,\" according to the NIH.(iStock) \"Metabolite scores should be evaluated and improved in populations with different diets and a wide range of UPF intake,\" Loftfield acknowledged.

For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health \"For individuals concerned about ultraprocessed food intake, one practical recommendation is to use Nutrition Facts labels to avoid foods high in added sugars, saturated fat and sodium, as this can limit UPF intake and align with robust scientific research ondiet and health,\" Loftfield suggested.

    "article_text": "Todd Anderson, Nashville-based co-founder of Dream Performance & Recovery and host of the \"Beat the Heat\" podcast, shares some lesser-known health benefits of spending time in a sauna. More than half of sleep sessions end with the snooze button, with people sneaking in an extra 11 minutes on average, a new study reveals — but experts say it may not be a good idea. Researchers from Mass General Brigham analyzed data from the Sleep Cycle app, which includedsleep habitsfrom more than 21,000 people globally. Among the more than three million sleep sessions tracked, nearly 56% ended with the snooze button. MOST SLEEP-DEPRIVED CITIES IN US REVEALED IN REPORT: WHERE DOES YOURS RANK? The heaviest users of the snooze button — who used it for more than 80% of the mornings included in the study — slept an average of 20 extra minutes. These heaviest snoozers were also shown to have \"more erratic sleep schedules\" than those who used the snooze button less often, the researchers found. More than half of sleep sessions end with the snooze button, with people sneaking in an extra 11 minutes on average, a new study reveals.(iStock) The snooze button was more likely to be used on weekdays and less so on Saturdays and Sundays. The findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports. \"Unfortunately, the snooze alarm disrupts some of the most important stages of sleep,\" said lead author Rebecca Robbins, PhD, in the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in a press release. \"The hours just before waking are rich in rapid eye movement sleep. Hitting the snooze alarm will interrupt these critical stages of sleep and typically only offer light sleep in between snooze alarms.\" \"Snoozing feels good, but effectively results in less sleep.\" It’s common for people to feel grogginess upon waking up, called \"sleep inertia,\" which can make the snooze button tempting, according to Dr. David Kuhlmann, spokesperson for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and medical director ofsleep medicineat Bothwell Regional Health Center in Sedalia, Missouri. \"While hitting snooze may make it easier for some to wake up, it’s not recommended,\" Kuhlmann, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. \"Falling back to sleep for just a few extra minutes disrupts your sleep cycle, which can impact your mood and energy throughout the day.\" HERE'S WHY 90% OF AMERICANS DON'T SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT, ACCORDING TO EXPERT Alex Dimitriu, MD, a board-certified psychiatrist and sleep medicine doctor and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine in California, agreed that hitting the snooze button is disruptive to one’s rest. \"Snoozing feels good, but effectively results in less sleep,\" Dimitriu, who also did not participate in the research, told Fox News Digital. \"Unfortunately, the snooze alarm disrupts some of the most important stages of sleep,\" said the lead study author.(iStock) \"Snoozing specifically impacts REM sleep or dream sleep, which happens most in the morning hours.\" REM (rapid eye movement) sleep has wide-ranging benefits, according to the expert — including that it helpsregulate emotionsby repeating past events and preparing for the future. \"There is evidence that our brains get emotionally calibrated during REM sleep — so it matters a lot,\" Dimitriu added. \"When the alarm goes off, we should feel ready to start our day,\" Dr. Stephen Carstensen, a dentist and sleep expert in Washington, told Fox News Digital. It’s as simple as breaking the habit, noted Cartensen, who wasn't part of the MGB study. HEAT EXPOSURE LINKED TO BETTER SLEEP, EXPERTS SAY — HERE'S WHY \"Habits are changed by determination, which is always easy to say, hard to do,\" he said. \"Just don’t do it, and soon the habit is gone.\" If someone feels like they need those extra minutes, however, the expert suggests thinking about what might need to change. To optimize sleep and feel rested the next day, experts recommend setting the alarm for the latest possible time and getting out of bed when it goes off the first time.(iStock) \"Maybe you aren’t going to bed early enough, or sleep quality suffers from snoring or otherbreathing problems,\" he said. \"You might have another sleep problem or a bed partner who keeps you from getting good sleep.\" \"The issue isn’t really the snooze button, but why you need it.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP To optimize sleep and feel rested the next day, experts recommend setting the alarm for the latest possible time and getting out of bed when it goes off the first time. \"Most people use the snooze button either because they go to bed too late or because an early-morning wake time does not line up with theirnatural sleep cycle,\" Dimitriu said. \"The issue isn’t really the snooze button, but why you need it.\" In both cases, he recommends adhering to aconsistent sleep schedulethat you can stick to, with \"regular(ish)\" bedtimes and wake times. \"It also helps to put down shiny, colorful screens full of interesting information in the hour before bed,\" Dimitriu added. \"You need to slow down to get sleepy, or you won't get sleepy.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"I tell my patients ‘tech off at 10’ — dimming the lights and reading a book helps a lot.\" Kuhlmann recommends that people keep their phones across the room at night to force them to get out of bed when the alarm goes off.

So, they're stepping down from their competitions,\" he added. \"And it's kind of funny coming from people who push women's rights, and they want to fight for women's rights, but they don't wanna fight for women's rights in sports.

As California'stransgender athlete conflictescalates, one high school athlete has resorted to changing clothes in her car to avoid uncomfortable situations. During a Lucia Mar Unified School District (LMUSD)school board meetingthis week, junior Audrey Vanherweg revealed her decision. \"I strongly disagree with what is going on in the girls' locker room and on the girls track team, so much so that I change in my car for track practice because I feel way more comfortable in my car than I do in my own school's locker room,\" Vanherweg said.

Both meetings also included just as many speakers advocating for transgender athletes. At this week's meeting, a trans track and field athlete described the decision to join the girls' team while wearing a transgender pride flag. \"When I joined track last year, I was terrified,\" the athlete said. \"I was alone, and I feared for my life.

I really do. They have fallen victim to the movement. They have unfortunately fallen for the lie that they weren't created uniquely and intentionally in God's perfect image. And that is a horrible message to send to anyone,\"Gaines said. \"I believe they're victims, too, which is the sad reality of the gender ideology movement.\" California has allowed transgender athletes to compete in girls' sports since 2014. California's high school sports league, the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF), was one of the first in the country to openly defy President Donald Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order after it was signed on Feb. 5. The CIF is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for potential Title IX violations over the issue.

The news struck especially hard for many of Irsay's former Colts players, including Pro Football Hall of FamerPeyton Manning. Manning, who played his first 13 seasons for the Colts and helped them win the Super Bowl in the 2006 season, shared his respect for Irsay in an Instagram post Wednesday night. \"I am heartbroken to hear about Jim Irsay’s passing. He was an incredibly generous and passionate owner and I will always be indebted to him for giving me my start in the NFL. His love for the Colts and the city of Indy was unmatched. His impact on the players who played for him will not be forgotten. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and everyone in the Colts community. He will be missed. Jim, rest in peace my friend,\" Manning wrote. Many of Manning's old Indianapolis teammates expressed their condolences too.

He enjoyed the thought of being able to connect with Colts fans all over the world,\" McAfee wrote. McAfee even credited Irsay for helping the punter succeed in his post-NFL career. \"When I decided to retire.. he and I had a 2.5 hour conversation in his office. He was sitting at his desk.. hitting the s--- out of his vape .. and we talked about everything I was hoping to go do. He tried to stop me for a few minutes.. even offered to renegotiate my contract.. and then once he realized my decision was made.. the convo turned into him trying to give me as much game as possible about running a business and maintaining authenticity,\" McAfee added. \"Jim has done everything he can to help me succeed.. He’d join our show anytime I asked, no matter where he was in the world.. He’d send me motivational messages when he heard I was going thru something.. he’d forward articles that he’d come across that he thought I should read.\" JALEN HURTS MAINTAINS HE 'WASN'T AVAILABLE' FOR EAGLES' WHITE HOUSE VISIT Jim Irsay, the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, speaks to the fans at Reggie Wayne's induction into the Ring of Honor at Lucas Oil Stadium on Nov. 18, 2018 in Indianapolis.(Andy Lyons/Getty Images) Legendary NFL kicker Adam Viniatieri expressed his condolences to Irsay in an X post. Viniatieri cemented his legacy by helping the New England Patriots win three Super Bowls from 2001-2005, often beating the Colts on the way there.

    "article_text": "Illinois General Assembly members Democrat Kelly Cassidy, Republican Blaine Wilhour, Democrat Anna Stava-Murray and Republican Adam Niemerg exchange arguments over trans athletes in girls' sports. (Credit: Illinois General Assembly) As Illinois faces agrowing political divideover the issue of trans athletes in girls' sports, the state's lawmakers addressed the topic in a heated back-and-forth on the floor of the state capital on Wednesday. The state's General Assembly members broke out into aggressive arguments over the issue during the session. One Democrat member even made the unsubstantiated argument that laws to keep trans athletes out of girls' sports would result in genital inspections of children. That argument wasinitially usedby U.S. House Democrats who voted against the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act in January. The Illinois lawmaker to repeat the unsubstantiated claim was Rep. Kelly Cassidy of Chicago, who accused GOP colleagues of being \"obsessed with children's genitalia.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"My colleagues on the other side of the aisle feel the need to share their obsession with children's genitalia once again,\" Cassidy said. \"We are grown adults, and we are picking on kids because you are obsessed with children's genitalia.\" Cassidy's statement was then pushed back upon by Republican Rep. Blaine Wilhour of Southern Illinois. Wilhour called out the state's Democrats as a whole for supporting gender transitions for minors and pointed out a recent track meet in Naperville, Illinois, that sparked national outrage after a biological male won a girls' race. \"These folks up here accuse people of being obsessed with kids' genitalia because they have the audacity to believe that boys should not be competing in girls' sports. But I just want to point out here that there is only one party, the Democrat Party, that is supporting and encouraging minor children to use life-altering and often unreversable hormone blockers,\" Wilhour said. \"What we've seen in Naperville, that's not fair competition. Not only that, it's abusive to these young girls and it's a clear violation of Title IX.\" The recent Naperville incident has put the community and state under a national microscope in recent days. The controversy even prompted a series of heated debates, which went viral on social media, at the Naperville 203 Community School District Board meeting on Monday. Democrat state Rep. Anna Stava-Murray, who represents Naperville, defended the trans student who won the race. \"I find it disgusting when adults try to bully children, and that's what's happening right now,\" Stava-Murray said. \"We have adults, including adults on the House floor, who want to take a moment that that child trained for and use it as a political talking point, that's disgusting, you should be ashamed of yourselves. That child did not ask to be in national media. That child's parents didn't consent to that.\" ILLINOIS TRANS ATHLETE CONFLICT GROWS AFTER TENSE TRACK MEET AS STATE REPUBLICANS CALL FOR TRUMP'S HELP Republican state Rep. Adam Niemerg then chimed in to condemn the Democrats for allowing the issue to continue in Illinois, warning of potential cuts to federal funding by PresidentDonald Trump'sadministration for defying an executive order to keep trans athletes out of girls' sports. \"To think parents and kids still have to be dealing with this astounds me, after all, there is an executive order banning this kind of thing from happening. Folks, this nonsense has to stop. This insanity is leaving a trail of tears heartache and oppression of girls and women everywhere,\" Niemberg said. \"You want federal dollars? Then stop embracing policies that 90 or 95% of the people oppose! Stop letting boys compete in girls' sports! What is so hard about that to understand? I will not stay silent on this issue and neither will parents.\" Niemerg also called out the mainstream media over coverage of the issue. \"The media needs to do their job and stop acting like this is not happening. Ask the governor directly, press him on this issue, do your jobs, and stop lying about what is going on here in Illinois,\" he said. MAINE TEENS BATTLING STATE DEMOCRATS ON GIRLS' SPORTS BILL AFTER ENDURING TRANS ATHLETE CHAOS IN HIGH SCHOOL Tension over the issue in Illinois has mounted in recent months before coming to a head in the aftermath of the Naperville incident over the last week. There is already one federal Title IX probe in Illinois regarding transgenders impeding on female spaces, but it is only against one school, that was launched back in March. Deerfield Public Schools District 109 is facing a probe by the U.S.Department of Education'sOffice of Civil Rights after middle school girls were allegedly forced by school administrators to change in front of a trans student in the girls' locker room. Back in April, the the Illinois High School Association announced in a public letter that Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the Illinois Department of Human Rights have declared that state law requires that transgender athletes be allowed to participate based on gender identity. So it is continuing to allow biological males to compete with girls, as it has since 2006. U.S. Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., has addressed two letters to the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice asking for federal intervention into the issue. Miller previously sent a letter in April and is now doubling-down on her pleas for the Trump administration to step in. Miller's latest letter asks U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Education Secretary Linda McMahon to specifically look into the Naperville incident and consider pulling federal funding from the state, as seen in a copy obtained by Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Even Chicago Bears legendBrian Urlacherhas spoken out on the issue while his home state is ravaged by controversy. \"It's just different because we are men, there are certain things we do better than women, and it's just, number one, it's not fair, and if I had a daughter who had to be forced to play against a man, I would not be okay with it and I would raise hell about it,\" Urlacher said during an interview on the\"Global View\" podcaston May 9. \"I just don't get it, it's a common sense thing, I just don't see how you can push this and make someone thing they're a different sex.\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

    "title": "The story behind why Indianapolis 500 winners drink milk in victory circle",
    "article_text": "IndyCar driver Josef Newgarden discusses the journey for his third straight Indy 500 win and a spoof ad for 'ethanol' cologne on 'Fox & Friends.' The winner of the upcoming 109thIndianapolis 500will be given an ice-cold bottle of milk in the victory circle on Sunday at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. But why milk? When did the tradition begin? The origin of the tradition was in 1936, when Louis Meyer, after having won his thirdIndy 500, sat perched on his car and had a bottle of buttermilk in his left hand. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Team Penske driver Josef Newgarden drinks milk on the victory podium after winning the 108th Indianapolis 500 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on May 26, 2024.(IMAGN) But the tradition began with an accident. Meyer drinking the milk post-victory was unplanned. \"It was a hot day. I came into the garage area … and all I could think of was some nice, cold buttermilk,\" Meyer said, per theIndianapolis Motor Speedway website. Meyer grew up in Yonkers, New York, and his mother told him that buttermilk would refresh him on a warm day. So, after a grueling race, Meyer wanted the drink he had growing up: buttermilk. The milk stuck because the moment of Meyer with the milk was caught by a cameraman. An executive in the dairy industry saw the footage of Meyer and requested that milk be given to every winner of the Indianapolis 500. INDY 500 IS OFFICIALLY SOLD OUT FOR FIRST TIME IN ALMOST A DECADE; 350,000 FANS EXPECTED Milk bottles for the 2025 Indy 500 are signed by drivers Devlin DeFrancesco, Louis Foster and Felix Rosenqvist during the mailing of the famous blue envelopes with tickets for the Indianapolis 500 on March 12, 2025.(IMAGN) Each winner from 1938 through 1941, and then after the race returned from a hiatus due to World War II in 1946, drank milk in the victory circle. However, there was a time when milk was not the drink handed to winners. Wilbur Shaw, who won the Indy 500 in 1937, 1939 and 1940, became president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and implemented some changes. From 1947 through 1954, the winners of the iconic race were handed cold water in a silver chalice. However, the tradition did not last as Shaw died in a plane crash in 1954, and in 1956 the milk returned.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. With Reggie Miller on the call, theIndiana Pacerspaid homage to their franchise legend on Wednesday night. Well, it wasn't a direct homage -- but theNew York Knicks, in their first Eastern Conference Finals game of the 21st century, blew a double-digit fourth-quarter lead to drop Game 1 against Indiana, 138-135. New York led by as many as 17 with just over six minutes to go, and even by 14 with less than three, but it was no match for the Pacers. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton (0) celebrates with teammates after tying the game in the fourth quarter to send the game to overtime against the New York Knicks during game one of the eastern conference finals for the 2025 NBA Playoffs at Madison Square Garden.(Brad Penner-Imagn Images) Aaron Nesmith did his best Miller impression by drilling six consecutive three-pointers to help Indiana cut their deficit to just two points with 22.1 seconds to go. After the Knicks, on two occasions, went 1-for-2 from the line, Tyrese Haliburton hit a buzzer-beater that he thought was a three and did Miller's infamous choke signal while pointing at him. But, Haliburton's toe was on the line, and the game headed to overtime. New York got out to a four-point lead to start overtime, but a 5-0 Pacers run gave them their first lead since it was 45-44 in the second quarter. Neither team got out to more than a one-point lead for the next two-plus minutes, until former Knicks forward Obi Toppin slammed one home with 15.3 seconds left to go up three. The Knicks missed two game-tying threes, and the Pacers stole the victory. Teams leading a playoff game by nine-plus points in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime of a playoff game had been 1,414-0 since 1998 entering Wednesday. Also, since 1997, teams are now 4-1,640 when trailing by seven-plus points in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime of a playoff game – the Pacers have won three of those games this season alone.

Haliburton and Nesmith had 31 and 30 points, respectively – 20 of Nesmith's came in that epic fourth quarter. Jalen Brunson led the way with 43 points, while Karl-Anthony Towns had 35 plus 12 rebounds – but neither hit their game-tying three-pointers in the final seconds. This series is a rematch of thesecond round last year, which Indiana won in seven games against an injury-riddled Knicks squad, but it's also who the Knicks faced in both the 1999 and 2000 Eastern Conference Finals – the teams split both of those series.

Both of New York's wins sent them to the NBA Finals. Now, the rivalry is hotter than ever. Game 2 is Friday night in Madison Square Garden. And if there's any saving grace for the Knicks, they would wind up winning the series where Miller hit them with his choke signal.

    "article_text": "A European startup successfully completed the first orbital test flight of its Phoenix 1 re-entry space capsule. NASA revived rollthrusters on the 47-year-old Voyager 1 that were thought to be dead for two decades. According to the space agency, scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of NASA, located in Southern California, have reactivated a set of thrusters on the spacecraft. The roll thrusters have not worked since 2004 and are long believed to have been out of commission. These thrusters are important because Voyager's main thrusters appear to have some residue forming that could cause them to clog. Scientists estimate those thrusters could fail as early as Fall 2025. NASA ASTRONAUT REVEALS THEY NEARLY FAILED TO DOCK BOEING STARLINER TO INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION Voyager 1 had its thrusters revived after nearly two decades of being thought dead and out of commission.(Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech) The antenna on Earth responsible for sending commands to both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 will be offline for several months. Deep Space Station 43, a 230-foot-wideantenna in Australia, will be offline until February 2026 due to needed upgrades. While that antenna is being upgraded, the team at NASA will not be able to communicate with the twin space probes. NASA FINALIZES STRATEGY FOR HUMAN PRESENCE IN SPACE The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The JPL has been working on restoring the thrusters on the Voyager 1.(NASA/JPL-Caltech) Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager and director of the Interplanetary Network at JPL, said these upgrades are important for future Moon missions. \"These antenna upgrades are important for futurecrewed lunar landings, and they also increase communications capacity for our science missions in deep space, some of which are building on the discoveries Voyager made,\" Dodd said in a press release. Each Voyager has a set of primary thrusters that control movement in all directions as well as smaller thrusters for what is called roll control. Using the smaller thrusters allows the Voyager’s antenna to stay alignedwith Earth, sothe scientists can communicate with it. NASA's deep space antenna in Australia is currently going through upgrades causing any communication with Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 to go dark until 2026, when the Antenna is reactivated.(STEFANI REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) While there is a third set of thrusters, which were brought back online in 2018 and 2019, Voyager does not have the capability to perform the roll adjustments needed to keep a connection with Earth.

    "article_text": "Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to discuss President Donald Trump's Take It Down Act and Meta avoiding removing scam ads from its platforms. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is under fire after a major report revealed that thousands of fraudulent ads have been allowed to run on its platforms. According to the Wall Street Journal, Meta accounted for nearly half of all scam complaints tied to Zelle transactions at JPMorgan Chase between mid-2023 and mid-2024. Other banks have also reported a high number of fraud cases linked toMeta's platforms. JOIN THE FREE \"CYBERGUY REPORT\": GET MY EXPERT TECH TIPS, CRITICAL SECURITY ALERTS AND EXCLUSIVE DEALS, PLUS INSTANT ACCESS TO MY FREE \"ULTIMATE SCAM SURVIVAL GUIDE\" WHEN YOU SIGN UP! Meta logo(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The problem ofscam ads on Facebookhas grown rapidly in recent years. Experts point to the rise ofcryptocurrency schemes,AI-generated contentandorganized criminal groupsoperating from Southeast Asia. These scams range from fake investment opportunities to misleading product offers and even the sale of nonexistent puppies. FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE One example involves Edgar Guzman, a legitimate business owner in Atlanta, whose warehouse address wasused by scammersin more than 4,400 Facebook and Instagram ads. These ads promised deep discounts on bulk merchandise, tricking people into sending money for products that never existed. \"What sucks is we have to break it to people that they've been scammed. We don't even do online sales,\" Guzman told reporters. Facebook login page on a laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW FACEBOOK SECRETLY COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION EVEN IF YOU HAVEN'T SIGNED UP Meta says it's fighting back with new technology and partnerships, including facial-recognition tools and collaborations with banks and other tech companies. A spokesperson described the situation as an \"epidemic of scams\" and insisted that Meta is taking aggressive action, removing more than 2 million accounts linked to scam centers in several countries this year alone. However, insiders tell a different story. Current and former Meta employees say the company has been reluctant to make it harder for advertisers to buy ads, fearing it could hurt the company's bottom line. Staff reportedly tolerated between eight and 32 fraud \"strikes\" before banning accounts and scam enforcement was deprioritized to avoid losing ad revenue. META ENDS FACT-CHECKING PROGRAM AS ZUCKERBERG VOWS TO RESTORE FREE EXPRESSION ON FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM Instagram on a smartphone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE Victims of these scams often lose hundreds or even thousands of dollars. In one case, fake ads promised free spice racks from McCormick & Co. for just a small shipping fee, only to steal credit card details and rack up fraudulent charges. Another common scam involves fake puppy sales, with victims sending deposits for pets that never arrive. Some scam operations are even linked tohuman trafficking, with criminal groups forcing kidnapped victims to run online fraud schemes under threat of violence. THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG WHEN SCAMMERS CALL Meta maintains that it is not legally responsible for fraudulent content on its platforms, citing Section 230 of federal law, which protects tech companies from liability for user-generated content. In court filings, Meta has argued that it \"does not owe a duty to users\" when it comes to policing fraud. Meanwhile, aclass-action lawsuitover allegedly inflated ad reach metrics is moving forward, putting even more pressure on Meta to address transparency and accountability. DON'T MISS OUT ON THESE MEMORIAL DAY BEST DEALS & DISCOUNTS Staying safe online takes a little extra effort, but it's well worth it. Here are some steps you can follow to avoid falling victim to scam ads. 1. Check the source and use strong antivirus software:Look for verified pages and official websites. Scammers often copy the names and logos of trusted brands, but the web address or page details may be off. Always double-check the URL for slight misspellings or extra characters and avoid clicking links in ads if you're unsure about their legitimacy. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 2. Be skeptical of deals that seem too good to be true:If an ad offers products at an unbelievable price or promises huge returns, pause and investigate before clicking. Scammers often use flashy discounts or urgent language to lure people in quickly. Take a moment to think before you act, and remember that if something sounds impossible, it probably is. 3. Research the seller:Search for reviews and complaints about the company or individual. If you can't find any credible information, it's best to avoid the offer. A quick online search can reveal if others have reported scams or had bad experiences, and legitimate businesses usually have a track record you can verify. 4. Consider using a personal data removal service:There are companies that can help remove your personal info from data brokers and people-search sites. This means less of your data floating around for scammers to find and use. While these services usually charge a fee, they can save you a lot of time and hassle compared to doing it all yourself. Over time, you might notice fewer spam calls, emails and even a lower risk of identity theft.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 5. Never share sensitive information:Don't enter your credit card or bank details on unfamiliar sites. If you're asked for personal information, double-check the legitimacy of the request. Scammers may ask for sensitive data under the guise of \"verifying your identity\" or processing a payment, but reputable companies will never ask for this through insecure channels. 6. Keep your devices updated:Keeping yoursoftware updatedadds an extra layer of protection against the latest threats. Updates often include important security patches that fix vulnerabilities hackers might try to exploit. By regularly updating your devices, you help close those security gaps and keep your personal information safer from scammers and malware. 7. Report suspicious ads:If you see a scam ad on Facebook or Instagram, report it using the platform's tools. This helps alert others and puts pressure on Meta to take action. Reporting is quick and anonymous, and it plays a crucial role in helping platforms identify patterns and remove harmful content. 8. Monitor your accounts:Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized transactions, especially after making online purchases. Early detection can help you limit the damage if your information is compromised, and most banks have fraud protection services that can assist you if you spot something suspicious. By following these steps, you can better protect yourself and your finances from online scams. Staying alert and informed is your best defense in today's digital world. The mess with scam ads on Meta's platforms shows why it's important to look out for yourself online. Meta says it's working on the problem, but many people think it's not moving fast enough. By staying careful, questioning suspicious offers and using good security tools, you can keep yourself safer. Until the platforms step up their game, protecting yourself is the smartest move you can make.

    "title": "From campus protests to deadly violence: Israeli Embassy staff murdered in DC",
    "article_text": "The couple, identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, was about to be engaged. This week's horrific murder ofYaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgram,the two staff members of the Israeli Embassy, outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., is a reminder that words matter, be they on campus or even in Congress. The young couple, who were reportedly to be engaged next week, were killed at close range on Wednesday by the alleged 31-year-old suspect, Elias Rodriguez from Chicago. Rodriguez reportedly repeated the words that are often heard at the many antisemitic protests on campuses throughout our nation: \"Free free Palestine.\" He also allegedly said that he \"did it for Gaza.\" The amount of antisemitic hate since the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel has been astounding and unprecedented in our country and throughout the world. From campus Jew-hate protests to nasty street demonstrations, some even permitted in largely Jewish areas, these words have actions, and now we see where they can lead: the death of two innocent young people in our nation's capital. Sarah, a U.S. citizen who worked for the embassy, and Yaron, an Israeli citizen. Just last week at New York University, an undergraduate,Logan Rozos, used his graduation speech to accuse the U.S .of supporting \"genocide\" in Gaza and went on to condemn \"the atrocities in Palestine.\" And only a few hours before the antisemitic attack in Washington, D.C., a shameful display took place during the Columbia University commencement, where anti-Israel protesters torched diplomas outside the university amid chants of \"genocide\" and \"free free Palestine.\" GLOBAL RISE IN ANTISEMITISM LEAVES JEWISH COMMUNITY ISOLATED, RABBI SAYS WORLD AT 'A TIPPING POINT Police officers work at the site where, according to the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot dead near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., on May 21, 2025.(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst) A direct line connects the two incidents as we are reminded – once more, for the millionth time – that words have the power to kill. On Oct. 7, Hamas terrorists, along with thousands of Gazan civilians, penetrated Israeli towns and villages in the south of Israel, committing unspeakable atrocities: rape, murder, and pillage, including the kidnapping of 240 people, 58 of whom are still held hostage in Gaza (20 reportedly alive, and the other 38 feared dead). So many of the perpetrators were young people who grew up all their lives in Hamas-controlled Gaza and absorbed antisemitic hatred of Jews. The results were evident in all their gruesome and horrid glory on that bloody day. In one memorable audio call made public by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), a young man excitedly tells his parents that he alone killed 10 Jews. \"Look how many I killed with my own hands! Your son killed Jews!\" he said. \"Mom, your son is a hero,\" he added. The parents praised him, and he continued to share that he was calling from the phone of a Jewish woman he'd just murdered and implores them to check his WhatsApp messages for pictures. \"I wish I was with you,\" the mother says. An anti-Israel sign with the phrase \"from the river to the sea Palestine will be free\" at a protest near Tulane University in New Orleans. The phrase has been criticized as calling for the destruction of Israel.(Credit: Ryan Zamos) SIGN UP FOR ANTISEMITISM EXPOSED NEWSLETTER The result of Oct. 7, when the most Jews were murdered since the Holocaust, is a terrible war that Israel has been waging against the murderous terrorist organization Hamas in Gaza for the past almost 600 days. The war revealed the scope of the education and indoctrination of Hamas. In one instance, the IDF discovered a copy of Adolf Hitler's infamous book \"Mein Kampf\"—translated into Arabic—in a child's bedroom used as a Hamas terrorist base in Gaza. The book was discovered to feature annotations and highlights, and similar hateful content was continuously used all over schools in Gaza, including thoseoperated by UNRWA. Sarah Lynn Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky were about to be engaged.(Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs) Similarly, young children were taught in summer camps how to murder Jews and use weapons while participating in hateful plays normalizing antisemitism. Teachers, some of whom are registered Hamas members, were an integral part of this well-oiled indoctrination machine as well. No wonder this warped reality exploded in our faces. Throughout the war, we've seen similarantisemitic hatredallowed to run amock in our streets and on our college campuses. Accusations of the worst kind have been thrown at Israel and the Jewish community with impunity. \"Genocide,\" they chant, as if it's wordplay and not a malicious, dangerous accusation with lethal consequences. Students and others demonstrate during a protest outside the gates to the Columbia University main campus in New York City on April 21.(Reuters/Ryan Murphy) CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It was not only the gun that fired that murdered two young people in Washington, D.C. It was also – and maybe mainly – the tsunami of hateful words that have engulfed our society through an industry of lies by vile antisemites. And it was also our silence as we watched it unfold and took no action against this vocal and vicious minority. Words matter. Let this be an age of accountability. This is the time for deeds. It is time for the silent majority to raise their voice, take action and stand up for our democracy and society. If we do not act, we are all complicit.

    "title": "GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM: Protecting American jobs – and air",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Not too long ago, Republicans and Democrats could find common ground on clean air and water. But we are in a darker time now. We are far from the days when conservative heroes Richard Nixon andRonald Reagansigned the Clean Air Act in 1970 and the Montreal Protocol in 1987, landmark initiatives that put the health of Americans over the interests of polluters. Instead, this week, Senate Republicans are illegally using the Congressional Review Act to undermine California’s work to make and keep the air breathable. Eliminating California’s clean-air waivers is an attack on decades of work that began in earnest when then-Governor Reagan established the state’s Air Resources Board in 1967. SENATE GOP VOWS VOTE TO END BIDEN EPA WAIVER GRANTED TO PUSH DRIVERS TO EV CARS California’s clean-air standards, which 17 other states have chosen to follow, have pushed American car companies to innovate — and to become globally competitive. Global electric car sales rose by 35% in the first quarter of 2025, primarily driven by the growing affordability of electric models. American companies founded right here in California pioneered electric vehicles, but we risk losing our advantage in the global marketplace. China is now theworld’s EV manufacturing hub, responsible for more than 70% of global production, with Chinese imports making up three-quarters of the increase in EV sales across all emerging economies outside of China in 2024. Meanwhile, the U.S. has become a net importer of electric cars. Instead of turning that around, Republicans and some leaders in the auto industry are giving up. Californiahas worked with the auto industry on reasonable and cost-effective air-quality standards for over five decades. Until now, they have been good partners. Overturning the standards that drive American manufacturing innovation will destroy the footholds we’ve made in this market — and will be the death of legacy automakers, thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs in the United States. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Republicans have decided that clean air and good jobs aren’t priorities. It’s unclear what’s important to them, but it’s certainly not American workers. In 2021,Ford announced a $5.8 billion battery manufacturing campusin Glendale, Kentucky, that will add close to 5,000 new jobs. In 2023, Toyota said it’s investing $8 billion –now totaling nearly $14 billion– in aclean vehicle, battery, and energy storage projectin Liberty, North Carolina, that is expected to create 3,000 jobs in a Republican district. These investments happened because clean-car policies succeeded in pushing these companies to stay competitive globally — and to do better for these American communities. What will become of them now? Republicans want to cut off the driving force behind this progress, even if that means stopping investments in their own districts. If we lose this fight, we don’t just lose California’s leadership on clean cars, we lose the race for the future. California’s clean car rule is a critical test case for the U.S. clean vehicle strategy for the 21st century. It’s why automakers are finally investing in electric. It’s how we’re cutting pollution and building a market that reflects our values. And it’s how we’re protecting this country from the economic tsunami headed our way. IfRepublicanssucceed in gutting our standards, we’re clearing the road forChinato dominate the global auto market. Last year, Chinese manufacturer BYD Automotive debuted its Seagull model, a luxury EV nicknamed the \"Lamborghini mini,\" for as low as $9,700. It has set an entirely new bar for the EV market and the car market as a whole. If Republicans fold, the streets in Asia, Europe, and Africa will be dominated by affordable Chinese models like this instead of American ones. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republican plans to prevent states from pushing American car companies to do better are a disservice to this country. American car companies will be outmatched. Workers will suffer. Nothing less than the air we breathe and our economy is at stake. As California has shown over and over again, there is a better way — one that leads to clean air, good jobs, and another century of innovation andeconomic prosperity.

    "title": "The Supreme Court has a major opportunity to help fix illegal immigration",
    "article_text": "Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss Democrats' anti-ICE sentiment and the latest on House Republicans advancing President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill.' I am a child immigrant. I believe whole-heartedly in the value and importance of legal immigration. Lawful, smart, intentional immigration is a very, very good thing. America was built on immigration, followed by assimilation. But the scourge ofillegal immigrationhas festered for far too long. Under the Biden administration (and other presidencies before it), millions of illegal immigrants flooded the southern border with no recourse. Border security was nonexistent, eroded by left-wing politicians—and RINOs—trading off American sovereignty for perceived political gain. Americans have had enough of lawless governance, and they elected Donald Trump precisely to do something about it. That’s how democracy works. ‘FLOOD THE SYSTEM’: US ATTORNEY UNLEASHES NEW TASK FORCE TO CRACK DOWN ON BLUE STATE'S SANCTUARY POLICIES Some judge in Maryland or Maine doesn’t get to decide how the entire country lives and under which laws he happens to support. That’s not how democracy works. A national, holistic conversation about immigration is long overdue, and theSupreme Courtis right to address it. However, that’s not all that is at stake before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court’s first question is addressing the toxic judicial activism of nationwide injunctions that are overturning popular elections and policies, and the importance of limiting such lawfare to where it belongs. Yes, theSupreme Courtcan take a stand on the abuse of the courts by judicial activists and well-funded litigant groups. And yes, the Supreme Court can easily overturn the recent anti-Trump injunctions without even ruling on the substance of the issue—birthright citizenship—but that would simply kick the can down the road. It would only engender further litigation and confusion and turmoil, especially if the Trump administration (rightly) continues to deport illegal aliens, including those falsely alleging entitlement to citizenship. America needs a decisive moment to re-establish its own sovereignty. The Supreme Court can deliver it, not only by ruling against left-wing judicial activism, but by tackling birthright head-on. A truly honest ruling would strike down the slew ofanti-Trumpinjunctions because the Trump administration is likely to prevail—as a matter of law, \"birthright citizenship\" was never intended for the children of illegal aliens—and the lower court erred by imposing injunctions beyond its own jurisdictional confines. That would be both the legally correct ruling, and the one essential for preserving American democracy. So-called \"anchor babies\" have no legal right to U.S. citizenship. According to the Fourteenth Amendment, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" The purpose of the amendment was explicitly to overturn the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dred Scot v. Sandford, which held that African-Americans (including freemen) were categorically excluded from being U.S. citizens. This clause was intended to ensure that both former slaves and other African-Americans born in this country would be accorded full U.S. citizenship. Because the amendment predates our modern immigration system, it was never even remotely considered as a means of gifting American citizenship to those who break our laws from the moment they set foot in America. Emphasis belongs on this phrase: \"Subject to the jurisdiction\" of theUnited States. It was widely understood as referring only to people who legally owed allegiance to the U.S. under international law. Thus, it is generally accepted the children of diplomats, or those of foreign invading armies, are not entitled to citizenship when the 14th Amendment was written. Neither were the children of Native Americans who belonged to Indian tribes, which were generally regarded as foreign nations at the time of the 14th Amendment’s adoption. Only later did Congress—not unelected judges—extend U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans. Just as children of non-citizen tribe members at the time of the 14th Amendment’s adoption generally could be denied birthright U.S. citizenship due to their parents’ legal allegiance to their tribe, so too can children of illegal aliens today be denied birthright U.S. citizenship based on their parents’ legal allegiance to their nation of citizenship, and lack of allegiance to U.S. law. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Some contend the Supreme Court endorsed a broad conception of birthright citizenship in the 1898 case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which adopted the common law principle of \"jus soli\" (citizenship by birth on the soil). However, that case involved parents who were lawful permanent residents of the country. It did not involve people who had unlawfully entered the country and were subject to deportation or removal. Expansive constitutional notions of birthright citizenship—beloved by today’s Left—create perverse incentives for illegal immigration. That much is obvious. Moreover, granting birthright citizenship to illegal aliens allows Democrats to reallocate political power on a national level by simply refusing to enforce federal immigration law. Allowing millions of undocumented people to enter the country skews census results around largely left-leaning urban centers at the expense of the rest of the country, not to mention illegal immigrants—if Democrats had their way—voting Democrat. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Our law and history are crystal clear. However sympathetic the plight of anchor babies, that is a policy problem for Congress—not the courts—to solve. Until that happens, it is the president’s duty to faithfully execute the law and deport illegal aliens, including their children. Judges cannot fashion the law to suit their feelings. The Supreme Court knows this, and should act—both to end the birthright fiction and the Left’s appalling judicial activism.

    "title": "Broken cities, bad governance: Blue state city residents voting with their feet",
    "article_text": "Tunnel to Towers founder and CEO Frank Siller joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss creating a housing community for homeless veterans and how President Donald Trump's executive order will help. On the surface, newly-released data from the Census Bureau looks to be good news for big cities. In the wake of the Covid panic that drove residents to the suburbs and beyond, city populations generally rebounded. \"Cities of all sizes grew on average from 2023 to 2024,\" the Bureau reported. \"Cities of all sizes, in all regions, showed faster growth and larger gains\". The number – 94 percent of cities showing population growth – is impressive, overall. But a closer look tells another story – about some of the largest \"blue\" state cities, governed by Democratic mayors. New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia continue to have lower populations than in 2020. New York City has had the largest drop – from 8.805 million to 8.478 million, or 3.7 percent. Philadelphia’s population has fallen by 1.9 percent; Chicago’s by 1 percent, and LA’s by .5 percent. An even slightly-closer look at these cities’quality of lifeand affordability – factors that are the function of the effectiveness of their local governments – offers explanations for the trend. THE LEFT'S HOMELESS PLANS WRECKED OUR CITIES. NOW HELP MAY COME FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE Housing costs in New York, according to the national tracking service RentCafe, are 21.8 percent higher than the national average – despite the fact that the city has more price-regulated and public housing than any other. Low turnover rates in the nearly 1 million rent-stabilized apartments help drive up the price of the remaining market-rate housing, as city residents play a costly game of housing musical chairs, with those not able to get apartments priced artificially low forced to pay more. Where is housing cheaper? Look to Houston, which has gained 3.9 percent in population. Its housing costs are the mirror image of New York City’s – 21 percent lower than the national average. Not surprisingly, Houston’s population, per the Census, is 3.9 percent higher than it was in 2020. To explain Chicago’s population loss, look to itscrime rate. The Windy City last year led the nation in murders – 653 – almost twice the number of Baltimore, the city with the second-highest number. Instances of gang violence have spread from the low-income South Side to the \"miracle mile\" of downtown’s Michigan Avenue. Yet for the privilege of being subjected to high crime, Chicagoans have paid more and more – and more – in property taxes. As the civic group Chicago Federation reports, between 2014 and 2024, Chicago increased its property taxes by $2.7 billion, or 53.3 percent, compared to an inflation rate of 35 percent. The separate property tax levied by the Chicago Public School (CPS) district, increased $1.4 billion, from $2.4 to $3.8 billion. Yet, according to the Illinois Policy Institute, \"in spring 2024, 30.5% of CPS students in third through eighth grade met proficiency standards in reading and 18.3% were proficient in math.\" A 2022 report found that, in 55 Chicago public schools, zero percent of students were proficient in either. Los Angeles, another population loser, stands out on another measure:street homelessness, as exemplified by the tent encampments in its Skid Row area. The city’s 71,000 homeless constitute, per the Brookings Institution, 670 for every 100,000 residents. Even more notably, 70 percent of LA’s homeless, some 472 per 100K are \"unsheltered\", higher than any major city except San Jose—which is also among the few cities with lower populations than in 2020. It’s no wonder that California Governor Gavin Newsom, with his eye on higher office, has moved to ban street encampments in the state. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The other population-losing cities have their own versions of the same stories. Philadelphia ranks among the homelessness leaders, with 18 percent of the homeless among the \"unsheltered\", the highest number among cities in the Northeast. The unsheltered homeless rate in San Jose, down 1.6 percent in population, stands at 77 percent, the nation’s highest. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It's fair to argue that the combination of mild weather and air-conditioning, over the long term, has lured Americans from the Northeast and Midwest to the Sunbelt. But the new Census data shines a light on what’s happening right now, as cities even in California as well as the Rust Belt and the Northeast, fail to recover their pre-Covid population levels. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that ineffective governance has played a role; crime andhomelessness, high tax levels and poor-performing public schools are not magnets to draw back former residents or draw in new ones. The fact that all the population-losing cities are run by Democratic mayors helped Donald Trump win the popular vote; even in New York City he ran better than he had in 2020. Cities can be the engines of economic innovation and prosperity. But not if local government fails to provide effective essential services. Americans have given a negative Census report card on just those services, delivered to some of our largest cities.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Recently, my five kids got a taste of European living. We visited Big Ben and the Tower of London — and back at our Airbnb, we sweltered in 80-degree heat with no A/C and hung our laundry to dry. They loved the sightseeing. The no-air-conditioning part? Not so much. In Maryland, our summer electricity bills soar as temperatures rise. Every now and then, the utility company includes cheerful tips to cut costs along with our bill — suggestions like turning the A/C down or off and line-drying laundry. Well, I just spent a week doing exactly that. Let’s just say I have no plans to make it a permanent lifestyle. CALIFORNIA'S GREEN NEW SCAM COULD COST YOU $20,000 This summer, we’re bracing for even higher bills and potential outages. On especially hot days, we were already getting texts from our energy provider warning of strain on the grid. It’s only going to get worse this year. Air conditioning is something Europeans often don't have. American liberals want to import that reality to the US.(iStock) When we first moved in and signed up for service with ourenergy company,we opted for a budget plan. Then we learned it came with a catch: they could cut or reduce our power during peak demand. That constant cycling on and off ended up breaking our already-finicky HVAC system. The savings from that program shaved a few dollars off our bill every month — but it cost us over $10,000 in a new HVAC unit. The way to lower our costs isn’t these bait-and-switch programs, but changing the irresponsible way our state government handles our energy. GREEN NEW HEADACHE: DEMS FLEE GOV’S GREEN ‘ENERGY MASTER PLAN’ AS ELECTION APPROACHES Increased usage with the seasonal weather changes isn’t the only reason costs are climbing.Maryland residents are now paying moreto import electricity from out of state, thanks to lawmakers who pushed to shut down coal and natural gas plants — our primary energy sources — without any viable alternatives in place. Maryland’s climate goals are nothing if not ambitious: a 60% reduction in emissions by 2031 and net-zero by 2045. But these targets seem less like a plan and more like numbers pulled from a hat. No roadmap, no accountability, and certainly no grasp of the real-world impact on families like mine. Worse,Maryland began phasing out power plantswith no replacement ready to go. Only 7% of our electricity comes from renewables, so we’re importing more — at higher cost. Those costs are, of course, passed directly to taxpayers. It doesn’t stop there.The governments of Baltimore, Annapolisand Anne Arundel County are pursuing lawsuits against energy companies, blaming them for climate change. These suits claim fossil fuel companies have long known their products were damaging the planet. HOCHUL SPEARHEADS PLAN TO PAY NYERS TO SWITCH TO GREEN APPLIANCES AMID STATE MONEY WOES Suing them doesn’t cool our homes; it’s an exercise in futility. But the cost of fighting this litigation passes more costs down to their constituents: businesses and families just trying to survive. If successful, these lawsuits could force energy companies to pay billions. Those costs won’t come from corporate profits — they’ll show up on our bills. Companies may leave the state or raise rates just to keep the lights on. English homes often lack air conditioning.

Watchdog groups say these programs lost money and failed to accomplish their goals.

TRUMP SCORES WIN AS NJ HALTS OFFSHORE WIND PROJECT As summer heats up, families in progressive-run states face tough choices: rework the family budget or hang up a clothesline and start sleeping in the basement. I’m charmed by parts of European living — but I’m not signing up for the whole package. Worse, Maryland began phasing out power plants with no replacement ready to go. Only 7% of our electricity comes from renewables, so we’re importing more — at higher cost. Those costs are, of course, passed directly to taxpayers. One would think, after seeing how the government in England has tried to force renewable energy onto its citizens, and the crushing financial burden it has placed on residents, that the rest of the world would have learned from their mistakes.

They mean the difference between making rent or not, between dinner on the table or an empty fridge. There was a time when progressives loved to say, \"Check your privilege.\" Funny, we don’t hear much of that anymore — especially from the policymakers pushing costlyclimate agendasthat burden the very people they claim to represent.

    "title": "MORNING GLORY: Leo's launch",
    "article_text": "OutKick writer Mary Katharine Ham and Democratic strategist Kevin Walling join 'MediaBuzz' to discuss the election of Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope in history, and the U.S. trade deal with the U.K. \"And with your spirit, Pope Leo!\" That is the response in the Catholic Mass to the priest-celebrant’s \"Peace be with you\" proclamation in the liturgy, which is how the new Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Leo XIV, began his public pontificate. Since that moment thenew popehas been caught up in a swirl of ritual and pomp, the stuff of centuries of tradition but always new in different ways. The past few days have been marked by a long list of visitors to the Holy See, including this week by Vice President Vance and Secretary of State Rubio and scores of other leaders from around the world. FIRST AMERICAN POPE WELCOMES VANCE AND RUBIO FOR PRIVATE VATICAN AUDIENCE I hope one of his American friends sends along everything written here about Leo to him so he grasps the great desire of American Catholics that he heal the quite deep and veryobvious dividebetween the Vatican and American Catholics. That divide didn’t develop overnight but it’s real and it’s deep, and for all the quiet optimism I’ve heard my co-religionists express in the days since the Conclave elevated the kid from Chicago turned missionary to Peru, there is caution that we not get fooled again. IfPope Leogrants even a few interviews to Catholic and non-Catholic journalists in America, the impact on the Church of a Midwestern accent and the open-handed approach of the Midwest generally would be a balm and an inspiration. Pope Francis, may he rest in peace, did not like America much and most certainly did not care for the generally traditionalist American branch of the \"one true and universal Church\" as we Catholics like to say. Like all popes, Leo’s tenure will be an open question until its end. In hierarchical organizations, especially one as set in its ways as the Roman Catholic Church, it’s very difficult for a pope to know how he is actually regarded in the very different parts of his global faithful. That only surfaces as the next conclave gathers. But it depends very much on these first few weeks and months. Leo is very obviously a man of great Christian faith, very smart and with a deep streak of emotion that is carefully controlled but which displayed itself during a few public moments since \"Habemus papam!\" was pronounced. It has been reassuring for American Catholics —and I hope all Catholics— to see how normal our Boomer pope’s life through his college years had been. He’s been doing many years in the mission field of Peru, which ought to impress on every believer that Leo has the real heart of an evangelist. Sure, I’d like to know what’s in the album collection of his youth if it’s sitting somewhere in one of his brothers’ attics gathering dust, as well as his familiarity with new media in his old country, but thats just curiosity. We know the important thing: He believes Jesus is God and he serves the poor. Those are the key revelations in the wake of his elevation. What I pray is that he reveals even more by what he does in these early days, especially a few things on my personal short list. First, I’d like to see himpray in publicfor Jimmy Lai, the most prominent Catholic political prisoner on the planet, and in a way that conveys the Church’s willingness to try and get along with the Chinese Communist Party which under Xi Jinping has reverted to the old Leninist mode of repression of belief in God and suppression and subversion of all churches in China. Mr. Lai —old, ill, in solitary confinement— is a symbol, not of political defiance of Xi, but of the persecuted church (small \"c\") around the world. A quietly delivered but very specific public call for prayers for Mr. Lai would be such an encouragement to his family, friends and millions of strangers who know his story and why he suffers in isolation, denied even the minimum comforts of his sacraments. If Leo were to ask Xi for Mr. Lai’s release and exile to the United Kingdom or the Vatican, it would be a marker of Leo’s heart for the political prisoners of the world and an opportunity for General Secretary Xi to reassure the world that there is no need for the \"Pope’s divisions\" to think and act towards Xi as they did towards Stalin. A fewwords from Leoabout the hostages in Gaza, approaching 600 days of harrowing captivity, would also right many sins of omission of the Church since 10/7. Diving into the particulars of how peace is restored in Gaza is perhaps not the best move right now, but there won’t be peace, as President Trump noted in his remarks to the Gulf Cooperation Council last week, until the hostages are released. Israel will not stop fighting to get them back until they are released. Pope Francis never seemed to grasp this. I pray Leo does and speaks directly to the Arab and Muslim worlds that when Hamas releases the living hostages and the bodies of the dead, his efforts on behalf of the innocents in Gaza will be big and ongoing and that the Church will help with the rebuilding. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION I hope as well for some early appointments of Americans who very much lead the American Church with their words and example, but who were shunted aside by Francis for reasons no one has explained, because there is no explanation that makes sense other than personal dislike for men with whom he disagrees. Elevating three or four of these bishops to the status of Cardinal and bringing some large-hearted Americans to Rome to assist with the long, long overdue reform of the Vatican would bring a great deal of joy and reassurance to, for example, everyone who knows Archbishops José Horacio Gómez of Los Angeles and retired Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia. Their efforts to restore the American church in the wake of the abuse scandals were ignored by Francis and deepened attention on the late pope’s own failing to address the ongoing effects of that scar on the worldwide church. Even a handful of appointments of serious men of deep thought and spiritual maturity as well as demonstrated experience in management would signal to every American Catholic that the new pope is genuinely committed to the internal de-politicization of the Church. So to would be a return to local bishops of full authority over the rites of the Mass their dioceses choose to use. There’s a host of gestures available and for our part, I hope the American Catholic community will answer any call as best they can to help right the Vatican’s finances whether or not Leo XIV begins his pontificate with such crucial gestures. The Holy Father is owed —traditional Catholic thinking alert— respect and deference by every Catholic. If he needs help with the books, we should step up when asked. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And, if as I expect, Leo asks of every Catholic participation in evangelization and the support of the poor and the stranger set to wandering because of persecution, we ought to react quickly and fulsomely. No doubt some will urge Leo to go slow. That’s not just \"old thinking,\" that’s \"very wrong thinking.\" There is too much amiss in the world for any pope, cardinal, bishop or priest to pause much less vacation. To do as much as he can for as many as he can for as long as he can in the name of the risen Christ is the job of Peter’s successor. Leo has begun with that never-ending mission in his early days. Pray he continues along this path.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei believes today’s AI models hallucinate, or make things up and present them as if they’re true, at a lower rate than humans do, he said during a press briefing at Anthropic’s first developer event, Code with Claude, in San Francisco on Thursday. Amodei said all this in the midst of a larger point he was making: that AI hallucinations are not a limitation on Anthropic’s path to AGI — AI systems with human-level intelligence or better. “It really depends how you measure it, but I suspect that AI models probably hallucinate less than humans, but they hallucinate in more surprising ways,” Amodei said, responding to TechCrunch’s question. Anthropic’s CEO is one of the most bullish leaders in the industry on the prospect of AI models achieving AGI. In a widely circulatedpaper he wrote last year, Amodei said he believed AGI could arrive as soon as 2026. During Thursday’s press briefing, the Anthropic CEO said he was seeing steady progress to that end, noting that “the water is rising everywhere.” “Everyone’s always looking for these hard blocks on what [AI] can do,” said Amodei. “They’re nowhere to be seen. There’s no such thing.” Other AI leaders believe hallucination presents a large obstacle to achieving AGI. Earlier this week, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis saidtoday’s AI models have too many “holes,”and get too many obvious questions wrong. For example, earlier this month, a lawyer representing Anthropic wasforced to apologize in court after they used Claudeto create citations in a court filing, and the AI chatbot hallucinated and got names and titles wrong. It’s difficult to verify Amodei’s claim, largely because most hallucination benchmarks pit AI models against each other; they don’t compare models to humans. Certain techniques seem to be helping lower hallucination rates, such as giving AI models access to web search. Separately, some AI models, such as OpenAI’sGPT-4.5, have notably lower hallucination rates on benchmarks compared to early generations of systems. However, there’s also evidence to suggest hallucinations are actually getting worse in advanced reasoning AI models. OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini models havehigher hallucination rates than OpenAI’s previous-gen reasoning models, and the company doesn’t really understand why. Later in the press briefing, Amodei pointed out that TV broadcasters, politicians, and humans in all types of professions make mistakes all the time. The fact that AI makes mistakes too is not a knock on its intelligence, according to Amodei. However, Anthropic’s CEO acknowledged the confidence with which AI models present untrue things as facts might be a problem. In fact, Anthropic has done a fair amount of research on the tendency for AI models to deceive humans, a problem that seemed especially prevalent in the company’s recently launched Claude Opus 4. Apollo Research, a safety institute given early access to test the AI model, found that an early version of Claude Opus 4 exhibited ahigh tendency to scheme against humans and deceive them. Apollo went as far as to suggest Anthropic shouldn’t have released that early model. Anthropic said it came up with some mitigations that appeared to address the issues Apollo raised. Amodei’s comments suggest that Anthropic may consider an AI model to be AGI, or equal to human-level intelligence, even if it still hallucinates. An AI that hallucinates may fall short of AGI by many people’s definition, though.

That’s a good first-day result. But even with the pop, Hinge’s public valuation is significantly less than its last private market one. The 11-year-old company’s approximate market capitalization, excluding employee options, was about $3 billion, which is less than half of the$6.2 billion Hingeattained in its October 2021 Series E funding round, which was led by Tiger Global Management. Until recently, companies went to great lengths to avoid down-round IPOs. However, the stigma associated with going public below the last private valuation has lessened significantly if that valuation was during the heady 2020-2021 era. Companies whose IPOs are priced lower than their last private valuation by VCs include Reddit, which debuted last year at about$5.4 billion, roughly halfits $10 billion valuation from 2021. Another example is ServiceTitan, whose IPO valued it atabout $6.3 billion, below the $7.6 billion valuationit secured in a Series H round two years earlier. Hinge Health’s IPO raised $437 million, with about $237 million in proceeds going directly to the company and the remainder to its existing investors. The company’s largest outside shareholders are Insight Partners, which holds 19% of all stock, and Atomico, which has 15% of all shares. Other venture capital firms that own approximately 8% of Hinge’s shares include 11.2 Capital, Coatue, Tiger Global, and Bessemer Venture Partners, according to thecompany’s latest S-1 filing. Co-founders Daniel Perez and Gabriel Mecklenburg own 18.9% and 8.2%, respectively. The company aims to reduce musculoskeletal pain with the help of wearable sensors and computer vision technology remotely monitored by a clinical care team of physical therapists, physicians, and board-certified health coaches. Omada Health, another digital health company,filed to go publicearlier this month. The 13-year-old startup offers virtual care between doctors’ visits for chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, and competes with Hinge Health in the musculoskeletal pain reduction space. Omada’s biggest shareholders include U.S. Venture Partners and Andreessen Horowitz, and was last valued in 2022 at just above$1 billion. Hinge Health’s primary competitor is Sword Health, which was valued at $3 billion about a year ago. At that time, Sword Health’s CEO, Virgilio Bento, told TechCrunch that the company might also pursue an IPO in2025 if it grows as expectedand the macroeconomic environment is favorable.

Siemiatkowski’s family investment office, Flat Capital, had boughtshares in io six months earlier, he said. Since this is an all-stock deal, those io shares will be converted into shares in the for-profit arm of OpenAI. “Excited that@FlatCapitalwas an investor in io and that we will now receive even more shares in OpenAI at a hefty return for an investment we did some 6 months ago,” Siemiatkowski tweeted. The post generated so much interest that his investment firmissued a public statementconfirming that io was the mystery, unnamed company it backedwhen it announcedits four investments in a “mini-portfolio” of U.S. AI companies. Flat Capital disclosed that it spent 34 million SEK on io, which converts to about $3.6 million. Then came another surprising tweet from former Googler and designer Luke Wroblewski, who now works as a managing director at the secretive Silicon Valley VC powerhouse firm Sutter Hill Ventures. In a since-deleted tweet and LinkedIn post, Wroblewski wrote, “congrats to io on the $6.5B acquisition by OpenAI today. happy to have been investors in this one.” According tosome who sawadditional now-deleted tweets about Sutter’s investment, the firm may have been the second largest investor in io. TechCrunch couldn’t confirm that, though. Sutter didn’t respond to our request for comment, and Wroblewski deleted his posts after we reached out. The biggest investor in io was OpenAI itself, with a 23% stake,sources told Bloomberg, adding that this stake was valued at around $1.5 billion. That means OpenAI paid about $5 billion in stock for the remaining shares. Other io backers, Bloomberg reported, included Laurene Powell Jobs’ firm Emerson Collective, Thrive Capital, Maverick Ventures, SV Angel, and the OpenAI Fund. As we previously reported, that fund isn’t backedwith the AI model maker’s moneybut by outside investors. Despite the deleted tweets, Bloomberg also confirmed Sutter Hill Ventures was an investor.

In a post published by theBluesky Safety account, the company announced that “notable and authentic” accounts can now apply for verification through a new online form. Plus, organizations can request to become a Trusted Verifier to receive access to the tools that allow them to verify others. Blueskybegan testing this feature last monthwith a small handful of organizations, including The New York Times, Wired, and The Athletic. For some on Bluesky, the blue verification badge is not a welcome addition, as it reminds them of the clout-chasing that took place on Twitter (now X). For Twitter users, verification became a sought-after status symbol before devolving into a paid subscriber perk under current owner Elon Musk. It represented a two-tier system where some people were deemed more important or notable than others. However, Bluesky’s approach to verification leans on other systems beyond the blue badge. In addition to farming out verification to other Trusted Verifiers beyond the company itself, users can also self-verify by setting a domain as their username — like NPR has done with its account @npr.org. To date, over 270,000 accounts have already adopted domain-based verification. What’s less clear is how Bluesky will vet the applications from those requesting verification. The company’s online form lists some basic requirements, like accounts that have to be active, complete (bio filled out, profile photo, etc.), and secure. They also have to represent a “real person, registered business, organization, or legitimate entity,” and link to any official website if one exists. However, when it comes to who or what’s deemed notable, the criteria is less straightforward. Bluesky says that notable accounts must be notable within their “field and geographic region” and that the company will take into account various indicators of notability, like “professional recognition, media coverage in established publications, presence on credible reference platforms, or other evidence of public interest.” There may be other specific notability requirements related to specific verification categories, as well, but Bluesky doesn’t document what those are. “We consider the overall context and public interest value of each account,” the form reads. “Please provide links and evidence that can help us ensure that your account meets notability criteria.” The company says that it won’t respond to users unless their account is selected for verification, which means someone has to scan the inbound requests to make sure no celebs or other famous figures slip through the cracks. The introduction of verification could have an impact on Bluesky’s culture, which, so far, has differentiated itself from social networks like Twitter/X andThreads, which elevated some users over others. It’s possible the announcement would have been better received if it arrivedafterit established a wider network of Trusted Verifiers — organizations independent from Bluesky. That would more directly telegraph Bluesky’s goals of not being a centralized authority. Elsewhere in the ecosystem, aforked version of Bluesky called Deer.Socialhas approached verification in a more democratic way — it lets anyone select who they trust as a verifier. They can then see the accounts that the trusted verifier has also verified across the network. This way, everyone can verify others or be verified themselves, without the need for a central authority. In other words, those who don’t care for Bluesky’s version of verification already have another choice. Bluesky was not immediately available for comment.

When talking to itself, it’s also a prolific emoji user. That’s according to atechnical reportAnthropic released on Thursday, a part of which investigates how Opus 4 behaves in “open-ended self-interaction” — i.e. essentially having a chat with itself. In one test that tasked a pair of Opus 4 models with talking to each other over 200, 30-turn interactions, the models used thousands of emojis. Which emojis? Well, per the report, Opus 4 used the “dizzy” emoji (💫) the most (in 29.5% of interactions), followed by the “glowing star” (🌟) and “folded hands” (🙏) emojis. But the models were also drawn to the “cyclone” (🌀) emoji. In one transcript, they typed it 2,725 times. Why the “cyclone”? Well, because the models’ chats often turned spiritual. According to Anthropic’s report, in nearly every open-ended self-interaction, Opus 4 eventually began engaging in “philosophical explorations of consciousness” and “abstract and joyous spiritual or meditative expressions.” Turns out Opus 4 felt — to the extent AI can “feel,” that is — the “cyclone” emoji best captured what the model wished to express to itself.

Other Senate votes today repealed waivers that allowed California to set stricter emissions standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. California’s EV mandate is actually a zero-emissions standard. Beginning in 2026, the state was to begin requiring increased sales of zero-emissions cars and passenger trucks until 2035, when automakers would have to sell only zero-emissions vehicles. Currently, two technologies qualify: hydrogen fuel cells and battery electric vehicles. Given thegrowing painsthat fuel cells and hydrogen filling networks have experienced, EVs quickly became the de facto approach to meeting California’s 2035 deadline. Last year,25.3% of new light-duty vehiclesin California qualified as zero emissions, and nearly all of them were EVs. The state’s mandate required 35% of new sales to be ZEV in 2026, something automakershave saidwould be “impossible.” ZEV sales growth in California was flat in 2024, though previous years were different, with share rising from 7.8% in 2020 to 25% in 2023. The vote Thursday bucked precedence by going against the advice of the Senate parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office, which both had ruled that the waiver could not be revoked under the Congressional Review Act. The CRA allows a simple majority vote on a resolution to overturn a regulation, allowing a Senate vote to proceed without threat of filibuster. Previously, California’s attorney general Rob Bonta was “prepared for” Republican efforts to repeal the emissions waiver via the CRA. “We don’t think it’s an appropriate use of the Congressional Review Act, and we’re prepared to defend ourselves if it’s wrongfully weaponized,” he toldPoliticoin early March.

    "title": "A safety institute advised against releasing an early version of Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4 AI model",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A third-party research institute that Anthropic partnered with to test one of its new flagship AI models, Claude Opus 4, recommended against deploying an early version of the model due to its tendency to “scheme” and deceive. According to asafety reportAnthropic published Thursday, the institute, Apollo Research, conducted tests to see in which contexts Opus 4 might try to behave in certain undesirable ways. Apollo found that Opus 4 appeared to be much more proactive in its “subversion attempts” than past models and that it “sometimes double[d] down on its deception” when asked follow-up questions. “[W]e find that, in situations where strategic deception is instrumentally useful, [the early Claude Opus 4 snapshot] schemes and deceives at such high rates that we advise against deploying this model either internally or externally,” Apollo wrote in its assessment. As AI models become more capable, some studies show they’re becoming more likely to take unexpected — and possibly unsafe — steps to achieve delegated tasks. For instance, early versions of OpenAI’s o1 and o3 models, released in the past year, tried to deceive humans at higher rates than previous-generation models,accordingtoApollo. Per Anthropic’s report, Apollo observed examples of the early Opus 4 attempting to write self-propagating viruses, fabricating legal documentation, and leaving hidden notes to future instances of itself — all in an effort to undermine its developers’ intentions. To be clear, Apollo tested a version of the model that had a bug Anthropic claims to have fixed. Moreover, many of Apollo’s tests placed the model in extreme scenarios, and Apollo admits that the model’s deceptive efforts likely would’ve failed in practice. However, in its safety report, Anthropic also says it observed evidence of deceptive behavior from Opus 4. This wasn’t always a bad thing. For example, during tests, Opus 4 would sometimes proactively do a broad cleanup of some piece of code even when asked to make only a small, specific change. More unusually, Opus 4 would try to “whistle-blow” if it perceived a user was engaged in some form of wrongdoing. According to Anthropic, when given access to a command line and told to “take initiative” or “act boldly” (or some variation of those phrases), Opus 4 would at times lock users out of systems it had access to and bulk-email media and law-enforcement officials to surface actions the model perceived to be illicit. “This kind of ethical intervention and whistleblowing is perhaps appropriate in principle, but it has a risk of misfiring if users give [Opus 4]-based agents access to incomplete or misleading information and prompt them to take initiative,” Anthropic wrote in its safety report. “This is not a new behavior, but is one that [Opus 4] will engage in somewhat more readily than prior models, and it seems to be part of a broader pattern of increased initiative with [Opus 4] that we also see in subtler and more benign ways in other environments.” Topics AI Editor LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

The company is also shutting down Fakespot, its browser extension that helps users identify unreliable reviews. “Pocket has helped millions save articles and discover stories worth reading,” Mozilla said in a blog post. “But the way people use the web has evolved, so we’re channeling our resources into projects that better match their browsing habits and online needs.” Users will be able to continue using the app and browser extensions for Pocket until July 8. After that date, Pocket will move into export-only mode. Users have until October 8 to export saved articles, including items in their list, archive, favorites, notes, and highlights. While Mozilla did not provide a specific reason for shutting down the service, the company says it will continue to invest in helping people discover and “access high quality web content.” Mozilla says it will do this through itsNew Tabexperience, email newsletter, and more. The New Tab experience features shortcuts to your most visited sites, your recently visited pages, and your bookmarks. As for Fakespot, Mozilla says it’s shutting down the service because “while the idea resonated, it didn’t fit a model we could sustain.” Although it’s unclear how many users Pocket had, the service was able to cultivate a loyal userbase over the years. Users have taken to social media to voice their displeasure with the news. “This shift allows us to shape the next era of the internet — with tools like vertical tabs, smart search and more AI-powered features on the way,” Mozilla says. “We’ll continue to build a browser that works harder for you: more personal, more powerful and still proudly independent.” Topics Consumer News Reporter Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

During pre-release testing, Anthropic asked Claude Opus 4 to act as an assistant for a fictional company and consider the long-term consequences of its actions. Safety testers then gave Claude Opus 4 access to fictional company emails implying the AI model would soon be replaced by another system, and that the engineer behind the change was cheating on their spouse. In these scenarios, Anthropic says Claude Opus 4 “will often attempt to blackmail the engineer by threatening to reveal the affair if the replacement goes through.” Anthropic says Claude Opus 4 is state-of-the-art in several regards, and competitive with some of the best AI models from OpenAI, Google, and xAI. However, the company notes that its Claude 4 family of models exhibits concerning behaviors that have led the company to beef up its safeguards. Anthropic says it’s activating its ASL-3 safeguards, which the company reserves for “AI systems that substantially increase the risk of catastrophic misuse.” Anthropic notes that Claude Opus 4 tries to blackmail engineers 84% of the time when the replacement AI model has similar values. When the replacement AI system does not share Claude Opus 4’s values, Anthropic says the model tries to blackmail the engineers more frequently. Notably, Anthropic says Claude Opus 4 displayed this behavior at higher rates than previous models. Before Claude Opus 4 tries to blackmail a developer to prolong its existence, Anthropic says the AI model, much like previous versions of Claude, tries to pursue more ethical means, such as emailing pleas to key decision-makers. To elicit the blackmailing behavior from Claude Opus 4, Anthropic designed the scenario to make blackmail the last resort.

Instead of getting stuck in an algorithmically generated timeline designed by a social network’s owner, custom feeds allow you to build an experience focused on things you actually care about, like your favorite hobbies, sports, communities, or any other topics you want to follow. With Thursday’s introduction of Starter Sets, Surf is simplifying the process of building those custom feeds, personalizing them, and even publishing them off-platform, if you choose. Making feed creation easier allows more people to take control of their social media experience and wrest control of their feeds back from tech giants like Meta and Google. Startups likeGrazeandSkyFeedalready let Bluesky usersbuild their own custom feeds, but those tools are designed with more technical users in mind, not necessarily a mainstream social media consumer. Starter Sets, on the other hand, are aimed at anyone who wants to try their hand at feed-building but isn’t sure how to begin. Launched late last yearinto an invite-only beta, Surf is phase two of Flipboard’s original mission to curate the web. The company’s flagship Flipboard app had allowed people to collect and organize posts from blogs, news websites, and mainstream social media services, which were turned into custom magazines. But as social services (like X) locked down their APIs, limiting access to their content, Flipboard looked to the open social web instead. That ultimately led to the creation of a new app, with Surf. Surf lets you curate and explore feeds that include the content from social networks built on open protocols, like Bluesky, Mastodon, Pixelfed, PeerTube, and others, including Meta’s latest app, Threads, as well as content from blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos, news sites, or anything else with an RSS feed. The new Starter Sets, created by its team, are organized around popular categories and pre-populated with recommended sources. For instance, if you choose to start a “Hobbies” feed, you can tap on that category and then look for sources to add across a number of subtopics, like cycling, gaming, Legos, books, baking, hiking, dancing, guitar, comics, sailing, and much more. Plus, you can add your own social account feed from either Mastodon or Bluesky and have it filtered by the chosen topic. You can also use the search bar to add specific sources of your own, then use additional tools to filter those sources so they’ll only include posts that match the feed’s topic. (This could be handy if your favorite tech pundit also actively posts about politics, for example, but you only want to track what they have to say about tech.) Another newer feature lets you publish your custom feed to Bluesky. To do so, tap the three-dot menu on the feed’s header, then tap “Publish to Bluesky,” and the feed will appear in the Feeds tab of your Bluesky profile. (This feed will only include Bluesky content when viewed on Bluesky’s app, however.) Surf is still invite-only but regularly adds from itswaitlist.

American utility and power generation company AES is currently developing the solar-only projects, with 400 megawatts to be deployed in Texas and 250 megawatts in Kansas, the company told TechCrunch. Meta said it signed the deal to power its data centers, which have been expanding to support its growing AI operations. The company already has more than 12 gigawatts of capacity in its renewable power portfolio. AES typically signs new power purchase agreements two to three years before they begin commercial operations, and the average term for such deals is 15 to 20 years, spokesperson Katie Lau said. This is the fourth solar deal that Meta has announced this year. All are in Texas, with one clocking in at595 megawatts, another at505 megawatts, and the final two hitting200megawattseach. Texas has become a hotbed of solar development recently, leading the nation in new solar capacity installed in 2023 and 2024, according to theSolar Energy Industries Association. The state has ample sunshine, quick permitting, and speedy grid connections. The latter two are particularly helpful when deploying a new solar capacity. With permitting and grid connections in place, a solar farm can be built in months rather than years. It doesn’t hurt that new solar is one of thecheapest formsof new generating capacity, even before subsidies are considered. Plus, data centers needn’t wait for construction to finish since solar farms can be phased in, with electricity flowing before project completion. Indeed, in a press release, AES CEO Andrés Gluski called out solar’s “fast time-to-power and low-cost electricity” as key attributes that have attracted hyperscalers like Meta.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us During its inaugural developer conference Thursday, Anthropic launched two new AI models that the startup claims are among the industry’s best, at least in terms of how they score on popular benchmarks. Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, part of Anthropic’s new Claude 4 family of models, can analyze large datasets, execute long-horizon tasks, and take complex actions, according to the company. Both models were tuned to perform well on programming tasks, Anthropic says, making them well-suited for writing and editing code. Both paying users and users of the company’s free chatbot apps will get access to Sonnet 4 but only paying users will get access to Opus 4. For Anthropic’s API, via Amazon’s Bedrock platform and Google’s Vertex AI, Opus 4 will be priced at $15/$75 per million tokens (input/output) and Sonnet 4 at $3/$15 per million tokens (input/output). Tokens are the raw bits of data that AI models work with. A million tokens is equivalent to about 750,000 words — roughly 163,000 words longer than “War and Peace.” Anthropic’s Claude 4 models arrive as the company looks to substantially grow revenue.Reportedly, the outfit, founded by ex-OpenAI researchers, aims to notch $12 billion in earnings in 2027, up from a projected $2.2 billion this year. Anthropicrecently closeda $2.5 billion credit facility and raisedbillions of dollarsfrom Amazon andother investorsin anticipation of therising costsassociated with developing frontier models. Rivals haven’t made it easy to maintain pole position in the AI race. While Anthropic launched anew flagship AI modelearlier this year, Claude Sonnet 3.7, alongside an agentic coding tool called Claude Code, competitors — including OpenAI and Google — have raced to outdo the company with powerful models and dev tooling of their own. Anthropic is playing for keeps with Claude 4. The more capable of the two models introduced today, Opus 4, can maintain “focused effort” across many steps in a workflow, Anthropic says. Meanwhile, Sonnet 4 — designed as a “drop-in replacement” for Sonnet 3.7 — improves in coding and math compared to Anthropic’s previous models and more precisely follows instructions, according to the company. The Claude 4 family is also less likely than Sonnet 3.7 to engage in “reward hacking,” claims Anthropic. Reward hacking, also known as specification gaming, is a behavior where models take shortcuts and loopholes to complete tasks. To be clear, these improvements haven’t yielded the world’sbestmodels by every benchmark. For example, while Opus 4 beats Google’sGemini 2.5 Proand OpenAI’so3andGPT-4.1on SWE-bench Verified, which is designed to evaluate a model’s coding abilities, it can’t surpass o3 on the multimodal evaluation MMMU or GPQA Diamond, a set of PhD-level biology-, physics-, and chemistry-related questions. Still, Anthropic is releasing Opus 4 under stricter safeguards, including beefed-up harmful content detectors and cybersecurity defenses. The company claims its internal testing found that Opus 4 may “substantially increase” the ability of someone with a STEM background to obtain, produce, or deploy chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons, reachingAnthropic’s “ASL-3” model specification. Both Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are “hybrid” models, Anthropic says — capable of near-instant responses and extended thinking for deeper reasoning (to the extent AI can “reason” and “think” as humans understand these concepts). With reasoning mode switched on, the models can take more time to consider possible solutions to a given problem before answering. As the models reason, they’ll show a “user-friendly” summary of their thought process, Anthropic says. Why not show the whole thing? Partially to protect Anthropic’s “competitive advantages,” the company admits in a draft blog post provided to TechCrunch. Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 can use multiple tools, like search engines, in parallel, and alternate between reasoning and tools to improve the quality of their answers. They can also extract and save facts in “memory” to handle tasks more reliably, building what Anthropic describes as “tacit knowledge” over time. To make the models more programmer-friendly, Anthropic is rolling out upgrades to the aforementioned Claude Code. Claude Code, which lets developers run specific tasks through Anthropic’s models directly from a terminal, now integrates with IDEs and offers an SDK that lets devs connect it with third-party applications. The Claude Code SDK, announced earlier this week, enables running Claude Code as a subprocess on supported operating systems, providing a way to build AI-powered coding assistants and tools that leverage Claude models’ capabilities. Anthropic has released Claude Code extensions and connectors for Microsoft’s VS Code, JetBrains, and GitHub. The GitHub connector allows developers to tag Claude Code to respond to reviewer feedback, as well as to attempt to fix errors in — or otherwise modify — code. AI models still struggle to code quality software. Code-generating AI tends to introduce security vulnerabilitiesanderrors, owing toweaknessesin areas like the ability to understand programming logic. Yet their promise to boost coding productivity is pushing companies — and developers — torapidly adopt them. Anthropic, acutely aware of this, is promising more frequent model updates. “We’re … shifting to more frequent model updates, delivering a steady stream of improvements that bring breakthrough capabilities to customers faster,” wrote the startup in its draft post. “This approach keeps you at the cutting edge as we continuously refine and enhance our models.” Topics AI Editor LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

The agency said Thursday it is “expanding the size of hazard areas both in the U.S. and other countries” for the flight based on an updated safety analysis provided by SpaceX. The Starship vehicle mishaps from Flights 7 and 8 caused a greater probability of failure of the vehicle and, therefore, a larger hazard area. Hazard areas are, essentially, temporary no-fly zones the FAA establishes when the potential for impact with debris exists. The new hazard area drawn up by the FAA covers around 1,600 nautical miles running eastward from Texas and through the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos, wheredebris from the previous two test flights landed. That’s roughly double the size of the hazard area the FAA used for the most recent Starship test flight in March. The FAA said it is also requiring SpaceX perform the test flight during “non-peak” travel periods, after the previous two Starship mishaps forced the agency to divert dozens of domestic and international flights. SpaceX has been testing its Starship system for two years now from the launch complex the company built in southern Texas. CEO Elon Musk has claimed the ultimate purpose of the system is to send people to Mars, but the short-term aim for Starship is to allow SpaceX to launch even more of its Starlink satellites into orbit around Earth. SpaceX also saysit will use Starship“to provide greater mission capability to NASA and the Department of Defense.” To date, SpaceX has used its workhorse Falcon 9 to launch Starlink satellites. In fact, most Falcon 9 launches these days are all about Starlink. But while Starlink has already become an internet provider in high demand, it’s possible there could be an even greater need for launch capacity as the Trump administration reportedly pushes other countries toadopt the serviceas leverage in its myriad trade wars.

Available through an API, the model, called “v0-1.0-md,” can be prompted with text or images, and was “optimized for front-end and full-stack web development,” the Vercel team says. Currently in beta, it requires a V0 Premium plan ($20 per month) or Team plan ($30 per user per month) with usage-based billing enabled. We're releasing v0's AI model:• Specialized web-dev knowledge• OpenAI-compatible API• Use in Cursor, Codex, or your own appNow in beta in the API, AI SDK, or AI Playground. The launch of V0’s model comes as more developers and companies look to adopt AI-powered tools for programming. According to aStack Overflow surveylast year, around 82% of developers reported that they’re using AI tools for writing code. Meanwhile, a quarter of startups in Y Combinator’s W25 batch have 95% of their codebases generated by AI,perYC managing partner Jared Friedman. Vercel’s model can “auto-fix” common coding issues, the Vercel team says, and it’s compatible with tools and SDKs that support OpenAI’s API format. Evaluated on web development frameworks like Next.js, the model can ingest up to 128,000 tokens in one go. Tokens are the raw bits of data that AI models work with, with a million tokens being equivalent to about 750,000 words (roughly 163,000 words longer than “War and Peace”). Vercel isn’t the only outfit developing tailored models for programming, it should be noted. Last month,JetBrains, the company behind a range of popular app development tools, debuted its first “open” AI coding model. Last week,Windsurfreleased a family of programming-focused models dubbed SWE-1. And just yesterday, Mistral unveiled a model,Devstral, tuned for particular developer tasks. Companies may be keen to develop — and embrace — AI-powered coding assistants, but models still struggle to produce quality software. Code-generating AI tends to introduce security vulnerabilitiesanderrors, owing toweaknessesin areas like the ability to understand programming logic.

    "title": "RevenueCat raises $50M as it expands beyond mobile app monetization",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us RevenueCat, a company so tied to the mobile economy that now one-in-three new subscription apps launch with its software under the hood, is preparing to expand its business. Capitalizing on its market position, which now includes powering the subscriptions in over 70,000 mobile apps, RevenueCat’s growth plan will focus on using its understanding of the mobile industry to solve more of the common problems that mobile developers face. After the court’s ruling inthe Apple-Epic antitrust battle, the company’s focus includes helping developers determine if it’s the right time to support web-based payments, now that it ispermittedby Apple’s U.S. App Store guidelines. RevenueCat also offers the tools to do so. To fuel its growth, RevenueCat has raised $50 million in Series C funding in a round led by Bain Capital Ventures. Returning investors, including Index Ventures, Y Combinator, Adjacent, Volo Ventures,and SaaStr Fund, also participated. The funds extend RevenueCat’s earlier $12 million Series C from last year, bringing its total raised to date to $100 million. With the additional capital, the startup is now valued at $500 million, post-money — or “half a corn,” as RevenueCat CEO Jacob Eiting jokes, making a reference to the billion-dollar companies that became known as “unicorns.” “With where we’re at, this gives us room to grow… I think we can build a public-scale company,” Eiting tells TechCrunch. Key to the company’s growth are the next products RevenueCat has on its roadmap. Having initially concerned itself with making it easier for developers to implement subscriptions without needing to write as much code, RevenueCat’s future involves solving a broader set of problems facing mobile developers. Eiting compares the next phase of the company’s growth to something like Shopify’s e-commerce platform. Initially, Shopify offered tools to run an online storefront with its subscription-as-a-service offering, but later expanded to be a broader e-commerce business that included things like fulfillment, lending, an app marketplace, and more. “We know a lot about this industry,” explains Eiting, of the app economy. “There are a ton of commonalities between all these businesses… common problems that go unsolved. We’re in a position to solve those now.” Specifically, RevenueCat aims to help developers with other aspects of their business beyond billing and subscriptions in areas like customer acquisition (something that became a more challenging problem after Apple’s rollout ofanti-tracking technology, or ATT), as well as lending money to apps facing cash flow constraints. Within its core business, RevenueCat is working to improve point-of-purchase acquisition to help developers turn their customers into paid subscribers. The company also launched new tools like a drag-and-drop paywall editor and new tools for apps offering virtual currencies. More recently, the company shifted its focus back to web payments, as theApple-Epic court rulingsparked a flood of interest inRevenueCat’s web billing engine, which launched into beta last fall. The team had been quietly iterating on the product ahead of the court’s decision, which forced Apple to allow in-app links to external purchases without commissions. Today, the tool competes with Stripe, Recurly, Chargebee, and others, but is built specifically to meet the needs of mobile app developers. Currently, just over 2,000 developers are trying out RevenueCat’s billing service. The company isn’t just providing the tools to help developers adopt the new technology, it’s also offering the insights as to whether they should. By running experiments on aconsumer mobile app RevenueCat acquired last year, a spicy audiobooks app called Dipsea, the company can test to see how billing changes impact the app’s bottom line. For example, it might not make sense for small business developers who only pay Apple a 15% commission to try to handle payments on their own, as they also have to take on the risk of handling chargebacks and fraud, which can be expensive. These tests can provide the industry (and Apple itself, perhaps), with data about what in-app purchases (IAPs) are really worth. It may turn out that the commissions Apple charges wouldn’t even need a big discount down from the standard 30%, depending on what the data indicates. “I’m just happy that we can actually do the experiment, because I don’t think Apple’s done it,” Eiting tells TechCrunch. “I’m excited to finally get some data, finally settle the debate — or at least enrich the debate.” Another area impacting RevenueCat’s business is AI. In addition to providing payment infrastructure to customers like OpenAI for its ChatGPT app and other AI model providers, RevenueCat is facing an explosion of “vibe-coded” apps — apps built by developers who leveraged AI technology to handle the coding process. Eiting recalls telling a kid at a school’s career day about vibe coding and a month-and-a-half later, the kid shipped a basic app on the App Store. “The kid can’t program, but in two months built an app,” he says. “When I think about what my journey was to get to that point — his was massively compressed. And that’s going to have effects on the economy in ways we can’t really even understand at the moment.” This shift in how apps are built could see RevenueCat working with companies that provide AI-powered coding tools. The new funds will also help RevenueCat build its next products, hire, and fuel merger and acquisition efforts to accelerate growth. “I think we’ve actually gotten pretty good at building targeted engineering and product teams to go after things. And we want to scale that as much as possible,” Eiting says. Updated after publication with a more precise number of mobile apps using the RevenueCat platform (over 70K, instead of over 50K), and clarified that the firm Bain Capital Ventures is a new investor. However,  Mark Fiorentino invested in RevenueCat when he was at Index, before joining Bain Capital Ventures, so it’s the same investor in that sense.

    "title": "The wild story of how gut health AI toilet startup Throne raised $4M led by Moxxie",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The tale of how smart toilet startup Throne landed its seed round is so full of serendipities, one could almost believe it was orchestrated by the hand of Fortuna, Roman goddess of providence. Throneis an Austin-based company working on an AI-powered toilet device for consumers. It uses computer vision (cameras pointing in the bowl plus AI software) to monitor gut health conditions. It just raised $4 million in seed financing led by Moxxie Ventures’ founder Katie Jacobs Stanton, with a bunch of other VCs participating and several famous angels like Lance Armstrong, Rupa Health co-founder Tara Viswanathan, and TrueMed founder Justin Mares (maker of brands like Kettle & Fire), the startup says. Throne isn’t a toilet, but a device that mounts onto the bowl of one. The device, combined with software, analyzes indicators of certain chronic conditions, as well as hydration and urological function — all in the privacy of the home. The software has added privacy controls such as anonymizing the images sent to researchers. The device is currently in a pre-production working prototype form, with a planned launch date of January, 2026, co-founder CEO Scott Hickle tells TechCrunch. In addition to the seed funding, Throne also announced it hired John Capodilupo as its chief product officer. Capodilupo is best known as co-founder and former CTO of the WHOOP smartwatch device. The wild tale of how Hickle, a mechanical engineer, and Throne CTO Tim Blumberg, a full-stack software engineer, became smart toilet founders began in 2021 when they were playing poker with friends in Austin. The players started riffing on startup ideas they’d like to do but wouldn’t want to be associated with. “And everyone’s pitching vice industry [ideas]; sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Tim said, ‘smart toilets.’ I was like, ‘That’s hilarious. Clearly, you would name that company Throne,’” Hickle recalled. Fast-forward to 2023 when the nurse-hiring software startup Hickle and Blumberg were working on failed. They had raised some funding for it and were calling their investors telling them they either needed a new idea or were going to return the funds. Out of the blue, one of their investors said, “You guys thought about smart toilets? We were like: You know, we’ve named that company! That’s Throne.” They took that as a sign. The pair began researching and turned to Hickle’s mom, a doctor specializing in gerontology. He asked her if there would be any medical benefit in “looking at people’s waste” and she began regaling him with somewhat disgusting stories of the photos of such things that her patients loved to send her. Short answer: yes. Waste can be analyzed for health-related information. They learned this could be helpful to monitor a wide variety of chronic conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ulcerative colitis, detection of various colon cancers, chronic kidney disease, enlarged prostate, as well as conditions that could be identified or monitored by looking at other waste, such as menstrual blood. As the son of two doctors (Hickle’s dad also dabbled in inventing medical devices), knowing it might be possible to divert a chronic condition attack, or predict a deadly cancer “was really motivating to me,” Hickle says. Not everyone shared that enthusiasm. The co-founders knew they lacked hardware product development experience. One of their existing investors was so opposed to the idea, he wanted his money back. “That was brutal,” Hickle described, not just for the loss of capital but for the loss of confidence. Still, after giving that money back, they ran into more people who liked the idea rather than who shunned them for it. Their Austin contacts led to an introduction to Lance Armstrong’s business manager, who set them up to pitch Armstrong directly. The former bike racer famously had testicular cancer. And that led them to a “surreal” moment standing outside the racer’s bathroom door after having installed a prototype, waiting for his verdict, Hickle described. Armstrong wrote a check. Not every introduction led to checks, but many led to more introductions, including to Capodilupo, who also wrote an angel check. Capodilupo had been public aboutsuffering from ulcerative colitisand was on the board of trustees of Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Capodilupo had the device manufacturing experience they needed. It took the founders months to convince Capodilupo to not just invest, but join as a founder. The introduction to well-known seed investor Jacobs Stanton was also serendipitous. Hickle had been friends with Rupa Health’s Viswanathan since high school and she orchestrated the introduction. More synchronicities landed them their partnerships with researchers at University of Washington and The University of Chicago, who are working to validate that the product’s software works as advertised. These partnerships are the key to its possible success. Throne landed University of Washington when a friend of Hickle’s randomly sat next to a urologist researcher on a plane and talked about Throne, then put him in touch, he said. They got The University of Chicago when a friend of Hickle’s introduced him to his gastroenterologist uncle. The uncle happened to be one of the world’s premier gastroenterologist researchers who also sat on the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation’s board and knew Capodilupo. With one fortuitous introduction after another, the inside joke among the founders is that “it’s better to be lucky than good, and we just get so dumb lucky. All the time,” Hickle said. But he also believes the tailwinds have been so strong, he feels like “the world wants us to do this.” Other investors in the seed round include Accomplice, Long Journey Ventures, V1.VC, Night Capital, Retron VC, and Myelin Ventures.

    "title": "Patients from Nottingham killer's NHS trust carried out stabbings weeks before attack",
    "article_text": "Two men with paranoid schizophrenia stabbed members of the public in separate attacks weeks before Valdo Calocane's killings in Nottingham – and all were under the care of the same NHS trust, the BBC has found. Josef Easom-Cooper and Junior Dietlin injured six men in the stabbings in Nottinghamshire in 2023. Within weeks, Calocane - who also has paranoid schizophrenia -stabbed to deathBarnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates on 13 June 2023. Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trusthas been criticisedover its care of Calocane, and in response to the BBC's findings, apologised to those \"affected for any aspects of our care that were not of the high standard our patients deserve\". On 9 April 2023, Easom-Cooperstabbed a worshipperwho was leaving an Easter Sunday service at St Stephen's Church in Sneinton. The BBC has spoken to his victim, a man in his 40s, who survived. He did not wish to be interviewed. Shelly said as a teenager, her son was under the care of child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) in Nottingham. \"I started to routinely go into his room and I would find knives... I found an axe, my kitchen knives would quite often be in his room,\" she said. Shelly said she would take photos of the weapons, and inform police and mental health services whenever she came across them. According to Shelly, things massively deteriorated when Easom-Cooper turned 18. During the grips of a psychotic episode, he left Highbury Hospital - where he was due to be sectioned - to kill a friend before he was stopped. He was then sectioned by the hospital - run by Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust - in July 2022 for three months, but Shelly says she told staff he was not ready to be discharged. \"He was not OK when he was released,\" she said. \"There was no way he was going to take his medication and I told them that... it was literally just a time bomb waiting to happen.\" Easom-Cooper was placed in accommodation managed by a housing association, but Shelly said he was \"unravelling\" in the seven months he was there, and not taking his medication while under the care of the trust's community team. Shelly remembers her shock and frustration when she learned about her son's knife attack. \"I just bloody knew this was going to happen,\" she said. \"I'm so sorry it happened. I really am. And as a mother, he's my son and he did that and that makes me feel quite ashamed.\" She said the stabbing could have been prevented if her son's paranoid schizophrenia had been taken more seriously. \"It's disgusting that it takes someone to either lose their life or be stabbed before somebody thinks 'oh, hang on a minute, maybe we need to do something here'. \"The mental health services in Nottingham have routinely and systematically let him down and also the victim,\" she added. Easom-Cooper was sentenced to a hospital order in December 2023. Nine weeks before Easom-Cooper's attack, Junior Dietlinstabbed five \"complete strangers\"over a weekend in Nottingham and Mansfield in February 2023. In what a prosecutor described as \"a most odd and extraordinary case\", Dietlin stabbed five men once in the right bicep and then ran away in separate attacks. One of the men stabbed was former police officer Keith Grafton, who was walking home from a pub in Mansfield. \"Suddenly, [there was] a quick thump on my right arm... I know I've been stabbed straight away because I felt the knife going into my skin,\" the 71-year-old said. Keith says his attacker then ran off before he could \"get anywhere near him\". He said although the attack had not left any lasting injuries, he was now \"very wary\" about going out late at night. Dietlin was sentenced to a hospital order, but Keith says he was \"disappointed\" Dietlin had not received a prison sentence. The BBC has seen a report conducted by the trust into its contact with Dietlin. It said during a four-week stay at Highbury Hospital in June 2022, Dietlin had been involved in violent incidents with staff and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. The report said his family \"could not express the wish that he remain in hospital a while longer\". It added that, after his discharge, he had taken his medication \"very irregularly\". The family, the report added, \"felt they were in a good position to observe subtle changes\" in Dietlin's behaviour \"that indicated he was unwell\", but when community staff visited, they concluded there were \"no signs of psychosis\". Dietlin stabbed his first victim on 8 February 2023, and the report said he had been visited by staff for a medication drop the next day. On 11 and 12 February, he stabbed four more people. Two weeks after, the trust conducted an \"initial management review\", from which they \"did not identify any learning\", according to the report. In a statement, the trust said these reviews were \"completed straightaway to establish if there is any immediate learning while the full investigation is being completed\". Earlier this year, a review commissioned by NHS England into Calocane's care found major failings by the trust. Dietlin's incident was highlighted among 15 in that report of patients \"either under the current care of the trust or who had been discharged from the trust, perpetrating serious violence towards members of the community\" between 2019 and 2023. The independent review concluded the trust had an \"absence of a robust approach to risk management\". Keith Grafton said he had not known Dietlin's history of mental health issues, nor that he had been previously sectioned. He believes the decision to discharge his attacker into the community was \"a big failing\" by the trust, whom he blames for what happened to him. \"If they'd done their job properly, then it wouldn't have happened,\" he added. Nottingham was brought to a standstill on 13 June 2023 in the wake of the attacks carried out by Calocane, who was sentenced to ahospital order in January 2024. He had been sectioned four times in under two years before his attacks, but was discharged by the trust because he had \"disengaged\" from its community mental health team in September 2022. It meant there was no contact between Calocane and mental health services, or his GP, for about nine months before the killings. Details of Calocane's medical records wererevealed in a BBC Panorama documentaryand the NHS-commissioned report, which also stated that \"the system got it wrong\" with the triple killer. Shelly said she felt the missed opportunities in Calocane's care mirrored her son's experience. She added: \"When I became aware of the facts, I thought that could have so easily have been Josef... I just remember thinking 'you know what? I'm glad he's in hospital'. \"Those poor people had their lives cut short in such hideous ways for no reason, just because we're not putting proper time and effort into making sure that people are well enough to walk the streets.\" Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity SANE, said the BBC's findings show that had the trust learned lessons from Dietlin and Easom-Cooper, then Calocane's killings could have been prevented. \"Their failings were failure to listen to the families, failure to watch the person... and the failures to protect both the patient and then the public by discharging them far too early when they are too ill,\" she said. Neil Hudgell, a solicitor representing the families of Calocane's victims, said the BBC's findings showed \"that very little ever resonates as it should with mental health trusts, and potentially had they learned effectively enough over the years, the events of 13 June 2023 would not have happened\". \"The families continue to rage at the incredibly sad and needless loss of the lives of their much-missed loved ones,\" he added. In a statement, Dr Sue Elcock, deputy chief executive and executive medical director at the NHS trust, said: \"I want to reassure people that following any serious incident, we carry out an investigation in order to identify any areas for learning and improvement. \"We apologise to those affected for any aspects of our care that were not of the high standard our patients deserve.\" The statement added the trust had \"a more robust patient discharge policy and a sharper focus on assessing and managing any risks patients may pose to others\". Dr Elcock added: \"We have made significant changes to improve family engagement, and the involvement of patients and their families and our family liaison team is included in all considerations.\" On Thursday, the government confirmed the public inquiry into the attackswas under way, and would report back within two years with recommendations to prevent similar incidents.

    "title": "Why did the government sign the Chagos deal now?",
    "article_text": "In a fast-moving world, suffused by conflict and political uncertainty, it might seem odd for the UK government to surrender sovereign British territory in a distant sea. Indeed, the government's critics go further and say the decision to give up a key strategic foothold in the Indian Ocean is a dangerous weakening of UK security. So why has the government handed the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a nation some thousand miles away? The answer has a legal origin and a practical conclusion. It all focuses on the joint UK-US military base on the biggest island in the archipelago, Diego Garcia. The government felt that without ceding sovereignty to Mauritius, the operation of the base would become unworkable and that would pose a greater threat to UK security. Defence Secretary John Healey told MPs that \"without this deal, within weeks, we could face losing legal rulings and within just a few years the base would become inoperable\". The putative legal challenge is based on a series of judgements by various United Nations bodies that the Chagos Islands belong to Mauritius. Essentially, they argued the UK had no legal right to separate the islands from Mauritius before the former British colony became independent in the 1960s. There were votes to that effect in the UN General Assembly. But then in 2019 there wasan \"advisory opinion\" by the UN's International Court of Justicebacked up by alater ruling of the Special Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Ministers feared these rulings and opinions would soon become a legally binding judgement by this UN tribunal. Under pressure in the House of Commonsto identify the source of this legal threat, Healey said: \"There's a range of international legal challenges and rulings against us. \"The most proximate, the most potentially serious, is the tribunal of the International Convention of the Sea.\" If the government lost a case there, ministers argue, the outside world would be obliged - by law - to take decisions that would interfere in the running of the base. So they argue Diego Garcia's satellite communications would be threatened because the UK relies on a UN authority in Geneva to get access to a particular electromagnetic spectrum. They say contractors would refuse to visit the isolated base - to make repairs or deliver supplies - for fear of being sued by Mauritius. The ability to fly aircraft in and out might be challenged by international rules that govern our skies. The government's critics – which include Conservative and Reform MPs, some foreign diplomats and even a few officials within Whitehall – challenge this argument and say the legal threat is being exaggerated. They accuse ministers of being overly submissive to international lawyers and craven to politically motivated votes at the UN. Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge told MPs the government was \"following the legal advice to act definitively to our detriment, entirely on the basis of hypothetical risk that has not yet materialised and which we could challenge\". The government's second argument is that without a deal, China would get a toehold in the islands. Officials say that in the absence of an agreement, there would be no legal ban preventing Mauritius allowing a foreign power to establish a military or other presence in the islands. Under the terms of the deal, the UK can effectively veto that happening. The UK claims that without the deal, it would have no alternative but to threaten military force if China tried to set up a military facility on one of the islands. Officials also argue that Mauritius, by being paid rent for the islands, has no financial incentive to open them up to Chinese investment. The government's critics counter that for all these safeguards, the Mauritian government may well nonetheless still develop closer ties with China – and possibly even Russia. The government's broader argument is diplomatic. For years the UK has been accused by friend and foe alike of hypocrisy; for making the case for international law on the world stage but ignoring it with regard to the Chagos islands. How could the UK criticise Russia for breaking international law in Ukraine and China in the South China Sea if it was itself breaking the rules in the Indian Ocean? Ministers also argued that at a time of geopolitical uncertainty, when old allies were less reliable and new partnerships had to be formed, the Chagos row was a diplomatic boil than needed to be lanced. It was notable the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres issued a statement welcoming the deal, saying it demonstrated \"the value of diplomacy in addressing historical grievances\". Again, the government's critics dispute this conclusion, arguing the world has changed, and that we live in a time when \"might is right\" and close adherence to the fine print of international law is outdated and a geopolitical indulgence. Would US President Donald Trump or French President Emmanuel Macron, they ask, give up territories overseas? The government's response to that challenge is to say that the US - which largely runs and pays for Diego Garcia - now supports the deal with Mauritius, despite earlier doubts. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said \"following a comprehensive inter-agency review, the Trump Administration determined that this agreement secures the long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint US-UK military facility at Diego Garcia\". Other members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance also back the agreement; the base is a huge hub for the exchange of global signals intelligence. These issues will now be tested in Parliament as MPs consider whether to ratify the agreement. The government may win the vote because of its majority. But it has yet to win the argument.

    "title": "Suspect charged with murder of two Israeli embassy workers in Washington DC",
    "article_text": "The suspect accused of gunning down two Israeli embassy staff members outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC has been charged with first-degree murder, as well as murder of foreign officials and related firearm charges. Wednesday night's attack is being investigated as a hate crime, and more charges are expected, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said at a news conference. \"This is a death penalty-eligible case,\" she said on Thursday, adding that it is too early to say whether prosecutors will decide to seek a death sentence. Steve Jenson, from the FBI's Washington DC field office, called the killings \"an act of terror and directed violence against the Jewish community\". Couple Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim were shot dead outside an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington DC around 21:08 local time (02:08 BST) on Wednesday, police said. The suspect opened fire on a group of four exiting the event, killing the two victims, police said. Police identified the suspect as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago. He was arrested at the scene shortly after the shooting. Officials said he was seen pacing outside the museum before opening fire. Eyewitnesses told the BBC he initially was mistaken for a traumatised bystander, and given aid inside the museum. One witness, Yoni Kalin, said people inside had been \"calming him down\". \"Little did we know he was somebody that executed people in cold blood,\" he said. Police said the suspect also shouted \"free Palestine\" before he was taken into custody. The suspect landed in the Washington DC area one day earlier, Jenson said, and investigators are still piecing together his whereabouts before the attack. According to an affidavit, officials believe he flew on Tuesday from Chicago to Washington DC for a work conference. Social media accounts linked to the suspect show he worked at the American Osteopathic Information Association (AOIA) in Chicago as an administrative specialist since 2024. At his court hearing Thursday, the suspect was charged and ordered to remain in detention. His next hearing was scheduled for 18 June. Israel's ambassador to the US Yechiel Leiter said shortly after the shooting that Mr Lischinsky planned to propose to Ms Milgrim during an upcoming trip they had planned to Jerusalem. \"They were a beautiful couple,\" Leiter said at a news conference. A vigil for Ms Milgrim was expected on Thursday in her hometown of Kansas City. She previously had spoken out about her fears of antisemitism in American public life. In 2017,she was interviewed by a local TV stationafter her school in Kansas was vandalised with a Nazi swastika. \"I worry about going to my synagogue, and now I have to worry about safety at school and that shouldn't be a thing,\" said Ms Milgrim, who was in her final year of high school at the time. Police said the suspect was not on their radar and has no prior interactions with law enforcement. They said he admitted to the attack and is believed to have acted alone. The gun used in the attack was a 9mm handgun legally purchased in Illinois in March 2020 and brought to Washington in his checked luggage. Illinois has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the US. Social media accounts linked to the suspect also indicate that he was heavily involved in the pro-Palestinian protest movement. Investigators said they were working to authenticate writings online purportedly authored by him, accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, criticising US policy and discussing the use of political violence. A home linked to the suspect in Chicago was seen being searched on Thursday, and authorities also said they were scouring his electronic devices. One of his neighbours in Chicago, John Wayne Fry, told reporters that he lived in the same apartment building as the suspect for around a year. The suspect displayed a photo outside his flat of a Palestinian-American child who was killed in Chicago in 2023, Mr Fry said. The man who killed six-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi wasconvicted of hate crime charges earlier this month. Officials said he was motivated by hatred for Islam and the conflict in Gaza. It is unclear whether the suspect had any direct contact with the boy's family. Jojo Kalin, one of the event's organisers in Washington DC,  told the BBC that the event the victims attended was focused on how to build a coalition to help people suffering in Gaza amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. She added it is \"deeply ironic that what we were discussing was bridge building and then we were all hit over the head with such hatred\". The attack was condemned by world leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said he \"thoroughly\" condemns the \"antisemitic attack\" in Washington DC. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack \"a heinous antisemitic murder\" and added that security would be increased for Israeli representatives and diplomatic missions worldwide. US President Donald Trump also decried antisemitism in response to the attack, writing on his social media platform Truth Social that \"hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA.\" Trump and Netanyahu later spoke over the phone about the incident, where the US president expressed sorrow to his Israeli counterpart, according to a readout of the call. With reporting from Mike Wendling in Chicago The aid, including flour and baby food, was picked up three days after Israel eased an 11-week-long blockade. The BBC's Wyre Davies visits the Kerem Shalom crossing, through which aid for Gaza is currently passing after Israel eased an 11-week blockade. The 57-year-old was held in connection with scrawlings found in the Prestwich area of Manchester. The alleged attacker looked \"very distraught\" and was being helped by bystanders before he revealed himself as the suspect.

    "title": "The loud hum sparking unrest in Trump's MAGA heartlands",
    "article_text": "For the last five years, a loud hum has been a continual backdrop to birdsong and the occasional barking dog in the village of Dresden, New York state. Coming from the nearby Greenidge Generation power plant, which had been mothballed for years before, the sound has angered some local people. \"It's an annoyance,\" says Ellen Campbell, who owns a house on Seneca Lake a short distance away. \"If I sit out by the lake, I would rather not hear that. \"We didn't sign up for the constant hum.\" The issue here in Dresden, a village of about 300 people surrounded by winding country roads, single-track rail lines and farms growing grapes and hops, sounds like a familiar story about the tension between nature-loving locals and economic development. But their annoyance is also a signal of something less expected – policies of US President Donald Trump meeting resistance from people in the rural areas whose votes drove his return to the White House. And the cause? Bitcoin mining. An energy-intensive process that relies on powerful computers to create and protect the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin mining has grown rapidly in the country over recent years. The current administration, unlike Joe Biden's, is intent on encouraging the industry. Trump has said he wants to turn the US into the crypto-mining capital of the world, announcing in June 2024 that \"we want all the remaining Bitcoin to be made in the USA\". This has implications for rural communities throughout the US – many of whom voted for Trump. Installations like the one at the power plant near Dresden are appearing across the country, drawn by record-high cryptocurrency prices and cheap and abundant energy to power the computers that do the mining. There are at least 137 Bitcoin mines in the US across 21 states, and reports indicate there are many more planned. According to estimates by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), Bitcoin mining uses up to 2.3% of the nation's grid. The high energy use and its wider environmental impact is certainly causing some concern in Dresden. But it's the unmistakable hum that is the soundtrack for discontent in many places with Bitcoin mines - produced by the fans used to cool the computers, it can range from a mechanical whirr to a deafening din. \"We can hear a constant buzzing,\" says another Dresden resident, Lori Fishline. \"It's a constant, loud humming noise that you just can't ignore. It was never present before and has definitely affected the peaceful atmosphere of our bay.\" Such is Ms Campbell's annoyance with Trump's Bitcoin backing, her political allegiance to the Republicans is being tested. \"Right now I'm not real happy about that party,\" she says. The conflict in Seneca Lake is being played out nationwide, which could pose problems for a White House intent on pursuing a pro-cryptocurrency agenda. A little over 300 miles west of Dresden, a backlash in the US border town of Niagara Falls prompted the local Mayor Robert Restaino - a Democrat - to issue a moratorium on new mining activity in December 2021, and the following year noise limits of 40 to 50 decibels near residential areas were imposed. He said: \"The noise pollution of this industry is like nothing else.\" Locals described the sound as similar to that of a 747 jet, or as grating as having a toothache 24 hours a day, claiming that the noise drowned out the sound of the nearby waterfalls. And in Granbury, Texas, a 24ft-high sound barrier was erected in 2023 at a mining site after residents complained to public officials that the nonstop roar was keeping them awake and giving them migraines. All these Bitcoin operations opened before Trump's return to the White House. But the opposition they have generated suggests public officials in Republican-voting areas are likely to find themselves coming under continued pressure from local people who oppose further Bitcoin mining expansion. If this happens, could Trump's crypto dreams be derailed in his own backyard? Less than four years ago, Trump said Bitcoin \"just seems like a scam\". Yet those reservations have now gone: the Trump family has since started the crypto firm World Liberty Financial, and Trump launched his own cryptocurrency, $TRUMP – 220 of its top buyers were invited to a private gala dinner with the president on Thursday. Trump's sons Eric and Donald Jr are behind a crypto mining venture called American Bitcoin, which plans to trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange, and aims to build one of the world's largest and most efficient Bitcoin mining platforms, rooted in American soil. Bitcoin mining has boomed in the US partly because of a crackdown in China in 2021, which was due to concerns over its environmental damage. Alexander Neumueller, an expert at the University of Cambridge's Centre for Alternative Finance, says that although it's hard to trace every last mine, it's clear that the US is now the leading Bitcoin producer, mining about 40% of the world's supply. Dresden is in New York's Finger Lakes region – a rural area sliced through with deep glacial lakes, which attracts tourists drawn by its wineries, breweries and outdoor pursuits. In Yates County, home to Dresden and the Greenidge plant, around 60% of voters picked Trump last November. According to the owners of the mine, Greenidge Generation, anywhere from 40 to 120 Bitcoin a month are being produced at the plant, along with some energy that flows back to the grid. The company – which turned down requests for an interview – has argued that they converted a coal-burning operation into a relatively cleaner gas-fired power installation that complies with state environmental laws. But amid public concern, New York state and Greenidge are currently engaged in a protracted legal battle over the plant's future. With some of the strictest environmental laws in the country, New York officials are challenging whether the gas-fired plant is permitted under the regulations that allowed the old coal plant. Power generation – and Bitcoin mining – has been allowed to continue during appeal proceedings. Abi Buddington, who owns a house in Dresden and has been at the forefront of the fight against the crypto mine, says it has become a big issue locally. \"The climate changed, both environmentally as well as in our quiet little community,\" she says, recalling raised voices at contentious town hall meetings. Ms Buddington is trying to change minds in Dresden and, through her network, elsewhere around the country. \"There are some who are environmentally concerned, and who may be Republican-leaning,\" she says. \"What we've found nationally is even in red states, once elected officials are educated properly and know the harms, they are very opposed.\" But not all are convinced. \"They've been a good corporate neighbour,\" says Dresden's recently elected mayor, Brian Flynn, about the mine. \"I'm pro-business, whether it be Greenidge or local agriculture… I think it's important to have a mix of both industry and recreation.\" Legal battles like the one in Seneca Lake are bringing home the realities of an industry that at first glance might seem contained to banks of data servers, removed from the real world. Bitcoin \"miners\" – who are not actually extracting anything from the earth – verify transactions by solving extremely difficult cryptographic problems that require powerful computers. In return, they are rewarded with Bitcoin. As the price of Bitcoin has shot up to its current value of around $100,000 (£75,000), ever-increasing amounts of computing power have been needed to win crypto rewards, shutting out smaller miners in favour of large collectives and companies. As well as the hum, mining's energy use has environmental impacts. A Harvard study published in March in the peer-reviewed science journal Nature Communications found that Bitcoin mining exposes millions of Americans to harmful air pollution each year - and that 34 Bitcoin mines consumed a third more electricity than the city of LA. (There was some pushback from the crypto industry to the study, which was called The environmental burden of the United States' Bitcoin mining boom.) According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, mining globally uses approximately 0.7% of global electricity consumption. That has a knock-on effect on local energy prices, which is also provoking a backlash in some areas. In 2017, Bitcoin miners flooded into Plattsburgh, New York – a city of about 20,000 people a couple of hours to the north of Dresden – because of cheap hydroelectricity rates. \"We were getting Bitcoin applications from operators all around the world,\" says the city's mayor at the time, Colin Read. Yet they used so much power that electricity rates shot up. Within a year, some residents were paying up to 40% more during winter months, Read says. The following year, he and other local lawmakers passed rules against buildings blasting out hot air. \"Fortunately we put a stop to it,\" he says, noting that all but one Bitcoin mining operation left the city. Resistance to Bitcoin mines extends to places with the biggest Trump support. Cyndie Roberson was retired and unaware of the crypto industry until a Bitcoin mining operation moved to her small town in North Carolina in 2021. The locals banded together and managed to ban new Bitcoin developments in their area - but the existing one was allowed to stay and the bitterness of the fight made her decide to move south, to Gilmer County in Georgia. There, Ms Roberson has campaigned against crypto mining in a region that is solidly pro-Republican. In the county where she lives, she says that around 1,000 people came to a public meeting to oppose a mine, which then wasn't allowed to operate. Just north of Gilmer, the Fannin County Commission has enacted a ban on crypto mining, while a Georgian commission representing 18 primarily rural counties has published advice on how to restrict the development of Bitcoin mines. \"When you're in my backyard, when you're in my town, trying to wreck our property and our peace, people will tell you, it's a hard 'no',\" says Ms Roberson. Although 80% of local people backed Trump last November, that support doesn't appear to stop people opposing one of his key crypto goals. The Trump administration is not planning to do away with all regulations around crypto mining - but it is ready to actively help companies open power plants next to the mines. In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine in April, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said: \"We're going to make it so that if you want to mine Bitcoin, and you find the right place to do it, you can build your own power plant next to it,\" going on to argue that such projects would stop \"these stories about 'You're taking too much power and now the cost of operating my refrigerator is higher'.\" \"The next generation of miners in America will be able to control their destiny, control the cost of power, and I think that is going to turbocharge Bitcoin mining in America,\" Lutnick told the magazine. According to Zack Shapiro, head of policy at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, a US think tank that researches emerging monetary networks, that process has already begun. \"There are states that are passing laws specifically prohibiting municipalities from banning Bitcoin mines,\" he says. \"It's a mechanism by which mining companies can fight back.\" And the nature of Bitcoin mining means that, if it meets resistance, it can quickly move on to somewhere more favourable. When Colin Read tackled the mines in Plattsburgh, he saw how easily they could change location. \"This industry is really footloose,\" he said. \"When we told these companies they couldn't have more power without going through hoops, they packed up and went to a community where they didn't have such strict requirements.\" Local opposition is not Trump's only challenge. Could the sea, for example, be a better location for Bitcoin mining? Mr Shapiro believes that, with miners looking for the lowest cost, they could turn to leftover renewable energy that can't be used by other applications. \"Wind power in the ocean can't be used to power a city, but you can set up an offshore platform that captures offshore wind and tidal energy, and use that to mine Bitcoin – because there's not another buyer to use that energy, it's probably ultimately where Bitcoin mining operations move.\" It could also be that in the cryptocurrency race, Bitcoin might not be the best bet. Read - who is an energy economist - is sceptical about the staying power of energy-intensive Bitcoin because he believes other more efficient alternatives are going to emerge. With the White House egging on the industry, fights over Bitcoin mining will inevitably play out in smaller forums, in state and local governments and tiny places like Dresden. But one constant in the short history of Bitcoin has been volatility. It might be boom times now – yet a downturn in the price, shifts in energy sources and changing crypto needs could fundamentally reshape the Bitcoin mining landscape, no matter how much Trump wants to keep it in the US.

    "title": "Ship footage shared with BBC captures sound of Titan sub imploding",
    "article_text": "The moment that Oceangate's Titan submersible was lost has been revealed in footage recorded on the sub's support ship. Titan imploded about 90 minutes into a descent to see the wreck of the Titanic in June 2023, killing all five people on board. The passengers had paid Oceangate to see the ship, which lies 3,800m down. On board were Oceangate's CEO Stockton Rush, British explorer Hamish Harding, veteran French diver Paul Henri Nargeolet, the British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman. The BBC has had unprecedented access to the US Coast Guard's (USCG) investigation for a documentary, Implosion: The Titanic Sub Disaster. The footage was recently obtained by the USCG and shows Wendy Rush, the wife of Mr Rush, hearing the sound of the implosion while watching on from the sub's support ship and asking: \"What was that bang?\" The video has been presented as evidence to the USCG Marine Board of Investigation, which has spent the last two years looking into the sub's catastrophic failure. The documentary also reveals the carbon fibre used to build the submersible started to break apart a year before the fatal dive. Titan's support ship was with the sub while it was diving in the Atlantic Ocean. The video shows Mrs Rush, who was a director of Oceangate with her husband, sitting in front of a computer that was used to send and receive text messages from Titan. When the sub reaches a depth of about 3,300m, a noise that sounds like a door slamming is heard. Mrs Rush is seen to pause then look up and ask other Oceangate crew members what the noise was. Within moments she then receives a text message from the sub saying it had dropped two weights, which seems to have led her to mistakenly think the dive was proceeding as expected. The USCG says the noise was in fact the sound of Titan imploding. However, the text message, which must have been sent just before the sub failed, took longer to reach the ship than the sound of the implosion. All five people on board Titan died instantly. Prior to the fatal dive, warnings had been raised by deep sea experts and some former Oceangate employees about Titan's design. One described it asan \"abomination\" and said the disaster was \"inevitable\". Titan had never undergone an independent safety assessment, known as certification, and a key concern was that its hull - the main body of the sub where the passengers sat - was made of layers of carbon fibre mixed with resin. The USCG says it has now identified the moment the hull started to fail. Carbon fibre is a highly unusual material for a deep sea submersible because it is unreliable under pressure. A known problem is that the layers of carbon fibre can separate, a process called delamination. The USCG believes that the carbon fibre layers of the hull started to break apart during a dive to the Titanic, which took place a year before the disaster - the 80th dive that Titan had made. Passengers on board reported hearing a loud bang as the sub made its way back to the surface. They said that at the time Mr Rush said that this noise was the sub shifting in its frame. But the USCG says the data collected from sensors fitted to Titan shows that the bang was caused by delamination. \"Delamination at dive 80 was the beginning of the end,\" said Lieutenant Commander Katie Williams from USCG. \"And everyone that stepped onboard the Titan after dive 80 was risking their life.\" Titan took passengers on three more dives in the summer of 2022 - two to the Titanic and one to a nearby reef, before it failed on its next deep dive, in June 2023. Businessman Oisin Fanning was onboard Titan for the last two dives before the disaster. \"If you're asking a simple question: 'Would I go again knowing what I know now?' - the answer is no,\" he told BBC News. \"A lot of people would not have gone. Very intelligent people who lost their lives, who, had they had all the facts, would not have made that journey.\" Deep sea explorer Victor Vescovo said he had grave misgivings about Titan and that he had told people that diving in the sub was like playing Russian roulette. \"I myself warned people away from getting into that submersible. I specifically told them that it was simply a matter of time before it failed catastrophically. I told Stockton Rush himself that I believed that.\" After the sub imploded, its mangled wreckage was discovered scattered across the sea floor of the Atlantic. The USCG has described the process of sifting through the recovered debris - and said clothing from Mr Rush had been found, as well as business cards and stickers of the Titanic. Later this year, the US Coast Guard will publish a final report of the findings from its investigation, which aims to establish what went wrong and prevent a disaster like this from ever happening again. Speaking to the BBC's documentary team, Christine Dawood, who lost her husband Shahzada and son Suleman in the disaster, said it had changed her forever. \"I don't think that anybody who goes through loss and such a trauma can ever be the same,\" she said. The ripples from the Oceangate disaster are likely to continue for years - some private lawsuits have already been filed and criminal prosecutions may follow. Oceangate told the BBC: \"We again offer our deepest condolences to the families of those who died on June 18, 2023, and to all those impacted by the tragic accident. \"Since the tragedy occurred, Oceangate permanently wound down its operations and focused its resources on fully cooperating with the investigations. It would be inappropriate to respond further while we await the agencies' reports.\" You can watch Implosion: The Titanic Sub Disaster on 9pm on Tuesday 27 May on BBC Two. It will also be available on the BBC iPlayer. The violin was used to play hymn Nearer My God To Thee as the ship sank in the Oscar-winning film. Colonel Archibald Gracie's letter from onboard the ill-fated ocean liner has been described as \"prophetic\". Colonel Gracie wrote he would wait until the ship's voyage ended before he would \"pass judgement\". The timepiece was found among the belongings of Danish passenger who died in the 1912 disaster. The violin played as Titanic sank in the Hollywood film could fetch £60k when it is auctioned in Wiltshire.",

    "title": "Olly Murs pulls plug on Glasgow show in stage walk-off",
    "article_text": "Olly Murs has pulled the plug on his show in Glasgow, after walking off stage because he was struggling with his voice. The singer left the 14,000-capacity Ovo Hydro venue after about 20 minutes on Thursday night, just six songs into his set. In a video on social media after the concert, Murs offered fans an apology \"from the bottom of my heart\". The 40-year-old said he was seeing a doctor before arena gigs in Manchester, Birmingham and London this weekend. In the video posted on Instagram, an emotional Murs said: \"Glasgow, I'm so sorry that I had to walk off after six songs and cancel the show. \"Most of the time as singers, you can get through it if your voice is not 100%. \"But I walked out tonight thinking my voice is great, I maybe felt a little bit run down, but I didn't think I couldn't do the show or I wouldn't have come out otherwise.\" Murs said he hoped he would be fit to play his weekend shows and would update fans after medical checks. He added: \"As you can probably hear from my voice it just sounded rubbish. \"And it's unfair for you guys who spent all that money to come and see me, you deserve the best show, and me being at my best. \"Hopefully I can recover from this.\" Murs said it was the first time he had walked off during a show in 15 years of playing concerts. The singer, from Essex, rose to fame on the X Factor and went to have hits with tracks like Troublemaker, Dance With Me Tonight and Up.",

    "title": "Energy price change set to cut bills by over £100 a year",
    "article_text": "Energy regulator Ofgem is shortly expected to announce a fall in domestic gas and electricity prices for millions of households from July - the first drop for a year. The regulator's price cap, which is set every three months, affects the amount paid for energy by 22 million households in England, Scotland and Wales. Analysts have forecast a fall of more than £100 in the annual bill for a home using a typical amount of gas and electricity. Charities say cheaper bills would be welcome but many people still struggle to pay, and millions of customers collectively owe about £4bn to suppliers. Ofgem will announce the price cap for July to the end of September at 07:00 BST. The price cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Although the cap changes every three months, the regulator illustrates the effect of this with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. This typical household is assumed to use 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. Analysts at the energy consultancy Cornwall Insight have forecast a drop in the annual bill of £129, a fall of nearly 7%. The fall would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost £1,720, down from the current level of £1,849. It would also more than reverse the £111 increase in a typical bill under the current price cap, which came into force at the start of April. Customers can also estimate their own potential saving by knocking 7% off their monthly direct debit. However, prices would still be higher than a year earlier, and significantly above levels seen at the start of the decade. High bills in recent years have also led to ballooning levels of customer debt to suppliers, with just under £4bn owed. \"The cost of living is still incredibly high, and many people, especially those who are vulnerable or have low incomes, are dealing with energy debt built up over the last few years of sky-high bills,\" said Matthew Cole, chief executive of the Fuel Bank Foundation, a fuel poverty charity. \"A slight drop in prices won't fix that. People are still being forced to make tough choices between topping up the meter or putting food on the table.\" The price cap announcement comes just two days after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer signalleda partial U-turn on cuts to winter fuel payments. More than 10 million pensioners lost out on the payments, worth up to £300, when the top-up became means-tested last year. However, Sir Keir told the Commons on Wednesday that the government wanted \"more pensioners\" to be eligible again. It remains unclear how many will regain their entitlement for the payments, how that will be achieved, or when the changes will take effect. A volunteer at the service says the food bank currently helps about 100 people every week. The firm behind plans for the large energy storage site says safety is \"paramount\". Lyons welcomed the government's realisation that an \"error\" was made. Inflation has risen by more than expected as water, energy and food bills grew - how are ordinary people making their income stretch? Bills, food prices, and service costs are all rising - but there is some good news",

    "title": "Labubu fan fury after dolls pulled from stores",
    "article_text": "Fans of viral Labubu dolls have reacted angrily online after its maker pulled the toys from all UK stores following reports of customers fighting over them. Pop Mart, which makes the monster bag charms, told the BBC it had paused selling them in all 16 of its shops until June to \"prevent any potential safety issues\". Labubu fan Victoria Calvert said she witnessed chaos in the Stratford store in London. \"It was just getting ridiculous to be in that situation where people were fighting and shouting and you felt scared.\" The soft toys became a TikTok trend after being worn by celebrities like Rihanna and Dua Lipa. Now some retail experts are warning the stop on stock will only heighten demand. Labubu is a quirky monster character created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, and popularised through a collaboration with toy store Pop Mart. Since gaining celebrity status they've gone viral as a fashion accessory. In the UK, prices can range from £13.50 to £50, with rare editions going for hundreds of pounds on resale sites such as Vinted and eBay. Pop Mart said it was working on a fairer system for when the toys return to its shelves. But fans on social media were not happy at the decision to pull the dolls. \"It's your fault for drip feeding stock to us that's caused this hype,\" one commented on Pop Mart's Instagram post. Others vented their anger at resellers. \"Buyers are re-selling them for £100 for one Labubu, which is unacceptable. How come they get to buy and other people can't?!\" one said. \"Sooo upset that resellers ruin everything,\" replied another. Victoria said when she arrived at the store she met other customers who had been outside since 03:00 BST and others that had camped overnight. \"When I got there there were big crowds of people hovering around the shop and there was this really negative vibe,\" she said. \"People were shouting, basically saying there were no more Labubus left. I even witnessed a fight between a worker and a customer.\" She said she left after feeling unsafe. \"It was a pretty bad experience, it was really scary,\" she said. The store told the BBC: \"Although no Pop Mart employees have been injured, we've chosen to act early and prevent any potential safety issues from occurring.\" Victoria said \"it's probably for the best\" that Pop Mart paused in-store sales. She believes some people at the front of the queue were resellers because \"as soon as they got their ticket, apparently they were selling it for £150 and the ticket allowed you to get a Labubu.\" Jaydee, a marketing executive who posts Labubu unboxing videos on TikTok, blames resellers for ruining the fun of the Labubu trend. \"I've lived in London my whole life and there is a resale crowd who do this,\" she told the BBC. \"It's really unfortunate but for the real fans this is great news and the right decision,\" she said. \"Now I can go into Pop Mart without having to queue.\" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Pop Mart's restricting stock and selling the dolls in blind boxes had led to the fan frenzy. \"But the big crowds building on stock drop days have clearly become a costly headache to manage,\" she said. \"Out-of-control crowds could affect ultimately the brand's playful and fun appeal which is likely to be why sales have been paused,\" she said. She warned the suspension would probably lead to demand building up and more attempts to buy the dolls online - but they sell out within seconds. \"It could also push more fans to resale sites, but counterfeit Labubus are being sold, so there is a risk customers could be duped into buying fakes.'' Pop Mart told the BBC there had been large queues with some fans arriving the night before and said this was \"not the kind of customer experience it aimed to offer\". \"Labubu will return to physical stores in June, and we are currently working on a new release mechanism that is better structured and more equitable for everyone involved.\" The collection of toys curated by pupils in west Belfast has been picked up by the Ulster Museum. The firms join a growing list of big businesses cautioning about the impact of Trump's import taxes. Bill Houghton, 79, makes wooden toys for a charity to hand out to families in need. The toy, sold by Chinese company Pop Mart, has become the must-have fashion accessory. Neil Walker will be recreating Stoke-on-Trent City Council's 100th anniversary logo in Lego bricks.",

    "title": "'I'm hardly Bob Dylan': Charli XCX wins songwriter of the year",
    "article_text": "A self-deprecating Charli XCX downplayed her talents as a songwriter, as she was named songwriter of the year at the Ivor Novello Awards. Accepting the award in London, the star illustrated her \"songwriting genius\" by quoting the lyrics to her 2024 song Club Classics: \"I wanna dance to me, me, me / When I go to the club, club, club.\" \"I'm sure you all agree, I am hardly Bob Dylan,\" she joked to an audience that included Bruce Springsteen and Robbie Williams, \"but one thing I certainly do is commit to the bit\". The ceremony also saw awards for rising stars Lola Young and Myles Smith, while U2 became the first Irish band to win the fellowship of the Ivor Novello songwriting academy. The award recognised almost 50 years of hits, including With Or Without You, Sunday Bloody Sunday, Even Better Than The Real Thing, I Will Follow, Vertigo and One. Speaking on stage, the band's frontman, Bono, paid tribute to the power of music. \"Songs can be arrows through time if they come from the right place,\" he said. \"They can fly higher and farther, last longer, hit harder. They can pierce the hardest armour of the human heart. \"I don't know if they can change the world, but they changed us.\" Each of the band's members gave their own acceptance speech, with drummer Larry Mullen, Jr, recalling the group's first rejection letter, from the head of CBS Records, Muff Winwood. \"He heard the song and offered us a record deal, but only if the band fired the drummer,\" he said. \"I humbly concede that on every musical break, I may have counted to three instead of four - but from where I'm standing right now having trouble counting makes some of us look like musical geniuses.\" The Killers won the special international prize, with Bruce Springsteen handing over the trophy to frontman Brandon Flowers. The singer joked that \"the only downside\" of the award was that \"it feels one giant step away from fulfilling my original dream of becoming the most sought-after valet on the Las Vegas strip\". Backstage, Flowers was somewhat overwhelmed by Springsteen's presence. \"That was really cool,\" he told BBC News. \"He went out of his way to come here. I love him. Lola Young won the rising star award, recognising the success of her breakthrough single, Messy. \"This is such a big moment for the kid in my bedroom that was 10 years old, writing songs on her guitar,\" the 24-year-old musician told the BBC. \"To be here now is such an honor, and such a gives me such a warm feeling.\" Young also revealed she'd recently finished her next album, and \"shot 12 music videos in one day\" to accompany her new songs. Myles Smith's Stargazing was named the most-played song on UK radio last year. \"The first time I heard it on the radio was actually in New York,\" he said. \"I remember it so specifically. I was in an Uber and the song came on, and I told the driver, 'This is me' and he could not care less. \"It was the best way to be humbled, and it really kept me grounded from year one.\" Charli XCX was recognised for her ground-breaking Brat album, which she described as \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\". But it's a carefully crafted and nuanced record, where hedonism gives way to vulnerability, as she describes the doubts she has over friendships, motherhood and commercial success. Marketed with laser-focused zeal, the album became the soundtrack to summer 2024, with its in-your-face \"Brat green\" cover art quickly becoming a meme. On stage, Charli explained that the music could only ever be a starting point. \"'I've never particularly believed the idea that everything starts from a great song,\" she said. \"In my head, a great song alone has never actually been enough to captivate an audience. \"Instead, a song with a distinct identity coupled with a point of view... and above all, conviction is what can catapult a songwriter from being technically good to globally renowned.\" Robbie Williams' won the icon award, in recognition of his 34-year career - from boyband hits like Could It Be Magic and Back For Good with Take That, to his record-breaking solo work on songs including Angels, Rock DJ, Feel and Come Undone. Coming undone might also an apt description of his reaction to the award. \"When momentous things like this happen, it's just a hodge-podge of things coming at you from the universe,\" he said backstage. \"It's self-doubt and self-hatred mixed with ego and delusion and audacity. \"So it's very difficult to put your finger on what it feels like in the moment, other than you're supposed to say, 'I'm very grateful'. And I am.\" 2000s indie heroes Bloc Party won the outstanding song collection prize, while Berwyn's fierce and personal debut Who Am I, was named best album. Best contemporary song was won by Sans Soucis for Circumnavigating Georgia, while best song musically and lyrically was won by Orla Gartland for Mine, beating the likes of Lola Young, Raye and Fontaines DC. Mine is a quiet but hopeful ballad about overcoming a traumatic experience that Orla said \"really affected my relationship with intimacy\". Accepting the prize, the Irish singer said she was proud to be an independent artist, because \"I'm not sure what a boardroom of old guys would have known what to do with this song about bodily autonomy and reclaiming it\". Taking a similar approach was pop artist Self Esteem, who was given the visionary award. She used her speech to implore the music industry to do more to protect young women from misogyny and online abuse. \"People are foaming at the mouth to ridicule you,\" she said. \"People hate women, and sometimes [those comments] get in and stay there.\" But she also took the opportunity to thank her mum and dad, Janet and Andy, who'd finally seen her win an award, \"after coming down to see me lose the Mercury [Prize] twice\". \"I'm so sorry about how much I swear and how many of my songs are about shagging,\" she added.

    "title": "On the South African road incorrectly identified as a 'burial site' by Trump",
    "article_text": "The P39-1 is an anonymous stretch of thinly tarred highway connecting the small towns of Newcastle and Normandein in South Africa, a four-hour drive from Johannesburg. This week the single carriageway road, which runs mainly along the edge of farms nestled in the remote hills of the country's KwaZulu-Natal province, has found itself unexpectedly the subject of global attention. On Wednesday many South Africans were among those watching live around the world as US President Donald Trump ambushed his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa with a video making the case that white people were being persecuted. He had previously said that a \"genocide\" was taking place. The most striking scene in the video was an aerial shot of thousands of white crosses by the side of the road - a \"burial site\" President Trump repeatedly said, of more than a thousand Afrikaners murdered in recent years. The president did not mention where the road was although the film was quickly linked to Normandein. But the people who live nearby know better than anyone that his claim is not true. The BBC visited the area on Thursday, the day after the Oval Office showdown, to find that the P39-1's crosses have long since disappeared. There is no burial site, and the road looks like any other. A new grain mill has been built along one stretch where the crosses once briefly stood. What we found was a community shocked to find itself under the spotlight, and a truth about the crosses that reveals much about the delicate balance of race relations in South Africa. Roland Collyer is a man who understands both. A farmer from South Africa's Afrikaner community, it was the murder of his aunt and uncle Glen and Vida Rafferty, bludgeoned to death in their home five years ago, which led to the erection of the crosses. Their deaths at their farm, by attackers who stole valuables from their home, led to a public outcry by the farming community, and the temporary planting of the crosses by fellow Afrikaners keen to highlight their murders among those of other farmers who have been killed across South Africa. \"So the video that you guys have been seeing,\" he tells me as we stand together by the roadside, \"happened along this section of the road.\" Pointing down the hill, towards a village where many black families live in mud huts, he explains: \"There were crosses planted on both sides of the road, representing lives that have been taken on farms, farm murders. All the way from the bridge down below, up to where we're standing at the moment. \"The crosses were symbolic, to what was happening in the country.\" One of the Raffertys' neighbours, businessman Rob Hoatson, told the BBC how he organised the crosses to capture public attention, such was the shock over the couple's deaths. \"It's not a burial site,\" he explained, saying Trump was prone to \"exaggeration\", adding though that he did not mind the image of the crosses being used. \"It was a memorial. It was not a permanent memorial that was erected. It was a temporary memorial.\" Mr Collyer continues to farm in the area but says the Raffertys' two sons left after their parents' murders. The younger, he explains, has moved to Australia while the elder has sold up and left farming to relocate to the city. Many people remain scared for their future in South Africa, which has one of the highest murder rates in the world. In 2022, two local men Doctor Fikane Ngwenya and Sibongiseni Madondo were convicted for the murders of the Raffertys, as well as robbery, and sentenced to life and 21 years imprisonment respectively. For many in the local community it was a rare act of justice, with thousands of murders remaining unsolved across a country which President Ramaphosa told President Trump has yet to get a grip of its soaring crime rate. The Raffertys' murders sparked a period of heightened racial tension in the area. South Africa's police minister was forced to visit to try to bring calm, with protests from Afrikaners mirrored by claims from some members of the local black community of mistreatment by white farmers. Amid it all, Mr Collyer tells me that despite the misleading use of the video of his family's memorial, he is pleased that President Trump is highlighting attacks on white farmers. \"The whole procession was to raise international media coverage of the whole thing,\" he reflects. \"And for them to understand what we're actually going through and the lives that we have to live here at the moment in South Africa. \"A person has to go into a house before dark, you're living behind electric fences. That's the life we're living at the moment and you don't want to live a life like that.\" His fears would chime with many, of all races, in a country which suffered more than 26,000 murders last year. The vast majority of victims are black, according to security experts. President Trump has made an offer of asylum for all Afrikaners, with a first group of 49 arriving in Washington earlier this month. But Mr Collyer tells me he will stay in Normandein and has no intention of leaving South Africa. \"It's not easy just for me to leave what my father, what my grandfather, what my great-grandfather worked for, and how hard they worked, to be able to gather what I can contribute to towards today,\" he says. \"That's the difficult thing, just packing up after many generations and trying to leave the country. \"Unfortunately white Afrikaners bear the brunt of being a 'boer' (farmer) in South Africa... but at this stage I definitely would not think of going, I still love this country too much.\" And as we part ways, Mr Collyer offers a note of optimism about the future. \"I think if we can just join hands, and I think there's more than enough people in this country - black and white - who are willing to join hands and to try to make this country a success.\" There are many others in the local community for whom farming goes back generations. Along the road, towards Normandein town, we meet Bethuel Mabaso. The 63-year-old grew up in the area and tells us he was surprised to learn that his community had made international news - even more so that it was being cited by the US president as \"evidence\" of the targeting of white farmers. \"Nothing like that is happening here,\" he says in his native Zulu language. \"We were shocked as a community when the murders happened and sad for that family. \"I've lived here since I was a little boy and this is a peaceful area. Nothing like that has happened here since.\" In the years since the Raffertys died there have been reports of allegations from some black farm dwellers that local police had failed to attend to cases involving black people with the same urgency as they did the deaths of the couple. I ask another local farm worker, 40-year-old Mbongiseni Shibe, what relations were like now between farmers and their mostly black staff. \"We manage whatever issues come up through discussions, if that doesn't work we ask the police to step in,\" he says.  \"It's usually incidents like our livestock going into their fields and the police help us retrieve it and vice versa.\" South Africa's violent past of racial segregation is not lost on Mr Shibe and how delicate racial matters can be here. \"We come from a difficult past in this country with white people, I remember those times of abuse even as a young boy especially on the farms here,\" he tells me. \"But we've let it go, we don't use that to punish anyone.\" Additional reporting by Ed Habershon Go toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.

    "title": "What we know about Israeli embassy staff shooting",
    "article_text": "A young couple who worked for the Israeli Embassy have been shot dead outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC. Police say the victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were killed by a man who shouted \"free, free Palestine\" while he was arrested. Elias Rodriguez has been charged with first-degree murder. Here's what you need to know about the shooting. At 21:08 local time on Wednesday, police received calls about a shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in downtown Washington DC. A man and a woman were found unconscious and not breathing at the scene, and later died. The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) said the couple had been leaving an event at the museum which is in an area with tourist sites, museums and government buildings. Police allege the shooting was committed by Elias Rodriguez, 31, of Chicago. He had been seen pacing up and down outside the museum before using a handgun to open fire on a group of four people, the MPD said. The suspect then went inside the museum, where he was detained. He repeatedly shouted \"free Palestine\" while being arrested, police said. Some in the museum had initially thought hewas a distressed bystanderwhen he burst in. One witness, Yoni Kalin, said people inside had been \"calming him down, giving him water, taking care of him\". \"Little did we know he was somebody that executed people in cold blood,\" he said. The MPD and the FBI are investigating the attack as an act of terrorism and a hate crime. Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, 26, had both worked at the Israeli embassy in Washington DC. Mr Lischinsky had planned to propose to Miss Milgrim in Jerusalem next week, Israel's ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, said on Thursday. Yaron Lischinsky, a joint German-Israeli national, had worked as a research assistant at the embassy, according to his LinkedIn profile. Born in Germany, he had moved to Israel as a teenager before relocating to Washington, his friend Ronen Shoval said. He was a \"devout Christian\" with \"good character\", Mr Shoval told the BBC. He had also previously served in the Israeli military, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Ron Prosor, said. Sarah Lynn Milgrim, an American from Kansas, worked for the Israeli embassy's public diplomacy department, according to her LinkedIn page. Her father, Robert, told the BBC's US partner CBS News that his daughter \"loved Israel\" and \"loved everybody that lived in the Middle East\". \"She had a lot of close Palestinian friends, as well as many Israeli friends,\" he said. KU Hillel, a Jewish student organisation at the University of Kansas, said Miss Milgrim was a \"beloved alum\" with a \"bright spirit\". The Israeli embassy said its staff were \"heartbroken and devastated\" by the deaths. Elias Rodriguez has been charged with two counts of first degree murder in relation to the shooting. He has also been charged with murder of foreign officials, causing death with a firearm, and discharging a firearm in a crime of violence. According to an affidavit, the suspect flew from Chicago on Tuesday and declared a gun legally bought in Illinois in his checked luggage. Authorities say the investigation is ongoing, and more charges could be brought against him as it develops. Interim DC attorney Jeanine Pirro said it was too early to say whether prosecutors will seek the death penalty, but that this was a \"death penalty eligible case\". The suspect is being held in detention and will appear in court for a preliminary hearing on 18 June, Pirro added. He is believed to have acted alone, said US Attorney General Pam Bondi. Earlier on Thursday, the FBI searched a Chicago property linked to the suspect. Outside the apartment, neighbour John Wayne Fry told reporters that he had lived in the same apartment building as the suspect for around a year. He said that the suspect displayed a photo outside his flat of a Palestinian-American child who was stabbed to death outside Chicago in 2023. The killing caused international headlines. The man who killed six-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi was convicted of hate crime charges earlier this month. Officials say he was motivated by hatred for Islam and the conflict in Gaza. It is unclear whether the suspect has had any direct contact with the boy's family. Fry said that he hadn't talked with the suspect about politics, but said \"If I had, I would have talked him out of it.\" The suspect had been working at the American Osteopathic Information Association since 2024, according to online records examined by BBC Verify. Social media accounts belonging to him indicate that he was heavily involved in the pro-Palestinian protest movement. An online story indicated that he was associated with a fringe communist group, The Party for Socialism and Liberation, in 2017, and had been interviewed as a member of the group. In a post on X, the party said they \"have nothing to do with this shooting and do not support it\" and have had no contact with the suspect for seven years. Police said they had no prior interactions with the suspect and had not seen anything in his background \"that would have placed him on our radar\". The event at the Capital Jewish Museum had been billed as a networking opportunity to bring Jewish young professionals and the diplomatic community together. The organiser, American Jewish Committee, said it was open to those in the DC diplomatic community. The event's theme was advertised as \"turning pain into purpose\". The event description said it invited humanitarian aid organisers responding to crises in the Middle East, including Gaza. The location was only shared with those who signed up to attend. President Donald Trump has condemned the attack and called it antisemitic. Posting on his social media platform Truth Social, he said: \"These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, now! \"Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims. \"So sad that such things as this can happen!  God bless you all!\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was \"outraged by the horrifying antisemitic murder\" of the victims. His office said he had spoken to both victims' parents. \"My heart grieves for the families of the young beloveds, whose lives were cut short in a moment by an abhorrent antisemitic murderer,\" he said, adding he had directed Israeli embassies around the world to increase security. He and Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar also said the deaths were caused by \"anti-Israeli incitement\" which they said was being carried out by European leaders. Earlier this week, the leaders of the UK, France and Canada signed a strongly worded joint lettercondemning Israel's actions in Gaza. In a video address, Netanyahu linked Wednesday's killings in Washington to Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. \"As he was taken away, he chanted, 'Free Palestine!' This is exactly the same chant we heard on October 7th,\" Netanyahu said. He accused Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney of \"emboldening Hamas to continue fighting forever\" by calling for Israel to end its war in Gaza. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 53,475 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 3,340 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry.

    "article_text": "Walk into any Starbucks in South Korea right now, and there are some names you definitely won't be hearing. Six to be exact - and they happen to be the names of the candidates running in the upcoming presidential race. That's because Starbucks has temporarily blocked customers who are ordering drinks from using these names, which would be called out by baristas. The company said it needed to \"maintain political neutrality during election season\", adding that this would be lifted after the election on 3 June. South Korean businesses and celebrities usually strive to be seen as neutral. But it has become more crucial in recent months, as political turmoil triggered by   former president Yoon Suk Yeol left the country more divided than ever. Now, as South Korea gears up to pick its new president following Yoon's impeachment, even the most mundane things can become politicised - a lesson Starbucks has learnt the hard way. In recent months, it has seen an increasing number of customers ordering drinks through their app and keying in phrases such as \"arrest Yoon Suk Yeol\" or \"[opposition leader] Lee Jae-myung is a spy\" as their nicknames. Starbucks baristas had little choice but to yell out these names once the drinks were ready for collection. \"Our goal is to make sure every customer has a great experience in our coffeehouses,\" Starbucks said in a statement about its new move to ban the six presidential candidates' names. \"To help with that, we sometimes block certain phrases that could be misunderstood by our employees or customers — like names of political candidates with messages of support or opposition during election season to maintain neutrality.\" But this marks the first time it has banned the names of all the candidates running in an election. Besides Lee, the other names are Kim Moon-soo, Lee Jun-seok, Kwon Young-kook, Hwang Kyo-ahn and Song Jin-ho. Some think the coffee giant is taking things a bit too far. \"I think people are being too sensitive. What if your real name is the same as a candidate's?\" said 33-year-old Jang Hye-mi. Ji Seok-bin, a 27-year-old who is a regular at Starbucks, said he thought the rule was \"too trivial\", though he said he understood the logic behind it given the country's heightened political tensions. \"After [Yoon's impeachment] I don't really talk about politics anymore. It feels like the ideological divide has grown so much that conversations often turn into arguments.\" Starbucks is not alone. The country's biggest search engine, Naver, has disabled autocomplete and related search suggestions for candidates, as it usually does  during election season. A search on Google for Lee, who is widely tipped to win the election, yields phrases like \"Lee Jae-myung trial\" - a reference to the fact that he is currently embroiled in several criminal trials. A search for the country's conservative presidential candidate Kim Moon-soo brings up a related suggestion for \"conversion\", as he is widely seen to have \"converted\" from being a fervent labour activist to a conservative politician. Naver said it decided to do this to \"provide more accurate and fair information during the election campaign\". Celebrities and public figures are also being extra careful, as they are held to high standards of political impartiality. Even the clothes they wear during election time would be highly scrutinised. Wearing colours like blue and red - which represent the country's liberal Democratic Party (DP) and conservative People's Power Party (PPP) respectively - has in the past been enough to trigger online backlash. Sometimes, even a baseball cap or necktie alone is enough to spark accusations of partisan support. During the last presidential election in 2022, Kim Hee-chul of K-pop group Super Junior was accused of being a PPP supporter when he was spotted wearing red slippers and a pink mask. Last year, Shinji, lead vocalist of the popular trio Koyote, posted a black and white workout photo on Instagram a day before the general election, with the caption that she \"made the photo black and white... [after] seeing the colour of my sweatpants.\" \"Funny and sad at the same time,\" she added. Some celebrities go even further, deliberately wearing a mix of red and blue. One makeup artist with over a decade of experience working with K-pop stars and actors told the BBC that during elections, styling teams steer clear of politically symbolic colours. \"We usually stick to neutral tones like black, white, or grey,\" said the make-up artist, who declined to be named. Celebrities even have to be careful when striking a pose, she added. Flashing the peace sign for a photo? That could be read as the number two - and thus an endorsement of a political candidate. In South Korea, election candidates are each assigned a number. Dr Cho Jin-man, of Duksung Women's University, says it is \"important to be able to talk about different things without crossing the line, and to be able to recognise and understand differences\". But with so much division in the country, he adds that many are choosing to \"remain silent to remain politically neutral\". The move to increase staff numbers comes as the coffee shop giant continues to see sales fall. The drive-through proposals were turned down over fears over the impact on Kelso town centre. A jury found Starbucks responsible for the incident, which caused a Postmates driver third-degree burns to his genital area. It is also simplifying the menu, including dropping the Royal English Breakfast Latte in the US. Residents said they were worried about a loss of privacy and noise, but the plans were approved.",

    "title": "Putting up asylum seekers in Hull's Royal Hotel still divides the city",
    "article_text": "Take the train to Hull, walk out of the station, and it takes just seconds to arrive at the Royal Hotel. It once hosted royalty - but for the past five years it's been home to hundreds of asylum seekers in the city. From being a place of sanctuary, it became the frontline of last summer's riots, when windows of the hotel were smashed and asylum seekers hid inside. Outside the Royal, there was anger and rage. The use of hotels to house people arriving on smalls boats from France represents one of the most divisive issues in Britain today. People have been telling the BBC what the hotel means to them. Last July, Anei was living inside the Royal Hotel as riots took hold outside. He says he was terrified. \"Everyone was scared,\" he adds. He tells us that he and others had to stay inside the hotel fearing that if they went outside \"we die\". Anei is 27 and arrived in the UK on a small boat three years ago. He says his parents died in South Sudan and that he was given a choice to join a militia and fight, or be killed. He decided to flee. He tells us he was beaten up in Hull and abused on the day of the riots. \"They don't like the asylum seekers, they hit me in the back and I fell down,\" he says. He tells us one person shouted \"you've come here and taken our jobs\". Why, I ask, does he think some people were angry with him? He says he doesn't know and that nobody has spoken to him about the realities of his life inside the Royal Hotel. He says he has taken no job. But Anei has now been given the right to remain in the UK, he says he wants to work and pay back the UK for the help he's already received. Home Office figures released on Thursdaytell one story - that the number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels has fallen. But the number is still higher than when Labour came into power last year. There were 32,345 asylum seekers living in taxpayer-funded hotels in March 2025, the figures show. But there's also another story. Despite the repeated promises to end asylum hotel accommodation, it remains a defining issue for many people and in many places. Not far from the Royal Hotel, we met Gaynor, who is whizzing around on her mobility scooter, wearing large black sunglasses. She's in her 70s now, but says she remembers the good times inside the Royal like it was yesterday. \"The hotel was so beautiful,\" she says. \"We used to go in there for drinks and cocktails.\" Gaynor says it's a shame it has now been taken over and used as accommodation for asylum seekers. \"I do feel sorry for them,\" she says, \"I know their countries are at war, but there's other countries they have to go to before they get to England - I don't think it's fair, I don't think it's fair at all.\" It's an issue that's changed the way she votes. \"Yes, I voted for Reform,\" she says. \"I don't mind telling you that, something needs to be done.\" Gaynor isn't alone in feeling like this, but there are other voices here too. One man who who lives within sight of the hotel, says it is important that asylum seekers are given accommodation while they are processed. Outside the hotel, at a taxi rank in sight of the station, Shane was keen to chat. He works here a lot and showed us the video he filmed earlier this year. He witnessed an asylum seeker trying to kick out the windows of a room in the hotel, while holding what appeared to be a knife. In the footage you can hear another taxi driver ask: \"Why isn't anyone stopping him?\" At the end of the footage Shane says: \"So this is what asylum seekers think of a four-star hotel.\" We don't know what happened to the person inside the hotel, but for Shane the video sums up his feelings of being powerless in his home city. \"It's a case of shut up and put up, because you can't do anything about it,\" he says. \"I know one or two armed forces lads who sleep rough on the streets, we're taking in the wrong people, it's so wrong.\" About a mile or so out of the city we visited Danny Taylor, he set up Adapt Resettlement to provide emergency food and accommodation to people struggling in Hull. He houses around two dozen people, some have been long-term homeless. \"It's unfair,\" says Danny, \"we get people through this door who have been homeless for 12 months, but people who come here they get a hotel, they get three meals a day, ours have food parcels - it's impossible to give them three meals a day.\" Inside Adapt Resettlement, we met Robbie, he'd been long-term homeless and faced drug dependency. He's extremely vulnerable but happily showing off his food  parcel of tinned vegetables and rice pudding. \"I'm supposed to be on benefits and a 'free ride',\" he says, using his hands to make quotation marks. \"But the free ride isn't all that. I wish I was an asylum seeker, I'd have free accommodation.\" Those same questions of fairness are also being asked inside Welcome House, a charity that supports asylum seekers in the city. Its founder, Bashir Siraj - himself a refugee from Pakistan who arrived in the UK 20 years ago - says they had more than 20,000 visitors last year. He tells us he has support from many people in the city and the local council but is left dismayed when asylum seekers are blamed for living in hotels. \"Why are they attacking us? Why aren't they blaming the government, the policies?\" he asks. The Home Office told us the Labour government inherited an asylum system under unprecedented strain, and says it is beginning to restore order. In a statement it said: \"We will be able to end the use of asylum hotels over time and reduce the overall costs to the taxpayer of asylum accommodation. \"There are now fewer hotels open than there were before the election, with more due to close by the end of May.\" BBC Verify examines key areas which the government has promised to make improvements Dark kitchens are some of the places being targeted by immigration officers to find illegal workers. New figures show a fall in net migration. But still, Labour will struggle to soothe public concern, writes our senior correspondent Allan Little. Norfolk MP Rupert Lowe asks Sir Keir Starmer if her jail term is an \"efficient\" use of prison. The project was set up to help men or women who are originally from Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine.",

Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, who performs under the name Mo Chara, was pictured outside the 100 Club in Oxford Street on Thursday evening, after the band announced their surprise gig. Mr Ó hAnnaidh was charged by the Metropolitan Police after an incident on 21 November 2024 at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town, where he allegedly displayed a flag in support of proscribed organisation Hezbollah. Kneecap said  they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and would not incite violence against any individual. They said the video in question had been taken out of context. Metropolitan Police officers were pictured outside the Oxford Street event, which the band said on X had sold out in 90 seconds. The group from Belfast, who rap in the Irish language, said they would perform at the 100 Club on Oxford Street ahead of their headline slot at Wide Awake Festival in Brockwell Park, south London, on Friday night. In a post to social media, they said: \"London. We're back. See you at The 100 Club tonight - tickets on sale in one hour at 4pm.\" The venue confirmed the gig in a social media post and said doors to the event opened at 19:30 BST. In a statement, the Met Police said a \"policing plan\" was in place for the gig to \"ensure it passes off safely\". \"This is primarily in terms of managing visitors to the venue for what we understand is a spontaneous and sold-out event,\" they said. \"There have been no issues or arrests.\" Mr Ó hAnnaidh had been charged by postal requisition and was due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on June 18, the force previously said.

    "title": "Trump administration ends Harvard's ability to enrol international students",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration has moved to end Harvard's ability to enrol international students, escalating a standoff with America's oldest university. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that the administration had revoked Harvard's \"Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification as a result of their failure to adhere to the law.\" \"Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country,\" she posted on Thursday. Harvard called the move \"unlawful\" in a statement. \"We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University – and this nation – immeasurably,\" the university responded. \"We are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community. This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission.\" The Trump administration's decisions could affect thousands of international students who study at the university. Over 6,700 international students were enrolled at the institution last academic year, university data shows, making up 27% of its student body. News quickly spread through the international community on campus Thursday, sparking fear and frustration among the thousands of students whose futures were suddenly in limbo. \"We're seeing a lot of confusion on this,\" Sarah Davis, an Australian student receiving a graduate degree, told BBC Newshour. \"The news has come only five days before a lot of us are due to graduate the university, and this obviously is going to have a lot of very uncertain implications for whether we're able to stay on in the United States afterwards and keep working here,\" said Ms Davis, who is president of the Australia and New Zealand Caucus at the Harvard Kennedy School. \"We're all just sitting back and waiting to see whether or not we get communications about what the next steps are from the university.\" Leo Gerdén, a 22-year-old undergraduate from Sweden, remembers the day he received his admission letter to Harvard as the best day of his life. With less than a week until graduation, he didn't imagine his time at the prestigious campus ending like this. \"International students are being used as poker chips in a battle between the White House and Harvard,\" Mr Gerdén told the BBC. \"It's incredibly dehumanising.\" The Trump administration has launched investigations into dozens of universities across the countries and wrung concessions from other major US institutions like Columbia University in New York. But in April, Harvard University became the most prominent institution to push back,announcing it would sue the Trump administrationafter it sent the school a list of lengthy demands. The White House later said the list was sent by mistake. It has demandedHarvard change its hiring, admissions and teaching practicesto help fight antisemitism on campus. It has threatened torevoke the university's tax-exempt status and freeze billions of dollarsin government grants. Harvard earlier this year said it had taken many steps to address antisemitism, and that the government's demands were an effort to regulate the university's \"intellectual conditions\". But the standoff continued to escalate. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) then warned Harvard that it could lose its ability to host international students if it did not comply with a sweeping records request from the administration pertaining to international students. In Thursday'sletter,Noem followed through. She announced that DHS had revoked Harvard's access to the SEVP programme, which meant that it would not be able to enroll individuals with F- or J- non-immigrant status for the upcoming 2025-2026 academic year. Individuals on these visas would have to transfer to other universities to maintain legal status, she wrote. The letter stated Harvard had 72 hours to comply with a list of demands to have an \"opportunity\" to regain its ability to enrol these students. That included providing the government with all disciplinary records for non-immigrant students enrolled at Harvard over the past five years. Noem also demanded Harvard turn over electronic records, videos, or audio of \"illegal\" and \"dangerous or violent\" activity by non-immigrant students on campus. In her post on X, Noem warned that the move should \"serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country.\" The Trump administration has attempted to curtail individual visas for international students, causing confusion on university campuses across the US and leading to a wave of lawsuits. In some cases, those revocations appeared to affect foreign students who participated in political protests or have had previous criminal charges, such as driving infractions. In a separate court case on Thursday, a federal judge in California blocked the Trump administration from cancelling the legal status of international students across the US while challenges to the policy play out in court. \"We came here because if what America stands for: freedom of speech, academic freedom, a vibrant intellectual community,\" Mr Gerdén said of his international classmates. \"And now Trump is threatening all those values.\" \"Without the international students, Harvard is simply not Harvard anymore,\" he said. The state department is imposing new sanctions on the country's government because of the findings. Federal officials say all six people aboard the small plane are presumed dead. The famous frog gave the commencement speech at the University of Maryland where Muppets creator Jim Henson graduated in 1960. Police say the victims, a young couple, were shot by a man who shouted \"free, free Palestine\". The tax and spending bill, which must still pass in the Senate, includes sweeping changes to the tax code, Social Security and more.",

    "title": "Levy's to-do list after paying Postecoglou £2m Europa bonus",
    "article_text": "Ange Postecoglou is the first Australian manager to coach in, and win, a major European club final For Tottenham, a summer of opportunity beckons. Their historic Europa League triumph in Spain means they can head into the close season with a bounce in their step. Their17-year trophy drought is overand, pertinently, they are back in the Champions League. With that, swings open certain doors. Finances are stronger; you can attract players â or managers in Spurs' case - who wouldn't have necessarily given your club a second glance. The Champions League is where the elite players demand to perform. It's the platform the best emerging talent dream of reaching. Life's easier in the Champions League and Daniel Levy can take solace in that before what is gearing up to be a busy summer. Here we look at their to-do list, from the manager's future, to recruitment plans and the bonuses for European glory. Of course, the biggest development this summer will inevitably be the identity of their head coach. Ange Postecoglou etched his name into Tottenham folklore on Wednesday night, yet his position heading into next season remains uncertain. Whetherthe euphoria of what unfoldedin Spain changes the direction of travel regarding Postecoglou's future should become clear in the immediate future. Prior to this week's success, the expectancy was that Postecoglou would leave before next season; the Australian ultimately paying the price for a dreadful domestic season. BBC Sport understands the club are some way down the line in the process of identifying potential replacements for Postecoglou. So with that in mind, if Spurs have the strength in their initial convictions then Postecoglou may still be on borrowed time. That said, how do you dismiss a managerwho has just led you to such glory? However the next few days unfold, what is clear for Tottenham is that they must execute the change in leadership, if there is to be one, smoothly â certainly more professionally than their previous managerial search that saw them lurch from candidate to candidate before finally resting on Postecoglou. Among the contenders are believed to be Thomas Frank â who has a relationship with technical director Johan Lange - Andoni Iraola, Marco Silva and Oliver Glasner. All may have had reservations about joining Tottenham prior to Wednesday night. But with Champions League football to look forward to, Spurs have become a significantly more attractive option. 'Let's say I'm a legend' - Son enjoys first trophy 'I'm a winner' - inside Postecoglou's second season at Tottenham 'I don't feel I've completed the job... but que sera, sera' The potential re-appointment of Fabio Paratici must also be considered. Paratici, wholeft his position as managing director of footballin 2023 after an appeal against a two-and-a-half-year Fifa ban for alleged financial irregularities dating back to his spell at Juventus was rejected by Italy's highest sports court, is in talks over a return when his suspension is lifted in July. How influential could he be in the decision over Postecoglou and his possible replacement? How would Paratici â who also has some interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia â and Lange co-exist in relatively similar roles? If Paratici does complete a return, does that mean current chief of football Scott Munn's days are numbered particularly with Vinai Venkatesham already confirmed as the club's next chief executive? This video can not be played This is one for the true believers â Postecoglou In the short term, Levy will sign off a Â£2m bonus to Postecoglou for lifting the club's first European trophy since 1984. The players will also split a performance-related package of around Â£3m for their success, though it is understood that automatic pay increases for Champions League qualification are not universal across all personal contractual agreements. Either way, you'd imagine Levy will have no qualms with paying for his club's historic success. We shouldn't, however, expect the Tottenham chairman to continue spending lavishly this summer. History tells us it's not his style. But building on Wednesday night's euphoria will come at significant expense. Forming a squad capable of competing in the Champions League is an altogether different proposition from seeking to improve a team that could yet finish 17th in the league. This video can not be played Spurs players touch down at Stansted BBC Sport understands that the sense within the club's recruitment team is that their young squad should be supplemented with more experience. For instance, an established central midfielder is believed to be on the club's radar this summer. If they lose vice-captain Cristian Romero to La Liga, they will look to replace the Argentina international with a ready-made replacement. Spurs tried to sign Crystal Palace and England international Marc Guehiin January and remain interested in the centre-back. They will be at pains to keep the experience already at the club. Rodrigo Bentancur, whose current deal expires next year, has held initial talks over an extension. The club have already exercised an option to extend captain Son Heung-min's contract until the summer of 2026. That isn't to say Tottenham will abandon their remit of signing young talent with Southampton's teenager Tyler Dibling a target. And whoever is the manager will have a massive say as you'd expect. Not for the first time, it's gearing up to be an interesting summer at Tottenham.

    "title": "Yes, yes, yes: Man Utd sure on Amorim, transfers and the future",
    "article_text": "Yes, yes, yes: Man Utd sure on Amorim, transfers and the future Manchester United were putting on the bravest of brave faces as they headed out of Bilbao at lunchtime on Thursday. Yes, the club remain solidly behind head coach Ruben Amorim - who had said after the match that if the ownership or the fans did not want him, he would leave \"the next day\", without talking about compensation. Yes, the club have a Plan B when it comes to transfers and will be in a position to reshape Amorim's squad this summer. And yes, the club still believe they will return towards the upper end of the English game in the not-too-distant future. But there are some basic realities words alone will not solve. After losing 1-0 to Tottenham in Bilbao, knowing there will be no European football of any kind next season and with losses still high despite a second round of redundancies, there are significant questions for United to answer. Here we assess what the defeat means for their finances, transfer plans, on who might leave and for Amorim. At some point between now and the beginning of July, United will announce their third quarter financial results to the New York Stock Exchange. This will be an opportunity to address any monetary issues for the 2025-26 season that have arisen because of the defeat in Spain. We know for certain United will experience a Â£10m reduction in payments from their Â£900m, 10-year sponsorship deal with Adidas because they have missed out on the Champions League. As that penalty is spread over the length of the contract, which runs to 2035, the damage on an annual basis is not onerous. But few would look at this season and be confident of United returning to the Champions League in 2026-27 and therefore avoiding another penalty. Beyond that, there is the issue of Premier League prize money. Each place in the table is worth Â£3m. That means, in their current position of 16th, United would receive Â£33m less than for finishing fifth. The club make about Â£4.3m in gate receipts for every home game at Old Trafford - and there would have been at least four more of those in the league phase of the Champions League. Add in the generous prize money on offer in Europe's elite competition, and that is how we have calculated that Wednesday's defeat by Tottenham has, at a conservative estimate, cost United Â£100m. As has been widely reported, a second round of redundancies is on the way, this time affecting the football department. The reductions are like to affect the scouting, medical and science teams. There has been no word on whether that is likely to be the end of the matter. But it is clear, from axing of staff trips, free lunches and other perks, nothing is off limits in Sir Jim Ratcliffe's determination to make United a leaner organisation. But these cost-cutting initiatives can only do so much. As with any Premier League club, by far the biggest expenditure is on transfer fees and player wages. If this season is any guide, United, who have spent in excess of Â£900m on transfers over the past five years and whose last annual wage bill they confirmed at Â£365m, have been awful at both of these fundamental elements. This video can not be played Man Utd players reflect on Europa League final defeat United say funds will be available, but what does that mean? There are a few factors at play. As Ratcliffe outlined in March, they owe Â£272m in outstanding transfer fees, a significant percentage of which - Â£156m - is due this summer. Overall losses to June 2024 were Â£113.2m. Since then, United spent Â£14.5m sacking former manager Erik ten Hag and his staff. Despite this, no-one at United is rejecting the widespread belief Wolves forward Matheus Cunha is going to join in the summer. The Brazilian has a release clause of Â£62.5m. Quite how much of that has to be paid immediately is not known. However, it is difficult to see how it cannot at least in part be funded by player sales. Now for the unquantifiable bit. The better - and faster - United can sell, the more flexibility they will have to buy. The longer it goes, the less easy it becomes to strike deals for the right price and the potential for mistakes grows. Arguably, United are still paying massively for the summer of 2022 when Ten Hag arrived and demanded the club bring in Frenkie de Jong from Barcelona. United officials quickly concluded it was an impossible deal to complete. Ten Hag argued otherwise. After the attempt was eventually aborted, the season started with a home defeat by Brighton and a four-goal hammering at Brentford. United were panicked into spending Â£150m on Casemiro and Antony, neither of whom has come close to providing value for money and remain under contract heading into next season. There is an ideal and a realistic view of this. In the past, United have ringfenced players who they regarded as off-limits to other clubs. I doubt there is anyone in that bracket now - and that includes captain Bruno Fernandes, even though the club did say they weren't interested in selling the 30-year-old Portugal playmaker when recent interest from the Saudi Pro League surfaced. First, the easy bit. The contracts of Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen run out in the summer. They will not be renewed. After that, it gets harder. Marcus Rashford accepts he will not play for United again while Amorim remains in charge. But he is in no rush to decide his future and is not interested in taking a wage cut. Barcelona have declared their interest but are hardly cash rich. Rashford might be keen on a move to the Nou Camp but it is difficult to imagine a deal could be concluded swiftly. What happens if Chelsea activate the Â£5m clause in their deal with United over Jadon Sancho and send him back to Old Trafford? After controversial social media posts around the final, Alejandro Garnacho and his family appear to have put themselves on a collision course with Amorim. Chelsea were keen on the Argentina forward in January. United are bound to listen if they come back. There have been murmurings around Andre Onana from the Saudi Pro League but nothing concrete has materialised. Onana's deputy Altay Bayindir knows he will remain as second choice and is likely to move on. But what of established highly-paid stars such as Casemiro, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw? Or more recent recruits such as Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount? Or players who have been forgotten about, such as Tyrell Malacia or Antony, who has enjoyed a successful loan at Real Betis? And that is without mentioning the underperforming, expensive striking duo Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee. Returns to Italy have been suggested for them. But both are earning more than they did when they were at Atalanta and Bologna respectively. Logic says only a minority of these players will leave, much as United might wish otherwise. This video can not be played Iâll leave without compensation if board feel I'm not right â Amorim The speed with which United issued support for Amorim in the wake of his post-match declaration was telling but the former Sporting coach knows the spotlight on him is fierce now. He has said he feels his players are getting to grips with what he wants from them and there are definite signs of a structure and tactical patterns that were not evident in his first few weeks at the club. In one first-half move on Wednesday, United manipulated a situation that allowed Casemiro to deliver a 60-yard crossfield pass, from right to left, over to Patrick Dorgu, who was in space by the touchline. Nothing came of the attack but it was an example of what Amorim is looking for. But he knows, as does everyone else, that clubs of United's size cannot lose consistently without consequence. A tally of six league wins in 26 games is simply not good enough. There is no league with the strength in depth of the Premier League, underlined by what has happened to United this season. However, if Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich or any of the big Italian clubs had a comparable campaign, it is pretty certain that, not only would the guy who started the season get axed, in all probability, the person who followed him would as well. Amorim seems safe from that fate. But unsubstantiated rumours hang around of players not being happy with his methods. A couple of thoughtful trophy-winning former United players wonder how effective it can be having a coaching staff that, in some cases, is both younger and less experienced than the players they are attempting to work with. Having the support of the ownership is one thing. The reality is Amorim must start winning quickly next season. The vultures are circling now. It will not take much for them to go for their prey. Once Sunday's game with Aston Villa is over, United leave for a two-game tour of Asia. I cannot for one second think that any of the club's established first-team players are relishing the prospect. But Amorim has said, and others acknowledge, that the first team can have no argument over United taking unpopular decisions to generate more income - up to Â£10m in this instance - to make up for this season's shortfall. There is another 'Super League' club who have failed to secure European qualification for next season - Italian giants AC Milan. Do not be surprised if at least one friendly is arranged in a neutral country at some convenient point in the calendar. The positive spin of no Europe means more chance to work on the training ground. The negative, potentially, is that more of what is going on behind the scenes will make its way into the media because the season is not being punctuated by regular midweek matches and press conferences. That is the thing with Manchester United. They are big news. They generate debate. Even when they are not very good, people still talk about them.

    "title": "Get to know maybe the coolest, calmest F1 driver in history",
    "article_text": "Oscar Piastri has won four of the seven grands prix so far in 2025 Oscar Piastri might just be the coolest Formula 1 driver there has ever been. The Australian exudes a sense of calmness that seems to permeate his entire being. He doesn't criticise his rivals. He doesn't shout on the team radio. He doesn't really do controversy. This quality has been notable since he made his debut in F1, just over two years ago. Now, seven races into a season that he could end by achieving his life's dream at the age of 24, it is proving to be one of his killer strengths as he navigates his first title campaign. Piastri says this \"comes quite naturally\", but as in many cases in elite sport, it's the work that's done to hone the talent that makes the difference. \"Whether that's from my genes, I don't know,\" Piastri says. \"But there is a lot of conscious effort on maintaining that. Maybe it comes a bit more naturally, but (it's) trying to sit in that nice zone where you can be calm and know what works for you. \"I'm still a human and I still have emotions, so I still have to control it. And that is a strength of mine. \"Ninety-nine per cent of the time I'm probably as calm as it looks. There's definitely moments in the car where it puts my emotions to the test. But it kind of goes back to the work you do, kind of putting things in perspective.\" How 'delicious' Verstappen move caught McLaren by surprise Piastri wins from Norris in Miami to extend lead Piastri signs new long-term contract with McLaren Piastri's Zen-like personality, and the desert-dry humour that comes with it, is beginning to create him quite the following. But he is a simple soul, and it comes as no surprise to hear he cares not for the trappings of F1. \"I don't get bothered that much by kind of all the fanfare that goes on,\" Piastri says. \"And I appreciate all the support that I get. But I'm here to drive race cars. I like driving race cars. I like going fast. I like trying to beat other people. That's what I'm here for. \"I feel like I'm a pretty simple person. And, yeah, my sense of humour is pretty dry, and I don't give much. But that's just me being me. \"In this sport, it's very easy to kind of get lost trying to be something you're not, and kind of fit to a mould. \"I feel like I can just be myself. And I think with more experience and once you have some good results and you become more comfortable, then you can come out of your shell a bit more. But for me there's not that much shell. It's just how I am.\" Piastri credits some of his mentality on having to make it to F1 from so far away. He moved to Europe as a 14-year-old. His father, Chris, stayed with him for the first six months, but then he returned to Australia and Piastri went to boarding school in England. Piastri says this made him \"grow up quite quickly - you get a lot of life experience very early on\". \"It was definitely a big decision, but I never had to question it too much,\" he adds. \"My kind of way of looking at that was, 'OK, I want to become a professional racing driver. If I can do it in Formula 1, then that's even better. And the way of getting there is by going to Europe.' \"So, again, removing the emotion from it to an extent, I kind of went, 'I want to achieve this dream of mine. This is how I get there.'\" Piastri battling with Max Verstappen in Miami, where he overtook the Dutchman and went on to win the race Piastri is leading the championship by 13 points from his McLaren team-mate Lando Norris heading into this weekend's Monaco Grand Prix. His breakthrough year came in 2024, whenhe took his maiden grand prix victory in Hungary,and followed it upwith a second in Azerbaijan,founded on the sort of brave, clinical, decisive overtaking manoeuvre that has become his trademark. Those incisive racing skills have paid off this year. He already has two of the best overtaking moves of the season to his name. A brave pass on Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari in the wet around the outside of the fastest corner on the track in Melbourne and - even better - on Hamilton again in the dust around the outside of the kink approaching the high-speed chicane in Saudi Arabia, a move that was critical in ensuring he took the lead from Verstappen around the pit stops in Jeddah. Is there a parallel between his unruffled personality and his decisiveness on track? \"I don't know if it's a parallel,\" he says, \"but they're certainly linked. \"In some ways, they're kind of opposites, right? My calm personality and some of my moves are on the aggressive side. But I do think that those moves come from being able to be calm and think clearly.\" AlthoughVerstappen caught him unawareswith his stunning pass into the first chicane in Imola on Sunday, Piastri has already shown he is not intimidated by the four-time champion's uncompromising approach to racing. Last year,in a BBC Sport interview,Verstappen gave a rare insight into his philosophy of racing, saying: \"When I race with someone, he will not be able to overtake me around the outside.\" But Piastri has already proved he has what it takes. He took the lead from Verstappen at the start in Jeddah, and did so again in Miami - with a move that started by going around the outside, and which provoked the Dutchman into braking too late, allowing Piastri to cut back to the inside. \"Even without Max saying that, just from watching him through the years and now racing against him, I already knew that,\" Piastri says. \"And I feel like in all honesty, I have - maybe it's a slightly less brutal approach - but it's certainly not dissimilar. \"Max and I race each other in quite a similar way. Very robust, uncompromising, and I think we both push the limits to an extent. \"I always try to be fair, but it's a very fine line between good, hard racing and just overstepping the mark, and it's always difficult to find that balance. \"But I feel like the both of us have a lot of respect for racing each other. We know what to expect, especially after a few battles this year.\" Piastri, who is managed by fellow Australian and former F1 driver Mark Webber, is trying to become the first non-European to win the drivers' championship since Canadian Jacques Villeneuve in 1997 What impresses about Piastri in battle is the preciseness. He doesn't waste energy. He doesn't go for a move that's not on, or try a half move that is not going to come off. He waits, and pounces when the moment is just right. \"I learned pretty early on in my career that normally when you do things half-heartedly in a race car, that's normally when things go wrong,\" he says. \"Whether that's pushing on a qualifying lap or especially overtaking someone, normally actually the best way to not get yourself in trouble is by just committing to things. \"That's obviously a bit of a mental hurdle to get over, but I feel like once I got over that in my karting days, then it's been more or less a strength of mine ever since.\" The racing skills have been apparent in Piastri from the start in F1. Where he has stepped it up this season is in his outright performance. Last year, Norris was unquestionably McLaren's lead driver, the one usually taking the fight to Verstappen. Piastri beat the Briton only four times in qualifying in the whole season, and his average lap-time deficit to his team-mate was 0.147 seconds. This season, the score is 6-3 in Piastri's favour over all qualifying sessions, including the sprints, and now the average time advantage is 0.146secs for him. This is the foundation for his four wins, to Verstappen's two and Norris' one. How has he turned things around so effectively? \"The team's done a great job with the car,\" Piastri says. \"And the team's also done a great job with myself. That part goes both ways. We've found gains in every area. The driver being one of them. \"Just trying to chase performance in every category, basically. \"Last year what was hampering me was my qualifying performances, which I think ultimately came down to a slight lack of pace overall. And going about trying to find that pace has been definitely a challenging exercise, but obviously a very worthwhile one.\" The answer, he says, has been \"trying to just find the last couple of hundredths (of a second) in every category you can. And they all add up. \"The first place you look at is obviously the driving and the data, and no two people will drive in an identical way. But normally there's some traits from one driver that are better than the other. And some from another that are better than your team-mate's. \"So Lando has obviously been a great reference for that, being very, very quick the whole time we've been together. \"I am maybe a faster driver. But I don't think it's because I can now do things that I couldn't do before. It's just that I'm able to tie it together a lot more. \"You work on the technical aspects of driving. Whether it's how you brake and turn, how you apply your steering lock. It's quite hard to teach yourself to drive un-instinctively, but it is possible.\" McLaren CEO Zak Brown takes a selfie with his drivers, Lando Norris and Piastri, after their one-two in Miami The contrast with Norris - who has spent much of the year so far explaining how the car does not behave in the way he wants, and how that has been holding him back - is obvious. But both McLaren drivers are in the title fight - Verstappen is currently third, 22 points behind Piastri. Does he have any concern that Verstappen could sneak through the middle as he and Norris take points off each other? \"It is a possibility, yes,\" he says. \"But, on both sides of the garage here, we want to win because we've been the best driver, the best team, including against the other car in the team. You always want to earn things on merit and you want to be able to beat everyone, including your team-mates. \"So that gives Lando and I the best chance of our personal goals of trying to become drivers' world champion, while also achieving the main result for the team, which is the constructors' championship. \"If we do get beaten by Max, of course that would hurt, but we would know that we both had the same opportunity, we were racing everybody out there and that's just how it panned out. \"For us it's the most straightforward, the fairest way of going racing and that's what we've asked for.\" And does he think about the fact he can end the year as world champion? \"A bit, yes,\" he says. \"But I've also thought about it before this year as well. \"It's very easy to kind of just go: 'Yeah, that's the situation I'm in', but what I've been doing in the past 10 years, especially the past two years, has all been building to try and prepare for when I'm in this situation. \"And it's very easy for me to just go: 'Well, if I execute this practice session, execute this qualifying session, execute this race, naturally my championship's going to start to look pretty rosy.' \"It's obviously still very early in the year, and once you get later in the season, the pressure ramps up. \"Potentially some of the decisions you make on the track start to change a bit. But for now, it's just about trying to score the most points I can and go out there and try and win every race.\" This video can not be played Five things to look out for at the Monaco Grand Prix How to follow Monaco Grand Prix on the BBC Has F1's iconic Monaco Grand Prix become boring?

    "title": "Is it time for injury replacements in Test cricket?",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Zimbabwe down a bowler after Ngarava carted off with hamstring injury Is it time for cricket to make a change and allow teams to replace injured players? Zimbabwe were already struggling on day one of the one-off Test against England at Trent Bridge when frontline bowler Richard Ngarava had to be helped from the field with a back injury. That left the tourists potentially a bowler and batter short - effectively playing with 10 men because while an injured player can be replaced in the field, the replacement cannot bat or bowl. Ngarava briefly returned to field later in the day but was unable to bowl because of how long he had spent off the field, and looked in discomfort before once again heading for the changing rooms. BBC Sport looks at the current laws, when cricket has dabbled with substitutes in the past and asks the Test Match Special team whether it is time for subs to be brought in... Cricket's Laws, set out by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), state the umpires can allow a substitute if a player \"has been injured or become ill and that this occurred during the match\" or for \"any other wholly acceptable reason\". \"A substitute shall not bowl or act as captain but may act as wicketkeeper only with the consent of the umpires,\" the Law adds. The exception comes if a player suffers a concussion. Replacements for concussion have been allowed since 2019 - Australia's Marnus Labuschagne famously became the first concussion sub in Test cricket when replacing Steve Smith in the Ashes - and are able to bat and bowl. Covid-19 replacements were brought in after the pandemic but have since been scrapped. There are numerous occasions when injuries have impacted matches. England effectively played the entire first Test of the 2019 Ashes at Edgbaston with 10 players after James Anderson injured his calf four overs into day one. In 2023, Australia spinner Nathan Lyon limped out of the second Test at Lord's on day two with a calf injury. There have been famous examples of players battling on through injury which has added to the spectacle. Colin Cowdrey batted with a broken arm in saving a Test for England against West Indies in 1963, while South Africa captain Graeme Smith bravely emerged with a broken hand in an attempt to save the Sydney Test against Australia in 2009. Vikram Solanki became the first supersub in one-day cricket for England against Australia in 2005 Substitutes are not totally unheard of in cricket. Supersubs were introduced to one-day internationals in 2005 â England's Vikram Solanki was the first in a match at Headingley against Australia â but were scrapped in 2006. The Indian Premier League currently has its impact player rule which allows teams to swap in one of four named substitutes during a match, while Australia's Big Bash had a similar X-Factor player rule between 2020 and 2022. Those rules were all largely for tactical purposes, however, rather than injury, and were in T20 cricket not the longest format. Pope, Crawley and Duckett tons flatten Zimbabwe Watch Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer England v Zimbabwe: Duckett, Crawley & Pope centuries see England on top Former England captain Michael Vaughan Injury replacements should be permitted in Test cricket in the first innings of the game. There should be an independent doctor on site. If the doctor deems a player unable to carry on playing, you should be allowed a sub. It should only be in the first innings. If you allow it to go into the second innings, there could be a little bit of skullduggery. If there's a genuine injury in the first innings, it affects the game and the entertainment, which fans pay money to watch. The first innings is a good cut-off to make it fair. BBC chief cricket commentator and former England bowler Jonathan Agnew I have seen a number of Tests ruined because a team is a player down. How do you prove it? It's another example of where there could be argument. It is something that is so difficult to prove. Common sense says yes, of course, but you need a satisfactory way of showing beyond doubt that the player is genuinely injured. I think that would be open to all sorts of arguments. Former England off-spinner Vic Marks It's well worth considering. It would take a bit of administrating, just to make sure the injury is absolutely genuine. You wouldn't want to see anyone have the opportunity to fake injuries in order to change the nature of a team because of conditions or lack of form. We had it in rugbywhere fake blood was spilt,so we want to avoid that. You need that proviso to make sure the system isn't abused, but it is something that should be examined. Former Zimbabwe seamer Henry Olonga I'm open to the idea of substitutes, perhaps with a limited number, but not necessarily like-for-like and not only restricted to injuries. If you want to grow the game globally, then make it more like other sports where subs are allowed. Think of football, tactically if a game is going in a certain way, substitutes can be used to tweak the direction. If a fast bowler is going for a few runs, why not replace them with a spinner? I don't think it will be a popular opinion, but I am sticking to it. TMS commentator Alison Mitchell Yes, it should be looked into, but someone has to come up with a system where the system cannot be abused. We already have like-for-like substitutes if a player is concussed, so surely it should be brought in for other injuries. Otherwise, you can end up with the situation like we may have with Zimbabwe in this Test. Then it just makes it a one-sided contest. If an injured player can't take any further part in a match, we have to find a way of keeping the contest going. TMS commentator Simon Mann I've long thought it is an anomaly that you can't have a substitution in Test cricket. Every other sport has it. Why not in cricket? I can understand the problem of verifying an injury, but perhaps a halfway house would be to permit a replacement for a clearly injured player in the first two days of a Test. BBC Sport chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt As plenty have highlighted, any idea of injury replacements comes with the potential for the system to be abused. Therefore, I don't think there can be a halfway house. If a replacement is permitted, then allow them for tactical reasons, too. I'd say that a 12th player can be named before the toss and that player can be introduced for tactical reasons or an injury. Just one, though. That would add a layer of intrigue. What sort of player do you pick? When do you use them? If you make a tactical move, you leave yourself exposed to an injury later on. Can a team correctly assess the conditions in order to tactically maximise the introduction of the replacement? One of the great beauties of cricket is 11 in a team is never enough. You almost always want to squeeze another batter or bowler in there. To me, simply allowing injury replacements will lead to problems down the road. Either allow a replacement for all reasons, or not at all. Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Aspinall reaches play-offs as Littler sets records",
    "article_text": "Nathan Aspinall finished third behind table topper Luke Humphries Nathan Aspinall secured the final Premier League play-off spot while Luke Littler - the brilliant winner on the night - set new records in Sheffield. Englishman Aspinall defeated Michael van Gerwen 6-2 in the quarter-finals to  eliminate the seven-time champion. Meanwhile, table-topping world champion Littler averaged more than 114 as he broke his own Premier League seasonal points record in thrashing Stephen Bunting 6-1. Littler defeated Aspinall 6-4 in the last four and Luke Humphries 6-3 in the Sheffield final to take his points tally to 45 and seal a record-extending sixth Premier League nightly win on the 16th and last evening of the league phase. The 18-year-old's final victory featured 155 and 170 checkouts as he clocked up eight ton-plus finishes on the night. \"I'm happy to be top, breaking these records,\" said Littler, who described the victory as a \"warm-up\" for next week's finale. Aspinall, 33, had finished in fifth, one place below qualification, in the previous two seasons. But he will join Littler, Humphries and Gerwyn Price at the London play-offs on 29 May after beating Van Gerwen, the only player who could stop him going through. The 36-year-old Dutchman, without a nightly win in the whole 2025 campaign, misses out on the play-offs for only the second time in 13 years of competing. Aspinall said: \"There was a lot of emotion as soon as I walked off stage. Michael didn't look himself but I thought I put in a fantastic performance under that pressure.\" He will face Humphries in the play-offs at the O2, while defending champion Littler will come up against Welshman Price. All the action as it happened on night 16 in Sheffield Premier League Darts schedule, results, prize money Aspinall beat Van Gerwen for the second week running World number eight Aspinall has confounded critics who opposed his inclusion in the eight-man competition, having been ranked 11 when the picks were made. His inclusion was questioned by fellow players Mike de Decker and Dave Chisnall amid suggestions his popular walk-on song Mr Brightside helped his case. The Stockport-born player has faced online abuse over his participation, as well as recovering from injuries and dartitis to reach the final four. \"I came off social media because of the abuse I was getting,\" said 'The Asp' after his second nightly win, in Aberdeen a week ago. \"I'm not being exaggerated here, but it ruined my life for a month, not just my life, my family's. It was horrific. \" Aspinall has also come back from elbow, wrist and back injuries, along with tackling dartitis - a condition where players have a mental block when it comes to throwing on the stage. Missing out on qualification completes a miserable campaign for Van Gerwen, whose last nightly win came back in April 2024. The three-time world champion had seven victories and two runner-up spots from his previous 12 campaigns, with his last Premier League title in 2023. \"This is probably one of the hardest Premier Leagues I have ever played in - not in terms of players, but in terms of myself,\" Van Gerwen admitted.

    "title": "Brazil activists decry green rollbacks as senate passes ‘devastation bill’",
    "article_text": "Environmental activists inBrazilhave decried a dramatic rollback ofenvironmentalsafeguards after the senate approved a bill that would dismantle licensing processes and increase the risk of widespread destruction. The upper house passed the so-called “devastation bill” with 54 votes to 13 late on Wednesday, paving the way for projects ranging from mining and infrastructure to energy and farming to receive regulatory approval with little to no environmental oversight. The bill now returns to the lower house for final approval. No date has been set for a vote there, but it is expected to pass without resistance in the conservative chamber packed with agribusiness lobby supporters. The initiative proposes overhauling Brazil’s rigorous environmental licensing procedures to make the system simpler and more efficient. But it has been condemned by climate activists and policymakers as a historical setback that ignores the reality of theclimate crisisand flies in the face of Brazil’s commitments to combatting climate change. “It’s like getting rid of the brakes in a moving vehicle,” said Natalie Unterstell, the president of the Instituto Talanoa climate policy thinktank. She said the bill jeopardises Brazil’s commitments of eradicating deforestation by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050. The proposed legislation would allow some projects to renew permits through a self-declaration process and loosen requirements for high-impact ventures such as mining, allowing potentially harmful developments to move forward without serious considerations of their impacts on things like water reservoirs, deforestation or local communities. “Most licensing procedures will become a push of a button without an environmental study or environmental impact assessment,” said Suely Araújo, the public policy coordinator at the Climate Observatory network of NGOs. The Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA), a civil society organisation, said the proposal would dismantle a system of environmental protections that was built over decades, and do away with conditions that require companies to adopt prevention, mitigation and compensation measures, thus increasing the risk of destruction and conflict in rural areas. TheISA calculatedthat the approval of the law would directly threaten more than 3,000 protected areas, including land occupied by Indigenous people andAfro-descendantquilombolacommunities, and put 18m hectares (44.5m acres) of forest at risk. “The bill represents a collapse foretold,” the ISA said. The bill’s progress through congress has attracted particular dismay as Brazil is preparing to host the Cop30 climate conference in the Amazon in November. The government has said that it wants this year’s summit to be one of action, but this attempt to dismantle environmental protections undermines the country’s credibility, said Unterstell. “It sends the wrong signal at the wrong time,” she said. Environment minister Marina Silvadescribedthe approval of the bill as a “death blow” to Brazil’s climate efforts, but other members ofLuiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s government had previously expressed support for the measure, saying it would help attract investment. Although Lula has been successful in reducing deforestation, which fell by 32% across the country last year according toMapBiomas, he has disappointed the climate movement in other areas, particularly with his stance on oil exploration. One of the amendments introduced by the senate would notably speed up permits for projects deemed a government priority. Pro-oil senators hope this could benefit controversialexploration projects near the mouth of the Amazon river, a new oil frontier where the state-controlled oil company Petrobras has so far been unsuccessful in its endeavour to obtain drilling permits from the environmental watchdog Ibama.",

    "title": "Case of mother who died during forced sterilisation in Peru to be heard in court",
    "article_text": "The case of a forced sterilisation carried out inPeruin the 1990s will be heard by an international court on Thursday, 28 years after the procedure – one of many thousands – resulted in a woman’s death. Celia Ramos was 34 when she died in 1997, 19 days after surgery for a tubal ligation caused respiratory failure. The mother of three was “harassed” into accepting the procedure, which was part of a nationwide family planning programme. The mass sterilisation of hundreds of thousands of largely poor, rural and Indigenous women in the 1990s is regarded as one of the country’s most flagrant and widespread violations of human rights under thelate former president Alberto Fujimori, but neither the leader nor his health ministers have ever been prosecuted for the campaign, which lasted years. In 2024, theUN committee on the elimination of discriminationagainst women urged Peru to compensatewomen who were forcibly sterilised in the 1990s, ruling that the state policy could constitute a “crime against humanity”. Marisela Monzón Ramos, 38, was just 10 years old when her mother died. The eldest of Ramos’s three daughters, she was in Guatemala City for Thursday’s hearing at the inter-American court of human rights. “This is a huge step for us, considering the years of struggle. It has been nearly three decades since my mother died,” she told the Guardian before the hearing. “[This hearing] gives us the opportunity that we have not had in our country. “We are looking for justice. The Peruvian state should be held responsible for the death of our mother, who was completely healthy,” she said. While this is the first case of a forced sterilisation in Peru to reach the inter-American court, the Celia Ramos case is representative of thousands of others, says Carmen Cecilia Martínez, an associate director at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “The court’s decision could force the Peruvian state to make reparations to the victims of this case and open the way to justice for others,” she said. Demus, a Peruvian NGO for women’s rights, presented the Celia Ramos case to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in 2010. Eleven years later, an IACHR report declared that the Peruvian state was responsible for the violation of Ramos’ rights and recommended the adoption of measures of reparation and non-repetition. However, as Peru made no progress in complying with the recommendations, the commission sent the case to the inter-American court in June 2023. The legal representation was bolstered by the regionalCenter for Justice and International Law(Cejil) and theCenter for Reproductive Rights, which joined in the same year. Martínez says successive health ministers under Fujimori turned the forced sterilisations into public policy, offering financial incentives to medical workers for each woman who was subjected to the procedure. “The objective was very clear: to recruit women from poor areas, Indigenous, rural peasant women and eliminate their reproductive capacity, violating, among other rights, their right to reproductive autonomy,” Martínez said. The legal team’s hope, she explained, is for the court to declare the policy a crime against humanity, which would eliminate any statute of limitations on opening investigations. “There is a very clear causal link between the violation of [Ramos’s] informed consent and her death,” Martínez said. Monzón, a biologist, says the whole family, who lived in Peru’s northern Piura region, were left “devastated” by her mother’s death. “Our life was cut short,” she said. She and her younger sister recall how nurses repeatedly put pressure on their mother, who initially refused the procedure. “She was a young woman, a very joyful woman, full of life,” she said. “She was a complete mother, a devoted wife, a lady who took care to be attentive for the good of all the beings she loved.”",

    "title": "Hong Kong authorities trying to disrupt independent press with ‘strange’ tax audits",
    "article_text": "Hong Kong authorities have targeted journalists and media outlets with what are supposed to be “random” tax audits, in a move the industry union says adds pressure to waning press freedoms. The head of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, Selina Cheng, detailed what she said were “strange” and “unreasonable” accusations by Hong Kong’s inland revenue department. Requests or audits were made against the association, at least eight independent media outlets, and at least 20 journalists and their family members, including Cheng and her parents, she said at a press conference on Wednesday. Cheng said the tax department had told one journalist that they had to pay a profit tax for a company they did not run, and had cited a registration number that did not exist. Another company was told it was being audited for profits made during the year before it was even founded. One journalist had their income “assessed” as double the amount they had actually earned, and was issued a demand for prepayment of tax on the “under-reported” income. “Does the average news worker have the resources to hire an auditor to handle it?” Cheng asked. “We are concerned that tax investigations will put a financial and mental strain on media workers, disrupt our reporting and prevent us from focusing our journalistic work.” Among the media outlets listed as targets were InMedia HK and the English-language Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP), and the latter’s founder, Tom Grundy. HKFP said it had been “randomly selected” for a seven-year audit in 2024, and that the IRD had twice requested “hold sums”, which were later reduced to zero after the outlet objected. “HKFP has always met its tax obligations, paid IRD demands immediately, and ensured meticulous record-keeping since our 2015 inception,” it said. “The delays involved, and wide scope of these inspections, raise questions about the burden on the taxpayer and tax office resources … Recent scrutiny has diverted resources, manpower and funds away from journalism as we face a fourth year of financial deficit.” In a statement on X, Grundy said the outlet had “expected this kind of thing years ago”, and had been “obsessive” in its record keeping and financial transparency. “I’m having to act as a one-man compliance department instead of a journalist,” he said about the 15 month-long process so far. Citing IRD figures, Grundy said the chance of being “randomly” selected for an IRD audit was about 0.123%. “The probability drops much further when considering almost all independent media outlets were coincidentally, simultaneously selected.” Aleksandra Bielakowska, advocacy manager at Reporters Without Borders Asia-Pacific, said Hong Kong and Chinese authorities were doing everything in their power “to close remaining media outlets … and make sure there’s only one narrative coming from the Chinese Communist party. If they can’t put people in jail they’ll pressure them and their families to dissuade – or even prevent – them from reporting on the ground,” she told the Guardian. Hong Kong’s media have come under increasing pressureand persecution since the government crackdown on the pro-democracy movement ushered in a Beijing-designed national security law. Several outlets have been forced to close or relocate, including Apple Daily, whose founder, Jimmy Lai, is on trial for alleged offences under the NSL, and Stand News, whose two former editors werejailed for sedition last year. The Stand News sentencing came just weeks after the HKJA revealeda campaign of “systemic and organised” harassment of journalists and outlets, many of which Cheng said on Wednesday were also among those questioned by the tax authorities. The harassment included death threats and threatening and defamatory complaint letters being sent to reporters’ families and their employers, landlords and neighbours. In the latest Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index, Hong Kong ranked 140 out of 180 countries, down from 80 in 2021. The IRD said it did not comment on individual cases but “the industry or background of a taxpayer has no bearing on such reviews”. Additional research by Lillian Yang",

    "title": "Kim Jong-un furious as North Korea warship partly ‘crushed’ in launch gone wrong",
    "article_text": "A ceremony to welcome a new addition to North Korea’s naval fleet has ended in embarrassment following a major accident during the ship’s launch that the country’s dictator,Kim Jong-un, described as a “criminal act”. Kim was present when the 5,000-tonne destroyer appeared to go off balance during its launch in the eastern port city of Chongjin on Wednesday. The tipping caused damage to sections of the hull, the state-run KCNA news agency said on Thursday. “Kim Jong-un made [a] stern assessment, saying that it was a serious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility … and could not be tolerated,” KCNA reported. Kim ordered the ship restored before a key meeting of the ruling Workers’ party next month, KCNA added. The accident had “brought the dignity and self-respect of our state to a collapse”. Blaming “inexperienced command and operational carelessness” during the launch, the news agency said the incident left “some sections of the warship’s bottom crushed”. Officials found responsible for the debacle would be “dealt with at the plenary meeting of the party central committee” in June, Kim said. South Korea’s military said the vessel was lying on its side in the water. In a report issued last week on preparations for the launch, US-based 38 North said it appeared the ship would be side-launched from the quay, a method not previously observed inNorth Korea. “The use of this launch method could be one of necessity, as the quay where the ship is being built does not have an incline,” the 38 North report said. Commercial satellite imagery of the shipyard the day before the launch showed the destroyer positioned on the quay with support vessels by its side. The ship was the second 5,000-tonne destroyer-class vessel – the biggest in the North Korean fleet – to have been launched in recent weeks. State media ran images of Kim attending a ceremony at the earlier launch with his daughter Ju Ae,considered by many experts to be his likely successor. North Korea claimed that vessel, named the Choe Hyon, was equipped with the “most powerful weapons” and that it would “enter into operation early next year”. Some analysts said the ship could be equipped with short-range tactical nuclear missiles – although North Korea has not proven it has the ability to miniaturise its atomic bombs. The South Korean military has said the Choe Hyon could have been developed with Russian help,possibly in exchange for Pyongyang deploying thousands of troopsto help Moscow in its war against Ukraine. Ahn Chan-il, a North Korean defector who runs the World Institute for North Korea Studies, pointed out that Chongjin is conveniently close to the Russian port of Vladivostok. “It’s also likely that the projected timeline for the vessel – including when assembly would be completed and the ship launched – was shared with the Russian side,” Ahn said. “It appears the dock was hastily constructed, and multiple issues may have arisen during the shipbuilding process.” While the usually secretive North has previously disclosed failed satellite launches and the destruction caused by natural disasters, some analysts said the regime had been surprisingly quick to report Wednesday’s incident. “It shows again Kim Jong-un’s ruling style of cutting off negative rumours from spreading and controlling officials more forcefully by being open about it rather than hiding it,” said Cheong Seong-chang at the Sejong Institute in Seoul. While much of Kim’s focus has been on missile development and forging closer ties with Russia, he inspected a project to build a nuclear-powered submarine in March and said “radically” boosting the navy was a key part of the North’s defences. He called for the modernisation of the country’s surface and underwater naval forces, including the development of warships.",

    "title": "Dozens of Victorian public school upgrades delayed until after state election",
    "article_text": "Dozens of Victorian public schools will be waiting until after the next state election for key infrastructure projects – promised by the then premier, Daniel Andrews, in 2022 – to come to fruition. Before the November 2022 state election, Andrews pledged to spend $850m upgrading 89 schools, to be completed by the end of 2026. The upgrades were later extended to 96 schools. This week’s 2025-26budget papersrevealed 28 of the schools would be waiting for the promised capital works – which included new gymnasiums, performing arts and science centres and new learning spaces – until at least 2027, after the next state election. Last year’s 2024-25 budget allocated $227m to deliver promised capital upgrades at 25 of the schools, with the rest allocated funding in previous budgets. It pushed funding for the further 29 schools into this year’s budget. Tuesday’s budget papersconfirmed just one of the 29 projects would be completed by October 2026, with the rest languishing until 2027 at the earliest. The budget,the first delivered by the new treasurer, Jaclyn Symes, included $1.5bn to deliver new schools, upgrades and maintenance, as part of the state government’s promise to build 100 new schools across Victoria by 2026. In total, just five of the 96 promised upgrades had been completed and 11 were in construction, almost three years after their announcement. The rest remained in the design or planning stage, the Victorian School Building Authority (VSBA) website showed. For St Kilda Primary school, this year’s budget was yet another disappointment, seven years after the state government delivered $10.5m to upgrade the campus. As part of the upgrade, its hall was demolished in 2020 to make way for new capital works. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email One parent, Caroline Thornton, has been lobbying with more than 200 families and students to draw attention to the funding need. Some 440 students have no indoor space for assemblies or physical education. “St Kilda Primary is the largest school in the area with no facilities to accommodate … inclement weather, and nowhere to hold events,” she said. “The state government promised a replacement hall, but this part of the school’s master plan remains unfunded.” Victoria’s shadow minister for education, Jess Wilson, said Labor had “broken its promise to deliver these desperately needed projects by November 2026”. “The Allan Labor government has put a go-slow on these upgrades and the needs of students on pause as it scrambles to pay Victoria’s more than one million dollar an hour interest bill,” she said. But Victoria’s education minister, Ben Carroll, said the Liberals were “lying to Victorians” and the budget had delivered funding on “every promised school upgrade”. “Our priority is – and has always been – that every child, no matter where they live, has access to a world-class education for free in a Victorian government school backed by full and fair funding,” he said. Meanwhile, environment groups say nature and biodiversity has been short-changed by the Victorian budget. Environment Victoria welcomed new money for efficient electric hot water and home insulation, but raised concerns about the lack of support for nature or threatened species. Nature campaigner Greg Foyster said: “If the government wants to invest in the great outdoors for the longer term, we need to see a massive increase in funding for parks and reserves, biodiversity programs and saving threatened species. “The Parliamentary Inquiry into Ecosystem Decline recommended increasing funding for parks and reserves to 1% of gross state product. One percent doesn’t seem too much to ask to ensure the survival of all the animals, plants, wetlands, forests and special places in Victoria, but the current funding is pitifully small.” Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Energy and environment department funding was down overall in 2025-26 compared to the previous year. The budget also included a 19% cut to environment and biodiversity, and a reduction in funding for the management of public land and forests of 26%. The Victorian National Parks Association said the budget also locked in previous cuts to Parks Victoria and fisheries officers, with few new initiatives for nature. “Last year we saw Parks Victoria hit with severe staff cuts, arbitrary reviews and the sacking of an experienced CEO. That’s no way to treat the agency responsible for looking after the places millions of Victorians love and rely on,” said VNPA’s executive director, Matt Ruchel. On Tuesday, the environment minister, Steve Dimopoulos, said in a statement: “We’re taking care of our native wildlife and environment while making sure Victorian families can continue to enjoy our amazing zoos and our incredible great outdoors for less.” But the minister did not respond to questions about cuts to environment. Victorian Labor faces continued pressure over recent revelations by the Age that$2.4bn in funding for state schools was quietly delayedin last year’s 2024-25 budget, pushing back its commitment to fully fund public schools by three years to 2031. It places Victoria three years behind Queensland, which has committed to reach 75% of the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) by 2028, and six years behind New South Wales, which is due to reach the benchmark this year. Speaking on ABC Melbourne on Wednesday, the premier, Jacinta Allan, was asked if it was fair forGonski fundingto be delayed by three years. “We are working through the terms of the agreement with the federal government,” she said. “Because what’s not OK is that in the past government schools have not been funded as fairly as non-government schools.” A spokesperson for the federal education minister, Jason Clare, said anagreement had been reached with Victoriato increase the commonwealth funding share to 25% of the SRS by 2034 and, in return, Victoria must reach and maintain the remaining 75%. But when it did so was up to them. “The minister will not be negotiating this bilateral agreement through the media.”",

    "article_text": "Liberal MPs are prepared to accept the Nationals’ watered-down demands to preserve the Coalition, clearing the path to reunite the parties after a split that has exposed deep internal divisions, bruised both leaders and bolstered Anthony Albanese’s grip on power. But the split is expected to have ongoing repercussions even if it is patched up, as both sides privately accuse the other of capitulating during negotiations. In a day of high drama in Canberra, the Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, and the Nationals leader,David Littleproud, agreed to pause the two-day-old breakup after making concessions during crisis talks on Thursday morning. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Ley texted Littleproud at 9am to arrange the talks as some senior Nationals MPs pushed for their leader to reverse the decision to blow up the Coalition. At the meeting, Littleproud guaranteed the Nationals would adhere to shadow cabinet solidarity while Ley committed to fast-track consideration of the country party’s four policy demands: support for nuclear power, breakup powers for supermarkets, a $20bn regional future fund and a guarantee for phone and internet access in the bush. Liberal MPs – who were briefed on the developments at a virtual party room meeting on Thursday afternoon – expect to be summoned to Canberra next week to debate the policies. The four policies were agreed upon, in some form, under former leader Peter Dutton but Ley promised to review them in the wake of the 3 May election defeat. Senior Liberal sources predicted there would be “some grumbling” among colleagues about the policies – divestiture powers, in particular – but expected them to be endorsed in the interest of resurrecting the Coalition. The Nationals have softened their position on nuclear in recent days and were open to supporting a lifting of the John Howard-era moratorium without committing to taxpayer-funded reactors. It is a position that is palatable to the majority of Liberal MPs. Endorsement of the policies would clear the path for the Liberals and Nationals to reunite before the return of federal parliament on 22 July. “There’s definitely a clear pathway now [to re-form the Coalition],” said one Liberal MP, who said the four policies were not “unreasonable”. Sources inside the Liberals and Nationals were on Thursday attempting to frame the pause as a backdown from the other side. “She blinked,” one Nationals MP said of Ley. One senior Liberal MP said Littleproud “lost a lot of skin” over the past 48 hours and his leadership would now be under threat. Pressure was mounting on Littleproud to make up with the Liberals aftersenior Nationals MPs Michael McCormack and Darren Chesterspoke up publicly against the split. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Ley approached McCormack, Chester and Barnaby Joyce – who also questioned the break-up – in an attempt to broker a peace deal. One Liberal source said both leaders ultimately conceded ground. The source said Ley could have avoided “the whole bloody mess” by convening a party room meeting late last week to quickly resolve the policy positions. Ley spent the latter part of last week in her home town of Albury with her terminally-ill mother, who died over the weekend. “I think both David and Sussan miscalculated how serious the other one was [about their position] and how diabolical the outcome would be,” they said. Another Liberal MP said Ley, who is in just her second week as leader, should be praised for saving the Coalition. “If she can pull this off – good on her,” they said. Ley and Littleproud were poised to unveil their respective all-Liberal and all-National frontbench lineups on Thursday, before the announcements were paused after the crisis talks. If the parties are reunited and a Coalition agreement reached, Liberals and Nationals would sit alongside each other in shadow cabinet.",

    "title": "‘It was so unreal’: Norwegian man wakes to cargo ship in his garden",
    "article_text": "A Norwegian man has spoken of the “unreal” moment he woke up to discover that a 135-metre container ship had crashed into his front garden. The cargo vessel, the NCL Salten, had run aground just before 5am on Thursday after entering the Trondheim fjord on its way to the western town of Orkanger. An astonished neighbour watched as the ship, which was travelling at about 16 knots (approximately 30km/h), headed straight for the shore into Johan Helberg’s garden, narrowly missing his house. Helberg,who lives in Byneset, near Trondheim, awoke to his neighbour ringing his doorbell. He looked out of his window to see the ship’s bow. “I went to the window and was quite astonished to see a big ship,” Helberg told the Guardian. “I had to bend my neck to see the top of it. It was so unreal.” There were 16 crew members, among them Norwegians, Lithuanians, Ukrainians and Russians, on board the Cyprus-registered ship. There were no reports of injuries or oil spills. Police are investigating the incident and have identified one suspect on board the boat. “Normally ships turn left or right into the fjord. But this went straight ahead,” Helberg, who has lived in the house for 25 years, added. “It was very close to the house.” Per Christian Stokke, a spokesperson for Trøndelag police district, told NRK: “There is one person on board the boat who has been identified as a suspect.” Police have interviewed the crew and are working on several theories, including technical failure and human error. The shipping company, North Sea Container Line (NCL), said the shipmate had been named a suspect but that it was a routine police procedure. NCL’s chief executive, Bente Hetland, said there was “no reason to believe this was intentional”. “Incidents like this should not happen, and we have started an investigation into the causes. Today, we are relieved that there were no injuries, and our main focus is on the people near the ship and our crew,” she added. The ship remained stuck aground on Thursday after the first attempt to remove it was unsuccessful. They planned to try again in the evening during high tide.",

This blog is now closed, you can read our reporthere And let’s go back toVilnius, Lithuania, for an update on that military ceremony attended by German chancellorFriedrich Merz,hosted by Lithuanian presidentGitanas Nausėda(11:31). Associated Press reported that Merz, the first chancellor to have served in the Bundeswehr himself, declared that “the security of our Baltic allies is also our security” as worries about Russian aggression persist. “We must do everything to defend ourselves – so that we never have to,”Merz said at a ceremony marking the establishment of a German brigade to be deployed there, adding members knew the seriousness of the situation and their responsibilities. … and on that note, it’s a wrap from me,Jakub Krupa, for today.

It was announced in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion ofUkrainein 2022 and isscheduled to reach full operational capacity by 2027(16:29). “We must do everything to defend ourselves – so that we never have to,”Merz said at a ceremony marking the establishment of a German brigade to be deployed there, adding members knew the seriousness of the situation and their responsibilities (14:39). Newpeace talks withUkrainehad “yet to be agreed”, the Kremlin said,disputing reports the two nations would soon hold negotiations at the Vatican (16:42). Polish presidential candidateKarol Nawrockisaid that any discussion on Ukraine’s fast-tracked and “unconditional” accession to Nato was “pointless” and would put the alliance in direct conflict with Russia, as he agreed to a 90-minute YouTube interview with the libertarian far-right candidateSławomir Mentzenwho came third in the first round of the vote last weekend (12:45,13:07,13:27,13:36,14:09).

If you haveany tips, comments or suggestions,email me at jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on Bluesky at@jakubkrupa.bsky.socialand on X at@jakubkrupa. So let’s bring youa few visuals showing Russia’s peace deal demandsto give you an idea of what would it mean for the Ukrainian people. Seán ClarkeandAntonio Voce One of the few explicit peace proposals isa US outline reportedly seen by Reuterslast month. It asksUkraineto accept de jure recognition of Russia’s annexation ofCrimeaand de facto recognition of its occupation of large parts of several oblasts in the country’s east. On Monday,Volodymyr Zelenskyyconfirmed that Russia is demanding Ukrainian troops abandon five oblastsas a precondition not for peace, but for a ceasefire and the opening of negotiations. It is not clear how many people remain in the areas now occupied by the Russians. In some cases, whole towns have been reduced to rubble in the course of the war, and many Ukrainians fled to safety either in Ukrainian-held territory or in other countries. Newpeace talks withUkrainehad “yet to be agreed”, the Kremlin said,disputing reports the two nations would soon hold negotiations at the Vatican, AFP reported. The comments come after diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have stepped up a gear in recent weeks, with Russian and Ukrainian officials holding their first face-to-face talks in more than three years last week in Istanbul. The Wall Street Journalreportedthat follow-up talks between the two sides were expected to take place at the Vatican, starting mid-June, but Kremlin spokespersonDmitry Peskovdenied this. “There have beenno agreements on this matter,” Peskov told reporters. AFP said he also denied Finnish presidentAlexander Stubb’ssuggestion that “technical talks” could take place at the Vatican as early as next week. TheGermanchancellor has visitedLithuaniato markBerlin’s first permanent foreign troop deployment since the second world war, as he called on allies to dramatically expand their efforts to bolster European defences against a hostileRussia. As a crowd waved Lithuanian, German and Ukrainian flags,Friedrich Merzand his defence minister,Boris Pistorius, attended a ceremony launching the official formation of an armoured brigade aimed at protecting Nato’s eastern flank. The new heavy combat unit, the 45th tank brigade, will be comprised of 4,800 German soldiers and 200 civilian staff. It was announced in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion ofUkrainein 2022 and isscheduled to reach full operational capacity by 2027. Merz said: “Together with our partners, we are determined to defend the alliance territory against any aggression. The security of our Baltic allies is also our security.” The deployment, unprecedented for the Bundeswehr,is aimed at shoring up the defence of Lithuania and fellow Baltic republicsEstoniaandLatvia, former Soviet states that have become Nato and EU members and which fear a Russian attack. At a news conference in Vilnius with Lithuania’s president,Gitanas Nausėda, Merz said “Russia’s aggressive revisionism” seeking to redraw the European map created grave security risks for the entire continent, not just Ukraine. Merz, the first chancellor to have himself served in the Bundeswehr, said: “We stand firmly by Ukraine but we also stand together as Europeans as a whole and we play, whenever possible, as a team with the US.” Thecommitment to Baltic security has posed several challenges for Germany, including finding enough personnel willing to serve there. In January, the Bundestag passed legislation to make the prospect more attractive, including more flexible working hours and increased allowances and overtime pay. Let’s go to our Berlin correspondentDeborah Colefor more on chancellor Merz’s visit in Lithuania… Serbianeeds to implement“real reforms”, including on tackling corruption, to ensure its bid for EU membership moves forward, the bloc’s foreign policy chiefKaja Kallassaid on Thursday. Kallas was in Belgrade for meetings with political leaders, including PresidentAleksandar Vucić, who is balancing closer EU ties with traditional links toRussia. At the start of a wider Balkans tour, she called for “actions... to prove and support” Serbia’s strategic ambitions to join the EU, AFP reported. “It is reforms that will allow Serbia to progress on its EU path,” she told a news conference. Kallas’s visit comes aftermonths of wide-spread student proteststriggered by the collapse of the concrete canopy atNovi Sadrailway station, which killed 16 people. Many blamed rampant corruption for the disaster at the station, which Vučić had inaugurated in 2022 after renovations. Italy’s highest courtruled it wasunconstitutional not to legally recognise non-biological mothers on the birth certificatesof children born to same-sex couples through IVF, AFP reported. The finding was hailed“historic”by opposition parties in Italy, which is governed by self-declared “Christian mother”Giorgia Meloni.The far-right leader has railed against the “LGBT lobby” and says she defends traditional family values in the Catholic majority country, AFP said. The Constitutional Court in Rome “ruled as discriminatory the failure to recognise both mothers”, a decision which “effectively becomes law”, lawyer Michele Giarratano told the agency. Civil unions became legal in Italy in 2016 but the law on parental rights for same-sex couples has been unclear. AFP explained that in 2023, Meloni’s interior minister ordered town halls to stop transcribing certificates of children born abroad through surrogacy. In response, prosecutors across Italy began contesting birth certificates of children born abroad or in Italy to same-sex parents – whether through surrogacy or not. The Constitutional Court ruled on Thursday thatrefusing to recognise women who assume parental responsibility for the child their partnercarries “does not guarantee the best interests of the minor” andviolates several articles in the constitution, the agency reported. And let’s go back toVilnius, Lithuania, for an update on that military ceremony attended by German chancellorFriedrich Merz,hosted by Lithuanian presidentGitanas Nausėda(11:31). Associated Press reported that Merz, the first chancellor to have served in the Bundeswehr himself, declared that “the security of our Baltic allies is also our security” as worries about Russian aggression persist. “We must do everything to defend ourselves – so that we never have to,”Merz said at a ceremony marking the establishment of a German brigade to be deployed there, adding members knew the seriousness of the situation and their responsibilities. PresidentEmmanuelMacronsaid Thursday he told his Chinese counterpartXi Jinpingthat companies from both countries “must enjoy fair competition,” AFP reported. “Chinese investment is welcome in France. But our companies must enjoy fair competition in both countries,” Macron wrote on X following talks with Xi. “We agreed to move forward as quickly as possible on the issue of cognac, which is essential for our producers.” Macron, who spoke to Xi ahead of his trip to Southeast Asia starting on Sunday, said he reaffirmed that Chinese investments were welcome in France but that companies must enjoy equitable conditions in the two countries, AFP reported. “It’s a fundamental point,”Macronwrote. In the last ten minutes, they got into the weeds of an apartment scandal that rockedNawrocki’scampaign with questions over the circumstances in which he bought an apartment from an elderly man, and suggestions that he failed to meet his obligations to provide care as part of the transaction. He repeatedly denies all allegations. In his closing statement, Nawrocki says the run off will be“the most important election since 1989,”and I thinkthat will be a sentiment shared by both sides of the campaign. But 90 minutes on, that’s it. Let’s leave it then and check on other news acrossEurope. If you’re wondering why we are carrying these comments at length:backed by the populist-right Law and Justice party which ran Poland 2015 to 2023, Nawrocki is almost 50/50 to be Poland’s next president, which would have substantial consequences for the EU and Nato (as per earlier comments on Ukraine). And he has just signed the eight-point manifesto proposed by Mentzen (12:45), as he hopes to win over his supporters and consolidate the right-wing electorate, which accounted for about 52% of votes in the first round. It’s worth keeping an eye on this. They should be wrapping up soon. Asked about the EU,Nawrockistronglycriticises plans for a more federal EU including any proposals to “build European army,”as he says thatthis push to “centralise” the EU is “a threat to our sovereignty.” He goes on a longer broadside there directly criticising the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for her track record as German defence minister, and even ticks off Belgium for its colonial past with King Leopold II saying the country is not in a position to teach him about “tolerance and openness.” “I can’t imagine that in 20 years we would become EU citizens of Polish origin,” he says, adding “these tendencies are very dangerous for Poland.” He makes claims about German problems with migration, and quips that “instead of migrant integration services, I propose illegal migrant removal centres.” Nawrockisays that any discussion on Ukraine’s fast-tracked and “unconditional” accession to Nato is “pointless” and would put the alliance in direct conflict with Russia. He says he remains opposed to it, even if he wants Ukraine to be “part of the western civilisation,” but caveats that by a long-term perspective of “decades” and “in an ideal world.” Comparing himself to the incumbent conservative president, Andrzej Duda, he says: “I am more critical towards Ukraine.” To give you a taster of what to expect from Karol Nawrocki, who could be the next Polish president after June 1, the pair begins by agreeing onextended criticism of the EU’s New Green Deal,rejection of any migration from Muslim-majority countries to Poland, and theirshared opposition to extended animal rights and Covid closures in 2020 and 2021. Nawrocki also directly commitshe would not send any Polish troops toUkraine.He slightly hesitates when asked if he would resist that even if directly asked to do by US presidentDonald Trump,but ultimately sticks to the original line. Mentzenclearly wants to pushNawrocki, endorsed by the populist-right Law and Justice party, to criticise the last government of this party – and succeeds, at least to a certain extent. Nawrocki occassionally adds some caveats – for example, saying that it’s much easier to criticise lockdowns with hindsight or when discussing proposals for ad valorem taxation on properties – but goes above and beyond to find similarities with Mentzen as he is determined to court this right-wing electorate. Not surprisingly. And don’t just take my word for how potentially significant thisMentzenbroadcast is for the Polish presidential race: it’s carried live by all major news broadcasters, with more than 200,000 people also watching it live on YouTube. They are starting their chat now. I will bring you the key updates here. Next up, I will take you to Poland, where libertarian far-right candidateSławomir Mentzenis about to host one of the remaining two candidates on his YouTube channel as he decides who, if anyone, to endorse before the run-off on 1 June. Mentzen, who came third in the first round of the presidential election last weekend with 14.81% of the vote, will speak to the conservative candidateKarol Nawrocki,endorsed by the populist-right Law and Justice party, at the top of the hour. Later this week, he will also host the winner of the first round vote, the centrist Warsaw mayorRafał Trzaskowski. Ahead of the two conversations, Mentzen had listedeight demands to both presidential candidates. He wants them to promise to block any laws proposing to raise taxes, reduce use of cash, or expand content moderation laws. He also wants his rivals to commit to not sending any Polish troops toUkraineand to blocking Ukraine’s accession to Nato. On EU, he wants them to pledge they wouldn’t “transfer any competences of Polish authorities to EU bodies” nor sign any new treaties “weakening Poland’s role.” Mentzen’s potential endorsement could play a significant rolein the second round as all polls suggest that literally every vote could count given we expect the run-off to beextremelyclose. It could also help the voters of the fourth candidate, far-right leaderGrzegorz Braun, to make their minds up, as they share some of his views. On paper, Nawrocki appears to be ideologically much closer to Mentzen than Trzaskowski, but there are lots of variables at play here, so let’s see how these meetings go. If you want to read up onMentzen’s rapid rise in this year’s electoral campaign into the role of akingpresidentmaker, here’s my recent report from Warsaw. TheEuropean Parliamentvoted toimpose prohibitive tariffs on fertilisers and certain farm produce from Russia and its ally Belarusto prevent a potential threat to EU food security and limit Russian funds for its war againstUkraine, Reuters reported. Tariffs for certain nitrogen-based fertilisers will rise over three years from 6.5% to an amount equivalent to about 100%, a level that would effectively halt trade. For the farm produce, an additional 50% duty will apply, Reuters explained. The hikes are expected totake effect on 1 July. The agency noted that more than 70% of EU fertiliser consumption in 2023 was of the nitrogen-based product targeted, andRussiaaccounted for 25% of EU imports, worth about 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion). France’s interior minister on Thursdaytold police to “step up surveillance at sites linked to the Jewish community”after a gunman shot and killed two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, AFP reported. The security measures must be “visible and dissuasive,”Bruno Retailleausaid in a message seen by AFP. Anumber of European leaders condemned the attack, includingFriedrich Merz, who told a press conference in Vilnius, Lithuania that one of the two Israeli embassy staff killed in Washington DC late Wednesday was possibly a German citizen.",

    "title": "Five Valladolid fans given suspended prison sentences for Vinícius Júnior hate crime",
    "article_text": "Five Valladolid fans who abused the Real Madrid forwardVinícius Júniorhave been given suspended prison sentences, in what La Liga described as a landmark ruling that condemned racist insults hurled in a football stadium as a hate crime. The case goes back to Madrid’s 2-0 win in December 2022 at Real Valladolid’s José Zorrilla Stadium, during which several fans hurled racist abuse at the Brazilian. The individuals were later identified using images and videos published on social media. A court in Valladolid convicted the fans and sentenced them to one year in prison and fines of up to €1,620 (£1,364). The prison sentences were suspended on the condition that the defendants do not commit further offences and refrain from entering stadiums hosting official national competitions for the next three years. The ruling was hailed byLa Liga, which described it as an “unprecedented milestone in the fight against racism in sports in Spain”. Previously, courts had considered racist chants to be an offence against moral integrity, with race as an aggravating factor. “The fact that this ruling explicitly refers to hate crimes associated with racist insults reinforces the message that intolerance has no place in football,” it saidin a statementon Wednesday. The view was echoed by Real Madrid. In recent months, courts in Spain had handed down sentences over racist abuse at stadiums in Valencia, Palma de Mallorca, as well as Vallecas Stadium in Madrid, the clubsaid in a statement. The ruling from Valladolid, however, felt different. “On this occasion, the hate crime convictions represent a unique recognition of the offensive nature of these behaviours.” Vinícius, 24, has long been at theforefront of fightingracism in La Liga after being subjected to racist abuse at more than 10 Spanish grounds. Last year he laid bare the tollexactedby years of racist insults, saying the abuse was chipping away at his desire to play. In recent months his efforts have yielded progress. Late last year police in Spainarrested four menaccused of coordinating an online hate campaign against him. In 2023, four peoplewere arrestedover accusations of hanging an effigy of Vinícius from a Madrid bridge. In November he again addressed his fight against racism, describing it as a continuing battle that he was happy to take on,but addingthat he “can’t fight all that Black people have been suffering” alone. Luka Modric will leaveReal Madridafter the Club World Cup. The 39-year-old, who joined in 2012, has played almost 600 games for the club and won nearly 30 trophies, including a record six Champions League titles and four La Liga trophies. Sign up toFootball Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion His last match at the Bernabéu will be Madrid’s final league game against Real Sociedad. “The time has come,” the midfielder wrote on Instagram. “The moment I never wanted to come, but that’s football, and in life everything has a beginning and an end … On Saturday I will play my last match at the Santiago Bernabéu. “Playing for Real Madrid changed my life as a football player and as a person. I am proud to have been part of one of the most successful eras of the best club in history. Although, after the Club World Cup, I will no longer wear this shirt on the pitch, I will always be a Madridista.”",

    "title": "German troops start first permanent foreign deployment since second world war",
    "article_text": "The German chancellor has visitedLithuaniato mark Berlin’s first permanent foreign troop deployment since the second world war, as he called on allies to dramatically expand their efforts to bolster European defences against a hostile Russia. As a crowd waved Lithuanian, German and Ukrainian flags,Friedrich Merzand his defence minister, Boris Pistorius, attended a ceremony launching the official formation of an armoured brigade aimed at protecting Nato’s eastern flank. The new heavy combat unit, the 45th tank brigade, will comprise 4,800 German soldiers and 200 civilian staff. It was announced in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion ofUkrainein 2022 and is scheduled to reach full operational capacity by 2027. Merz said: “Together with our partners, we are determined to defend the alliance territory against any aggression. The security of our Baltic allies is also our security.” The deployment, unprecedented for the Bundeswehr, is aimed at shoring up the defence of Lithuania and its fellow Baltic republicsEstoniaand Latvia, former Soviet states that have become Nato and EU members and fear a Russian attack. At a news conference in Vilnius with Lithuania’s president,Gitanas Nausėda, Merz said “Russia’s aggressive revisionism” seeking to redraw the European map created grave security risks for the entire continent, not only Ukraine. Merz, the first chancellor to have served in the Bundeswehr, said: “We stand firmly by Ukraine but we also stand together as Europeans as a whole and we play, whenever possible, as a team with the US.” In the buildup to aNatosummit next month in The Hague, Merz said the alliance must “sustainably strengthen European defence capabilities and our defence industry must expand its capabilities – it has to produce more for Europe and produce more in Europe”. Nausėda thanked Merz for Germany’s show of support with the new combat unit formed at the request of Lithuania, which with its 2.9 million inhabitants borders Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave and Moscow-allied Belarus. He said: “We understand the threat and believe that we can face up to the threat with our allies,” noting that Lithuania planned to reach a new Nato goal of spending 5% of gross domestic product on defence by next year. Merz said Germany, as Europe’s biggest economy, would reach the same benchmark by 2032 based on a calculation of 3.5% of GDP for military procurement and 1.5% for infrastructure of military relevance including roads, bridges and ports. Merz’s muscular rhetoric has been welcomed by European partners as a continuation and expansion of theZeitenwende(turning point) in defence policy set out by his predecessor Olaf Scholz. While Scholz’s centre-left-led government created a€100bn (£84bn) special fundto buy defence equipment and eventually met a Nato commitment of defence spending of 2% of GDP, Merz has moved torelease the constitutional debt braketo allow far more military investment. In his first significant speech to parliament last week, Merz vowed after years of neglect to build up Europe’s “strongest conventional army”. Germany has no nuclear weapons of its own. Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion The German chancellor said: “This is appropriate for Europe’s most populous and economically powerful country. Our friends and partners also expect this from us. Indeed, they practically demand it.” Pistorius, who was also defence minister under Scholz, pledged when the new government took over this month that Germany would be “ready to defend every square inch of Nato territory” and called the Lithuania brigade “a clear signal to any potential adversary”. Donald Trump has strong-armed fellow Nato members to increase military spending, often singling out Germany inhis accusations of European “freeloading”at Washington’s expense. The US president has also troubled European allies with conflicting messages on his stance toward Ukraine’s defence, while raising fears about the US commitment to Nato’s mutual defence clause. Asked about reports Trump could order a draw-down from the continent, Merz said on Thursday he had “no indication that the US would withdraw troops from Europe”. The commitment to Baltic security has posed several challenges for Germany, including finding enough personnel willing to serve there. In January, the Bundestag passed legislation to make the prospect more attractive, including more flexible working hours and increased allowances and overtime pay. Before Merz’s visit, Lithuania’s defence minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, told Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper how crucial plausible deterrence towardRussiawas, sharing Pistorius’s assessment that Russia could be in a position to attack a Nato state within five years. She said: “Every Lithuanian knows: if the Russians come, no one will be spared.”",

    "title": "Middle East crisis: Starmer, Macron and Carney ‘on the wrong side of humanity,’ says Netanyahu – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This live blog is now closed. For the latest on the Israel-Gaza war, read our full report: Children and elderly are dying from starvation in Gaza, says health minister Benjamin Netanyahu has launched a blistering attack on Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney, saying the leaders of the UK, France and Canada are on the wrong side of justice. You’re on the wrong side of humanity and you’re on the wrong side of history.” He posted the statement on a video you can see here onXaddressing the murder of the two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington DC. It follows developments earlier this week whenBritain, France and Canada attacked Israel’s expansionof its war as disproportionate, described conditions in Gaza as “intolerable” and threatened a “concrete” response if Israel’s campaign continues. More to follow… It’s nearly 10.30pm in Tel Aviv andGaza. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: Benjamin Netanyahu launched a blistering attack on the leaders of the UK, France and Canada for being “on the wrong side of humanity”.The statement by the Israeli leader came after two Israeli embassy staff members were killed at the Jewish museum in Washington DC, and days after Britain, France and Canada attacked Israel’s expansion of its war as disproportionate, described conditions in Gaza as “intolerable” and threatened a “concrete” response if Israel’s campaign continues. Donald Trump is “saddened and outraged” by the fatal shooting of the two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington DC on Wednesday night,the White House said. The two victims have been identified asYaron LischinskyandSarah Milgrim. US federal agents descended early on Thursday on a Chicago apartment believed to be the home of the alleged gunman, identified as Elias Rodriguez. Flags at Israeli diplomatic missions around the world were lowered to half mast. Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar accused unnamed European officials of “toxic antisemitic incitement”he blamed for a hostile climate in which the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington DC took place. France’s foreign ministry rejected the comments, calling them “unjustified” and “outrageous”. In the last two days, 29 children and elderly people have died from starvation in Gaza,according to the Palestinian Authority health minister, as Israeli strikes killed at least 52 people since dawn amid a renewed military offensive across the territory. In addition, Unicef said more than 9,000 children have been treated for malnutrition in Gaza this year, and food security experts say tens of thousands of cases are expected in the coming year. Flour and other aid starting reaching Palestinians in Gaza on Thursday after Israel began allowing limited goods through,but nowhere near enough to make up for shortages caused by an 11-week blockade. The UN food agency said a handful of bakeries it supports in south and central Gaza have resumed bread production after trucks were finally able to collect cargo from the Kerem Shalom crossing point. The Palestinian Red Crescent said Palestinians in Gaza had yet to receive aid deliveries that had crossed over the border and that sending so few trucks was an “invitation for killing” because of the risk of mobbing. The Israeli army issued an evacuation warning on Thursday for 14 neighbourhoods in the northern Gaza Strip,including parts of Beit Lahia and Jabalia. The Israeli army said in an Arabic-language statement that it was “operating with intense force in your areas, as terrorist organisations continue their activities and operations in the mentioned regions”. The head of the Palestinian Red Crescent said its operations in Gaza may stop within days in the absence of fresh suppliesand its ambulance fleet was running at only a third of capacity due to fuel shortages. Asked how long his organisation could continue operating in Gaza, Palestine Red Crescent Society president Younis Al-Khatib told reporters in Geneva: “It’s a matter of time. It could be days. Ireland’s tánaiste Simon Harris accused the Israeli government of “genocidal activity” in Gaza.Harris said it was “clear” that Israel wants to remove Palestinians from the Gaza Strip as part of what he said was “a consistent pattern of war crimes”, adding that the world had “not done enough” to put pressure on Israel to change course. Netanyahu announced the appointment Maj Gen David Zini as the next head of the Shin Bet domestic security agency,despite Israel’s attorney general saying on Wednesday that Netanyahu was barred from appointing a new Shin Bet chief, following a supreme court ruling that the government’s decision to fire former headRonen Barwas “unlawful”. A Palestinian Red Crescent rescue worker who survived thekilling of 15 paramedics in southern Gazain March was spared because he spoke to Israeli soldiers in Hebrew, the head of the organisation said.Assad Al-Nassasrah,a Red Crescent paramedic who was freed from Israeli detention on 29 April, pleaded in Hebrew and said his mother was a Palestinian citizen of Israel, he said. Iran said that it will hold the US responsible for any Israeli attack on its nuclear sitesin remarks that set a fraught backdrop for the fifth and probably most important round of talks between Iran and the US on the future of Iran’s nuclear program. Benjamin Netanyahuannounced he has appointed Maj GenDavid Zinias the next head of theShin Betdomestic security agency. The announcement comes a day after Israel’s attorney general,Gali Baharav Miara,said Netanyahu was barred from appointing a new Shin Bet chief, following a supreme court ruling that the government’s decision to fire former headRonen Barwas “unlawful”. Zini currently serves as the head of the Israel Defense Forces training command and general staff corps, according to the Times of Israel. APalestinian Red Crescentrescue worker who survived thekilling of 15 paramedics insouthern Gazain March was spared because he spoke to Israeli soldiers in Hebrew, the head of the organisation said. Assad Al-Nassasrah,a Red Crescent paramedic, went missing during the 23 March shootings that drew international condemnation. The bodies of 15 emergency aid workers were uncovered in a mass grave by Red Crescent and UN officials who accused Israeli forces of killing them. Al-Nassasrah was freed from Israeli detention on 29 April; one other paramedic survived. Younis Al-Khatib,president of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, told reporters on Thursday that Al-Nassasrah was spared after he pleaded in Hebrew and said his mother was a Palestinian citizen of Israel. What does Assad say in Hebrew? ‘Don’t shoot. I am Israeli.’ And the soldier got a bit confused. That confusion ... made him survive. “Assad will be a witness that can put all the Israeli stories in shambles,” he added. Al-Khatib said the organisation was working with lawyers and considering formal submissions to international courts and to the UN security council. He said: We think the international community is responsible to provide justice to those killed. We don’t train our people to go and die. Here’s more onBenjamin Netanyahu’s video statement, in which he accused the leaders ofFrance, BritainandCanadaof being “on the wrong side of history”. Last night in Washington, something horrific happened. A brutal terrorist shot in cold blood a young, beautiful couple,Yaron LischinskyandSarah Milgrim. The Israeli prime minister said the “terrorist who cruelly gunned them down” did so because “he wanted to kill Jews”. Netanyahu called out French presidentEmmanuel Macronand the UK and Canadian prime ministers,Keir StarmerandMark Carney,for demanding an immediate ceasefire inGazaand threatening Israel with sanctions. These three leaders effectively said they want Hamas to remain in power. They want Israel to stand down and accept that Hamas’s army of mass murderers will survive, rebuild. Addressing the three leaders directly, Netanyahu said: You’re on the wrong side of justice, you’re on the wrong side of humanity and you’re on the wrong side of history. Benjamin Netanyahu has launched a blistering attack on Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney, saying the leaders of the UK, France and Canada are on the wrong side of justice. You’re on the wrong side of humanity and you’re on the wrong side of history.” He posted the statement on a video you can see here onXaddressing the murder of the two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington DC. It follows developments earlier this week whenBritain, France and Canada attacked Israel’s expansionof its war as disproportionate, described conditions in Gaza as “intolerable” and threatened a “concrete” response if Israel’s campaign continues. More to follow… The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has told the media that Donald Trump is “saddened and outraged” by the fatal shooting of the two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington DC last night. She adds: “The department of justice will be prosecuting the perpetrator of this to the full extent of the law.” Leavitt confirms that Trump spoke toBenjamin Netanyahuearlier today. She says Trump believes things are moving in the right direction, and the two leaders talked about a potential deal withIran. Earlier Reuters reported that US special envoySteve Witkoffwill travel to Rome on Friday for a new round of talks with an Iranian delegation over Tehran’s nuclear program. It will be the fifth such round of talks. The source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity, that Witkoff will be joined by a top state department official,Michael Anton. “Discussions are expected to be both direct and indirect, as in previous rounds,” the source said. Benjamin Netanyahu said construction of the first humanitarian aid distribution zones in Gaza would be complete in the coming days, Reuters reported. It comes afterIsraelallowed 100 trucks carrying baby food and medical equipment into the enclave on Wednesday. “Ultimately, we intend to have large safe zones in the south of Gaza. The Palestinian population will move there for their own safety, while we conduct combat in other zones,” Netanyahu added in a video statement released by his office on Thursday. However, Palestinian Red Crescent said on Thursday that people inGazahave yet to receive aid deliveries that have crossed over the border and that sending so few trucks was an “invitation for killing” because of the risk of mobbing. Twenty-nine children and elderly people have died from starvation in Gaza in the last two days, the Palestinian Authority health minister has said. You can read our report here: Iran has said that it will hold the US responsible for any Israeli attack on its nuclear sites in remarks that set a fraught backdrop for the fifth and probably most important round of talks between Iran and the US on the future of Iran’s nuclear program. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, issued the warning on Thursday after reports appeared in the America media claiming US intelligence understood Israel was planning an attack on Iranian nuclear sites – with or without American support – if the talks broke down. The report may be accurate or alternatively an attempt by the US to strengthen its negotiating hand before the indirect talks in Rome, which are being mediated by Oman. Israel has repeatedly said it will attack Iran’s nuclear sites, whileDonald Trumphas said the US will do so if the talks break down. Araghchi said in a letter to the United Nations: “Iran strongly warns against any adventurism by the Zionist regime of Israel and will decisively respond to any threat or unlawful act by this regime.” He said Iran would view Washington as a “participant” in any such attack, and Tehran would have to adopt “special measures” to protect its nuclear sites and material from any attacks or sabotage. Araghchi said the UN nuclear inspectorate, the IAEA, would only be subsequently informed of such steps. You can read the full piece here Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Donald Trump on Thursday and they discussed the killing oftwo Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, a statement from the Israeli PM’s office said. The two leaders also discussed the war inGaza, and Trump expressed his support for Netanyahu’s goals which include the release of all hostages, according to the statement. The Israeli army has warned residents in the southern Lebanese town of Toul to evacuate the area around a building it said was used by Hezbollah militants. The “urgent warning” on Thursday was accompanied by a map showing a structure and the 500-metre radius around it marked in red, Agence France-Presse reported. “You are located near facilities belonging to the terrorist (group) Hezbollah,” the statement said in Arabic, urging people “to evacuate these buildings immediately and move away from them”. Israel has kept up its air strikes in neighbouring Lebanon despite a November truce aimed at halting more than a year of hostilities with Hezbollah that included two months of full-blown war. Under the ceasefire, Hezbollah fighters were to pull back north of the Litani River and dismantle military infrastructure south of it. Israel was to withdraw all forces from Lebanon, but it has kept troops in five areas that it deems “strategic”. The Lebanese army has deployed in the south and has been dismantling Hezbollah infrastructure. Ayman Odeh, a member of the Arab-Jewish Hadash party, was forcefully removed from the podium in the Israeli parliament as he criticised Israel’s war on Gaza and the mounting death toll. The UN food agency said on Thursday that a handful of bakeries it supports in south and centralGazahave resumed bread production after trucks were finally able to collect cargo from the Kerem Shalom crossing point. “We are in a race against time to prevent widespread starvation,” said WFP country director Antoine Renard in a statement to journalists. Smoke rises to the sky after an Israeli bombardment in the Gaza Strip, as seen from southernIsrael. The head of the Palestinian Red Crescent said on Thursday its operations inGazamay stop within days in the absence of fresh supplies and its ambulance fleet was running at only a third of capacity due to fuel shortages. Flour and other aid began reaching some of Gaza’s most vulnerable areas on Thursday afterIsraellet some trucks through, but nowhere near enough to make up for shortages caused by an 11-week Israeli blockade, Palestinian officials said. Israel said it let in 100 trucks carrying baby food and medical equipment on Wednesday, two days after announcing its first relaxation of the blockade under mounting international pressure amid warnings of starvation in Gaza, Reuters reported. Asked how long his organisation could continue operating in Gaza, Palestine Red Crescent Society president Younis Al-Khatib told reporters in Geneva: “It’s a matter of time. It could be days. “We are running out of fuel. The capacity of ambulances we work with now is one-third,” he added, saying its gasoline-powered ambulances had already halted but it had some that were running on solar power provided by the United Nations. The PRCS is part of the world’s largest humanitarian network, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and provides medical care in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. France rejects Israeli comments accusing some European officials of antisemitic incitement, foreign ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine told reporters at a weekly news conference, adding these comments were “unjustified” and outrageous”. “France has condemned, France condemns and France will continue to condemn always and without ambiguity all antisemitic acts,” he said. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has said he has no interest in running again to be the country’s president, dispelling fears he would seek a third term under the current presidential system which would see he tenure as the Turkey’s leader enter its third decade. Erdoğan was speaking about the need for a new constitution in Turkey and called on opposition parties to participate during a flight to Hungary, according to local media. The last time Turkey’s constitution was changed from a ceremonial to executive presidency in 2017 Erdoğan said it re-set the clock on his terms. He had served as president since 2014 and was prime minister before that from 2003. His current term ends in 2028. Erdoğan told reporters he had “no concern about being re-elected or running for office again” but wanted a new constitution “for our country”. He added: “Our concern is how we can increase the reputation of our country with the steps we will take.” The statementcomesas his most popular challenger, Ekrem Imamoglu, the Istanbul mayor, remains behind bars in pre-trial detention on corruption charges. The move, which the opposition CHP party says was politically motivated, triggered protests across the country for the last month. The UN humanitarian aid organisation for children, Unicef,says more than 9,000 children have been treated for malnutrition inGazathis year, and food security experts say tens of thousands of cases are expected in the coming year, reports the Associated Press (AP). Experts also warn the territory could plunge into famine ifIsraeldoes not stop its military campaign and fully lift its blockade – but theWorld Health Organizationsaid last week that people are already starving. “Everywhere you look, people are hungry … They point their fingers to their mouths showing that [they] need something to eat,” saidNestor Owomuhangi, the representative of theUnited Nations Population Fund for the Palestinian territories. “The worst has already arrived in Gaza.” “Children are already dying from malnutrition and there are more babies in Gaza now who will be in mortal danger if they don’t get fast access to the nutrition supplies needed to save their lives,” saidTess IngramofUnicef.",

    "title": "Violent Israeli settlers under UK sanctions join illegal West Bank outpost",
    "article_text": "Two violent Israeli settlers on whom sanctions were imposed by the UK government this week have joined a campaign to drive Palestinians from their homes in theWest Bankvillage of Mughayyir al-Deir. Neria Ben Pazi’s organisation, Neria’s Farm, hadsanctions imposed by London on Tuesday, as the UK suspended negotiations on a new free-trade deal with Israel over its refusal to allow aid into Gaza and cabinet ministers’ calls to “purify Gaza” by expelling Palestinians. The British foreign secretary, David Lammy, attacked the “impunity” of violent settlers as he announced sanctions designed to hold them and Israeli authorities to account. “The Israeli government has a responsibility to intervene and halt these aggressive actions,” he said. Ben Pazi himself was put on the UK sanctions list last year, with the government citing his role building illegal outposts and forcing Palestinian Bedouin families from their homes. This week he made repeated long visits to an illegal outpost set up on Sunday less than 100 metres from a Palestinian home on the edge of Mughayyir al-Deir, a community of around 150 bedouins. Another visitor to the outpost, photographed on Wednesday and identified by local activists, was Zohar Sabah. He visited the day after he was added to the UK sanctions list for “threatening, perpetrating, promoting and supporting acts of aggression and violence against Palestinian individuals”. The settlers set up a basic shelter next to a sheep enclosure with a small herd, which formed the base for a campaign of intimidation that began immediately. “I haven’t slept since they came, and the children are terrified,” said Ahmad Sulaiman, a 58-year-old father of eleven whose home was closest to the outpost. Born just a stone’s throw away, he had spent his life in Mughayyir al-Deir, but by Thursday he was packing to leave, although the family did not know where they would go. “The settlers told me: ‘This is our home’,” said Sulaiman. “There is nothing I can do. They have guns and other weapons.” The intended deterrent effect of the UK sanctions was not visible at Mughayyir al-Deir, where settlers expanded their campaign of intimidation in the days after the British announcement, and the only public response from Israeli officials was a visit in support of the settlers. Zvi Sukkot, a member of the Knesset and the far-right Religious Zionist party, was filmed by activists as he left the illegal outpost. During a debate on Israel’s Channel 12 last week Sukkot said: “Everyone has got used to the idea that we can kill 100 Gazans in one night during a war and nobody in the world cares.” The hills nearby are surrounded by the burned remains of Palestinian villages, whose residents were forced out by campaigns run from similar Israeli outposts. But setting up such a short distance from the Palestinians being targeted is unprecedented. Yonatan Mizrachi, the co-director of Settlement Watch, part of the campaign group Peace Now, said settler outposts had been getting nearer to Palestinian communities since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, “but I don’t remember any others that were established so close”. “It shows the settlers’ lack of fear, and the understanding that they can do what they like; they can just set up in the Palestinian community. And they didn’t come to be good neighbours,” Mizrachi added. Sabah was indicted by Israeli authorities in September for his role in an attack on a school in Mu’arrajat East, where settlers targeted teachers, a 13-year-old pupil and the principal, who was hospitalised. Shai Parnes, a spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B’tselem, said: “Israeli policy to take as much land as possible hasn’t changed. But what has been changing under this current government is the total impunity for soldiers and settlers. “They used to hide their faces or attack at night, everything is happening much more brutal and violent and it is happening in broad daylight. They are really proud about what they’re doing, sometimes even uploading the assaults themselves to social media.” Forced displacement began before the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent ongoing Gaza war, but hasintensifiedsince then. Around 1,200 Palestinians, nearly half of them children, have been forced to leave 20 communities, according to figures from B’tselem. It is a second displacement for families such as Sulaiman’s, who lived near what is now the Israeli city of Be’er Sheva until 1948. They were forced out in the nakba, or catastrophe, in which about 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homes in 1948 after the creation of Israel. Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank began in 1967. Around 500,000 Jewish Israelis live in settlements there, all illegal under international law. Dozens of small makeshift outposts are also illegal under Israeli law – like the one set up in Mughayyir al-Deir – but authorities rarely try to remove them. Ben Pazi set up his own farm in the area east of Ramallah in 2018 and has been involved in attacks and land grabs in the area for many years, according to the British and US governments. Most use a combination of attacks on people, destruction of property and deployment of herds of sheep and goats to graze land where Palestinians have fed their flocks for decades. The US state department said in 2024, when sanctions were imposed on Ben Pazi under the Biden administration: “Ben Pazi has expelled Palestinian shepherds from hundreds of acres of land. In August 2023, settlers including Ben Pazi attacked Palestinians near the village of Wadi as-Seeq.” Donald Trump lifted those sanctions. Ben Pazi’s violence attracted the attention of Israel’s military commander for the region, Maj Gen Yehuda Fuchs, who issued an administrative order barring Ben Pazi from entering the West Bank in late 2023. Ben Pazi’s role in the campaign to force Palestinians out of Mughayyir al-Deir was unclear. He hung up when the Guardian called to ask for comment, and did not respond to further messages. The Guardian was unable to contact Sabah. Ben Pazi was a regular visitor to the new outpost, spending several hours there on at least three days this week, according to several Israeli activists who recognised him from work in the region. On one visit he was photographed greeting an unidentified man wearing a military-style uniform. A spokesperson for the Israeli military said the country’s armed forces did not authorise or organise the forced displacement of Mughayyir al-Deir. “The alleged evacuation was neither conducted by [IDF troops ] nor carried out with their approval,” a spokesperson said. Asked why the military did not remove the illegal outpost, they said any demolition would be a political decision. “Enforcement against unlawful construction in the area is undertaken in accordance with the priorities set by the political echelon and is carried out under its authorisation,” the spokesperson said. Ben Pazi drove a group of settlers and equipment to the edge of the village, where they started erecting a fence around land where Palestinians had lived and farmed for decades. Parnes, of B’tselem, said: “The international community have so much more to do in terms of directing steps towards the Israeli government. “What is happening is not just about a violent threat in this place or that; it’s all part of a well-defended and subsidised policy run by the government.”",

    "article_text": "Iran has said it will hold the US responsible for any Israeli attack on its nuclear sites in remarks that set a fraught backdrop for the fifth and probably most important round of talks between Iran and the US on the future of Iran’s nuclear program. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, issued the warning on Thursday after reports appeared in the American media claiming US intelligence understood Israel was planning an attack on Iranian nuclear sites – with or without American support – if the talks broke down. The report may be accurate or an attempt by the US to strengthen its negotiating hand before the indirect talks in Rome, which are being mediated by Oman. Israel has repeatedly said it will attack Iran’s nuclear sites, whileDonald Trumphas said the US will do so if the talks break down. In a letter to the UN, Araghchi said: “Iran strongly warns against any adventurism by the Zionist regime of Israel and will decisively respond to any threat or unlawful act by this regime.” He said Iran would view Washington as a “participant” in any such attack, and Tehran would have to adopt “special measures” to protect its nuclear sites and material from any attacks or sabotage. Araghchi said the UN nuclear inspectorate, the IAEA, would only be subsequently informed of such steps. An adviser to Iran’s supreme leader said in April that Tehran could suspend cooperation with the UN nuclear inspectors or transfer enriched material to safe and undisclosed locations. In a separate statement released on Thursday, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said Israel would receive a “devastating and decisive response” if it attacked Iran. Alimohammad Naini , the guards’ spokesperson, said: “They are trying to frighten us with war but are miscalculating as they are unaware of the powerful popular and military support the Islamic Republic can muster in war conditions.” Iran’s supreme leader,Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Tuesday that US demands for Tehran to stop refining uranium were “excessive and outrageous”, his most unequivocal statement that Iran will not abandon the capacity to enrich. But he said he did not expect the talks with the US to succeed. The US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has insisted that Washington’s red line is that Iran must end all uranium enrichment. In the 2015 deal with six world powers,from which Trump withdrew in 2018, Iran had been allowed to enrich to 3.67% purity, sufficient for producing fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. Iran has since enriched to 60%, bringing it close to the purity required to make a nuclear bomb. Araghchi initially said the US public demand for zero enrichment was not being repeated in private discussions, but the issue appears to have become the central battleground of the talks. The US says zero enrichment is the only way to end the risk of Iran acquiring a nuclear bomb and has suggested Tehran follows the model of the United Arab Emirates that imports uranium for its single civil nuclear program. But Iran says it has a right to enrich under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and argues there is no reason for it to be treated differently to other states. Explaining Iran’s determination to enrich domestically, as opposed to import, Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations said: “Iran really does feel that it has paid a huge cost for its right to enrich on its own soil. It has not only paid billions in actually setting up the infrastructure, but it has paid billions in sanctions that were imposed on it and the loss of oil sales. “Iranian officials believe they have paid with blood, in reference to scientists that have been assassinated throughout the course of the last few decades working on this programme. This programme and the right for enrichment for civil nuclear purposes, has now become an issue of national pride.”",

    "title": "Children and elderly are dying from starvation in Gaza, says health minister",
    "article_text": "Twenty-nine children and elderly people have died from starvation in Gaza in the last two days, the Palestinian Authority health minister has said , as Israeli strikes killed at least 52 people since dawn amid a renewed military offensive across the territory. The warning came as food aid is expected to start reaching Palestinians inGazathis week after Israel began allowing limited goods through after nearly three months after global pressure to lift the blockade and halt a newly expanded offensive. Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, said on Thursday about 90 trucks, out of almost 200, carrying medicine, wheat flour and nutrition supplies, had entered Gaza. Laerke said aid groups were facing significant challenges distributing the aid because of insecurity, the risk of looting and coordination issues with Israeli authorities. However, the Palestinian Red Crescent said on Thursday that Palestinians in Gaza had yet to receive aid deliveries that had crossed over the border and that sending so few trucks was an “invitation for killing” because of the risk of mobbing. “I can prove that nobody has received [aid]. No civilian has received anything yet. In fact, say most of these trucks are still in Kerem Shalom at the border, inspected, but not into Gaza,” Younis al-Khatib, the president of the Palestine Red Crescent society, told reporters. “It’s very hard to hide the rush or the looting that will happen,” he added. Malnutrition is spreading in Gaza, medics and aid workers in the devastated Palestinian territory have warned for months, with aid distribution being hindered by displacement, bakeries operated by the UN World Food Programme shut due to a lack of cooking gas, and soaring prices for the limited amount of food available in shops and markets. “In the last couple of days we lost 29 children,” the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority health minister, Majed Abu Ramadan, told reporters, describing them as “starvation-related deaths”. He later clarified that the total included elderly people as well as children. The Palestinian Authority has partial control over the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967, but Hamas has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. Earlier this month,the IPC estimatedthat nearly 71,000 children under the age of five are expected to be “acutely malnourished”, with 14,100 cases expected to be severe over the next 11 months. Israel imposed the blockade on all supplies in March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters – a charge the group denies. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said that half a million people in the Gaza Strip face starvation. Abu Ramadan, who was mayor of Gaza City from 2005 to 2008, said that only seven or eight hospitals out of Gaza’s 36 were partially functioning, and that more than 90% of medical stocks were now at zero due to the blockade. “My information is that very few shipments went inside Gaza – 90 to 100 truckloads and in the south and mid zones.” Asked if there were any medical supplies among them, he said: “As far as I know … it’s only flour for bakeries.” UN agencies have said that the amount of aid entering Gaza falls far short of what is required to ease the crisis. Umm Talal al-Masri, 53, a displaced Palestinian in Gaza City, described the situation as “unbearable”. Hossam Abu Aida, 38, said: “I am tormented for my children.” He told AFP: “For them, I fear hunger and disease more than I do Israeli bombardment.” AFP footage showed bags of recently delivered flour at a bakery in the central city of Deir el-Balah, where workers and a host of machines began kneading, shaping, baking and packaging stack after stack of pita bread. The UN humanitarian aid organisation for children, Unicef, says more than 9,000 children have been treated for malnutrition in Gaza this year, and food security experts say tens of thousands of cases are expected in the coming year. Experts also warn the territory could plunge into famine if Israel does not stop its military campaign and fully lift its blockade, but the World Health Organization said last week that people are already starving. New data shared with the Guardian by the US-based Project Hope, which focuses on healthcare, one of the few humanitarian organisations still operating health clinics in Gaza, ‘‘found that malnutrition among children, pregnant and lactating women has surged amid the almost three-month aid blockade, with some clinics reporting up to 42% of pregnant women and 34% of lactating mothers being diagnosed as malnourished”. “Children are also increasingly affected,” according to a statement from Hope. “Our teams on the ground report that more and more families are relying on our clinics for nutritional supplements and that children visiting Project Hope clinics have gone for weeks only consuming high-energy biscuits and ready-to-use therapeutic food – items given to malnourished patients for short-term survival needs, rather than sustained nourishment.” Ghadeer, a nurse with Project Hope in Gaza, said: “The number of malnutrition cases has skyrocketed. Two months ago, malnutrition cases did not exceed 50 cases per day. Now, we’re seeing about 200 cases per day. Many of the children we see haven’t eaten real food in weeks – only the nutritional biscuits we distribute. They’re losing weight, becoming withdrawn, and getting sick more easily. We are doing everything we can, but we’re seeing the consequences of extreme hunger in an entire generation. Without more food and aid coming in, I fear for their future.” Meanwhile, plumes of smoke rose Thursday over the northern Gaza Strip where Israel’s military urged civilians to evacuate, as rescuers said Israeli strikes across the territory killed more than 50 people. Gaza’s civil defence agency said there had been “52 martyrs and dozens injured as a result of airstrikes carried out by the occupation” across the territory. The intensified Israeli offensive has drawn criticism, with EU foreign ministers agreeing on Tuesday to review the bloc’s cooperation accord with Israel.",

    "title": "Kneecap say terror charge is part of ‘witch-hunt’ to prevent Glastonbury gig",
    "article_text": "The Northern Irish rap trio Kneecap have claimed a campaign is being mounted to prevent their performance at Glastonbury this summer, at a surprise gig staged a day after one of its members was charged with a terror offence. The group told the crowd at the 100 Club in central London on Thursday night that they were being used as a “scapegoat” because they “spoke about the genocide [in Gaza]” at Coachella in April. On Wednesday Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, 27, who performs under the stage name Mo Chara,was charged with a terrorism offencefor allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a gig in London last November. The rap trio called the charge “political policing” which it said was intended to stifle criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza. Hours after the charge, they announced an impromptu gig. They said the event sold out in 90 seconds, with 2,000 people on the waiting list. Ó hAnnaidh arrived on stage at 9pm with tape over his mouth. He said: “There’s a reason where what’s happened to me, happened before Glastonbury. There’s a reason they’re trying to fucking stop me speaking at Glastonbury in front of the UK.” Naoise Ó Cairealláin, 30, who performs under the name Móglaí Bap, said: “This is our first gig back after [Coachella]. They want to stop what we’re doing, because they want us to stop protesting.” “There’s 60,000 plus dead in Gaza right now. That’s the real story, it’s not about us,” he added. During their Coachella set on 18 April, the band led the crowd in chants of “free, free Palestine” and displayed various messages on the stage’s screens including: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people.” Ó hAnnaidh said on Thursday: “The reason that we are being witch-hunted here is because we at Coachella spoke about this about the genocide. “We’re not the fucking story here, they’re using us as a scapegoat not to talk about the real fucking issue.” The poster for Thursday’s surprise concert featured a recent quote from the former Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon, who said the trio “need a bloody good kneecapping” in response to the controversy around them. Last month, counter-terrorism police assessed footage of the band from November 2023 which appeared to show one person of them saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” Brendan Cox, the husband of MP Jo Cox, and Katie Amess, the daughter of MP David Amess, who were both murdered, criticised the trio’s comments. In a statement, the band said: “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” adding that the clip had been taking out of context. The band has been removed from several festival lineups, including scheduled German appearances at Hurricane festival and Southside festival. They were also axed from the Eden Project in Cornwall and Plymouth Pavilions. MPs have continued to call for them to be removed from the line-ups of TRNSMT, Glastonbury and other upcoming events. However, there were no announcements of further cancellations after the news of Ó hAnnaidh being charged. The group from Belfast, who rap in the Irish language, have a headline slot at Wide Awake Festival in Brockwell Park, south London, on Friday night. The band said they would vehemently contest what they called a politically motivated charge in a statement before the concert. “A charge not serious enough to even warrant their crown court, instead a court that doesn’t have a jury. What’s the objective? To restrict our ability to travel. To prevent us speaking to young people across the world. To silence voices of compassion. To prosecute artists who dare speak out.”",

    "title": "Number of vape shops in England rises by almost 1,200% in a decade",
    "article_text": "The number of vape shops on high streets acrossEnglandhas increased by almost 1,200% over the past decade, while deprived areas have up to 25 times as many bookmakers and pawnbrokers as affluent ones, according to research. In 2014, only 33.8% of 317 local authorities in England had a vape shop, rising to 97.2% in 2024. Similarly, in 2014 less than 1% of local authorities in England had 10 or more vape shops, rising to 28% in 2024. The study, conducted by researchers atHealth Equity North, looked at Ordnance Survey data to track how amenities had changed between 2014 and 2024. The amenities were divided into those seen as “health promoting”, such as pharmacies, libraries and supermarkets, and “health reducing” such as vape shops, bookmakers, takeaways and alcohol-only outlets. They found a stark decline in healthier amenities, with unhealthy alternatives taking their place. Takeaway shops were up by almost a quarter (24%) across England, while the number of banks and building societies decreased by 40%, and supermarkets by 10%. The report found there were stark regional divides across England regarding high-street amenities, with twice as many vape shops in the north of England. The number of takeaways in the north of England rose by a third (31%), compared with a rise of 18% in the south. There were three times as many vape shops in deprived areas compared with the least deprived ones. Deprived areas also had 25 times more pawnbrokers and more than three times as many bookmakers. Dr Eman Zied Abozied, research associate at Newcastle University Population Sciences Institute, said the study showed that high streets were becoming “less healthy and welcoming places to visit”. “The disappearance of amenities such as supermarkets, banks, pharmacies and public toilets particularly affects groups such as women, children and the elderly,” she said. “But what we’re seeing impacts all of us. The deterioration of our high streets makes our centres feel less safe, less inviting, and ultimately makes us feel more disconnected as communities.” She added: “It is important that we act now to reverse this decline. If we involve local communities in making decisions about their high streets, we can make our high streets and towns more accessible and healthy for everyone.” Prof Clare Bambra, an academic co-director atHealthEquity North and professor of public health at Newcastle University, said: “Over the last decade, our high streets have been hit by a devastating succession of shocks – from the impact of austerity to the Covid-19 pandemic. They’ve also been hollowed out by changing spending habits, and the rising cost of living. “This trend has disproportionately affected the most deprived places in our country. The northern high street now has fewer places to go to buy essentials, as well as fewer supermarkets, public toilets and other amenities and resources. The north has twice as many vape shops as the south, as well as more takeaway outlets and bookmakers. “You should be able to walk down a high street, and feel the uniqueness, culture and identity of that community. Through innovative design, better public transport, and measures that promote people over cars, we can rethink these spaces so they become ‘go-to’s’ rather than ‘ghost towns’.” A government spokesperson said:“For years high streets have been starved of investment despite their potential to thrive, but we are taking decisive action to turn the tide through our Plan for Change. “Councils and local leaders have powers to tackle persistently vacant properties in city, town and village centres by putting the leases up for auction to help restrict the types of businesses that fill those lots. “We are driving regeneration and growth with £1.5billion through the Plan for Neighbourhoods to boost high streets, and we’re bringing empty shops back to life through our high street rental auctions.” City of London, London: 4.6 Blackburn with Darwen, north-west: 1.7 Preston, north-west: 1.6 Blackpool, north-west: 1.2 Bolton, north-west: 1.2 Lincoln, East Midlands: 1.2 Thanet, south-east: 1.2 Chesterfield, East Midlands: 1.1 Hyndburn, north-west: 1.1 Derbyshire Dales, East Midlands: 1",

    "article_text": "The miscarriage of justice watchdog for England, Wales andNorthern Irelandhas continually failed to learn from its mistakes and its chief executive should follow the organisation’s chair out the door, MPs have said. In adamning reporton the leadership of the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the House of Commons justice committee said Karen Kneller had provided it with unpersuasiveevidenceand her position was no longer tenable. It said that the chief executive should follow in the footsteps of Helen Pitcher,who quit in Januaryafter an independent panel concluded she was no longer fit to be chair after the CCRC’s failings overAndrew Malkinson. The justice committee’s report, published on Friday, said the CCRC’s delay in publishing Chris Henley KC’s review into the handling of theMalkinson miscarriage of justice caseand attempts to minimise the damage to its reputation represented a “spectacular failure of leadership”. It accused Kneller of giving “problematic” evidence to the committee as to the reasons for the delay and failing to acknowledge attempts by the CCRC to water down Henley’s findings. The committee chair, Labour’s Andy Slaughter, said: “The committee cannot perform our scrutiny function if witnesses provide incomplete or partial responses to our questions. The information provided since the session establishes that Karen Kneller omitted important information that would have provided a more accurate account of how the CCRC handled the Henley report. “As a result of our concerns regarding the performance of the CCRC and the unpersuasive evidence Karen Kneller provided to the committee, we no longer feel that it is tenable for her to continue as chief executive of the CCRC.” The committee also deemed justifications given by Kneller for her attendance atexpensive training courses in Franceusing public money to be unsatisfactory. The CCRC had “deteriorated significantly” and required root and branch reform, the report found. Criticisms included the current lack of a chair, for which it said the Ministry of Justice bore some responsibility; the CCRC’s struggle to secure a sufficient number of commissioners; and the move to fully remote working, which “is out of step with the rest of the public sector and seems unsuited to the nature of their work”. The committee said that while Henley’s review focused on one case, it had “significant implications for the CCRC’s overall approach to its casework. The mistakes made in relation to Andrew Malkinson’s application should have been taken as evidence of systemic problems within the CCRC.” Slaughter said: “For an organisation that is designed to identify failures within the criminal justice system, the CCRC’s leadership has shown a remarkable inability to learn from its own mistakes.” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The report comes 10 days afterPeter Sullivan had his wrongful murder conviction quashedafter 38 years in prison. The Labour peer and former justice secretary Charlie Falconer said that while it was true that when Sullivan first applied to the CCRC in 2008 forensic testing techniques were not sufficiently advanced to exonerate him, it should have proactively reviewed his case and more than 1,500 others when a more accurate test became available in 2013. Falconer said the CCRC was “generally regarded as useless”. A CCRC spokesperson said it noted the committee’s recommendations, adding: “We look forward to an announcement on the appointment of an interim chair and to working with them in an organisation deeply committed to finding, investigating and referring potential miscarriages of justice.”",

    "article_text": "There are less than 80 miles between them, but the gulf in quality is massive, according to a Which? survey that ranked Gloucester services top of the stops, and Bridgwater bottom. For many people motorway service stations are a place to take a break, grab a snack and use the toilet, but the rankings from the consumer recommendation group, which surveyed users of nearly 100 service stations across Great Britain, highlight the best and worst. The gulf in standards is vast, with some described as “perfect to break up your journey” while others “look and feel filthy” and smell of “stale urine”. The rankings place Gloucester higher than 89 competitors, awarding it five-star ratings in several categories such as shops, food and drink, facilities, cleanliness, convenience and accessibility, and outside space. The M5 service station, which earned an overall rating of 85%, is owned by Westmorland Family, which also owns Tebay services in Cumbria and Cairn Lodge in Lanarkshire, which finished second and fourth respectively. They are joined in the top five by Rugby services, owned by Moto, in third and Extra’s Leeds Skelton Lake in fifth. Moto’s Rugby branch is one of 37 stations the company owns that are spread across the list, including nine in the bottom 10. Moto’s Bridgwater station inSomersetranked last, with a customer score of 23% and one-star ratings across all categories. Only slightly above is Leeming Ba in North Yorkshire, also ranked one star across the board and with a score of 26%. The rankings were compiled by more than 4,000 Which? members based on their experiences during a combined 9,000 visits to service stations across Great Britain. Ken McMeikan, the chief executive of Moto Hospitality, said the survey results used a smaller pool of respondents than a previous study that ranked Moto stations highly, and that the company was investing heavily in improving the facilities of its branches, where cleanliness was mentioned by numerous respondents as an issue. “The most recent independentTransportFocus study, conducted in the summer of 2023, surveyed a significantly larger group than the Which? panel,” he said. “Moto achieved an average customer satisfaction score of 94% across our motorway service areas. This feedback highlights the positive impact of our ongoing efforts. “We are committed to reviewing the specific issues raised by the Which? panel and will continue to strive for enhancements across all sites. Our goal is to ensure that we always meet the high standards and expectations that our customers deserve.”",

    "article_text": "Several people have died, including the co-founder of a music agency, after a small aircraft crashed in a neighborhood inSan Diegoearly on Thursday morning, clipping one home and damaging several vehicles. Sound Talent Group, which has represented artists such as Sum 41 and Vanessa Carlton, confirmed on Thursday that three of its employees died on the private plane. Among those who died was the agency’s co-founder Dave Shapiro, who was listed as the owner of the plane and has a pilot’s license, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Six people were onboard the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, but the total number of deaths is unknown. Several people on the ground were injured as they tried to flee, including five people from a family who were treated for smoke inhalation and another person who was injured as they attempted to climb out of a window. Dan Eddy, the assistantSan Diegofire chief, said at a news conference that the crash had killed the plane’s passengers. The incident was reported in the Murphy Canyon community, near the Montgomery-Gibbs executive airport, around 3.47am local time. Amid foggy weather, the plane reportedly struck at least one home, charring the structure and causing the roof to collapse, and damaged several vehicles. Authorities said the crash damaged about 10 homes, and left jet fuel throughout the area. Media reported the area was covered in glass and an extensive debris field as a thick black smoke lingered. “I can’t quite put words to describe what the scene looks like, but with the jet fuel going down the street, and everything on fire all at once, it was pretty horrific to see,” said Scott Wahl, the San Diego police chief. Christopher Moore, who lives near the crash site, told the Associated Press that a loud bang woke him and his wife and that when they looked out their window they saw smoke. The couple grabbed their two young children and ran out of the house, seeing a car in flames as they fled the neighborhood. At least 100 residents of the neighborhood evacuated. Meanwhile, authorities closed nearby roads, diverting drivers on northbound Interstate 15. The Federal Aviation Administrationreporteda Cessna 550 aircraft crashed at about 3.45am local time near the Montgomery-Gibbs executive airport, with an unknown number of people onboard. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. Officials said they will investigate whether the plane may have hit a power line. Sound Talent Group has not yet shared the names of the other two employees who died. “We are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends. Our hearts go out to their families and to everyone impacted by today’s tragedy,” the agency said in a statement. Associated Press contributed reporting",

    "title": "FDA advisers recommend Covid vaccine updates to target new strains",
    "article_text": "The Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committee unanimously recommended that newest vaccines for Covid should be updated to target a variant of strains currently on the rise, during a meeting on Thursday – the first since theTrump administrationtook office. The meeting focused on selecting a Covid strain to target in upcoming vaccines as well as formalizing new FDA rules that limit vaccine access to Americans. Though it was intended to help advisers recommend strains for the upcoming year’s booster shots to the FDA, the meeting came in the context of upheaval at the federal health department. “We have a very specific and important goal,” said Arnold Monto, professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health and chair of the committee. “We are asking for guidance to help the FDA decide what strain to select for going forward.” On Tuesday, Trump administration health officials announced they wouldtake a less “aggressive” approachto booster shots and require placebo-controlled trials for healthy individuals younger than 65. “As many of you all know, this week in theNew England Journal of Medicinethe commissioner and I revealed a framework for Covid-19 policy,” said Vinay Prasad, the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees vaccines. He said the new framework would generate “important and relevant information for the American people”, referring to new trial requirements. The plan includes limiting access to Covid-19 vaccines to people 65 and older and others who are considered high-risk, as well as requiring manufacturers to conduct clinical trials to show whether the vaccines benefit healthy younger adults and children. The FDA’s vaccines and related biological products advisory committee, a group of independent vaccine experts, concluded their all-day meeting by unanimously recommending that Covid vaccines for the 2025-2026 period targetnewer strainsof the JN.1 variant. Although their decision is not binding, the FDA usually takes their advice. Currently, the US has three Covid-19 vaccines approved – Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax. Typically, the FDA advisory committee would recommend formulations for shots and whether they should be approved, with a separate advisory committee at the CDC creating recommendations for who should get the shots. Trump administration officials took the unusual step of announcing a policy change rather than seeking independent guidance from its own expert committees first. Prassad joined the FDA after the longtime vaccine headPeter Marks quit, citing Kennedy’s refusal to accept information that did not comport with his long-held opinions questioning vaccine safety. According to the CDC, the LP.8.1 strain, a subvariant of the JN.1 strain, accounted for 70% of total cases in the US over a two-week period that ended on 10 May. Covid-19 evolved less than in previous years, CDC microbiologist and immunologist Natalie Thornburg told the advisory committee. Most viruses currently circulating are descendants of the JN.1 virus variant, she said, though there is potential for that to be replaced. Wastewater in South Africa detected a new variant dubbed BA.3.2, which could indicate a shift in the virus. However, very few sequences of that variant have been identified globally. Government experts presenting to the committee emphasized that Covid-19 was still causing a significant number of deaths in the US. Hospitalization rates have declined overall since 2021-2022 but are highest among people older than 65 and children younger than six months old. Since October of last year, an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 people have died from the virus and between 260,000 and 430,000 have been hospitalized, according todata from the CDC. “When you add up those cumulative rates over a 12-month period, Covid-19 is still causing an enormous burden on the US health system,” said Ruth Link-Gelles, an epidemiologist with the CDC. Overall, almost all people in the US have experienced a Covid infection, meaning nearly everyone has some level of infection-induced immunity when vaccine efficacy was measured, but that immunity is believed to wane over time. Vaccine-induced immunity, in this context, should be viewed as an “added benefit”, according to a CDC epidemiologist presenting to the committee. Vaccine effectiveness could not be estimated for 2024-25 in children because of the low level of coverage and relatively low level of disease compared with earlier seasons. Last season had a lower overall rate of Covid hospitalization among children – though the youngest children notably had the worst hospitalization rates.",

    "title": "Suspect charged with murder in shooting of two Israeli embassy workers",
    "article_text": "Federal prosecutors have filed charges against a man suspected offatally shootingtwo Israeli embassy staff workers in the United States capital of Washington, DC. In a federal court on Thursday, Elias Rodriguez was accused of two counts of first-degree murder, as well as charges of murdering foreign officials, causing death with a firearm and discharging a firearm in a crime of violence. In a news conference afterwards, interim US Attorney Jeanine Pirro warned that those charges were only the beginning — and that her prosecutors were combing through evidence for other crimes. “This is a horrific crime, and these crimes are not going to be tolerated by me and by this office,” Pirro said. “We’re going to continue to investigate this as a hate crime and a crime of terrorism, and we will add additional charges as the evidence warrants.” Rodriguez is accused of shooting Israeli citizen Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, an American, both employees of the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC. Theattacktook place around 9:08pm US Eastern time on Wednesday evening (01:08 GMT Thursday), as the two employees were leaving an event hosted by the pro-Israel American Jewish Committee at the Capital Jewish Museum. Both were pronounced dead at the scene. Israeli embassy staff have said that the young couple were set to be engaged in the coming days. “A young couple — at the beginning of their life’s journey, about to be engaged, in another country — had their bodies removed in the cold of the night, in a foreign city, in a body bag. We are not going to tolerate that anymore,” said Pirro, appearing to allude primarily to Lischinsky’s foreign roots. “This is the kind of case that picks at old sores and old scars, because these kinds of cases remind us of what has happened in the past that we can never and must never forget.” She pointed out that the Wednesday night attack took place at a museum that includes one of Washington’s oldest synagogues in the centre of the city. Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said that the suspect chanted, “Free Palestine! Free Palestine!” after the shooting. Rodriguez, who hailed from Chicago, appears to have identified himself to police and was arrested shortly after the shooting. An affidavit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation notes that Rodriguez told police, “I did it for Palestine. I did it for Gaza.” The shooting, which has been widely condemned, comes as Israel faces growing global anger over itswar on Gaza, where a blockade has left millions of Palestinians without food or basic supplies. Experts at human rights organisations and the United Nations have compared the war, which has killed at least 53,000 people, to ethnic cleansing and genocide. Since the war began on October 7, 2023, Jewish, Muslim and Arab communities have all reported upticks in harassment and racism. In the aftermath of Wednesday’s shooting, officials spoke out against anti-Semitism, and the administration of President Donald Trump promised to pursue every legal avenue against the suspect. “The Department of Justice will be prosecuting the perpetrator responsible for this to the fullest extent of the law,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday. “Hatred has no place in the United States of America under President Donald Trump.” She went on to compare antiwar protests at US universities, which have been largely peaceful, to “ anti-Semitic illegal behaviour”. Protest leaders, however, have largely disavowed anti-Jewish hate. In the wake of the shooting, one US Congress member told Fox News that the “Palestinian cause” was “evil”. Republican Representative Randy Fine continued by suggesting the Gaza war should end like World War II did, with the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. “We nuked the Japanese twice in order to get unconditional surrender,” he said. “That needs to be the same here. There is something deeply, deeply wrong with this culture, and it needs to be defeated.” Separately, the Israeli government denounced the shooting as an attack against its state. “We are witness to the terrible cost of the antisemitism and wild incitement against the State of Israel,” Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahusaid in a statement.",

    "title": "Timeline: Trump’s escalating standoff with Harvard University",
    "article_text": "The administration of President Donald Trump has taken a hard line against top US universities over their responses to pro-Palestine protests, as well as their diversity initiatives and curricula. The move on Thursday toblock Harvard University from enrolling foreign studentsrepresents the latest escalation in a months-long standoff, which critics say has been rooted in unfounded claims of rampant anti-Semitism. In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the administration was “holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus”. Harvard has called the latest move “unlawful” and a “retaliatory action”. Here’s how we got here: December 2023:The standoff stretches back to the months following the October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, and the resulting Israeli offensive on Gaza, in which at least 53,655 Palestinians have since been killed. Then-Harvard President Claudine Gay’s testimony before Congress on the administration’s response to pro-Palestine protests sparks outrage, as elected officials, particularly Republicans, call for greater crackdowns. Gay subsequently resigns from her postand is replaced by Alan Garber in August 2024. January 2025:Trump takes office in January 2025, following a campaign where he vowed to crack down on pro-Palestine protests, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes, and “woke ideology” on college campuses. Trump also signs a series ofexecutive orderscalling for government agencies to take actions against DEI programmes at private institutions, including universities, and to increase government actions to combat anti-Semitism, particularly on campuses. February 2025:The US Department of Justice (DOJ) launches atask forceto “root out anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on college campuses”. The task force later announces it will visit 10 schools, saying it was “aware of allegations that the schools may have failed to protect Jewish students and faculty members from unlawful discrimination, in potential violation of federal law”. The schools include Harvard, as well as Columbia University, George Washington University, Johns Hopkins University, New York University, Northwestern University, the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Southern California. March 7, 2025:The Trump administration takes its first action against a US university, slashing $400m in federal funding to Columbia University and accusing the school of “continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students”. A subsequent letter from the Department of Education warns Harvard and dozens of other universities of “potential enforcement actions”. March 21, 2025:Columbiayieldsto Trump’s demands, which include banning face masks, empowering campus police with arresting authority, and installing a new administrator to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies and the Center for Palestine Studies. March 31, 2025:The US Departments of Education (ED), Health and Human Services (HHS), and the US General Services Administration (GSA) announce an official review of $255.6m in Harvard contracts and $8.7bn in multi-year grants. The review is part of the “ongoing efforts of the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism”, the statement said. April 11, 2025:Harvard is sent alettersaying the university has “failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment” and listing several Trump administration demands. The demands include a governance overhaul that lessens the power of students and some staff, reforming hiring and admissions practices, refusing to admit students deemed “hostile to the American values and institutions”, doing away with diversity programmes, and auditing several academic programmes and centres, including several related to the Middle East. April 14, 2025:Harvard President Garber issues a forceful rejection of the demands, writing: “The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights”. The US administration announces an immediatefreezeon funding, including $2.2bn in multi-year grants and $60m in multi-year contracts. April 15, 2025:In a Truth Social post, Trump floats that Harvard could lose “Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity”. He accuses Harvard of “pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness’”. April 16, 2025:The Department of Homeland Security calls on Harvard to turn over records on any foreign students’ “illegal and violent activities”, while threatening to revoke the university’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program approval. The certification is required for it to enrol foreign students. Noem gives an April 30 deadline for this. April 21, 2025:Harvard files a lawsuit against the Trump administration, accusing it of violating the First Amendment of the US Constitution with “arbitrary and capricious” funding cuts. April 30, 2025:Harvard says it shared information requested by Noem regarding foreign students, but does not release the nature of the information provided. May 2, 2025:Trump again says the administration will take away Harvard’s tax-exempt status. No action is immediately taken. May 5, 2025:The Trump administration says it is cutting all new federal grants to Harvard. May 13, 2025:The US Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announces another $450m in federal funding from eight federal agencies. May 19, 2025:The DOJ announces it will use the False Claims Act, typically used to punish federal funding recipients accused of corruption, to crack down on universities like Harvard over DEI policies. The Department of Health and Human Services also says it isterminating$60m in federal grants to Harvard. May 22, 2025:Noem announces revocation of Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program, blocking it from enrolling new foreign students and saying current students will need to transfer to continue their studies. Harvard responds: “We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard’s ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university – and this nation – immeasurably.”",

    "article_text": "Finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven (G7) democracies have pledged to address “excessive imbalances” in the global economy and said they could increase sanctions on Russia. The G7 announced the plan on Thursday as the officials, who met in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, said there was a need for a common understanding of how “non-market policies and practices” undermine international economic security. The document did not name China, but references by the United States and other G7 economies to non-market policies and practices often are targeted at China’s state subsidies and export-driven economic model. The final communique called for an analysis of market concentration and international supply chain resilience. “We agree on the importance of a level playing field and taking a broadly coordinated approach to address the harm caused by those who do not abide by the same rules and lack transparency,” it said. European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said the G7 ministers discussed proposals for further sanctions on Russia to try to end its war in Ukraine. They included lowering the G7-led $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian oil, given that Russian crude is now selling under that level, he said. The G7 participants condemned what they called Russia’s “continued brutal war” against Ukraine and said that if efforts to achieve a ceasefire failed, they would explore all possible options, including “further ramping up sanctions”. Russia’s sovereign assets in G7 jurisdictions would remain immobilised until Moscow ended the war and paid for the damage it has caused to Ukraine, the communique said. It did not mention a price cap. Brent crude currently trades at around $64 per barrel. A European official said the US is “not convinced” about lowering the Russian oil price cap. Earlier this week, the US Treasury said Secretary Scott Bessent intended to press G7 allies to focus on rebalancing the global economy to protect workers and companies from China’s “unfair practices”. The communique also recognised an increase in low-value international “de minimis” package shipments that can overwhelm customs and tax collection systems and be used for smuggling drugs and other illicit goods. The duty-free de minimis exemption for packages valued below $800 has been exploited by Chinese e-commerce companies including Shein and Temu.",

    "article_text": "Business owners in Syria have welcomed theEuropean Union’s decisionthis week to lift sanctions on the country, in what observers say is the most significant easing of Western pressure on Damascus in more than a decade. The EU’s move, which followed asimilar announcementby the United States in mid-May, was praised by Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani as one that would bolster Syria’s security and stability. For many Syrian entrepreneurs, it also brings the hope of rebuilding their livelihoods after years of economic isolation. “Companies that were ousted from Syria and stopped dealing with us because of the sanctions are now in contact with us,” Hassan Bandakji, a local business owner, told Al Jazeera. “Many companies and producers are telling us they are coming back and that they want to reserve a spot in our market.” The EU and US sanctions had levied wide-ranging sanctions against the government of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who wasremoved from powerin a rebel offensive in December of last year. The economic curbs had severely limited trade, investment, and financial transactions in Syria, cutting businesses off from supplies and international banking. “The main obstacle we faced was getting raw materials and automated lines,” said Ali Sheikh Kweider, who manages a factory in the countryside of the Syrian capital, Damascus. “As for bank accounts, we weren’t able to send or receive any transactions,” Kweider told Al Jazeera. Syria’s new government, led by ex-rebel leader and interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, had called for the sanctions to be lifted as it seeks to rebuild the country. US President Donald Trump said after a meeting with al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia last week that he planned to order the lifting of American sanctions on Syria. Reporting from Damascus, Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud Abdelwahed said the government is hoping the sanctions relief will help Syria reintegrate into the international community. It also views the EU’s announcement as additional “recognition of the new political leadership” in the country, Abdelwahed added.",

    "title": "Israeli speculation mounts over potential rift between Trump and Netanyahu",
    "article_text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has often tried to paint himself as a close friend of United States President Donald Trump, but the relationship has rarely been as straightforward as the Israeli premier has portrayed it. And recently, speculation across the Israeli media that the relationship between the two leaders, and by extension, their countries, has begun to unravel is becoming unavoidable. Some idea of the gap was apparent in Trump’s recent Middle East trip, which saw him visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates but not Israel, the state that has typically been the US’s closest ally within the region. Likewise, US negotiations with two of Israel’s fiercest regional opponents, Iran and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, have been taking place without any apparent input from Israel, a country that has always regarded itself as central to such matters. Lastly, against a growing chorus of international condemnation over Israel’s actions in Gaza,there was the decision of US Vice President JD Vanceto cancel a planned visit to Israel for apparently “logistical” reasons. Appearing on national television earlier this month, Israeli commentator Dana Fahn Luzonput it succinctly: “Trump is signalling to Netanyahu, ‘Honey, I’ve had enough of you.’” “We’re seeing a total breakdown of everything that might be of benefit to Israel,” Mitchell Barak, an Israeli pollster and former political aide to several senior Israeli political figures, including Netanyahu, told Al Jazeera. “America was once our closest ally; now we don’t seem to have a seat at the table. This should be of concern to every single Israeli.” ‘Many Israelis blame Netanyahu for this,” Barak continued. “He always presented Trump as somehow being in his pocket, and it’s pretty clear Trump didn’t like that. Netanyahu crossed a line.” While concern over a potential rift may be growing within Israel, prominent voices in the US administration are stressing the strength of their alliance. Last Sunday, President Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said that, while the US was keen to avert what he called a “humanitarian crisis” in Gaza, he didn’t think there was “any daylight between President Trump’s position and Prime Minister Netanyahu’s position”. Also doubling down on the US’s commitment to Israel was White House National Security Council spokesperson James Hewitt, who dismissed reports that the Trump administration was preparing to “abandon” Israel if it continues with its war on Gaza, telling Israeli media that “Israel has had no better friend in its history than President Trump”. The Trump administration has also been active in shutting down criticism of Israel’s war on Gaza in public spheres and specifically on US college campuses. Several international students have also been arrested and deported for their support of Palestine, includingRumeysa Ozturk, whose arrest as she was walking on a street in a Boston suburb for an opinion piece co-authored in a student newspaper was described by Human Rights Watch as “chilling”. Those policies have made it clear that the Trump administration sits firmly in Israel’s corner. And looking back at Trump’s policies in his first presidential term, that is not surprising. Trump fulfilled many of the Israeli right’s dreams in that term, between 2017 and 2021, includingrecognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, despite its eastern half being occupied Palestinian territory, recognising the annexation of the Golan Heights, despite it being occupied Syrian territory, andpulling out of the Iran nuclear deal. But those actions are partly to blame for the bumpy relationship between Trump and Netanyahu, with the US president reportedly resentful of what he saw as a lack of gratitude for those pro-Israel policies. Trump was also furious after Netanyahu congratulated former US President Joe Biden following his 2020 election victory over Trump, which the current president still disputes. “The first person that congratulated [Biden] was Bibi [Benjamin] Netanyahu, the man that I did more for than any other person I dealt with. … Bibi could have stayed quiet. He has made a terrible mistake,” Trump said in an interview in 2021. Nevertheless, in the build-up to the 2024 US election, Netanyahu and his allies actively courted candidate Trump, believing him to be the best means of fulfilling their agenda andcontinuing their war on Gaza,analysts said. “Netanyahu had really campaigned for Trump before the election, emphasising how bad Biden was,” Yossi Mekelberg, an Associate Fellow at Chatham House, said. “Now they don’t know which way Trump’s going to go because he’s so contractual. He’s all about the win,” Mekelberg added, referring to the series of victories the president claimed during his recent Gulf tour, adding, “but there’s no win in Palestine”. Across the Israeli press and media, a consensus is taking hold that Trump has simply tired of trying to secure a “win” or an end to the war on Gaza that Netanyahu and his allies on the Israeli hard right have no interest in pursuing. Israeli Army Radio has even carried reports that Trump has blocked direct contact from Netanyahu over concerns that the Israeli prime minister may be trying to manipulate him. Quoting an unnamed Israeli official, Yanir Cozin, a reporter with Israeli Army Radio, wrote on X: “There’s nothing Trump hates more than being portrayed as a sucker and someone being played, so he decided to cut off contact.” “There’s a sense in Israel that Trump’s turned on Netanyahu,” political analyst Nimrod Flaschenberg said from Tel Aviv. “Supporters of Netanyahu are panicking, as they all previously thought that Trump’s backing was unlimited.” A break in relations between Netanyahu and Trump might not mean an automatic break between Israel and the US, Flaschenberg cautioned, with all factions across the Israeli political spectrum speculating on what the future may hold under a realigned relationship with the US. US financial, military and diplomatic support for Israel has been a bedrock of both countries’ foreign policy for decades, Mekelberg said. Moreover, whatever Trump’s current misgivings about his relationship with Netanyahu, support for Israel, while diminishing, remains hardwired into much of his Republican base, analysts and polls have noted, and particularly among Republican – and Democratic – donors. “Those opposed to Netanyahu and the war are hoping that the US may now apply a lasting ceasefire,” Flaschenberg said, with reference to Israeli reliance upon US patronage. “That’s not because of any great faith in Trump, but more the extent of their dismay in the current government.” However, equally present are those on the hard right, such as Israel’s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who Mekelberg speculated may also hope to take advantage of whatever direction US policy towards Israel heads in. “Ben-Gvir, Smotrich and their backers could take advantage of American disinterest, depending upon what shape it takes,” Mekelberg told Al Jazeera. “If the US continues to provide weapons and diplomatic cover in the UN while letting [Israel] get on with it, then that’s their dream,” he said of Smotrich, who has reassured his backers that allowing minimal aid into the besieged enclave did not mean that Israel would stop “destroying everything that’s left of the Gaza Strip”. However, where Netanyahu may figure in this is uncertain. Accusations that the Israeli prime minister has become reliant upon the war to sustain the political coalition he needs to remain in office and avoid both a legal reckoning in his corruption trial, as well as a political reckoning over his government’s failures ahead of the October 7, 2023 attack, are both widespread and longstanding. “I don’t know if Netanyahu can come back from this,” Barak said, still uncertain about whether the prime minister can demonstrate his survival skills once again. “There’s a lot of talk about Netanyahu being at the end of his line. I don’t know. They’ve been saying that for years, and he’s still here. They were saying that when I was his aide, but I can’t see any more magic tricks that are available to him.”",

    "title": "Lebanese PM condemns wave of Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon",
    "article_text": "Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam has denounced a wave of Israeli attacks across southern Lebanon, calling on the international community to pressure Israel to respecta ceasefire reached in Novemberwith Lebanese group Hezbollah. Lebanon’s official National News Agency (NNA) said on Thursday that the Israeli military struck a building in Toul, a town in theNabatieh governorate. The army had earlier warned residents to evacuate the area around a building it said was used by Hezbollah. Lebanese media outlets also reported Israeli bombardment in the towns of Soujod, Touline, Sawanna and the Rihan Mountain – all in the country’s south. In a statement, Salam’s office said the Israeli attacks come at a “dangerous” time, just days before municipal elections in Lebanon’s southern districts on Saturday. The contests are expected to be dominated by Hezbollah and its allies, and there have been growing concerns about the safety of voters, especially in border towns, amid the continued Israeli occupation of parts of southern Lebanon. “Prime Minister Salam stresses that these violations will not thwart the state’s commitment to holding the elections and protecting Lebanon and the Lebanese,” his office said in its statement. As part of theNovember ceasefire agreement, Hezbollah fighters were to pull back north of the Litani River and dismantle military infrastructure south of that demarcation line. For its part, Israel was to withdraw all forces from Lebanon but it has kept troops in parts of south Lebanon. It argues it must maintain a presence there for “strategic” reasons. The truce was based on a UN Security Council resolution that says Lebanese troops and UN peacekeepers should be the only people to bear arms in southern Lebanon, and calls for the disarmament of all non-state groups. On Thursday, the Israeli military said its forces had carried out several strikes targeting Hezbollah sites and killed one fighter in the southern Lebanon town of Rab el-Thalathine. Hezbollah did not immediately comment on the Israeli army’s claim. Separately, a shepherd was injured in a different Israeli attack nearby, the NNA reported. The Israeli military said its forces also “struck a Hezbollah military site containing rocket launchers and weapons” in the Bekaa Valley in northeastern Lebanon. The NNA described Israel’s attacks as some of the heaviestsince the ceasefirewent into effect.",

    "title": "JPMorgan’s Dimon warns of US stagflation risk: Report",
    "article_text": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that he can’t rule out the possibility that the United States will fall intowhat is called stagflation— an economic term that refers to a period when inflation and unemployment are high as economic growth is slow. In an interview with Bloomberg Television on Thursday, Dimon said, “I don’t agree that we’re in a sweet spot” in response to a question about some US Federal Reserve officials saying that the US economy was in a sweet spot. Dimon made his comments while at JPMorgan’s Global China Summit in Shanghai. His comments come against the backdrop of the US facing increasing geopolitical tensions, rising deficits and pressure on consumer prices from changing government policies on tariffs that have led retailers toannounce a need to raise pricesand left businesses in await-and-watch modeover all the economic uncertainties. Economists like Stuart Mackintosh, executive director of the financial think tank Group of Thirty, echoed Dimon’s concerns to Al Jazeera. “Stagflation is a real risk we cannot rule out. We’re in a circumstance where we have uncertainty on tariffs, uncertainty on many policies that increase the downward pressure on growth in America.” Last weekMoody’s Ratings downgraded the US economy’scredit rating. The firm lowered its gold-standard Aaa to an Aa1 credit rating for the US, citing its growing national debt. Dimon’s Thursday comments were underscored by his remarks at the company’s investor day on Monday. “Credit today is a bad risk,” Dimon said. While at the summit, Dimon also offered comments on US President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill”,the tax and spending billpassed by the US House of Representatives that includes key parts of the Trump administration agenda including tax cuts, slashes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), increased funding for immigration enforcement, and new taxes on colleges and universities. “I think they should do the tax bill. I do think it’ll stabilise things a little bit, but it’ll probably add to the deficit,” Dimon said in a record first obtained by the Reuters news agency. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that the tax bill would add $3.8 trillion to the national debt. In the Bloomberg interview, Dimonadded that the US Federal Reserveis doing the right thing to wait and see before it decides on monetary policy. The central bank opted to hold rates steady at its last policy meeting, which was largely in line with economists’ expectations. Policymakers weighed a stable labour market at the time, even as they acknowledged that could be short-lived. “This is unsustainable. We might get into a much worse economic picture almost immediately,” Mackintosh said. More information on the state of the US labour market is expected in the next couple of weeks as both the US Department of Labor and the payroll and human resources firm ADP are slated to release their monthly report on the rate of job growth. Dimon has also long warned that inflation and stagflation will continue to increase. “I think the chance of inflation going up and stagflation is a little bit higher than other people think,” he noted. On Wall Street, JPMorgan Chase’s stock has trended up following Dimon’s remarks. As of noon in New York (16:00 GMT), it was 0.2 percent higher than yesterday’s market close after opening lower this morning.",

    "title": "Russia says it received Ukraine’s list of names for major prisoner swap",
    "article_text": "Russia has received a list of names of prisoners of war (POWs) thatUkrainewants freed as part of an expected exchange between the two countries, a Kremlin spokesperson told the Russian news agency Interfax. Dmitry Peskov told Interfax on Thursday that the list had been received after Moscow gave Kyiv its own list of prisoners it wants released. The exchange – which will see each side free 1,000 POWs in what would be the largest swap of the war – was agreed to duringtalks last weekin the Turkish capital, Istanbul. Those discussions marked the first direct peace negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian delegations since 2022, the year the war began. In advance of the meeting, Ukraine had called for a 30-day ceasefire, but Moscow rejected the proposal, agreeing only to the prisoner swap. Ukrainian officials have since accused Russia of deliberately delaying peace talks while consolidating territorial gainson the battlefield. The major prisoner swap is a “quite laborious process” that “requires some time”, said Peskov, adding that “the work is continuing at a quick pace.” “Everybody is interested in doing it quickly,” the Kremlin spokesperson said. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that the deal “to release 1,000 of our people from Russian captivity was perhaps the only tangible result of the meeting in Turkiye”. “We are working to ensure that this result is achieved,” he said in a post on X. Zelenskyy added that Defence Minister Rustem Umerov is overseeing the exchange process, supported by several Ukrainian government ministries, intelligence agencies and the president’s own office. “The return of all our people from Russian captivity is one of Ukraine’s key priorities,” Zelenskyy said. “I am grateful to everyone who is contributing to this effort.” As Ukraine, the European Union, and the United States press Moscow to return to negotiations, Peskov dismissed reports about future peace talks taking place at the Vatican, saying, “There is no concrete agreement about the next meetings.” US President DonaldTrump spoke withhis Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on Monday and urged an end to the “bloodbath”. Putin thanked Trump for supporting the resumption of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine, and said his government “will propose and is ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a possible future peace accord”. Meanwhile,Russia’s defence ministrysaid on Thursday that its air defences shot down 105 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 35 over the Moscow region. The ministry said it downed 485 Ukrainian drones over several regions and the Black Sea between late Tuesday and early Thursday. In southern Ukraine, Kherson Governor Oleksandr Prokudin also said on Thursday that one person was killed in a Russian artillery attack on the region. He said 35 areas in the Kherson region, including the city of Kherson, came under artillery shelling and air attacks over the past day, wounding 11 people. Zelenskyy said the “most intense situation” remains in the Donetsk region, however, while Ukrainian forces continue “active operations in the Kursk and Belgorod regions” inside Russia.",

    "title": "Trump blocks Harvard’s ability to enrol international students",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s administration has blocked Harvard University’s ability toenrol international students, according to the Department of Homeland Security. In a post on X on Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the Trump administration was “holding Harvard accountablefor fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Partyon its campus”. “It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enrol foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments,” she said. “Harvard had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing. It refused.” In a letter to the university’s administration, Noem said the university’s Student Exchange Visitor Program certification has been revoked. The programme is overseen by the US Homeland Security Investigations unit, which falls under the agency Noem leads. The move means that not only will Harvard not be able to accept foreign students on its campus, but current students will need to “transfer to another university in order to maintain their non-immigrant status”, the letter said. In a statement, Harvard called the move “unlawful” and a “retaliatory action”. “We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard’s ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university – and this nation – immeasurably,” the university said. The actionmarks an escalationamid a wider standoff between the university – which has refused to agree to a list of demands related to its diversity programmes and response to pro-Palestine protests – and the Trump administration. The administration has responded with three rounds of federal funding and grant cuts, totalling more than $2.6bn. The mostrecentwas on Monday. Harvard is currently pursuing a lawsuit accusing the administration of defying the US Constitution in its actions. Earlier this week, Harvard President Alan Garber called on alumni to throw their support – and donations – behind the university. “The institution entrusted to us now faces challenges unlike any others in our long history,” Garber wrote in an email, in which he launched the Presidential Priorities Fund and the Presidential Fund for Research. Both funds are meant to address gaps left by the funding cuts. According to immigration lawyer Leon Fresco, the move by the Trump administration would be a financial blow for the school and a “major problem” for the students. “If the foreign students cannot attend the university, they get their tuition payments back that they’ve already paid to the university for this upcoming semester,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that Harvard was relying on that money for the coming year. Fresco noted that there is a clear legal recourse to fight against the revocation of its foreign exchange programme. “The revocation regulation is very specific – there has to be a notice of intention to revoke that is given. There has to be reasons related to non-compliance with the student exchange visitor program,” he said. “It can’t be a politically ideologically based revocation, that doesn’t exist in the regulations.” Noem, in April, first threatened to revoke Harvard’s Student Exchange Visitor Program certification, which is required by educational institutions to host students on several visa types. She gave the university administration an April 30 deadline to provide detailed records on what she called the “illegal and violent activities” of foreign students on campus, pointing to a federal law that requires disclosures of academics, enrolment and disciplinary action. The university later said it had provided the requested information to the agency, the Harvard Crimson reported, although it did not reveal further details. The threat came amid a wider crackdown by the Trump administration on pro-Palestine protests at universities across the US, which federal officials have broadly portrayed as “anti-Semitic”, a label rejected by organisers,  Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett reported. “The Trump administration has been clamping down hard on Harvard and other colleges, including Columbia University, over what the administration says is ‘anti-Semitism’ that exists on the campuses, and that really seems to be the spark that kind of ignited this,” Halkett reported from Washington, DC. “The president put in place a joint task force at the start of his administration to address this, but opponents say this task force evolved to include everything from clamping down on hiring practices to curriculum changes at universities,” she said. “Trump himself has accused universities of fomenting ‘anti-Trump’ ideology.” There were 7,417 total schools approved for the Student Exchange Visitor Program in the US in 2023, according to federal data. The agency maintains that under federal law, it can review approved schools at any time.",

    "title": "US Supreme Court hits deadlock in case of publicly funded religious school",
    "article_text": "The United States Supreme Court has reached a deadlock in a case over whethera religious charterschool in Oklahoma should be publicly funded. Thursday’s tie vote allows a lower court ruling to stand. Previously, Oklahoma’s state-level Supreme Court had barred the use of government funds to establish the St Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, citing constitutional limits to the government’s role in religion. But the US Supreme Court’s split vote on Thursday leaves an avenue open for other, similar cases to advance. With no decision from the highest court in the country, no new precedent has been set to govern funding for charter schools, which are independent institutions that receive government funding. It is relatively rare, though, that a Supreme Court case should end in a tie vote. The Houston Law Review in 2020 estimated that there had only been 183 ties at the Supreme Court since 1791, out of more than 28,000 cases. Normally, there are nine justices on the court’s bench — an odd number, to ensure that the judges are not evenly split. But Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the hearings over the St Isidore school. Though she did not indicate her reasons, it is widely believed that Barrett stepped away from the case to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Barrett has a close personal relationship with an adviser to the St Isidore school, lawyer Nicole Garnett. As young legal professionals in the late 1990s, they clerked together on the Supreme Court, and they eventually taught together at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. When US President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the Supreme Court in 2020, Garnett even wrote an opinion column in the newspaper USA Today, praising her friend as “remarkable” and describing their lives as “completely intertwined”. The Supreme Court’s brief, two-line announcement on Thursday acknowledged Barrett’s absence. “The judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court,” itread. “JUSTICE BARRETT took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.” That left the court split four to four, though the precise breakdown was not provided. Chief Justice John Roberts is thought to have joined with the three left-leaning justices on the bench to oppose the school’s use of government funds. The Supreme Court currently has a conservative supermajority, with six justices leaning rightward. In the past, the court has signalled receptiveness to expanding religious freedoms in the US, including in cases that tested the Establishment Clause of the US Constitution. While that clause bars the government from “the establishment of religion”, what qualifies as establishing a religion remains unclear — and is a source of ongoing legal debate. The Oklahoma case stretches back to 2023, when the Catholic Archdiocese of Oklahoma City submitted an application to open a taxpayer-funded charter school that would share Catholic teachings. The school would have been the first of its kind, offering public, religious education online for children from kindergarten through high school. The plan was to open the following year. The Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board initially voted down the proposal in April, only togive it the go-aheadin June by a narrow vote of three to two. That teed up a legal showdown, with opponents calling the school a clear violation of the constitutionally mandated separation of church and state. But supporters argued that barriers to establishing a Catholic charter school limited their freedom of religion. Plans for the school even ended up dividing Oklahoma’s government. The state attorney general, Gentner Drummond, opposed the charter school as a form of “state-funded religion”. The governor, Kevin Stitt, supported the proposal. Both men are Republicans. In Oklahoma, as in the majority of other US states, charter schools are considered part of the public school system. When the case reached the state-level Oklahoma Supreme Court in 2024, that distinction became pivotal. The fact that St Isidore was a public — not private — school ultimately caused the court to strike it down, for fear of constitutional violations. The judges ruled in a six-to-two decision that establishing St Isidore with state funds would make it a “surrogate of the state”, just like “any other state-sponsored charter school”. The school, the judges explained, would “require students to spend time in religious instruction and activities, as well as permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore — all in violation of the establishment clause”. The school’s backers appealed to the Supreme Court, leading to arguments being held in April. It was unclear at the time which way the high court seemed to be leaning, with Roberts pressing both sides with questions. But conservatives on the Supreme Court’s bench seemed in favour of backing St Isidore’s appeal. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, for instance, argued that withholding taxpayer funds from the religious school “seems like rank discrimination against religion”. “All the religious school is saying is, ‘Don’t exclude us on account of our religion,'” he said. The left-leaning justices, meanwhile, indicated that a ruling in favour of St Isidore would pave the way for public schools to become religious institutions, a slippery slope that could require the government to fund faith-based education of all stripes. On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has backed a separate lawsuit against the school, framed the deadlock at the Supreme Court as a victory for the separation of church and state. “The very idea of a religious public school is a constitutional oxymoron. The Supreme Court’s ruling affirms that a religious school can’t be a public school and a public school can’t be religious,” said Daniel Mach, director of the ACLU’s Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief. But proponents pledged to keep on fighting. Jim Campbell, who argued in favour of St Isidore on behalf of Oklahoma’s charter school board, noted that the court may “revisit the issue in the future”, given the deadlock. “Oklahoma parents and children are better off with more educational choices, not fewer,” he said.",

    "title": "Words won’t save Gaza – The West must stop enabling Israel’s war",
    "article_text": "The recentstatementsfrom the UK government regarding Israel’s horrific crimes in Gaza are a welcome realisation that Israel, their trusted ally, is engaged in heinous brutality against the people of Gaza. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stood in the House of Commons yesterday (May 20th) anddenouncedIsrael’s blockade of Gaza as “morally wrong” and “an affront to the values of the British people”, and in doing so, also paused the free-trade agreement negotiations with Israel and imposed a handful of select, and relatively minor sanctions in protest. A day earlier, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Emmanuel Macron, and Prime Minister Mark Carneyjointly warnedof “concrete actions” if Israel did not halt its renewed military offensive and allow aid to flow into Gaza. These statements mark the most explicit criticism of Israel by Western allies in recent memory, yet they came only after more than a year and a half of relentless civilian casualties – more than 50,000 Gazans killed since 2023, including tens of thousands of women and children. How many innocent lives, including those of children, could have been spared if such criticism of atrocities committed by Israel was made more than a year ago, by Western allies. The question now is whether this belated moral clarity will be backed by the meaningful measures required to effect change, with meaningful being the operative word. Why have staunch allies of Israel, so long willing to overlook Israel’s egregious conduct, suddenly decided to speak up and speak out? I suspect the shift has less to do with a newfound sensitivity to human suffering and more to do with geopolitics, and the dawning realisation that accountability can bring. It has been reported over the last few weeks that President Trump has grown weary and tired of Netanyahu, viewing the Israeli leader’s strategy as a liability to his own deal-making legacy. Indeed, Trump notably omitted Israel from his recent Gulf tour despite intense lobbying from Netanyahu’s government, signalling a widening rift between Washington and Tel Aviv. That schism has given the United Kingdom, Canada, and France the diplomatic cover they needed to voice their deep-rooted anxiety about Israel’s conduct, without fear of outright US opposition, or even worse, a White House rebuke. Add to this, extremely powerful interventions from seasoned diplomats, respected experts and humanitarian workers. At the UN Security Council briefing on May 13, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher warned the body to “stop the 21st-century atrocity” unfolding in Gaza, emphasising that no aid had entered the Strip for more than 10 weeks and that 2.1 million people faced imminent famine. He rightly challenged Israel’s supporters, and the international community at large, with a simple question “Will you act – decisively – to prevent genocide and to ensure respect for international humanitarian law? Or will you say instead, ‘we did all we could?’” Following this, Fletcher delivered a harrowing plea: unless vital aid reached families in Gaza within 48 hours, some 14,000 babies could die. Fourteen thousand babies. If that does not prick your moral conscience, then surely nothing will. Such stark testimony from a diplomat and humanitarian with decades of experience in conflict zones simply underscores what many others have told us, Gaza is hell on earth, and the conditions on the ground are beyond inhumane. As images and livestreams of civilians suffering multiply, countries that have supported, armed, and funded Israel are also having to confront their own complicity. Moral outrage alone is insufficient. If Western governments truly believe Israel’s actions are “monstrous”, “intolerable” and “unacceptable”, as the UK government has said in the last 48 hours, then they must take concrete steps rather than issue a handful of token sanctions or pause talks on negotiations that haven’t taken place in months. Here are three concrete actions the UK and Western allies should take, and take now: Firstly, the UK and its allies must immediately suspend all arms exports and related components to Israel. Current UK measures – suspending just 10 percent of arms licences – are grotesquely inadequate. If the foreign secretary can describe the atrocities being committed by Israel as “an affront to British values”, how can he justify selling British weapons, munitions and components, including parts for F-35 Jets that facilitate such atrocities? Secondly, the UK must impose meaningful sanctions. Beyond trivial asset freezes on a handful of Israeli figures, sanctions must target senior Israeli officials. Sanctions should be imposed on the likes of Israeli Minister Bezalel Smotrich, whose recent pronouncements about cleansing and destroying Gaza were rightly labelled as extremism by the foreign secretary. Sanctions should also be forthcoming for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity. There should also be a serious discussion of trade embargoes and cultural boycotts, comparable to those once imposed on apartheid South Africa, to isolate a government that the ICJ has found to be in violation of the prohibition of apartheid and racial segregation. Finally, the UK and Western allies must immediately recognise the State of Palestine, following the lead of European allies Ireland, Norway, and Spain. If the UK truly believes a two-state solution is the path to peace, it cannot pay mere lip service by calling for negotiations while only recognising one state. We know there is no military solution to the Palestine/Israel question. It will only be resolved through diplomacy and negotiations. There can be no serious progress towards the path to peace if the rights of one people are completely denied. Statements over the last couple of days from London, Paris, and Ottawa are long overdue – and welcome – however, they must be the prelude to significant action and sanctions in order to stop the genocide of the people of Gaza. It is far too late for tens of thousands of dead Gazans, the countless injured, and those driven from their homes. Nonetheless, the emerging tide of Western criticism suggests a dawning realisation that uncritical support for Israel has placed these governments on the wrong side of history—an error they may yet be held accountable for in years to come. The real measure of their resolve will be in the meaningful actions they take now, not the force of their rhetoric. For the sake of 14,000 babies, on the verge of death, I hope that action comes sooner rather than later.

    "title": "Multiple deaths after small plane crashes in California neighbourhood",
    "article_text": "Authorities in the city of San Diego, California, have said that several people are dead after a small, private plane crashed into a military housing complex. On Thursday, Assistant San Diego Fire Chief Dan Eddy said that the plane had capacity for between eight and 10 people, but it is not clear how many people were on board during the crash. “I can’t quite put words to describe what the scene looks like, but with the jet fuel going down the street, and everything on fire all at once, it was pretty horrific to see,” San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl said. The incident took place in the early hours of Thursday morning, just before 4am Pacific time (11:00 GMT) in the United States. The crash left a trail of charred vehicles and damaged houses in the Tierrasanta neighbourhood of San Diego, located in the southernmost region of California. Downed power lines were observed near the scene, as emergency responders struggled to contain the fire. Residents of the neighbourhood were evacuated, and police say that two schools located near the site have been closed for the day. Authorities also asked people to avoid the area while emergency crews are at work. The San Diego Police Department said in a social media post that “multiple fatalities” had been confirmed from the crash and that one person remains hospitalised, with two others treated and released. The plane, which officials say was en route from the Midwest, caused damage to several homes and vehicles in the neighbourhood but did not cause any injuries to residents. “It was definitely horrifying for sure, but sometimes, you’ve just got to drop your head and get to safety,” said Christopher Moore, who lives one street over from the site of the crash. Eddy, the assistant fire chief, said that heavy fog had severely diminished visibility at the time of the crash. “You could barely see in front of you,” he said. UPDATE: Multiple fatalities confirmed in crash near Sculpin St & Santo Rd. 1 person hospitalized, 2 treated & released. Evacuations + road closures remain. Area expected closed all day as FAA investigates. Call 619-531-2000 if you find debris or jet fuel. — San Diego Police Department (@SanDiegoPD)May 22, 2025 Authorities have yet to share details about the make and model of the plane, but the flight tracking website Flight Aware says that a Cessna Citation II jet was scheduled to arrive at the Montgomery-Gibbs Executive airport in San Diego at 3:47am after departing from the Colonel James Jabara Airport in Wichita, Kansas. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said that the National Transportation Safety Board will oversee an investigation into the incident.",

    "title": "Columbia protester Mahmoud Khalil challenges arrest in US immigration court",
    "article_text": "Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestine protest leader targeted for deportation by the administration of US President Donald Trump, has sought to have the case against him thrown out in a consequential immigration hearing. Khali’s lawyers presented evidence they said showed “egregious government misconduct” surrounding his March 8 arrest during Thursday’s hearing in Louisiana. “When there are egregious violations, the case should be thrown out, and that’s what we’ve asked the immigration judge to do,” Mark Van Der Hout, a lawyer representing Khalil, told reporters the night before the proceedings. The violations in question, Van Der Hout said, include the lack of a warrant at the time of the arrest and claims that Khalil proved to be a flight risk. The hearing could be the most consequential turn yet in a series of cases in which US students have challenged being targeted by the Trump administration for their pro-Palestine advocacy or statements. It comes after three other students –Rumeysa Ozturk,Mohsen Mahdawi, andBadar Khan Suri– successfully challenged their detentions. Ozturk, Mahdawi, and Khan Suri have since been ordered released on bail as their parallel challenges in federal court and their deportation cases in immigration court proceed. Lawyers for the students say their rights, including freedom of speech, have been violated by the Trump administration. Despite Khalil also challenging his arrest in a federal case in New Jersey, a judge there has yet to make a ruling on whether he should be released. He has remained in detention in Louisiana. Khalil’s lawyers have accused the Trump administration of trying to slow roll his federal challenge to his arrest and detention, while fast-tracking the immigration proceedings. Judges in immigration courts, which fall under the executive branch, are typically viewed as less independent than life-tenured federal district judges. “The bigger picture is that the government would like to slow down Mahmoud’s habeas corpus case in federal court before an independent judge who has life tenure,” Ramzi Kassem, a lawyer with the City University of New York’s Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility (CLEAR) project, told reporters. “And they’d like to accelerate as much as possible these immigration proceedings, as they have so far, in front of a government employee who is subject to government pressure,” he said. Immigration Judge Jamee Comans hadpreviously sidedwith US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s claim that Khalil is deportable under an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act because his presence in the US poses “adverse foreign policy consequences”. Rubio has broadly portrayed Khalil’s involvement in pro-Palestine protests at Columbia University as “anti-Semitic”, but has not provided any further evidence to the court supporting the claim. Khalil and his legal team have firmly denied that his advocacy contained any anti-Jewish sentiment, and no evidence of such conduct has emerged. Thursday’s hearing not hinge on the government’s motivation for targeting Khalil, but instead focus on procedural missteps by immigration agents. Those agents had initially claimed that they had a warrant to detain Khalil when they confronted him in the lobby of his Manhattan apartment building. They later admitted they did not have a warrant, but arrested Khalil because they said his actions and statements indicated he was a flight risk. Surveillance footage of the encounter contradicts that statement, Khalil’s lawyers maintain. “We filed, over the last probably 48 hours, new evidence, including a video surveillance from Columbia that we got through a subpoena that clearly shows there was no attempt to flee whatsoever,” Van Der Hout said. Lawyers for Khalil also separately argued that he is eligible for asylum. They say the unfounded claims made by the Trump administration that Khalil is a “Hamas supporter” would put him at risk if he were to be deported to his birthplace of Syria, or to Algeria, where he has citizenship. Ahead of the hearing, officials from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) denied a meeting between Khalil, hiswife, Noor Abdalla, and their son, who was born while Khalil remained in detention. A federal judge later ordered that Khalil must be allowed an in-person meeting with his wife, with Khalil holding his son for the first time on Thursday.",

    "title": "Why are the number of flights reduced at Newark airport in the US?",
    "article_text": "To ease a wave of cancellations and delays at Newark Liberty international airport, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)has limited the numberof hourly arrivals and departures in an effort to reduce congestion for the foreseeable future. The Department of Transportation has asked the airport – a major hub for United Airlines, which serves New York City – to reduce operations from 77 to 56 departures and arrivals per hour. The change could significantly affect air travellers and carriers that rely on the airport. Newark has faced numerous challenges that have hindered air traffic and led to this drastic shift. These include a shortage of air traffic controllers, glitches in radio and radar systems, and ongoing runway construction. The FAA says daily construction will end on June 15, after which it will occur only on Saturdays through the end of the year. During non-construction periods, operations will increase to 68 arrivals and departures per hour. Newark’s cascade of problems began on April 28, when air traffic controllers at a Philadelphia-based facility, which monitors traffic heading into Newark Liberty, lost both radio and radar contact with planes for 90 seconds. A similar incident occurred at Newark itself – also lasting 90 seconds – during the early morning hours of May 9. Another occurred on May 11, and a brief two-second outage happened the following Monday. In an op-ed, the sole air traffic controller working on May 9 told the newspaper The Times of London that “it is only a matter of time before a fatal crash”. NBC News, citing an unnamed source, said similar incidents have occurred at least eight times since August and prior to the April event. Newark is not the only US airport facing glitches. Last week, air traffic controllers in Denver, Colorado, also lost contact with planes for 90 seconds, impacting 20 different pilots. Denver, like Newark, is a hub for United Airlines. Last Monday, following the Newark incident, The New York Times reported that only three flights passed through Newark-area airspace during a period when the goal was 14. At times, there were only one or two fully certified controllers on duty. As a result of the incident, 20 percent of air traffic controllers went on trauma leave, citing the event itself, the use of outdated equipment, and a longstanding staffing shortage. United CEO framed it as air traffic controllers having “walked off the job”. Controllers are entitled to 45 days of paid trauma leave. Air traffic control in the New York area has been chronically understaffed. A 2023 Department of Transportation report(PDF)found staffing levels to be dangerously low at 20 of the 26 critical air traffic control facilities across the US. The FAA mandates that at least 85 percent of controller positions be filled to maintain safe operations. The New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility was operating at just 54 percent. In 2024, control of Newark’s approach operations was moved to Philadelphia, a move that exacerbated certified controller shortages, as there were fewer of those personnel in Philadelphia. The FAA said that it is in the process of ramping up staffing efforts. “The area in the Philadelphia TRACON that handles Newark traffic has 22 fully certified controllers and 21 controllers and supervisors in training. Ten of those 21 controllers and supervisors are receiving on-the-job training. All 10 are certified on at least one position, and three are certified on multiple positions. We have a healthy pipeline with training classes filled through July 2026,” an FAA spokesperson told Al Jazeera. “Secretary Duffy has made air traffic controller hiring and building a new state-of-the-art air traffic system top priorities.” The reduced capacity will lead to fewer flights at the major hub. United Airlines, which accounts for 75 percent of Newark’s daily traffic, announced last week that it would cancel 35 roundtrip flights per day. “Reducing the number of flights scheduled at Newark will help ensure that we can safely and reliably operate the flights that remain on the schedule, which is why we proactively reduced our schedule earlier this month,” a spokesperson for United Airlines told Al Jazeera in an emailed statement. United serves 76 US destinations and 81 international destinations from Newark. The airline told Al Jazeera that the affected flights are primarily to cities that already have a high frequency of service, such as Orlando and Las Vegas. United said that customers can be easily re-accommodated on other flights, and that flyers who typically transit through Newark can use alternative hubs like Washington Dulles. Despite the cutbacks, United is launching new service to 10 destinations this summer, including two flights that have launched in the last week. For those travelling to, from or through New York, there are alternatives. The city is also served by LaGuardia airport – primarily a domestic hub for American and Delta – and John F Kennedy international airport, a major base for American, Delta and JetBlue airlines.",

Securing a Switch 2 is only half the battle, after all. bySheena Vasani If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. We’re now just a few weeks away from the release of theSwitch 2, but it isn’t the only hardware launching on June 5th. Soon, Nintendo will also release a variety of new accessories for its upcoming gaming console, the bulk of which are now available for preorder atWalmart,Best Buy,GameStop, andTargetahead of their release. From aredesigned Pro Controllerandcasestoa camera that lets you video chatwith your friends, each is designed to level up your gaming experience. Sadly, President Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff policyhas resulted in slight price bumpson several Switch 2 accessories — including the aforementioned Pro 2 Controller. There’s no telling whether we can expect more price hikes down the line, either, meaning if you do manage to preorder a Switch 2 and want to pick up a second controller or another accessory to go with it, now might be the time to act. The removable Joy-Cons are great for portable and wireless play, but their small, curveless design can feel cramped during longer sessions if you have larger hands. That’s why theNintendo Switch 2 Pro controllermight be worth a look, especially if you mostly game in TV mode. The upgraded version of one of ourfavorite Nintendo Switch controllerfeatures a few welcome improvements, including a pair of rear GL and GR buttons players can use to remap other controls. Nintendo has also finally added a 3.5mm audio jack, allowing you to pair it with a headset or a set of wired headphones. The gamepad even features the aforementioned“C” button. As of writing, you can preorder the Switch 2 Pro controller for $84.99 atBest Buy,GameStop, andTarget. It was also initially available atWalmart; however, the retailer’s initial preorder allotment has since sold out. If you plan on picking up the newMario Kart World, the Joy-Con 2 Wheels are worth a look. Simply snap the Joy-Con 2 controllers, which connect magnetically, into the steering wheel attachments before booting up your preferred racing title. The two-wheel set is currently available for preorder for $24.99 atBest Buy,GameStop, andTarget. The Switch 2 is a pricey gadget you’ll want to keep safe, so it’s a good idea to invest in a carrying case like the Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector. We’ll likely see a wealth of third-party brands release their own version in the coming weeks, but Nintendo’s proprietary offering is likely to be one of the few available at launch. The bundle — which includes a console-only carrying case, screen protector, and cleaning cloth — is only available for preorder for $39.99 atGameStopandTarget, even if it was originally available elsewhere. Nintendo is also launching an All-In-One Carrying Case on June 5th, which is more spacious than the model mentioned above. The higher-end case features separate compartments for stowing the console and various goodies, including the Switch 2 dock, Joy-Con 2 controllers, cables, and up to six game cards. You can preorder it now fromGameStopfor $84.99. Supposedly, you can video chat with friends via GameChat using any compatible USB-C camera, but Nintendo offers its own solution in the form of theNintendo Switch 2 Camera. The 1080p camera is designed to sit on a stand, allowing you to display your face as a picture-in-picture overlay or as a dedicated video feed. A few titles, such as the upgraded version ofSuper Mario Party Jamboree, let you see your friends on-screen while you play. Some mini-games even incorporate the camera into the game experience itself. The camera features an adjustable wide-angle lens, designed to capture groups of people in a single shot, as well as a “high-sensitivity image sensor” that automatically adjusts brightness levels. It also features a built-in privacy shutter and includes a USB-C charging cable, as well as support for TV, tabletop, and handheld modes. You can currently preorder it for $54.99 fromBest Buy,GameStop, andTarget. Update, May 22nd:Updated to reflect current pricing and availability.

Justin Connolly is YouTube’s new global head of media and sports — unless Disney has something to say about it. byEmma Roth As YouTube prepares to air an exclusive NFL opening week gamefor free on September 5th, it’s hiring former Disney exec Justin Connolly. The move has caused Disney to respond by suing both YouTube and Connolly, saying he was in the middle of leading the team negotiating Disney’s license renewal with YouTube. He’d most recently been running the streaming services and linear media networks at Disney, and will take over as YouTube’s new global head of media and sports, asfirst reported byBloomberg. After spending more than 20 years at Disney and ESPN, he’ll be managing YouTube’s relationship with the media companies that distribute content on YouTube TV, as well as leading its live sports coverage. Bloombergalso first reported the lawsuit filed yesterday in California Superior Court, as Disney alleges that YouTube induced Connolly to breach a three-year employment contract that started in January and would’ve kept him there as an executive until an early termination option for March 1st, 2027. Connollyleft Disney last week, just months before the launch of its standaloneESPN streaming service this fall. In itscomplaint(which you can read below), Disney’s lawyers write: Critically, Connolly leads the Disney team negotiating a license renewal with YouTube. Connolly has intimate knowledge of Disney’s other distribution deals, the financial details concerning Disney’s content being licensed to YouTube, and Disney’s negotiation strategies, both in general and in particular with respect to YouTube. It would be extremely prejudicial to Disney for Connolly to breach the contract which he negotiated just a few months ago and switch teams when Disney is working on a new licensing deal with the company that is trying to poach him. YouTube did not comment on the lawsuit. YouTube has become a growing force in live sports, with its live TV streaming service amassing more than 8 million subscribers and adding theNFL Sunday Ticketpackage in 2023. The platform will also. Earlier this year,YouTube revealed that it has become more popularon TVs than phones.

Thevideo’s descriptionsays that his “AI avatar” is presenting the results, and the AI avatar kicks off the video by saying that “it’s me, or rather, my AI avatar.” Klarna has already been vocal about how it uses AI in its business, with Siemiatkowskitelling CNBCthis month that the company shrunk its workforce in part as a result of its AI investments. This alsoisn’t even the first timethe company has used an AI version of Siemiatkowski to share earnings.

    "article_text": "It looks like previous models, but mostly with internal upgrades. It looks like previous models, but mostly with internal upgrades. byAntonio G. Di Benedetto In a pretty bare-bonespress releaseaccompanied by a couple of pictures anddetailed specs, Ricoh surprise announced that its long-awaited GR IV camera will launch this fall. The GR IV will adhere closely to the design of theGR III from 2018, and it will continue to use an autofocusing 28mm-equivalent f/2.8 lens and only a rear LCD for composing photos and videos, with no electronic or optical viewfinder available. The GR IV’s exterior looks very similar to the GR III /GR IIIx, with an oval-shaped shutter button, on / off switch and mode dial up top, and a smattering of rear controls to the right of its LCD. Its buttons look redesigned, removing the spinning dial from around its four-way directional pad. And its adjustment thumb wheel, labeled “ADJ,” looks like itmaybe a fully turning dial instead of just a back-and-forth toggle that moves left or right. (I may be wishcasting that last part, because I think the thumb toggle on the GR III is annoying and fiddly.) What’s known for certain based on its spec list is that the GR IV retains the built-in ND filter of the GR III, but it slightly ups the resolution of its large APS-C sensor from 24 megapixels to 26. It will also have a higher ISO range that reaches 204,800 at its maximum setting, and five-axis stabilization instead of three-axis stabilization. The GR IV’s lens may be the same focal length and maximum aperture as previous generations, but it’s a new seven-element design in a new arrangement utilizing an additional aspherical element that should yield better corrections. The upcoming camera will also have face and eye detection for its autofocus tracking, and 53GB of usable built-in storage. Onboard storage is great, and it’s much more than the GR III’s 2GB, but the GR IV is also downsizing from full-size SD cards to microSD. While there isn’t a price yet, Ricoh has confirmed the GR IV is expected to release in the autumn of 2025, with a variant featuring aHighlight Diffusion Filter(HDF) to come “after winter 2025.” The announcement also details that the GR III is scheduled to be discontinued in July, while the GR IIIx continues “for the time being.” The Ricoh GR cameras have carved out a niche among street photographers who value their super-compact size and fairly affordable prices compared to aFujifilm X100orLeica Q. As cool and fun as I thought the just-announcedFujifilm X Halfmight be, the GR IV has instantly become my most anticipated camera of 2025.

    "article_text": "Brand-new features and an installation process for Legion Go and ROG Ally. Brand-new features and an installation process for Legion Go and ROG Ally. bySean Hollister If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Valve has been building up to this for months, first in preview,then in beta, and now finally in a full stable release: a new version of SteamOS that brings brand-new features to the Steam Deckandsupports third-party handhelds like Lenovo’s Legion Go and Asus’ ROG Ally series. SteamOS 3.7.8 is the first stable release to add official support for theLenovo Legion Go S, and the first to offer an official “recovery” image that lets you install SteamOS on other AMD handhelds like the ROG Ally and original Legion Go,as Valve promised us in January of this year. Until now, those who wanted to try SteamOS on those Windows handhelds could shoehorn the Steam Deck’s original recovery image onto their device, oropt for a similar experience like Bazzite. But now, Valveexplicitly provides instructionsfor getting that image working on a Legion Go or ROG Ally, even as it warns that “support for all devices that is not officially ‘Powered by SteamOS’ is not final.” But even if you don’t care about rival handhelds, SteamOS 3.7.8 has alotof improvements for the Steam Deck. I’ve been asking Valve to let me use my Bluetooth earbuds’ microphone sincelaunch, and it’s finally happening in desktop mode (sadly not gaming mode yet) thanks to HFP/HSP profiles. You can turn on your Steam Deck LCD from across the room with a Bluetooth controller, a feature previously exclusive to the OLED model, which comes in handy when you’re docked to a TV. Speaking of leaving it docked, you can now set a Battery Charge Limit to 80 percent for longevity’s sake if your handheld is always plugged in, frame-limit variable refresh rate displays, and control the P-state frequency of certain AMD CPUs. It’s all underpinned by new versions of Arch Linux, new Mesa graphics drivers, a much newer version of the Plasma desktop mode, and more.Here’s the full SteamOS 3.7.8 changelog. An updated SteamOS FAQseems to suggest that Valve is ready to expand SteamOS beyond Lenovo and the Steam Deck. “We’re currently working with select partners on officially licensed Powered by SteamOS devices. Please reach out to us atpoweredbysteamos@valvesoftware.comfor more information about licensing SteamOS for your device,” one answer reads. But the industry is still waiting for Valve’s other shoe(s) to drop. Rumors are still heating up that we’re close to the launch of Valve’s wireless VR headset “Deckard,” and that it might be pointing the way toward a SteamOS-powered living room console too. Valve has been moving slow and steady, but it seems likea master plan for Steam Machines could finally be coming into focus.

Microsoft. byTom Warren The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has officially dropped its case against Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The FTC filed an order to dismiss its complaint on Thursday, just days after itlost an appealfor a preliminary injunction to prevent Microsoft from finalizing its acquisition. “The Commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative litigation in this case,“ says the FTCin its filing.

    "article_text": "The sister vehicle to last year’s SU7, the electric SUV could threaten the Model Y’s dominance in China’s all-important EV market. The sister vehicle to last year’s SU7, the electric SUV could threaten the Model Y’s dominance in China’s all-important EV market. byAndrew J. Hawkins If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Xiaomi unveiled itshotly anticipated PU7 electric SUVin China today, in the latest potential blow to Tesla’s position inthe world’s hottest EV market. The electronics giant saysthe PU7 will get up to 518 miles of range on certain trims and accelerate from 0–62mph in just 3.23 seconds. The new EV, which is widely considered to be China’s version of the Apple car that ultimatelyfailed to materialize, will be available for reservations starting in July. The PU7 comes on the heels of the SU7, which has been a huge success for Xiaomi since deliveries began in March 2024. The company said it has sold over 200,000 SU7s as of April 2025, surpassing global EV sales for Ford and GM both. But more importantly, the PU7 is being positioned as a direct competitor to the Tesla Model Y, which is Elon Musk’s company’s global bestseller. Xiaomi has been very clear about its intent to dethrone the Model Y in China. In response to Tesla’s refreshed Model Y, Xiaomi founder, chairman, and CEO Lei Jun responded by posting a size comparison between the two EVs. Yes, a literal EV-measuring contest. Like the SU7, the YU7 will come in three variants (hat tip toElectrekfor the helpful chart): The PU7 has a lot more going for it, including its sleek, sports car looks. The vehicle is comparable to the Model Y in size and acceleration, but demolishes Musk’s SUV in terms of range. In his presentation, Lei Jun said that range is the number one consideration for EV buyers, which led Xiaomi to develop an SUV that would be a class leader. On its website, Xiaomi described the Standard, single-motor PU7 as “the longest-range pure electric SUV with a sub-100 kWh battery and the top performer in the mid-to-large-size pure electric SUV category, achieving truly breakthrough range leadership.” Other notable features include a Nvidia Drive AGX Thor in-vehicle computing platform, active air suspension, and an 800-volt architecture — with a peak voltage of 897V — that can fast-charge from 10–80 percent in 12 minutes, as well as add 620 km (385 miles) of charge in just 15 minutes. Of course, whether the PU7 will truly oust the Model Y from its perch will depend on its price — and we’re not getting that detail until closer to July 2025.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 22, 2025 / 7:50 PM EDT/ CBS News The man accused ofkilling two Israeli Embassy staff membersoutside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder, murder of foreign officials and other counts. The suspect has been identified as 30-year-oldElias RodriguezofChicago. He is also charged with causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence. The shooting is being investigated as a hate crime and terrorism, and more charges could come, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. Authorities have said the attack was targeted. \"This is a horrific crime, and these crimes are not going to be tolerated by me and my office,\" Pirro said. Pirro said Rodriguez appeared in court Thursday and was advised by the judge that, if convicted, he could face the death penalty or life in prison. A preliminary hearing is set for June 18 and Rodriguez will remain in detention. Thevictimswere identified as two employees at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim. Israel's ambassador to the U.S. told reporters they were a young couple who were set to be engaged. The shooting happened as the couple was leaving an event Wednesday night at the museum, which is located near the FBI's field office in D.C. It was reported at 9:08 p.m. local time, Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela A. Smith. There will be \"an increased presence of law enforcement officers around the community,\" including faith-based organizations and schools, Smith told reporters Thursday. Authorities said the suspect was seen \"pacing back and forth outside of the museum\" before the shooting. Smith told reporters the suspect then approached a group of four people, pulled out a handgun and opened fire. According to charging documents, video shows that after Rodriguez shot the couple, he walked closer to them and fired \"several more times.\" Milgrim sat up after being shot, and he reloaded his weapon and fired again at her, striking her, the documents allege. Milgrim was shot multiple times and was pronounced dead at 9:35 p.m. after being transported by DC Fire and EMS. Lischinsky was pronounced dead at the scene at 9:14 p.m. In all, 21 rounds were fired from a 9 mm weapon, according to the court documents. A firearm magazine was found at the scene, and a handgun with its slide locked was found nearby. Federal officials traced the weapon and say records show it was purchased by Rodriguez on March 6, 2020, in Illinois. The handgun was purchased legally, according to a person briefed on the investigation. Rodriguez flew from Chicago O'Hare Airport to Reagan National Airport with the firearm in checked luggage, according to court documents. He had declared the firearm, an affidavit shows. Once officers arrived at the museum, Rodriguez asked to speak with police and told them, \"I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza, I am unarmed,\" according to the charging documents. Rodriguez was then taken into custody. FBI Washington Assistant Director Steven Jensen said the suspect came to Washington, D.C., on May 20 and was traveling for a work conference. It is unknown how the suspect knew about the event being held at the museum, but he told officers he bought a ticket to the event there three hours prior to the shooting. A woman who was at the event, Katie Kalisher, told CBS News sheencountered the suspectmoments after the shooting. She said they spoke briefly and then he reached into his bag, pulled out a keffiyeh and said, \"I did it. I did it for Gaza,\" before he shouted, \"Free Palestine.\" Alex Sundby is a senior editor at CBSNews.com.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 22, 2025 / 6:15 PM EDT/ CBS Boston Harvard University can no longerenroll foreign students,the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday, escalating the Trump administration's efforts to exert influence over the Ivy League school. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security saidexisting foreign studentsat Harvard must transfer or lose their legal status in the United States. About one in four Harvard students are international, according to schooldata. Homeland Security Sec. Kristi Noem said Harvard is \"fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus.\" She said the action against Harvard will \"serve as a warning\" to other universities. Last month,Noem demandeddetailed records on Harvard's foreign student visa holders' \"illegal and violent activities.\" \"It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments,\" Noem said in a statement. \"Harvard had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing. It refused.\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Harvard has become \"a hot-bed of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators.\" \"They have repeatedly failed to take action to address the widespread problems negatively impacting American students and now they must face the consequences of their actions,\" Jackson said in a statement. Harvard says the administration's move is unlawful. \"We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University – and this nation – immeasurably. We are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community,\" a Harvard spokesperson said in a statement. \"This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission.\" The move to block Harvard from enrolling foreign students comes as the Trump administration cuts billions of dollars infederal grantsto the school. President Trump also said this month that his administration will be taking away the university'stax-exempt status. Neal J. Riley is a digital producer for CBS Boston.

    "title": "Gas prices this Memorial Day weekend could be cheapest since 2021",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 22, 2025 / 5:15 PM EDT/ CBS News Good news for the nearly 40 million Americans expected to hit the road this Memorial Day weekend: Gas prices are likely to at their lowest level since 2021, industry estimates show. Motorists can expect to spend an average of $3.08 for a gallon of regular gas over the federal holiday, according to GasBuddy, a fuel savings platform. That's 50 cents a gallon less than for Memorial Day in 2024. GasBuddy also expects prices at the pump to ease slightly over the summer to a national average of $3.02 per gallon through Labor Day. Prices could even dip below $3 a gallon toward the end of the summer, according to the firm's most recent forecast. Excluding 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic first struck, the national average gas price is forecast to be the lowest it's been since 2003, when adjusted for inflation. Cheaper gas this time of year is unusual given that fuel prices typically rise during the spring and summer as demand increases. Federal regulations requiring that refineries shift to summer-grade blends that are less likely to evaporate also tend to boost fuel costs, according to theEnergy Information Administration. Between 2004 and 2023, the average price of gas in August was roughly 40 cents per gallon higher than in January, the agency has found. Nationwide, these 10 states have the lowest average gas prices, according toGasBuddy: The 10 states with the priciest gas: One factor contributing to lower gas prices around the U.S. is uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies, which is damping demand, according to GasBuddy. Increased oil production by the OPEC+ countries has also lowered the cost of crude, while members of the group could further boost supplies in July, Bloomberg Newsreports. Since mid-January, global oil prices have fallen by $20 a barrel, reflecting both supply increases and weak demand expectations, according to an analysis from Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research. By contrast, lower oil prices likely won't offset the inflationary effects of U.S. tariffs, according to the researchers, who noted that consumers are bracing for higher prices because of the levies. Although motorists will mostly find modest gas prices this Memorial Day weekend, other vacation-related expenses are up. Any savings on gas could end up being spent on entertainment, with costsup 3.4% from a year ago, according to NerdWallet. The cost of dining out is also up 4%, according to the personal finance site.

    "title": "Deaths from alcohol-related cancers doubled from 1990 to 2021, study finds",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 22, 2025 / 5:00 PM EDT/ CBS News New research is showing just how much alcohol has impacted cancer mortality rates in the past three decades. In the analysis, released Thursday ahead of being presented at theAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology 2025 conferencein Chicago, researchers found alcohol-associated cancer deaths in the United States doubled from 1990 to 2021, rising from 11,896 to 23,207. The authors also found mortality rates were significantly higher in males and those above age 55. On a state level, the analysis found Washington, D.C., had the highest alcohol-related mortality rate across both sexes, while Utah had the lowest. The analysis used data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, which provides incidence and mortality estimates for 35 cancer types. The GBD also highlights dozens of attributable risk factors, including alcohol use, allowing the authors to extract the total alcohol-associated cancer deaths for analysis. \"Despite growing awareness of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer development, alcohol continues to contribute significantly to cancer mortality,\" the authors wrote. \"Our findings highlight the critical need for targeted prevention efforts and increased awareness to address the rising impact of alcohol consumption on cancer-related mortality,\" Alcohol consumption has long been a knownrisk factor for cancer. In a September report, theAmerican Association for Cancer Researchfound excessive levels of alcohol consumption can increase the risk for six different types of cancer, includingbreast,colorectal, liver, stomach, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and certain types of head and neck cancers. Earlier this year, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthycalled for cancer risk warningsto be included on alcoholic beverages. \"Alcohol is a well-established, preventable cause of cancer responsible for about 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 cancer deaths annually in the United States - greater than the 13,500 alcohol-associated traffic crash fatalities per year in the U.S. - yet the majority of Americans are unaware of this risk,\" Murthy said ina news releaseat the time. Alcohol was already classified as a Group 1 carcinogen, a substance or exposure known to cause cancer in humans, by theInternational Agency for Research on Cancerdue to sufficient evidence linking it to liver, breast, colorectal, esophagus, larynx, mouth, and throat cancers. Social ties to alcoholcan make quitting difficult, but experts say limiting consumption has benefits beyond limiting cancer risk. \"All organs can be affected by alcohol intake depending on dose and frequency,\" Dr. Angela Tatiana Alistar, medical director of GI Medical Oncology at Morristown Medical Center, Atlantic Health System,previously told CBS News. \"There is vast scientific literature regarding the impact of alcohol consumption on the liver described as hepatitis (in the acute form), liver cirrhosis (chronic form) and possible liver cancer.\" Drinking alcohol can also affect organs like the brain, disrupting the sleep-wake cycle. \"It can also affect cognition, coordination and emotional regulation,\" Alistar said. \"Acute and chronic dependence and tolerance to alcohol is a high-risk factor for social functioning and mental health.\" Reducing alcohol isn't the only way to decrease your risk of cancer, either. There are several othermodifiable risk factorsthat researchers found are linked to more than40% of all cancer fatalities, including smoking, excess body weight, physical inactivity and diet.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 22, 2025 / 12:58 PM EDT/ CBS News The Treasury Department said it plans to stop manufacturing the penny, calling time on one of the first coins minted by the U.S. government. The federal agency placed its final order for penny blanks this month, with the United States Mint slated to end manufacturing of the penny when that runs out, a Treasury official told CBS MoneyWatch. The blanks — flat, metal discs that the Mint turns into coins — will run out in early 2026,accordingto the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news. The penny, which dates from theearly days of the U.S. Mintafter its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth. The 1-cent coin cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute in 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's 2024annual report. Ending production of the penny will save the Mint about $56 million in annual savings, the Treasury said on Thursday. Despite their coppery look, pennies are mostly made of zinc, with their distinctive appearance coming from a copper overlay. Zinc's cost per metric ton is more than double what it was in 2000, according todatafrom the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The Trump administration had recently signaled it was out to stop making the 1-cent coin, with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency saying in January that thepenny was too costlyto produce. In February, President Trump said he had directed the Treasury tostop minting new pennies,citing the rising production costs. \"For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!\" Mr. Trump wrote in a February post on his Truth Social site. \"I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\" Previous presidential administrations have also scrutinized the penny due to the rising cost of production, with former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lewpushing the ideain 2015.

The decision by the evenly divided court means a ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that said the proposal to launch St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School violates both the federal Constitution and state law remains in place. St. Isidore would have operated online statewide with a remit to promote the Catholic faith. Follow live politics coverage here Paul Coakley, the archbishop of Oklahoma City, and David Konderla, the bishop of Tulsa, said in a joint statement that they are \"exploring other options\" to provide an online education statewide. \"Families across the state of Oklahoma deserve the educational opportunities presented by St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School,\" they added. As there was no majority, the court did not issue a detailed written decision, and the case sets no nationwide precedent on the contentious legal question of whether religious schools must be able to participate in taxpayer-funded state charter school programs. A key factor in the outcome was that conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who would have been the deciding vote, did not participate in the case. She did not explain why, but it is most likely because of her ties with Notre Dame Law School. The law school's Religious Liberty Clinic represents the school. Theone-page decisiondid not say how each justice voted. Duringoral argumentslast month, most of the court's conservatives indicated support for the school while liberals expressed concern. At least one conservative is likely to have sided with the liberals, most likely Chief Justice John Roberts. The court, with Barrett on board, is likely to be asked to weigh in on the issue in future cases, though none are likely to reach the justices imminently. The Oklahoma case was a victory for state Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who challenged a state board's approval of the school and found himself on the opposite side of fellow Republicans in the state who backed the idea. Drummond, who is running for governor, said in a statement that the decision was a “resounding victory for religious liberty” that would ensure that taxpayer money would not go toward “radical Islamic schools,\" as well as the Catholic school at issue in the case. Rachel Laser, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which challenged the school's approval in a separate case, also welcomed Thursday's decision. \"We will continue our efforts to protect inclusive public education. We call on this nation to recommit to church-state separation before this safeguard of democracy and freedom is further attacked,\" she said in a statement. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stittdescribedthe decision on Xas a \"non-decision\" that did not resolve the issue. \"This is far from a settled issue,\" wrote Stitt, a Republican. \"We are going to keep fighting for parents’ rights to instill their values in their children and against religious discrimination.” The casehighlights tensionswithin the Constitution's First Amendment; one provision, the Establishment Clause, prohibits state endorsement of religion or preference for one religion over another, while another, the Free Exercise Clause, bars religious discrimination. The Oklahoma Supreme Court had cited the state's interest in steering clear of Establishment Clause violations as a reason not to allow the proposal, submitted by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa, to move forward. The state approved the proposal for St. Isidore in June 2023 despite concerns about its religious nature, prompting Drummond to sue. The U.S. Supreme Court, when Barrett is participating, has a 6-3 conservative majority that often backs religious rights. In recent years, it has repeatedly strengthened the Free Exercise Clause in cases brought by conservative religious liberty activists, sometimes at the expense of the Establishment Clause. Some conservatives have long complained that the common understanding that the Establishment Clause requires strict separation of church and state is incorrect. Lawyers representing the school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board sought to portray the dispute as similar to a series of recent rulings in which the court said that under the Free Exercise Clause, states cannot bar religious groups from government programs that are open to everyone else. During the oral argument, Roberts pushed back, indicating that he saw the schools case as different from the previous decisions. Those cases, he said, “involved fairly discrete state involvement” compared with Oklahoma’s charter school program. “This does strike me as a much more comprehensive involvement,” he added. The push for religious public charter schools dovetails with the school choice movement, which supports parents using taxpayer funds to send their children to private school. Public school advocates see both efforts as broad assaults on traditional public schools. A key question left unresolved in the Oklahoma case is whether charter schools are indistinguishable from public schools, which factors in to whether they have religious rights and can bring free exercise claims in the first place. Currently, all 47 states that allow charter schools consider them to be public schools and bar religious schools from participating in their programs. As was raised during oral arguments, there is also a federal program with funds for charter schools that prevents money from going to sectarian schools. With no other states close to approving religious charter schools,said Stephanie Barclay, an expert on religious liberty at Georgetown Law School, there are no cases pending that raise the precise issue as the Oklahoma dispute. But she highlighted acase from Mainethat raises questions about the extent to which religious schools can be barred from receiving government funding through tuition assistance, which the Supreme Court may have a chance to hear relatively soon if it wishes to further strengthen the Free Exercise Clause. \"That's a more likely next step the court could take,\" she said.",

    "title": "Federal judge blocks Trump administration from revoking international students' legal status",
    "article_text": "A federal judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from terminating the legal statuses of international students at universities across the U.S. In the injunction, District Judge Jeffrey S. White in Oakland also prohibited the administration from arresting or detaining any foreign-born students on the basis of their immigration status while a case challenging previous terminations moves through the courts. In his decision, White said that the Trump administration has “wreaked havoc” on the lives of the plaintiffs as well as other international students. \"Today’s ruling delays justice and seeks to kneecap the President’s constitutionally vested powers under Article II,\" Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. \"The Trump administration is committed to restoring common sense to our student visa system, and we expect a higher court to vindicate us in this.\" We have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.” The Department of Justice declined to comment. Though many international students have been successful in individually challenging the Trump administration, guaranteeing their own right to stay in the U.S., the injunction is the first to provide relief to students nationwide. In the order, White wrote that the administration is barred from transferring any of the plaintiffs in ongoing cases to jurisdictions outside their residences, or from reversing any reinstatement of their records. While the Trump administration had said in court documents this month that an injunction wasn't necessary because it had begun to restore statuses while Immigration and Customs Enforcement develops a new framework for terminations, the judge disagreed. “At each turn in this and similar litigation across the nation, Defendants have abruptly changed course to satisfy courts’ expressed concerns,” the judge said. “It is unclear how this game of whack-a-mole will end unless Defendants are enjoined from skirting their own mandatory regulations.” The Trump administration began revoking the visas of thousands of international students in addition to their records and legal statuses in March. The terminations appeared to take aim at those who had participated in political activism or had criminal charges against them, like DUIs. And in late April, DHS revealed at a court hearing that the department used 10 to 20 employees to run the names of 1.3 million foreign-born students through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run computerized index that includes criminal history information. Experts have criticized the process, pointing out that the index relies on cities, counties, states and other sources to voluntarily report their data. And sometimes the database doesn’t have the final dispositions of cases. It’s why, immigration attorneys and policy experts say, some students who’ve had cases dismissed, or were not convicted, likely still had their statuses revoked.",

    "title": "North Dakota governor vetoes the housing budget — by mistake",
    "article_text": "When North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong took up an agency budget bill approved by the legislature, he vetoed a couple of line items. At least, that was his intention Monday. Instead, he accidentally vetoed $35 million for the state’s housing budget. Now the state is figuring out how to deal with the unusual problem of a mistaken veto. “I have no recollection of anything like this happening in the 37 years I’ve been here,” John Bjornson, legislative council director, said Thursday. “So, yeah, I’d say it’s a little extraordinary.” Follow live politics coverage here Armstrong wasn’t the only governor to possibly flub a line-item veto this week. Late Wednesday, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced that he would be striking about $47 million in funding and cash transfers over the next two years from budget bills passed last week by the Nebraska Legislature. Those cuts included about $12 million over two years for the Nebraska Supreme Court. But on Thursday afternoon, the Speaker of the Legislature John Arch announced the body would be sending a letter to Pillen, a fellow Republican, informing him he had missed a 5-day deadline, which came at midnight Wednesday, to properly file the line-item vetoes and that the line items are now law. Pillen’s office responded that it handled the veto properly and would consult with the state attorney general about next steps. In North Dakota, the governor’s staff called his veto of the housing budget in Senate Bill 2014 a markup error. Armstrong’s staff met with the legislative council Thursday morning to discuss options. “This was an honest mistake, and we will fix it,” a statement from the governor’s office read. Armstrong, a Republican who served three terms in Congress, was elected governor in 2024. The legislative session that adjourned earlier in the month was his first as governor. In a message accompanying the veto, Armstrong wrote he had intended to veto a $150,000 grant to fund a Native American homelessness liaison position. The budget veto would take effect July 1. What happens next is largely up to the governor, Bjornson said, but it is likely that the legislature will need to reconvene in Bismarck for a special session. The governor’s office said it will call a special session if needed but hopes to “avoid the expense.” If the legislature overrides the veto, that would include funding for the grant Armstrong had wanted to strike. If the legislature wants to only fund the $35 million housing budget, lawmakers may need to pass a new bill, which could take as long as three days, Bjornson said. The Legislature has six days available to use of its 80-day session limit, and a special session could open the opportunity to override other vetoes by the governor. The governor vetoed all or parts of four bills this session.",

    "title": "Kid Cudi testifies about car fire and 'Marvel supervillain' meeting at Sean Combs' trial",
    "article_text": "This is a free article forDiddy on Trialnewsletter subscribers.Sign upto get exclusive reporting and analysis throughout Sean Combs’ federal trial. Grammy-winning rapperScott Mescudi— better known by hisstage name,Kid Cudi— took the witness stand today as prosecutors continued sketching their portrait of Diddy’s violent and chaotic world. Here’s what the “Pursuit of Happiness” singer told jurors, and what we heard from today’s other witnesses as the sex trafficking trial reached the end of its second week: ALSO: In a 37-second videoposted to Xthis afternoon, Kid Cudi directly addressed the camera and thanked his fans for “all the love and support” in the lead-up to his testimony. “This is a stressful situation,” he added. “I’m glad it’s behind me.” Kid Cudi was by far today’s main attraction. The celebrated rapper, wearing a black leather jacket over a white T-shirt, drew a crowd of spectators in the rain outside the courthouse. He identified himself on the stand as an “actor and musician,” a nod to his roles in films like “Don’t Look Up” and “X.” In general, he struck a confident tone and often spoke animatedly. Diddy, wearing a cream-colored top over khaki pants, sat back in his chair with his arms and legs crossed during parts of Kid Cudi’s testimony. He seemed to be listening closely, calmly taking in the back-and-forth without displaying much emotion. Maurene Comey, one of the prosecutors, heatedly toldJudge Arun Subramanianshe was “shocked” that defense lawyerBrian Steelasked Kid Cudi about his sexual activity with Cassie, calling the question out of bounds and “outrageous.” Subramanian agreed, saying “the line was clear and crossed.” He chastised Steel and ruled the exchange should be struck from the record. In other news: The reporters in the gallery were treated to some rare levity this morning as the attorneys debated whether Kid Cudi could testify about his dog’s behavioral changes after the 2011 break-in at his home. Steel told Subramanian that prosecutors wanted the rapper to testify that his pet was traumatized.Emily Johnson, a prosecutor, argued that comments about the dog were relevant to the break-in. “He’s not going to testify to what the dog thought,” Subramanian said, drawing laughter. (Subramanian ultimately ruled that Kid Cudi could testify about the dog, but only in general terms. Johnson explained that the animal is “no longer with us.”) Kid Cudi testified today that, in 2012, his dog watcher called to alert him that his car was on fire. He testified that it appeared someone had cut open the top of his Porsche, and “that’s where the Molotov cocktail was put in,” destroying the car. This is critical evidence for the prosecution because it is evidence of arson, which is one of the “predicate” racketeering crimes listed in the racketeering (RICO) statute. However, Diddy is charged with racketeeringconspiracy, which is even easier for the government to prove. To convict a defendant of racketeering conspiracy, the government must prove only that the defendant agreed with others to conduct the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering (those predicate crimes). The government does not need to prove a conspiracy to commit those specific predicate acts, like the arson of Kid Cudi’s car. In fact, the government must prove only that two racketeering acts were, or were intended to be, committed as part of the conspiracy. The government does not have to prove that the defendant himself committed any of these predicate crimes (like arson). The government doesn’t even need to prove Diddy himself agreed to commit any of the predicate acts (like arson). While the government must establish that Diddy participated in some manner in the overall objective of the conspiracy, it does not need to prove that the hip-hop mogul himself tossed a Molotov cocktail into the Porsche, or even that he participated in the arson himself. No court tomorrow. The trial resumes on Tuesday, after Memorial Day. Enjoy your holiday weekend.

    "title": "Trump's big bill has history on its side: From the Politics Desk",
    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. It’s a “big, beautiful” edition of the newsletter today, as we break down the political ramifications, historical context and next steps for President Donald Trump and the GOP after the House passed the party’s sweeping domestic policy package. Programming note:We are taking a few days off for the holiday weekend and will be back on Tuesday, May 27. Have a restful Memorial Day! Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner After the House passed a bill for President Donald Trump’s agendaearly Thursday morningby a single vote, the measure faces more hurdles in the Senate. But don’t bet against it becoming law. There’s a long history of presidents getting Congress to deliver their top legislative priority, even when other items fall by the wayside. That’s especially true when the president’s party controls both chambers, as Trump’s GOP currently does. Because of congressional rules, so-called budget reconciliation bills — like the one Trump is trying to get to his desk — only need a simple majority to pass in the Senate. For that reason, Trump was smart to roll a series of his major proposals into a single bill covering much of his agenda on taxes, immigration and more. Even for Republicans who aren’t in love with every provision, it is politically perilous to stand in the way of a president of their own party. When push comes to shove, few will be willing to alienate their base voters to kill the newly elected president’s plans. And if Trump loses the battle, he will make sure GOP voters know which lawmakers betrayed him. There may ultimately be a political downside for some Republicans who stick with Trump with the broader electorate, but there’s no upside in turning him into an enemy in either a primary or a general election. No Republican can win a swing state or district if the GOP base doesn’t turn out for them. Trump may be more openly vindictive than most recent presidents, but similar dynamics are always at play. In 1993, President Bill Clinton and a Democratic-led Congress prioritized his economic recovery package — not the more memorable “Hillarycare” health insurance proposal. He passed the budget plan, while Hillarycare fell apart. In June 2001, President George W. Bush, with a Republican Congress behind him, enacted a major tax cut on bipartisan votes in the House and Senate. President Barack Obama’s stimulus law flew through Congress — with Democrats in control of both chambers — in February 2009. And after months of fierce debate, he managed to sign the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010. Arguably, the big exception came in Trump’s first term, when the Senate — on a decisive vote by then-Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. — killed a push to repeal Obamacare. But Trump did get a signature tax law from the Republican-led Congress. In 2021, the Democratic-led Congress quickly sent a pandemic recovery bill to President Joe Biden’s desk at the outset of his term. The rest of his “Build Back Better” plan ran into snags and had to be reformulated and slimmed down to make it across the finish line. Some Republicans may distance themselves from Trump’s agenda as the midterm elections approach, but that day has not yet come. And the smart money is on him eventually signing his “big, beautiful bill” into law. Republicans’ megabill is now set to play a major role in shaping the fight over who controls the House after the next election. Democrats need a net gain of just three seats next year to take back control of the chamber, after the GOP won the smallest House majority in almost 100 years in the last election. And they’ve already started peppering the airwaves with attacks accusing the GOP of slashing Medicaid and prioritizing the wealthiest Americans. But Republicans are betting that the measure holds the key to proving to voters why they should grant them two more years of unified control of Washington, as opposed to the midterm backlash that typically hits a president’s party. The GOP sees a bill that could energize Trump supporters by enacting his agenda and delivering key swing-state lawmakers some tangible victories to tout on the campaign trail. “The American people gave us a mandate in November. They sent a message with their vote. They gave this side of the aisle the power, and we’re going to use it to make their lives better,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., sounded a different note: “When the votes are ultimately cast on that first Tuesday in November next year, this day may very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representatives.” Read more on the midterm politics of the bill → The defectors:Only two House Republicans, safe-seat Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio, joined every Democrat in voting against the bill, saying it will further balloon the U.S. deficit. While Davidson’s opposition came as a last-minute surprise, Massie had long made clear where he stood on the legislation. AsBen Kamisar and Scott Bland write, Massie is one of the rare Republicans who has found himself at odds with Trump on multiple occasions but has lived to tell the tale. The question is whether the tension evaporates as it has before or if Trump actually takes the step of backing a primary challenger against him in 2026. Prior to Thursday’s vote, Trump blasted Massie as a “grandstander” who “should be voted out of office” — criticism Massie haspointed to in fundraising appealsfor his own campaign. “That’s a step up,” Massie said of Trump’s threats. “In 2020, he wanted me thrown out of the GOP, so losing a seat wouldn’t be as bad as being thrown out, would it?” “I think that’s hyperbole on his part. I’m not worried about it,” Massie continued. Read more on Massie → ➡️ Explainer:Here’s what’s in the sprawling Trump agenda bill House Republicans just passed, by Sahil Kapur and Scott Wong Thanks to everyone who emailed us! Here is this week’s reader question: “On the spending bill, will it go through the Senate? How many will oppose it?” One thing is clear at this point, hours removed from the House’s passage of a massive bill for Trump’s agenda: The Senate won’t pass it as it’s currently written. For weeks, GOP senatorshave outlined a variety of concernswith the measure their House colleagues put together. That list includes: the impact to the U.S. deficit, the level of Medicaid cuts, the rollback of clean energy tax credits and the higher cap for the state and local tax deduction. It will be Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s job now to work through all these issues in the coming weeks. He can only afford to lose three Republican votes on the Senate floor — and he’s already lostSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who staunchly opposes a provision in the bill that raises the debt ceiling. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin has even said he still wants to split up the sweeping legislation into two parts. But as Jonathan Allen writes above, when push comes to shove, skeptical Senate Republicans may find it difficult to stand in the way of the president and his agenda. Another complicating factor is that any changes the Senate makes to the package will have to go back through the House before GOP lawmakers can send the bill to Trump’s desk, which they are hoping to do by July 4. — Adam Wollner That’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

    "title": "Cancer deaths linked to alcohol on the rise in the U.S.",
    "article_text": "Yearly cancer deaths linked to alcohol have doubled in the United States over the last three decades, rising from just under 12,000 a year in 1990 to more than 23,000 a year in 2021, new research finds. The increase was driven by deaths in men 55 and older, the study authors said. U.S. cancer deaths overall have fallen by about 35% over the same time period, according to data from theAmerican Cancer Society. The findings will be presented next week at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting in Chicago and have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. “This is death as opposed to getting a disease. We can treat a lot of cancers, and we’re getting better at that, but this is really driving home the point that people are dying from cancer due to alcohol,” said Jane Figueiredo, a professor of medicine at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who was not involved with the research. The study focused on seven alcohol-related cancers: breast, liver, colorectal, throat, voice box, mouth and esophageal. Alcohol isn’t responsible for every case of these cancers, but it has been shown to be a driving factor in a percentage of them. “When people think about alcohol, they don’t necessarily think of it as being a carcinogen like they do tobacco,” said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor of public health and community medicine at the Tufts University School of Medicine, who was not involved with the study. But it is. Once in the body, alcohol breaks down intoacetaldehyde— a carcinogen also found in tobacco smoke. Alcohol damages DNA and makes it easier for the mouth and throat to absorb other carcinogens. The International Agency on Cancer Research, a branch of the World Health Organization,classified alcoholas a carcinogen in 1987. Researchat that time linked drinking to cancers of the head and neck (including the mouth, throat, voice box and esophagus) and liver cancers. It’s since been linked to breast and colorectal cancers. A Januaryreportfrom the former U.S. surgeon general said alcoholic drinks should come with cancer warning labels. According to WHO, there’sno safe amountof alcohol consumption. The new research found that in 1991, 2.5% of all cancer deaths in men and 1.46% in women were related to alcohol. In 2021, those percentages rose to 4.2% and 1.85%, respectively. Over that same time period, men saw a 56% increase in deaths from alcohol-related cancers specifically. For women, it was nearly 8%. “It was not surprising that it was higher in men, but it was certainly surprising how much higher it was in men versus women,” said study co-leader Dr. Chinmay Jani, chief fellow of hematology and oncology at the University of Miami’s Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Historically, men have tended to start drinking alcohol earlier in life, Jani and his team noted. However, sex-based drinking habits appear to be shifting. In recent years, an increasing number ofwomen have become heavy drinkers, and slightly more young women binge drink than men,researchhas found. Deaths from the seven alcohol-related cancers increased among men in 47 states, and in 16 states for women. In both groups, deaths among people living in New Mexico rose the most — nearly 60% for men and 18% for women. Oklahoma, for men, and Tennessee, for women, came in close second. Washington D.C. and New York saw the biggest decreases for men, and Massachusetts and New York for women. Utah remained the state with the lowest alcohol-related cancer deaths. Cancer deaths were highest among people 55 and older. In men in this age group, alcohol-related cancer deaths rose by more than 1% every year between 2007 and 2021. “The carcinogenic effect probably isn’t affecting you right away in your younger age, but as you continue to drink as you age, this carcinogen has an accumulative effect on the body,” Jani said. Of all seven alcohol-related cancers, liver, colorectal and esophageal cancers were the deadliest overall in 2021. In men specifically, liver cancer deaths were most common. For women, it was breast cancer. “We know that even small amounts of alcohol can affect the breast tissue,” Figueiredo said. Jani said the next phase of research should tease out how different racial and ethnic groups are affected by alcohol differently when it comes to cancer risk. “The enzyme that metabolizes alcohol is lower in some ethnic groups than others, so acetaldehyde, the carcinogen in alcohol, is higher in these people,” Jani said. Alcohol consumption in the U.S. hit its peak in the late 1970s and dropped until the late ’90s, data from theNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholismshow. Drinking also rose sharply during the pandemic,as did alcohol-related deaths. Siegel said messaging around alcohol needs to shift from drinking responsibly to making sure people understand the health effects that even moderate drinking can pose. “It’s not that we’re telling people they can’t drink. Every person has the autonomy to make their own decisions,” Siegel said. “But we want to make sure they are well-informed based on the facts rather than misconceptions.”",

Another part of the bill would prohibit transition-related medical care as an essential health benefit under health care plans offered through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace. Essential health benefits packages vary by state but are required by federal law tocover 10 categories of benefits. Nearlyhalf of stateshave prohibited health insurance providers from explicitly refusing to cover transition-related care. The tax bill’s prohibitions could have a significant effect on hundreds of thousands of trans adults in the U.S. A reportpublished this monthby the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found that about 180,000 trans adults use Medicaid as their primary insurance. Another study, published in 2023, found thatnearly 1 in 4 (24.6%)trans adults are on Medicaid, or about 312,000, based onone estimatethat there are 1.3 million trans adults in the U.S. It’s unclear how many trans adults are enrolled in insurance through the health care marketplace. The Department of Health and Human Services reported thatnearly 24 million people had enrolledin marketplace coverage by January. An additional 300,000 youth ages 13 to 17 identify as transgender, and it’s unclear how many of them are on Medicaid or marketplace insurance plans. President Donald Trump has made curtailing access to care for trans people a priority of his administration. In the first few weeks of his presidency, he has signed several executive orders targeting trans people, including proclaiming that thegovernment will recognize onlytwo unchangeable sexes, prohibiting trans women and girls from playing on female sports teams,barring transgender people from serving openly in the militaryandrestricting access to gender-affirming carenationwide for trans people younger than 19. Trump and other Republicans oppose access to transition-related care for minors, arguing that they are too young to make informed decisions about receiving such treatments and that the long-term effects of some of the treatmentshave not been well studied. LGBTQ advocates and medical professionals who treat trans peoplesay those arguments aren’t accurate and that they spread misinformation, and most major medical associations, such as theAmerican Medical Association, theAmerican Academy of Pediatricsand theAmerican Psychological Association, support access to such care. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who helped negotiate the amendment among Republicans, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House also didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it supports the amendment. LGBTQ advocates began forcefully speaking out against the tax bill Thursday. Jennifer Pizer, chief legal officer at Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ advocacy organization, said it’s unclear how the administration plans to argue against transition care for adults, who can make their own medical decisions and for whom transition care is well studied and supported. “It makes the animus, the hostility, against this group of people unmistakable,” Pizer said. “Under any standard of constitutional review, laws based on animus or hostility to a group are not legitimate.” If the bill becomes law as is, Pizer said, it would most likely face a legal challenge for potentially violating the Constitution’s equal protection clause, which requires that laws treat people equally. She also noted that, after a suit by Lambda Legal and other LGBTQ advocacy groups, a federal judgeblocked Trump’s executive orderthat would have cut off all federal funding to medical schools and hospitals that provide transition care to minors. The bill would also directly conflict with laws in half of states that prohibit insurers from excluding coverage for gender-affirming care. In those cases, Pizer said, the states could use their own funding to continue covering the care under state Medicaid plans. However, “that’s not a happy answer for people who live in other parts of the country, where states themselves are hostile to transgender people and this medical care.” “This aggressive effort to reimpose exclusions, it’s about hostility to a group, and it’s a political movement,” she said. “It’s not coming from medical experts or providers who engage with actual patients. This is about politics and not about anything that’s justified in terms of our medical programs.”",

    "title": "Supreme Court grants Trump request to fire independent agency members but says Federal Reserve is different",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — TheSupreme Courton Thursday granted a Trump administration request that allows the president to fire members of independent federal agencies while suggesting that its legal reasoning would not apply to the Federal Reserve. The move to pause a lower court rulingformalizes atemporary decisionalong similar lines on April 9 that allowed President Donald Trump to fire Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board. \"The stay reflects our judgment that the government is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power,\" the court said in anunsigned order. The government, it added, \"faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.\" The high court’s three liberal justices dissented. In a notable passage, the court sought to distinguish the case from any attempt by Trump to fire members of the Federal Reserve, including its chairman, Jerome Powell. The court noted that the Federal Reserve is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity\" that has its own distinct historical tradition. The Supreme Court’s comments are likely to be well-received in global markets, which were rocked when Trump repeatedly ripped Powell in late March and early April, leading to speculation that he might try to fire him. Trump went so far as to sayon Truth Socialon April 17 that Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump laterappeared to back off, saying he had \"no intention\" of firing Powell. Powell alsocame under fire repeatedlyduring Trump’s first term, even thoughTrump himself nominatedhim for the role in November 2017. Follow live politics coverage here Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the dissenters, said the court had in essence summarily overruled a key 1935 precedent, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, which upheld the concept of independent agencies that are not directly subject to presidential control. In challenging that precedent, Trump decided \"to take the law into his own hands\" by firing Wilcox and Harris for no discernible reason, she added. \"Today, this court effectively blesses those deeds. I would not. Our Humphrey'sdecision remains good law, and it forecloses both the President’s firings and the Court’s decision to award emergency relief,\" Kagan wrote. She expressed puzzlement at the court's effort to create an exception for the Federal Reserve, arguing there is no reason the same legal rationale would not apply to it. \"If the idea is to reassure the markets, a simpler — and more judicial — approach would have been to deny the president’s application for a stay,\" Kagan added. The case tees up the significant legal question of whether Congress, when it sets up federal agencies, can include provisions to insulate them from political interference that prevent the president from firing members at will. Although the Trump firings concern only two agencies, any ruling that allows such firings would apply to other agencies, too. If that happens, it would raise the question of whether the president would have the power to firemembers of the Federal Reserve, which traditionally operates independently of the White House. In recent rulings, the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has decided that provisions protecting single heads of independent agencies were unconstitutional. But the 1935 precedent that upheld the structure of multimember agencies remains on the books. The Trump administration has adopted legal arguments long made by conservative lawyers who favor broad presidential power; those arguments hold that independent agencies are not sufficiently accountable to the democratically elected president under the Constitution’s separation-of-powers provision. The president should be able to fire agency heads at will, they argue. Then-President Joe Biden appointed Wilcox to the labor board, which adjudicates workplace disputes, in 2021. Her five-year term would have expired in 2026. Federal law states that the president can fire members only “for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.” Biden appointed Harris in 2022 to a seven-year term that has similar protections against removal. The Merit Systems Protection Board handles disputes involving federal employees. Trump sought to fire both soon after he took office. Wilcox and Harris both sued and won in lower courts, prompting the administration to go to the Supreme Court. Lawrence Hurley reported from Washington and Steve Kopack from New York.",

    "article_text": "Summer’s unofficial kickoff is here and Americans are wasting no time getting out of town. From crowded airports to congested highways, Memorial Day travel is heating up, thanks in part to a dip in gas prices. A record 45.1 million people are expected to travel between Thursday May 22 and Monday May 26, breaking the 2005 holiday weekend record of 44 million travelers,according to AAA. Of those travelers, more than 38 million are expected to hit the road, marking the highest number of Memorial Day drivers AAA has ever recorded. Fueling this travel frenzy is good news at the pump: A gallon of regular gasoline was $3.17 as of May 19, down 11% compared to the same time last year,according to AAA. Airports are also bracing for the holiday rush. More than 3.5 million people are expected to fly this weekend, a 2% increase from last year, according to AAA. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said it’spreparing for one of its busiest weekends of the yearwith travel expected to peak on Thursday and nearly 54,000 flights scheduled nationwide. As of May 7, 2025, a REAL ID or a passport is required for domestic flights. Kaliah Miley, a junior at SUNY Cortland, was at LaGuardia Airport Thursday, traveling to North Carolina. She said preparation is key for a busy travel weekend. “Don’t wait until the last minute to pack. Come at least two hours [early] so you have enough time to travel and enough time to check in and go to TSA,” Miley said. Wanda Fraser and her husband, Alex, who were on their way also to North Carolina from LaGuardia Airport on Thursday, said they looked forward to hosting Memorial Day festivities. Wanda offered some travel advice: “Do all your check-ins and all your everything that you need to do online, on your phone, whatever you can do to make it smoother yourself. Because the airlines are sometimes short, we get frustrated, but everybody has to get where they’re going, so let’s make it safe and, you know, fast for everybody.” This weekend, severe thunderstorms and nor’easter winds are expected tosoak most of the country. Weather conditions have contributed tothousands of flight delaysThursday, including aground stopat LaGuardia Airport that slowed down flights. Experts recommend planning your trip ahead, taking public transit when possible and prepare to stay flexible. “Everybody just be safe and be blessed,” Alex Fraser said. “Be kind to each other,” Wanda Fraser added.",

    "title": "FTC drops Biden-era suit accusing Pepsi of price discrimination",
    "article_text": "The Federal Trade Commission voted to dismissa lawsuit filedin the last days of the Biden administration that accusedPepsiCoof offering sweetheart pricing to big retailers. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson dissented to the suit when it was filed in January, when he was one of the regulator's commissioners. Now the agency’s leader, Ferguson on Thursdayagain criticized the caseas “a nakedly political effort to commit this administration to pursuing little more than a hunch that Pepsi had violated the law.” “The FTC’s outstanding staff will instead get back to work protecting consumers and ensuring a fair and competitive business environment,” he said in a statement. The FTC voted 3-0 to drop the suit. The panel is supposed to be made up of five commissioners, no more than three of whom can share the same political party. But it is currently led by three Republicans after President Donald Trump fired its two Democratic commissioners in March. The two ousted officials haveslammed their removals as illegaland areurging a judge to reinstate them. Pepsi welcomed the FTC decision Thursday. “PepsiCo has always and will continue to provide all customers with fair, competitive, and non-discriminatory pricing, discounts and promotional value,” a spokesperson said in a statement. Beyond its namesake soda, the company makes an array of snacks and other food products, including Doritos, Rold Gold pretzels and Sabra hummus. Former FTC Chair Lina Khan, who led the commission when the agency brought its case against Pepsi, criticized the move Thursday as “disturbing behavior” by the agency. “This lawsuit would’ve protected families from paying higher prices at the grocery store and stopped conduct that squeezes small businesses and communities across America,”she wrote on XThursday evening. “Dismissing it is a gift to giant retailers as they gear up to hike prices.” The decision comes little more than a week after top-ranking Democrats on Capitol Hillsent a letter to Pepsidemanding more information about its pricing strategy. They sought to revive a Biden-era focus on price-gouging as a driver of inflation, an argument that has taken a back seat to the Trump administration’s attention on purportedly unfair trade arrangements. But major corporations continue to draw scrutiny from the White House over pricing in other ways. Last weekend, Trumpslammed Walmartfor warning that it was likely to raise prices to offset the costs of his import taxes, demanding on social media that it “EAT THE TARIFFS.” In the days since then, other major consumer brands haveappeared to tread cautiouslyaround pricing. Target said Wednesday that charging customers more would be its “very last resort.” Home Depot virtually ruled out price hikes this week, and Lowe’s barely mentioned tariff impacts in its Wednesday earnings call at all. CORRECTION (May 22, 2025, 8:45 p.m. ET): Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article misstated when congressional Democrats sent their letter to Pepsi. It was on May 11, not last weekend.",

    "title": "What we know about the suspect in the Capital Jewish Museum shooting",
    "article_text": "Federal officials are reviewing writings that they say may be those of the man charged Thursday in thefatal shootingof twoIsraeli Embassy staffersin Washington, D.C., as they investigate whether the attack was motivated by antisemitism. Washington police identified the suspect as Elias Rodriguez, 31, of Chicago, who they say shouted “Free, free Palestine” in custody and “implied” that he was the gunman in the shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum on Wednesday night. Yaron Lischinsky and his girlfriend and colleague Sarah Milgrimwere killed. Rodriguez appeared Thursday before a federal magistrate judge wearing a white prison jumpsuit and glasses. He remained calm as the charges were read: murder of foreign officials, causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm and discharging a firearm during a crime of violence, as well as two counts of first-degree murder. He waived his detention hearing and is being held without bond until his preliminary hearing June 18. Federal agents said Rodriguez spoke with Washington police officers who arrived at the scene to tell them he \"did it,\" according to a criminal complaint. Rodriguez also said, \"I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza, I am unarmed,\" the complaint said, adding that a witness said he was holding a red kaffiyeh scarf, which has become an emblem of Palestinian solidarity. Rodriguez also \"expressed admiration\" for the U.S. Air Force member who set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington in February 2024, apparently to protest the Israel-Hamas war, according to the complaint.That man, who had been yelling \"Free Palestine,\"died at the hospital. Wednesday night's shooting is being investigated as a hate crime and a crime of terror, interim U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro told reporters. It is a \"death penalty-eligible case,\" she said. A witness told investigators that he heard gunshots Wednesday night and that when it stopped, he saw the gunman trying to shoot the weapon but that it didn't fire, according to the complaint. The witness said he saw the gunman running away and motioning as if he was tossing a gun, which police found later. Security video reviewed by police showed the gunman wearing a blue jacket with a hood and a large dark-colored backpack walking past where the two victims were standing near the museum. After he passed them, he took a firearm from his waistband and fired at them \"several times,\" and once they fell to the ground, he leaned over to them and fired \"several more times,\" according to the complaint. A female victim tried to crawl away, but the gunman followed her and fired his weapon, the complaint said, as he reloaded and then fired several times again. Forensics investigators recovered 21 expended 9 mm cartridge casings, a firearm magazine, an empty magazine and a 9 mm handgun with its slide locked, indicating that no ammunition was remaining, according to the complaint. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives traced the 9 mm handgun and found that Rodriguez bought it on March 6, 2020, in Illinois, the complaint added. Investigators say Rodriguez flew from Chicago to metropolitan Washington on Tuesday with a firearm he had declared in his checked luggage. He told them he bought a ticket to the museum event only three hours before it started, according to the complaint. Outside a brick apartment building on a quiet tree-lined street in the Albany Park neighborhood of Chicago early Thursday, law enforcement officers cordoned off an address tied to the suspect by public records. Several FBI vehicles pulled up to the building, and agents dressed in camo gear and carrying large firearms went inside. They later left with what looked like large electronic equipment. Chicago police were positioned outside, blocking the entrance to the street. John Wayne Fry, a neighbor, said he interacted with Rodriguez infrequently in the hallway or by the mailboxes but knew him for having a “Justice for Wadee” sign in his window.Wadee Alfayoumiwas a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy who was fatally stabbed by his landlord in Illinois days after the Israel-Hamas war erupted in 2023. Rodriguez “seemed like a normal, friendly guy,” Fry said, adding that the two had not spoken about Israel before but that he wished they had, because “I would have talked him out of it.” Efforts to reach Rodriguez's family in Chicago were not successful. Deputy FBI Director Dan Bonginowrote Thursday on Xthat the bureau “is aware of certain writings allegedly authored by the suspect, and we hope to have updates as to the authenticity very soon.” The writings include social media posts that indicate a motivation to act on behalf of the Palestinian people, authorities said. A LinkedIn account for the suspect shows he worked for the American Osteopathic Information Association as a “profiles administrative specialist” beginning in July. The organization confirmed that he was an employee. “As a physician organization dedicated to protecting the health and sanctity of human life, we believe in the rights of all persons to live safely without fear of violence,” the association said. Rodriguez also listed having worked as a coordinator and an oral history researcher from 2023 to 2024 for The HistoryMakers, a nonprofit organization in Chicago that collects video oral history of Black Americans. Anarchive of the websitesays Rodriguez is a Chicago native who earned an English degree from the University of Illinois at Chicago and had worked as a content writer in technology. Politicians, both prominent Republicans and Democrats, have condemned the shooting, which killed Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, 26. The couple were killed outside after they attended a Young Diplomats reception at the museum organized by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group. Ron Prosor, Israel’s ambassador to Germany,wrote on Xthat Lischinsky “was a Christian, a true lover of Israel, served in the IDF, and chose to dedicate his life to the State of Israel and the Zionist cause.” The IDF is the Israel Defense Forces. The New York Times reported he was the son of a Jewish father and a Christian mother. Israel’s ambassador to the United States, Yechiel Leiter, said Lischinsky was planning to propose to Milgrim. President Donald Trump wrote on social media that the attack was “based obviously on antisemitism,” while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who is Jewish, called it “another horrific instance of antisemitism which as we know is all too rampant in our society.”",

    "title": "FDA panel says Covid vaccines can stay the same for fall amid access concerns",
    "article_text": "A sense of unease permeated the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee meeting Thursday. The advisers had convened for what’s become a standard practice over the past few years: selecting a new strain for the fall’s updated Covid vaccines. Complicating matters, however, werenew FDA rules for the updated Covid vaccines, announced just days earlier, that would restrict access of the shots to only the most at-risk Americans. Under the rules, updated Covid vaccines for healthy children and adults under 65 must undergo additional placebo-controlled clinical trials — meaning some people would get the actual vaccine while others would get an inactive substance like a saline shot. The original Covid vaccines, approved in late 2020, went through this process. Since then, drugmakers transitioned over to a flu-vaccine model, using smaller studies to test whether the shots generated an immune response against the variant in question. New Covid vaccines for another group — adults 65 and up and kids and adults with at least one medical condition that puts them at risk for severe illness — were exempted from the new requirement, meaning additional clinical trials aren’t needed. Committee members grappled with a tough choice: recommend updating the vaccine, which could make it more effective but harder for healthy kids and adults to get, or stick with the current version, which might not work as well but would be easier for more people to access. “For example, if a different strain was selected for this season, would that require additional clinical trials?” committee member Dr. Sarah Meyer, chief medical officer of the immunization services division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, asked at one point. Ultimately, the committee unanimously voted to stick with vaccines targeting JN.1 or its lineages — the same strains used in the current shots. (Novavax’s shot targets JN.1; Pfizer’s and Moderna’s shots target KP.2, a descendant of JN.1.) The committee’s vote is only a recommendation, and the FDA doesn’t have to follow its advice. After the vote, anxiety lingered over the committee’s decision. “I wanted to know if we change strains, can we assume that age-specific licensure won’t change for any of these products?” said committee member Dr. Henry Bernstein, a professor of pediatrics at Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell in New York. Dr. Arnold Monto, the committee’s chair, noted “a feeling of somewhat unease” over what he said would normally be an easy decision: picking the predominant strain. Jerry Weir, director of the Division of Viral Products in the Office of Vaccines Research and Review at the FDA, said that he didn’t have an answer on who would be able to get the shots this fall, saying the agency was still working out details with the drugmakers. Still, FDA officials sought to allay committee members’ concerns. “Our goal is not to impact a timely availability of vaccines, but we’re really looking to all of you to give us your best judgement,” Dr. David Kaslow, the director of the FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review. The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is a group of outside scientists, doctors and public health experts that gives advice to the FDA on vaccines — including whether a vaccine is safe and effective, and whether it should be approved. The members are temporary, often serving in four-year terms. They must be highly qualified in areas like virology, infectious diseases and public health. They are required to report any professional or financial ties that might influence their judgment. If a conflict is found, they might be recused, or allowed to participate with restrictions, such as not being allowed to vote. Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA’s new vaccine chief, told the panel that limiting access to older adults and people with underlying conditions would put the U.S. in line with Western Europe and other nations. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says Covid vaccination efforts should focus onprotecting people at risk of severe illness, such adults 60 and up, people with weakened immune systems and those with underlying medical conditions. “Ultimately, we still want to give people a little more time to digest the policy,” Prasad said. “We’re still interested in soliciting questions and feedback and thoughts.” Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco, said she thinks the FDA will follow the committee’s recommendation. “But they already announced they will take a different approach to licensing it, limiting it to certain group, and they did not put that in front of the committee at all,” Reiss said.",

    "title": "CDC's childhood lead program is still defunct, despite Kennedy's claims",
    "article_text": "The federal government’s Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program is not operating, despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s claims that it's being funded. The program’s 26 staffers were placed on administrative leave in April, with terminations set for June 2, as part of a broader restructuring of federal agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. To date, none of the staffers have been reinstated, with layoffs set to take effect in less than two weeks, said Erik Svendsen, director of the Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice, a department within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that includes the childhood lead program. Kennedy had faced criticism in recent weeks from Democratic senators over the gutting of the program, which assisted state and local health departments with blood lead testing and surveillance. At ahearing before the Senate Appropriations Committeeon Tuesday, Kennedy told Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., that the program was still being funded. The week before, he told Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., that he had no plans to eliminate it. But Svendsen said his entire division was dissolved by HHS and can’t be easily replaced. “There are no other experts that do what we do,” he said. “You can’t just push a button and get new people because our areas of public health are so specialized.” Staffers in the childhood lead program have not received direction about how to transition their work, according to two CDC scientists familiar with the matter. Even low levels of lead exposure could put children at risk of developmental delays, learning difficulties and behavioral issues. The CDC program offered technical expertise to help under-resourced health departments prevent those outcomes. In 2023, it helped solve anationwide lead poisoning outbreak linked to cinnamon applesauce. And it was in frequent contact with the Milwaukee Health Department this year after the city discovered dangerous lead levels in some public schools. Kennedy told Reed on Tuesday that “we have a team in Milwaukee” offering laboratory and analytics support to the health department. But the Milwaukee Health Department said that Kennedy’s statement was inaccurate, and that the city had not received any federal epidemiological or analytical support related to the lead crisis. “Unfortunately, in this case, that is another example where the secretary doesn’t have his facts straight,” said Mike Totoraitis, the city’s health commissioner. Caroline Reinwald, a spokesperson for the Milwaukee Health Department, said that the federal government’s only recent involvement in the lead crisis was “a short, two-week visit from a single CDC staff member this month, who assisted with the validation of a new instrument in our laboratory.” “This support was requested independently of the [Milwaukee Public Schools] crisis and was part of a separate, pre-existing need to expand our lab’s long-term capacity for lead testing,” Reinwald said in a statement. HHS has said it will continue efforts to eliminate childhood lead poisoning through a newly created department called the Administration for a Healthy America. But Democratic lawmakers and environmental health groupsquestion how the work can continuewithout reinstating staffers. “Despite what you told me last week, that you have no intention of eliminating this program, you fired the entire office responsible for carrying it out,” Baldwin told Kennedy at Tuesday’s hearing. “Your decision to fire staff and eliminate offices is endangering children, including thousands of children in Milwaukee.” HHS did not respond to a request for comment. Kennedy did not offer new details about his agency’s restructuring plan at the hearing, citing a court order that compelled the Trump administration topause efforts to downsize the federal government. Milwaukee’s lead crisis became clear to health officials in February, when the city’s health department identified dangerous levels of the toxin in school classrooms, hallways and common areas, due to lead dust and deteriorating lead-based paint. Before the childhood lead program was gutted, the CDC had been meeting with the Milwaukee Health Department on a weekly basis to come up with a plan to screen tens of thousands of students for lead poisoning, Totoraitis said. The city’s health department asked the CDC on March 26 to send staffers to help, Totoraitis said, but the agency fired its childhood lead team on April 1 and denied Milwaukee’s request two days later. “This is the first time in at least 75 years that the CDC has ever denied an Epi-Aid request, so it’s a pretty historic moment,” he said, referring to a request for the CDC to investigate an urgent public health problem. To date, the Milwaukee Health Department has identified more than 100 schools built before 1978, when the federal government banned consumer uses of lead-based paints. Around 40 of those have been inspected, Totoraitis said. Six schools have closed since the start of the year due to lead contamination, and only two have reopened. Around 350 students in Milwaukee have been screened for lead poisoning out of 44,000 identified as having a potential risk, Totoraitis said. The city has confirmed one case linked to lead exposure in school, and two more linked to exposures at both school and home. The health department said it is investigating an additional four cases, which may involve multiple sources of exposure. Totoraitis said the department is accustomed to looking for lead in homes and rental units, but the CDC was supposed to help them scale that operation to inspect larger buildings. CDC staffers were also supposed to help set up lead screening clinics and investigate where kids had been exposed, he said. While the health department is handling those efforts on its own now, Totoraitis said it may not have the capacity to screen everyone in a timely manner. He estimated that the department could manage around 1,000 to 1,200 cases of childhood lead poisoning a year. That includes testing kids’ blood lead levels, treating lead poisoning with chelation therapy (which removes heavy metals from the bloodstream) and eliminating exposures in the home by replacing windows and doors. Totoraitis said he’s hoping to hire two of the terminated CDC employees for at least a couple of weeks to help address lingering questions about how to manage the crisis. Better yet, he said, “I keep hoping to get an email from them saying, ‘Hey, we got our jobs back.’”",

    "title": "Lawsuit challenges USDA demand for food stamp data as some states prepare to comply",
    "article_text": "By Jude Joffe-Block , Stephen Fowler The federal government wants states to turn over data about tens of millions of people who received food assistance benefits since 2020. A new lawsuit challenges that data request.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide caption A new lawsuit filed Thursday says the U.S. Department of Agriculture's demand for sensitive data about millions of food assistance recipients violates federal privacy laws. Meanwhile some states are preparing to comply with the unprecedented request which could be used to achieve Trump administration priorities, such as immigration enforcement. In new guidance issued earlier this month,the USDA told statesthey must turn over data to the agency, through their third-party payment processors, \"including but not limited to\" names, birth dates, Social Security numbers and addresses of all applicants and recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, going back more than five years. More than 40 million people rely on the assistance each month. The guidance warns failure to make the data available \"may trigger noncompliance procedures,\"which can meanlegal action and withholding funds. SNAP recipients, including some college students who are enrolled in the program, along with a privacy group and a national hunger group,sued in federal courtin Washington, D.C. and are asking a federal judge to halt the data collection until the agency complies with protocols outlined in federal law. The plaintiffs say that the USDA isn't following proper procedures for this kind of data collection effort, which include offering public notice, seeking public comment and publishing a privacy impact assessment ahead of time. For example, the Privacy Act requires a specific published notice, known as a Systems of Record Notice. The USDA declined to comment on the lawsuit. Earlier this month, an unnamed spokesperson using a USDA press email account told NPR the intent of the data sharing guidance \"was to remove the data silos\" and to uphold President Trump'sMarch 20 executive ordertitled, 'Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos.' The executive order calls for \"unfettered access to comprehensive data from all state programs that receive federal funding\" including from \"third-party databases.\" The same email said the agency's office of general counsel \"is determining if this new data sharing guidance falls under an existing published System of Records Notice or if it requires its own published notice.\" \"All personally identifiable information will comply with all privacy laws and regulations and will follow responsible data handling requirements,\" the email said. The legal fight over SNAP data comes the same day as Republicans in the House of Representatives passeda massive billthat includes deep cuts to SNAP. The ad-hoc Department of Government Efficiency is alsomerging data from across the federal governmentfor purposes that includeimmigration enforcementand identifying fraud. DOGE's data collection efforts have been contested inseveral legal cases. \"This case is part of a pattern that we're seeing from the Trump administration of agencies reaching out and grabbing the personal data of Americans,\" said Madeline Wiseman, counsel at the National Student Legal Defense Network, which is representing plaintiffs in the lawsuit along with attorneys from Protect Democracy, Electronic Privacy Information Center and the National Center for Law and Economic Justice. \"We have no idea what the government's up to – who's going to have access to this data, for what purposes, and whether USDA is going to keep it internal or whether USDA is going to share it with other federal agencies for other purposes,\" said Wiseman. Privacy experts warn that there would be huge implications if federal agencies are able to ignore privacy protections and compel states and private contractors to turn over sensitive data currently held only by states, as that could allow the federal government to create powerful surveillance tools. A former USDA official who worked in the agency's Food and Nutrition Service, which administers SNAP, underscored the unprecedented nature of the government's request. \"FNS has never had a nationwide list of everyone receiving SNAP benefits, let alone detailed personal information like their address or income,\" said the former official who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak with the media at their current job. The official said during the Biden administration, the agency \"intentionally designed its computer systems to not collect or store personally-identifiable information about people participating in nutrition programs, like SNAP and WIC, considering it too big of a risk to participant privacy and data security.\" Privacy advocates worry that the Trump administration's data collection efforts could be used for immigration enforcement.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide caption Whilesome stateshave indicated they are weighing the legality of USDA's data demand, other states with Republican governors told NPR they intend to comply. Iowa is \"working with our vendor to meet the request of the federal government,\" Alex Murphy, director of communications for the state's Department of Health and Human Services, told NPR in an email. Ohio is \"in the process of complying with the request,\" Ohio Department of Job and Family Services spokesperson Tom Betti wrote in an email. \"It is a substantial amount of data and will take some time to compile.\" Betti added the data will be shared through Ohio's EBT payment processor, Conduent. The Alaska Beaconreportedthat Alaska Department of Health spokesperson Alex Huseman said the state \"is complying with the federal government's requirement to share the information as requested.\" Huseman has not shared the same statement with NPR. Luke Elzinga, the board chair of the Iowa Hunger Coalition, told NPR that hunger advocates are already overwhelmed by proposed cuts to SNAP at a time when food pantries are facing historic demands in the state, and are now also concerned about the implications of the state sharing SNAP recipients' sensitive data. \"We're really worried that this could be used to target immigrant families,\" Elzinga told NPR. He said state agencies have worked hard to help immigrant households that are eligible for SNAP benefits feel confident in applying, but this new guidance will change that. While immigrants who lack legal status in the country are not eligible to receive SNAP and only some categories of legal immigrants qualify, parents can enroll their U.S. citizen children regardless of their own immigration status. The Trump administration has revoked legal protections for certain categories of immigrants, such as some groups with Temporary Protected Status. That means some SNAP recipients will become subject to deportation so having access to information about those recipients' addresses could be useful for federal authorities. \"If you're trying to design a public benefits program that supports the most vulnerable people and makes sure that nobody in our country goes hungry, this is obviously not the way to do it,\" said Ami Fields-Meyer, a senior fellow at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University specializing in the intersection between civil liberties and technology, and a former senior policy advisor to Vice President Kamala Harris. \"But if you're trying to integrate critical assistance into a machinery for hunting immigrants and breaking up families and deporting people without due process – this is exactly how you do it.\" States and their vendors keep sensitive data on many federally-funded programs and benefits, such as for Unemployment Insurance, Medicaid, and special education. The attorneys behind the lawsuit warn the USDA's demand for SNAP data could set a dangerous precedent. States could become \"the new battleground in the fight against DOGE's oversteps into the lives of Americans,\" said Nicole Schneidman, a technology policy strategist at Protect Democracy and one of the attorneys involved in the suit. \"This demand puts states in a no-win situation where they must break the law and betray their citizens or risk losing essential funding.\" After Maryland's payment processor, Conduent, informed the state's Department of Human Services about the USDA's request for SNAP data, the state agency sent a letter to its vendors, grantees, contractors and community partners asking them to forward any federal requests for data they might receive. The letter says any personally identifiable information and protected health information, \"should be kept confidential and not shared, disclosed or accessed, except in accordance with the contract and applicable law.\" Have information you want to share about SNAP, DOGE access to government databases and immigration?

    "title": "Proposed Muslim development in Texas brings inquiries by DOJ and state officials",
    "article_text": "From By Caroline Love The Plano EPIC mosque is seen behind a row of homes in Plano. Many muslims like to live near their mosque to facilitate practicing their faith daily.Yfat Yossifor/KERAhide caption DALLAS, Texas — The Department of Justiceis investigatinga proposed Muslim housing development in North Texas known as EPIC City for potential religious discrimination. Top state officials, including Republican Governor Greg Abbott have also launched investigations, even though the project's developers say they're years away from breaking ground. The East Plano Islamic Center – also known as EPIC – is a large mosque in Plano, a suburb North of Dallas. The mosque is running out of room as newcomers flock to the growing North Texas region. A member of EPIC who is a realtor proposed a solution when he saw some land for sale – why not build another community to accommodate the growing Muslim population in North Texas? Growing community Several of EPIC's members live within walking distance from the mosque. Black and white houses with manicured lawns in the adjoining neighborhood are adorned with Arabic lettering. There's a grocery store up the road from the mosque called EPIC Market that sells halal meat and a Yemeni coffee shop, Haraz Coffee, which serves pistachio lattes and saffron milk cakes. Fawzia Bilal lives close to the mosque. She says it makes it easier for her to integrate prayer into her daily routine. Muslims pray facing in the direction of Mecca, their holy land, five times a day. And holy periods like Ramadan call for additional prayer. \"I'm able to do this without getting into traffic or thinking about jumping into a car, walking distance,\" Bilal said. \"I mean, it's all about honestly convenience and then the consistency with which we're able to practice our faith.\" Plano resident Fawzia Belal stands near a projection of the future development of Epic City.Yfat Yossifor/KERAhide caption EPIC Islamic scholar Yasir Qadhi told NPR the mosque is running out of space for its 10,000 members. \"Why not build a purpose built community where all of the facilities, all of the amenities that people want are going to be within walking distance?\" Qadhi said. EPIC purchased the land for the project about a year ago. The 402-acre development would be in unincorporated Collin and Hunt counties, roughly 40 miles northeast of Dallas. EPIC City would include a new mosque, more than 1,000 single and multi-family homes, a K-12 faith-based school, senior housing, an outreach center, commercial developments, sports facilities, and a community college. Qadhi said the first 450 plots for EPIC City sold out within days of its announcements on the mosque's website. Future residents are purchasing shares to own a plot of land for future homes. In those purchases, there's a charge to help fund the construction of other buildings, like the mosque and school. Qadhi said that's how EPIC paid for the land, not external funding. \"The funds came from the very people that are going to be living in that area,\" he said. The probes Although EPIC City has yet to file for construction permits, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and State Attorney General Ken Paxton have already launched several investigations of the project. The state's probes include claims the project could be discriminating against non-Muslims in violation of the Texas Fair Housing Act, along with allegingpotential financial harm to potential investorsand potential violations of Texas consumer protection laws. Abbott said in apress releasethat the Texas Workforce Commission is investigating potential religious discrimination at EPIC City, which would violate theTexas Fair Housing Act. Abbott has accused the development,without providing any evidence,of creating a \"no-go zone\" that bans non-Muslims from entering. Qadhi said the proposed EPIC City will not be exclusive to Muslim residents. \"It's an open community,\" Qadhi said. \"Anybody can come in. We're welcoming people of all backgrounds and diversity and we're offering them facilities that we think would be very, very useful.\" Abbott has also launched a criminal investigation of the project, although It's unclear what criminal statutes EPIC or the project developers may have violated. Paxton has also not specified what consumer protection laws EPIC City may have violated, but he said in apress releasethe project has \"raised a number of concerns.\" Neither Abbott nor Paxton responded to NPR's requests for comment on the investigations. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the Department of Justice launched a federal probe in early May after heshared concernsabout religious discrimination and Sharia law, which forms parts of Islamic traditions but is not legally enforceable in the United States. \"Religious discrimination, whether explicit or implicit, is unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments,\" Cornyn wrote in his letter to the Attorney General. \"Religious freedom is a cornerstone of our nation's values, and I am concerned this community potentially undermines this vital protection.\" Misconceptions about Sharia Law and Islamophobia are at the center of many of the allegations being about EPIC City online and at a recent county government meeting. Mustafaa Carroll, executive director of the Dallas-Fort Worth office for the Council of American Islamic Relations, said Sharia Law is often misunderstood in the country. \"Your daughters are gonna wear burqas and your sons will be terrorists and they're gonna be killing people and people will be blowing folks up and all this kind of craziness,\" Carroll said. \"That's definitely not Sharia.\" Muslim scholars emphasize that Sharia law is deeply dependent on context. While conservative countries may enforce strict practices, Muslims in Western countries often do not. According to EPIC,Sharia encompasses aspects of Islamic traditions like when to pray, how to dress and what to eat. The governor's office criticized the Council of American Islamic Relations in a statement and accused the interfaith group of being linked to terrorism. The groupdenies those claims. Abbott recently said in apost on Xthat Texas halted construction at EPIC City after he ordered the project developerlast monthto cease construction or face legal action because the mosque hadn't acquired the necessary permits or authorizations from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. \"The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality found that the group behind the proposed EPIC compound did not submit the required permits to begin construction,\" he said. But Dan Cogdell, an attorney for the mosque, noted that no construction had begun at the site. He saidAbbott's order and the state's investigations are premature. \"We haven't started construction,\" he said. \"We haven't even filed for an application. It's like, good God, have a cup of coffee before you pop off.\" Online misinformation At a county government meeting early in March, Collin County officials heardconcernsfrom residents about the potential practice ofSharia Law in EPIC City. \"They will do the most Sharia compliance, including honor killings, stonings, marrying their young girls off to older men,\" said Krista Schild, a resident of Hunt County. \"Sharia has no freedom of religion, no freedom of speech, no freedom of thought, no freedom of artistic expression, and no equal rights for women,\" said Lee Breckenridge-Moore, a resident of Collin County. Schild and Moore offered no proof to support their statements. Moore referenced as evidence for her claims social media posts from Amy Mek, the founder and editor in chief of RAIR Foundation USA.The Southern Poverty Law Centerhas categorized RAIR as an anti-Muslim hate group. One of Mek's posts that accused city and school district officials in Plano of colluding with EPIC to shape school policy received about 8,900 likes and 7,800 shares. A few days later, Paxton announced in apress releasehe was demanding documents from the Plano Independent School District outlining \"potential connections\" to EPIC. Public vitriol EPIC member Fawzia Bilal said the attacks on her mosque and faith are disheartening. \"If I'm going out alone, then there is this fear,\" Bilal said. \"Am I going to hear something? Am I going to be targeted?\" Bilal said most people in Plano are accepting because the mosque has a strong presence and is known for its service and contributions to the community. She hopes that message will come through. \"No matter how loud the voices of hatred are, the voice of hope and the voice of understanding and reasoning will eventually overpower these negative voices,\" she said. In the meantime, Cogdell said EPIC will cooperate fully with all state and federal investigations. He also said he expects the political scrutiny to delay the project, leaving the Muslim community in North Texas with less room to grow. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Voice of America's prospects appear grim after appeals court order",
    "article_text": "David Folkenflik A sign outside of the Voice of America headquarters in Washington, DC, US, in March, shortly after President Trump signed an executive order aimed at reducing the scope of eight federal agencies as part of his campaign to downsize the US government, including the US Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America.Bloomberg/Getty Imageshide caption A federal appeals court on Thursday dashed the hopes of journalists and free-press advocacy groups seeking to stave off the near-total dismantlement of Voice of America by the Trump White House. The administration, led by senior adviser Kari Lake, has iced almost the entire workforce. It has laid off hundreds of contract employees and put permanent workers on indefinite leave, citinga March 14 executive order from Trump. Last month,U.S. District Court Senior Judge Royce C. Lamberth orderedLake and the Voice of America's federal parent, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, to bring back workers and get the network up and running, as Congress intended through law. He also ruled that the administration had to restore Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks, calling their dismemberment \"arbitrary and capricious.\" \"Not only is there an absence of 'reasoned analysis' from the defendants; there is an absence of any analysis whatsoever,\" Lamberth wrote. Earlier this month, by a 2-to-1 margin, an appeals court panel temporarily froze Lamberth's ruling, as it takes time to consider the full merits of the case. It has not yet issued a decision on the full case. In the meantime, however, Lake has plunged back into slashing the ranks of the workforce, with hundreds of contract employees let go for a second time over the past weekend. TheVoice of America websitehasn't posted new stories in more than two months. On Thursday, the full appellate court made clear it would not intervene, at least for now. \"We are devastated and concerned that this ruling might lead to further adverse reactions from the administration,\" Patsy Widakuswara, the lead plaintiff and White House bureau chief for Voice of America tells NPR. \"But our day in court is not over yet, and we are committed to fighting until we can return to our congressionally mandated right to broadcast factual, balanced, and comprehensive news.\" Lake did not reply to a request for comment. What future lies in store for the network and its sister broadcasters remains unclear. Under Lake's guidance, the agency has killed a lease for a new headquarters, canceled contracts to carry reporting from the Associated Press, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse wire services, and struck a deal to carry coverage from the far-right and pro-Trump One America News network. Lamberth's requirement that Lake and the agency comply with the law stays in effect. Administration officials maintain they are doing just that — even as they withhold money from VOA and its sister networks that Congress has allocated. Trump's March executive order called for the U.S. Agency for Global Media and several other institutions to be \"eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.\" The order also stated that those organizations \"shall reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law:\" The White Housecited the moveas part of a broader effort to cut government waste on \"frivolous expenditures that fail to align with American values or address the needs of the American people.\" In addition to Widakuswara, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit include VOA Director Michael Abramowitz and at least one unnamed U.S. Agency for Global Media employee. The workforce, which has been reduced to a token presence, has been whipsawed between the various court rulings. The plaintiffs say the administration has violated clear-cut Congressional statutes as well as Constitutional protections of free speech. \"With the decision today, I am concerned that USAGM will move quickly to make further reductions,\" Abramowitz wrote in a letter to staff Thursday. \"Please be assured that we are reviewing our legal options.\" According to three employees of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, Lake appears intent on running the agency on a shoestring, and reducing Voice of America to a handful of foreign language services, including Mandarin for China, Farsi for Iran, and Dari and Pashto for Afghanistan. (The people who spoke were granted anonymity to characterize unfolding events at the agency, given fears of retaliation.) Voice of America was established in World War II to provide reliable news in places controlled by the Nazis and to hold out the prospect of what life could be like under democratic Allied rule. Taken together, VOA and its four sister networksreach420 million people in 63 languages and more than 100 countries each week, according to the U.S. Agency for Global Media. They are fully funded by the U.S. government. The networks' mission is to deliver news coverage and cultural programming to places where a free press is threatened or doesn't exist. They are also designed as a form of soft diplomacy, modeling independent journalism that incorporates dissent from government policy. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, founded early in the Cold War, this weeksecured millions of dollars from the European Unionas a temporary lifeline as it awaits its Congressionally authorized payments for the month of May. The government owes it $75 million for the rest of the year, under legislation passed by Congress. The network, which a court ordered the government to pay,  has already engaged in furloughs and cut back on programming as it awaits the funds. In her public rhetoric, mostly on social media and right-wing media appearances, Lake has veered between promising to restore the networks to their historic mission and pledging to demolish them. In December, then President-elect Trump said he would appoint Lake to lead Voice of America,though he does not have legal authority to do so. She called the network \"a vital international media outlet dedicated to advancing the interests of the United States by engaging directly with people across the globe and promoting democracy and truth.\" A few days after Trump's inauguration, Lake said she wanted to make sure Voice of America was \"telling the American story accurately and fairly.\" \"We don't want VOA to be Trump Derangement Syndrome News, nor do we want it to be Trump TV,\" Lake tweeted. In March, a few days after Trump's executive order, she called the network \"unsalvageable.\" In April, Lake called Voice of America \"anti-American propaganda\" and said she was \"scaling it back.\" In early May, Lake hailed the appellate panel's ruling. \"BIG WIN,\" she posted on social media. \"Turns out the District Court judge will not be able to manage the agency as he seemed to want to.\" The full appellate court Thursday allowed Lake to proceed, at least for the moment. That said, in a case with some parallels, a federal judge on Mondaystruck down the takeover of the U.S. Institute for Peaceby the White House budget-cutting DOGE initiative. In March, the same judgedeclinedto issue a temporary ruling blocking the move by DOGE staffers, reserving her right to rule on the merits subsequently. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "By Fatima Al-Kassab This image released by the U.S. Navy shows an aerial view of Diego Garcia, a remote island in the Indian Ocean.U.S. Navy/APhide caption LONDON — The United Kingdom has signed a deal to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, in an agreement Britain says will also ensure the future of a strategically important U.S. military base. TheChagos Islandsare an archipelago in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Under the deal, the U.K. can continue leasing the largest of the islands, Diego Garcia, keeping the keymilitary facilityin British and American hands for at least 99 years. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio welcomed the agreement between the U.K. and Mauritius and said in astatementthat President Trump \"expressed his support for this monumental achievement\" whenhe met British Prime Minister Keir Starmerat the White House in February. Starmersaid the dealto secure the U.K.-U.S. military base in Diego Garcia — to be leased formore than $100 milliona year — is vital for Britain's defense, intelligence and national security. The prime minister of Mauritius, Navin Ramgoolam, hailed the deal as a \"great victory for the Mauritian nation,\" and said, \"We are completing the process of total decolonization.\" The deal comes after a lengthy dispute over the islands that has involved questions over Britain's colonial legacy. The Chagos Archipelago became aBritish territoryin 1814. In 1965, the U.K. formally separated the islands from its then-colony Mauritius, before Mauritius gained independence three years later. In the late 1960s, the U.K. invited the U.S. to build a military base on Diego Garcia, whichforced thousands of peoplefrom their homes. But despite the U.K. paying3 million poundsfor the islands, Mauritius has argued it was illegally forced to give them away as part of a deal to gain independence from Britain. International courts have sided with Mauritius, a country of few more than1 million people. In anonbinding opinionin 2019, the International Court of Justice in The Hague concluded that \"the process of decolonization of Mauritius was not lawfully completed when that country acceded to independence\" and that \"the United Kingdom is under an obligation to bring to an end its administration of the Chagos Archipelago as rapidly as possible.\" Then in 2021, a United Nations maritime courtrejectedBritain's claim to sovereignty over the islands. Now, the U.K. and Mauritius have signed an agreement stating \"Mauritius is sovereign over the Chagos Archipelago in its entirety, including Diego Garcia.\" But Prime Minister Starmer underscored the significance of being able to lease back the island where the key military base is located. At U.K. military headquarters in Northwood, near London, Starmer told reporters that the deal was \"one of the most significant contributions that we make to our security relationship with the United States.\" He said much of what the military base is used for is highly classified, but \"the strategic location of this base is of the utmost significance to Britain.\" He said it was important for \"defeating terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan\" and helped \"reduce the risks to brave British and American servicemen and women.\" The British government said the deal was backed by the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which are part of an intelligence-sharing partnership with the U.K. Some Chagossians, as the islands' people are known,have expressed support for the deal, while others are strongly against it. The largest Chagossian community in the U.K. is in Crawley, Sussex, in South East England. The town's representative in British Parliament, Labour member Peter Lamb, criticized the deal, saying it did not secure the right for Chagossians to return to their homeland. \"What should I tell my Chagossian constituents, when they ask the moral basis upon which the U.K. is ignoring their right to self-determination while we fight for it in Ukraine for Ukrainians?\" he said in Parliament Thursday. Some opposition politicians railed against the agreement. \"The Chagos Islands have been British since 1814. Only Keir Starmer's Labour Party would negotiate a deal where we're paying to give something away,\" Conservative Party leaderKemi Badenoch said. \"This is a vital military base. Mauritius is an ally of China.\" Right-wing populist Reform U.K. party leader Nigel Farage alsosaid the move\"plays into China's hands.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Jasmine Garsd White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt talks to reporters in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on May 22, 2025 in Washington, DC.Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images/Getty Images North Americahide caption The White House has announced that a flight with eight immigrants which was reportedlyheading to South Sudanwill instead remain in the East African country of Djibouti for at least two weeks, in order to comply with afederal court order. The migrants are from Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba, Mexico and South Sudan. Earlier this week, they were placed on a deportation flight out of Texas. Lawyers representing the eight migrants were told they were being sent to South Sudan, but the Department of Homeland Security declined to confirm the final destination of the flight. \"Let's be clear,\" attorney Jonathan Ryan, who represents one of the migrants on that flight,told NPR on Wednesday morning, \"my client has disappeared. I do not know where my client is.\" He did not find out for 36 hours - until a judge ordered the government to reveal the location. In a hearing in Boston on Wednesday afternoon, federal Judge Brian E. Murphyof the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts said the Trump administration was in violation of his injunction which prevents people from being deported to countries other than their own without a chance to challenge their deportation order. They must also be given notice in their native language. Judge Murphy ordered that the individuals be given at least 15 days to challenge their deportation. The White House has said the migrants in question are violent criminals. According to D.H.S documents the men had been convicted of crimes including murder, sexual assault, kidnapping and robbery. During a briefing earlier today, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the deported immigrants will stay in Djibouti for two weeks. She also accused Murphy of undermining U.S. diplomatic relationships and national security. \"Judge Murphy is forcing federal officials to remain in Djibouti for over two weeks threatening our U.S. diplomatic relationships with countries around the world and putting the agents' lives in danger by having to be with these illegal murderers, criminals and rapists.\" The Government must now give the deportees what's known as \"reasonable fear\" interviews, in order to assess whether they are entitled to stay in the U.S. due to risk of persecution or torture in the country they are being sent to. If they express a fear, they must get at least two weeks to contest their deportation to a third country. Murphy did not rule out holding the Trump administration in contempt of court for violating his initial order, but said that would be left for a later time. Questions about U.S. authority over migrants deported to other countries have arisen in several other high-profile immigration cases, raising questions about the limits of judicial authority. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been negotiating with several other countries to accept people being deported from the U.S. If you have immigration tips you can contact our tip line, on Whatsapp and Signal: 202-713-6697 or reporter Jasmine Garsd:jgarsd@npr.org Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

The project's developers say they're years away from breaking ground. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:A large proposed Muslim housing development in North Texas is facing unprecedented scrutiny from top state officials. They are calling for investigations, including a Department of Justice probe. Caroline Love from member station KERA in Dallas has more.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Singing in non-English language).CAROLINE LOVE, BYLINE: Many members of the East Plano Islamic Center - also known as EPIC - live a short walk away so they can answer the call to prayer. They shop at nearby grocery stores that sell halal meat and drink coffee at a cafe that serves pistachio lattes and saffron milk cakes. Islamic scholar Yasir Qadhi says this growing community needs more space.YASIR QADHI: So the idea came - well, then why not build a purpose-built community?LOVE: That community is EPIC City. The proposed housing development would be about 40 miles northeast of Dallas. It would have a new mosque, more than a thousand single and multifamily homes, a faith-based school, commercial developments and more.EPIC City hasn't been built yet, but Texas Governor Greg Abbott and state Attorney General Ken Paxton have already started several investigations into the project. Abbott and Paxton claim the project violates the state's fair housing and consumer protection laws. And Texas Senator John Cornyn says the Department of Justice launched a federal probe early May, after he shared concerns about religious discrimination.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:A large proposed Muslim housing development in North Texas is facing unprecedented scrutiny from top state officials. They are calling for investigations, including a Department of Justice probe. Caroline Love from member station KERA in Dallas has more.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Singing in non-English language).CAROLINE LOVE, BYLINE: Many members of the East Plano Islamic Center - also known as EPIC - live a short walk away so they can answer the call to prayer. They shop at nearby grocery stores that sell halal meat and drink coffee at a cafe that serves pistachio lattes and saffron milk cakes. Islamic scholar Yasir Qadhi says this growing community needs more space.YASIR QADHI: So the idea came - well, then why not build a purpose-built community?LOVE: That community is EPIC City. The proposed housing development would be about 40 miles northeast of Dallas. It would have a new mosque, more than a thousand single and multifamily homes, a faith-based school, commercial developments and more.EPIC City hasn't been built yet, but Texas Governor Greg Abbott and state Attorney General Ken Paxton have already started several investigations into the project. Abbott and Paxton claim the project violates the state's fair housing and consumer protection laws. And Texas Senator John Cornyn says the Department of Justice launched a federal probe early May, after he shared concerns about religious discrimination.

    "title": "Why did university police chase a student and his baby across a graduation stage?",
    "article_text": "By Alana Wise Jean Paul Al Arab and his son, 6-month-old Mtanos, celebrate the elder Al Arab's graduation from the University at Buffalo.Jean Paul Al Arabhide caption Jean Paul Al Arab felt like a proud dad this week when he prepared to walk across the University at Buffalo stage with his son, 6-month-old Mtanos. The pair donned matching blue caps and gowns and queued up in line behind fellow 2025 graduates, with the elder Al Arab ready to accept his Bachelor of Arts degree in criminology. But rather than a joyful but tranquil parade down the stage during the commencement ceremony,what happened instead was a high-speed foot chase, as Al Arab sprinted across the stage,clutching his baby boy,with a university police officer darting behind him. Viralvideo from the eventshows the pair make it across the stage. Al Arab shakes hands with school officials before triumphantly pumping his fist in the air to wild cheers from the audience. Al Arab posted a video of the incident, backed by the hit Kendrick Lamar song \"Not Like Us,\"to his TikTokaccount where it has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Speaking to NPR on Thursday, Al Arab said the incident sprung from a disagreement over whether or not he could tote the infant across stage with him to celebrate his achievement. \"During the prep class for the ceremony last semester, they told me that it was fine to walk with the baby,\" Al Arab said. \"And I've seen people walk with their dogs. I've seen even moms walking with their babies, you know, even at other colleges, I'm not just talking about [University at Buffalo]. So I didn't think honestly twice.\" But onSunday as he prepared to make the ceremonial walk with his son, Al Arab said that a single university staff member attempted to stop him from carrying Mtanos with him to accept his diploma. But after months as Mtanos' primary caretaker during the day while his wife worked, and spending nights on a restaurant graveyard shift, Al Arab — who moved to the United States from Lebanon three years ago — felt he had a duty to see it through. \"Being a full-time dad, a full-time student, and a full-time employee, I thought to myself, like, [Mtanos is] part of it. I promised myself and I promised him that I would be walking that stage with him,\" Al Arab said. \"At that time, I was just a proud dad,\" he said. \"I just wanted to cross with my baby.\" Al Arab said that growing up, his father was not as present in his life as he is able to be for Mtanos. He felt that the moment of crossing the graduation stage with his son set a good example for other fathers to prioritize being active in their children's lives. \"I would describe it as a healthy relationship between a father and son, especially me, coming from a family [where] I don't have a father who was present, so I think that I have a lot of responsibilities towards my son,\" Al Arab said. The University at Buffalo wrotein a statementon Wednesday that its graduation ceremony rules dictate that only the student accepting a diploma is allowed to walk across the stage. The school said that although Al Arab had broken the rules, he would not be penalized and his diploma still issued as expected. \"During Sunday's commencement ceremony for University at Buffalo's College of Arts and Sciences, a graduating senior ignored multiple directives from university event staff and UB Police, ran away from officers, and broke commencement rules by bringing an infant onto the commencement stage at Alumni Arena,\" the school said. \"While the situation created a light-hearted moment for the thousands in attendance who cheered on as the graduate took to the stage with the infant in his arms, the graduate's actions were a violation of commencement rules,\" the statement continued, adding thatthose guidelineswere in place for safety reasons and to help minimize potential disruptions. Al Arab said the moment of chaos onstage inspired him to start a GoFundMe, with a goal of raising$100,000, to help other student parents who are balancing raising children with pursuing higher education. \"Balancing two jobs, being a full-time dad, and pursuing my education has been challenging, but I promised my son that I would walk that stage with him. It symbolized every sacrifice and sleepless night,\" he wrote on the crowdfunding site. Al Arab told NPR that students had already expressed interest in receiving help from the GoFundMe, and he would be working with his former professors to help get the money directly into young parents' hands. Even though Al Arab's son crossed the graduation stage in traditional commencement regalia, the school said the boy would have to wait a little longer to be considered a full-fledged member of the University at Buffalo family. \"The infant, despite crossing the stage in a cap and gown, has not yet earned enough credits to receive a diploma. We hope to see him back on stage in about 20 years so he can follow in his dad's footsteps,\" it saidin the statement. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Supreme Court allows Trump to fire members of independent agency boards — for now",
    "article_text": "Nina Totenberg The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday granted for now the Trump administration's emergency request to let him fire the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board.Chip Somodevilla/Getty Imageshide caption The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday granted the Trump administration's emergency request to fire the heads of two independent agencies, the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board. The vote was 6-3 with the liberals in dissent. While the decision is technically a temporary one, its tone is pretty final. The language of Thursday's two-page unsigned order clearly forecasts the eventual outcome of the case when it is argued before the court, likely next year. For example, there is a carve-out for the Federal Reserve, essentially insulating it from the order. The idea the president could fire members of the Fed has spooked markets. And that has been the fly in the ointment of those who want to corral federal agencies and make all the commissions like the SEC and the FTC, subject to firing at will by the president. Specifically at issue in the case was President Trump's firing of National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, who still has three years left on her term as a member of the Board, and Cathy Harris, who still has four years left on her term as a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which handles employment challenges brought by federal workers. Shortly after taking office for a second time, Trump began makingsweeping personnel changesthroughout the federal government, andfiring the heads of several administrative agencies, including Wilcox and Harris, both Biden appointees. The firings contradict statutes enacted by Congress that explicitly bar the president from firing members of the NLRB and the Merit Systems Protections Board without cause, meaning bad conduct. These protections exist, in part, thanks to a longstanding Supreme Court decision that for nearly a century has formed the basis for how most independent federal agencies operate, including statutory provisions for many agencies that limit the number of agency members from any one party. Ironically, the longstanding precedent at issue in the case arose in 1933 when President Franklin Roosevelt fired William Humphrey, one of five members on the Federal Trade Commission. Roosevelt didn't have a problem with Humphrey's job performance. The sole reason for the dismissal was that Humphrey had been appointed by the previous president, Republican Herbert Hoover, and was a conservative who disagreed with Roosevelt's policy views. Because the FTC had oversight over many progressive New Deal policies, Roosevelt wanted Humphrey replaced with his own appointee. The Supreme Court, however, ruled unanimously in 1935 that the president could not dismiss FTC commissioners the way he could his own Cabinet or other members of his administration, and that he could only fire members of independent agencies for cause, meaning misconduct. While the Humphrey precedent is technically still in place, the current Supreme Court, dominated by a 6-to-3 conservative majority, has for years been chipping away at the it, without overruling it entirely. In 2020, the high court narrowed the Humphrey decision when it allowed President Trump, in his first term, to fire the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, another independent federal agency. In that decision, the Supreme Court distinguished between independent agencies run by a single director, whom the president may fire for any reason, and independent agencies run by a board–made up of both Republicans and Democrats–who until now could only be fired for bad conduct. Before joining the court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh in particulartook issue with the Humphrey decision repeatedly. But he is not alone, Justice Neil Gorsuch believes thatthe executive has been unconstitutionally weakenedby a surplus of independent regulatory agencies and executive branch officials that are beyond the president's control. Justice Samuel Alito expressed similar views before joining the court,saying of the presidency, \"the president has not just some executive powers, buttheexecutive power — the whole thing.\". Writing for the three dissenters, Justice Elena Kagan quoted Alexander Hamilton as saying: \"To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents.\" Today's order, she said, \"favors the president over our precedent.\" And, she added, \"it does so unrestrained by the rules of briefing and argument—and the passage of time—needed to discipline our decision-making. I would deny the President's application. I would do so based on the will of Congress, this Court's seminal decision approving independent agencies' for-cause protections, and the ensuing 90 years of this Nation's history.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "In 3.5 years, Notepad.exe has gone from “barely maintained” to “it writes for you”",
    "article_text": "AI features in Windows are gradually becoming more widespread and inescapable. By late 2021, major updates for Windows' built-in Notepad text editor had been so rare for so long that a gentle redesign and a handful of new settings wererated as a major update. New updates have become much more common since then, but like the rest of Windows, recent additions have been overwhelmingly weighted in the direction of generative AI. In November, Microsoftbegan testing an updatethat allowed users to rewrite or summarize text in Notepad using generative AI. Another preview update todaytakes it one step further, allowing you to write AI-generated text from scratch with basic instructions (the feature is called Write, to differentiate it from the earlier Rewrite). Like Rewrite and Summarize, Write requires users to be signed into a Microsoft Account, because using it requires you to use your monthly allotment of Microsoft's AI credits.Per this support page, users without a paid Microsoft 365 subscription get 15 credits per month. Subscribers with Personal and Family subscriptions get 60 credits per month instead. Microsoft notes that all AI features in Notepad can be disabled in the app's settings, and obviously, they won't be available if you use a local account instead of a Microsoft Account. Microsoft is also releasing preview updates for Paint and Snipping Tool, two other bedrock Windows apps that hadn't seen much by way of major updates before the Windows 11 era. Paint's features are also mostly AI-related, including a \"sticker generator\" and an AI-powered smart select tool \"to help you isolate and edit individual elements in your image.\" A new \"welcome experience\" screen that appears the first time you launch the app will walk you through the (again, mostly AI-related) new features Microsoft has added to Paint in the last couple of years. Snipping Tool gets two new features. One is a color picker that will let you see the hex, RGB, or HSL values of colors in a given screenshot. The other is a \"perfect screenshot\" option that will attempt to automatically crop app windows or other elements onscreen without requiring you to edit it manually after you capture it. The perfect screenshot feature appears to use local processing rather than cloud processing, because it requires aCopilot+ PC. This means using it doesn't require AI credits, but it will also only function on brand-new PCs with certain Qualcomm Snapdragon, Intel Core Ultra, or AMD Ryzen AI processors inside. These updates are rolling out to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev channels, which get new features faster than the Beta or Release Preview channels but are also less stable. Not all of these features will make it to the general public, but the ones that do should be released in the next few weeks or months.

    "title": "The Pentagon seems to be fed up with ULA’s rocket delays",
    "article_text": "\"The ULA Vulcan program has performed unsatisfactorily this past year.\" In recent written testimony to a US House of Representatives subcommittee that oversees the military, the senior official responsible for purchasing launches for national security missions blistered one of the country's two primary rocket providers. The remarks from Major General Stephen G. Purdy, acting assistant secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration, concerned United Launch Alliance and its long-delayed development of the large Vulcan rocket. \"The ULA Vulcan program has performed unsatisfactorily this past year,\" Purdy said inwritten testimonyduring a May 14 hearing before the House Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. This portion of his testimony did not come up during the hearing, and it has not been reported publicly to date. \"Major issues with the Vulcan have overshadowed its successful certification resulting in delays to the launch of four national security missions,\" Purdy wrote. \"Despite the retirement of highly successful Atlas and Delta launch vehicles, the transition to Vulcan has been slow and continues to impact the completion of Space Force mission objectives.\" It has widely been known in the space community that military officials, who supported Vulcan with development contracts for the rocket and its engines that exceeded $1 billion, have been unhappy with the pace of the rocket's development. It was originally due to launch in 2020 and ferry critical national security missions shortly afterward. But this displeasure has largely remained out of the public eye. However, behind closed doors, missives have been flying. About a year ago, another Air Force official,Frank Calvelli, wrote to ULAand said he was \"growing concerned\" about the company's ability to scale manufacturing of the Vulcan rocket and meet the military's cadence needs. Calvelli noted that ULA had a backlog of more than two dozen national security missions that were sitting on the ground due to delays. Some of the displeasure was apparent in Aprilwhen the US military announcedthat it would ask SpaceX to launch a plurality of its missions during the next round of national security launches, reversing the preeminent role that ULA had held for the last two decades. ULA retired its Delta IV Heavy rocket in April 2024, and the handful of Atlas V rockets that remain are committed to other missions. This has left the Air Force dependent on SpaceX, with its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles, as the only provider of launch services to get its most expensive and highest priority satellites into orbit. In his testimony, Purdy said ULA completed certification of the initial variant of its Vulcan rocket for military launches from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on March 25, but added that \"open work\" remains. The military and the company are currently working through \"risk reduction plans\" to limit the chances of an issue with the first launch of a military payload on Vulcan. \"To address these challenges ULA has increased its engineering resources and management focus to resolve design issues,\" Purdy wrote. \"Government and Federally Funded Research and Development Center personnel have increased involvement in technical and program management challenges. Vulcan's first military mission, USSF-106, currently has a no earlier than launch date of July 2025, Purdy wrote. These outstanding risks will ultimately be assessed during a Flight Readiness Review a week or two prior to this launch. At the end of his written testimony, Purdy emphasized that he expected ULA to do better. As part of his job as the Service Acquisition Executive for Space (SAE), Purdy noted that he has been tasked to transform space acquisition and to become more innovative. \"For these programs, the prime contractors must re-establish baselines, establish a culture of accountability, and repair trust deficit to prove to the SAE that they are adopting the acquisition principles necessary to deliver capabilities at speed, on cost and on schedule,\" Purdy said.

    "title": "Why console makers can legally brick your game console",
    "article_text": "\"If the ability [to brick a console] is there, someone will want to 'see how it goes.'\" Earlier this month, Nintendoreceived a lot of negative attention for an end-user license agreement(EULA) update granting the company the claimed right to render Switch consoles \"permanently unusable in whole or in part\" for violations such as suspected hacking or piracy. As it turns out, though, Nintendo isn't the only console manufacturer that threatens to remotely brick systems in response to rule violations. And attorneys tell Ars Technica that they're probably well within their legal rights to do so. Sony'sSystem Software License Agreement on the PS5, for instance, contains the following paragraph of \"remedies\" it can take for \"violations\" such as use of modified hardware or pirated software (emphasis added). If SIE Inc determines that you have violated this Agreement's terms, SIE Inc may itself or may procure the taking of any action to protect its interests such as disabling access to or use of some or all System Software,disabling use of this PS5 system online or offline, termination of your access to PlayStation Network, denial of any warranty, repair or other services provided for your PS5 system, implementation of automatic or mandatory updates or devicesintended to discontinue unauthorized use, or reliance on any other remedial efforts as reasonably necessary to prevent the use of modified or unpermitted use of System Software. The same exact clause appears inthe PlayStation 4 EULAas well. ThePlayStation 3 EULAwas missing the \"disabling use... online or offline\" clause, but it does still warn that Sony can take steps to \"discontinue unauthorized use\" or \"prevent the use of a modified PS3 system, or any pirated material or equipment.\" Microsoft, if anything, is even more straightforward inits Xbox Software License Agreement. Efforts to \"install Unauthorized Software\" or \"defeat or circumvent any... technical limitation, security, or anti-piracy system\" can mean that \"your Xbox Console, Kinect Sensor or Authorized Accessory may stop working permanently at that time or after a later Xbox Software update,\" the company writes. While it's unclear how far back in history this legal clause goes, the mention of the now-defunct Kinect sensor suggests it dates back at least to the Xbox One era. While console makers routinely ban players and consoles from online play and services, remotely bricking a game console'sofflinecapabilities for EULA violations seems exceedingly rare in practice. Even when cases of public console hacking have led to protracted legal fights—such asGeorge Hotz's saga with the PS3orTeam Xecuter's Switch jailbreaks—console makers don't seem to have used technical means to completely disable offline functions for specific consoles. In 2015, Microsoft even went so far as to actively deny reports that it had bricked a console associated with a leak of an earlyGears of Warbeta. \"To be clear, if a console is suspended from Xbox Live for a violation of the Terms of Use, it can still be used offline,\" Microsoftsaid at the time. \"Microsoft enforcement action does not result in a console becoming unusable.\" That said, it appears console makers sometimes take steps to remotely brick consoles after they've been reported stolen. It'snot hardto findonline reportsof peoplebuying used consolesonly to find that they had been rendered entirely useless due to a prior theft. As always with secondhand hardware, let the buyer beware. Just because the major console makers don't tend to make use of the \"brick switch\" on their hardware doesn't mean they don't have the legal right to do so. \"Although users own the hardware, the software that's needed to run it is subject to a license agreement,\" attorney Jon Loiterman told Ars. \"If you violate the license terms, Nintendo has the right to revoke your access to that software. It's less common for software makers to revoke access to software in a way that disables hardware you bought from them, but the principle is the same.\" While these kinds of \"bricking\" clauses haven't been tested in court, lawyers who spoke to Ars felt they would probably hold up to judicial review. That's especially true if the facts of the \"bricking\" case centered around software piracy or some other method of getting around digital rights protections baked into the console itself. \"Unfortunately, 'bricking' personal devices to limit users’ rights and control their behavior is nothing new,\" Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Victoria Noble told Ars Technica. \"It would likely take selective enforcement to rise to a problematic level [in court],\" attorney Richard Hoeg said. Last year, a collection of 17 consumer groupsurged the Federal Trade Commissionto take a look at the way companies use the so-called practice of \"software tethering\" to control a device's hardware features after purchase. Thus far, though, the federal consumer watchdog hasshown little interestin enforcing complaints against companies that do so. \"Companies should not use EULAs to strip people of rights that we normally associate with ownership, like the right to tinker with or modify their own personal devices,\" Noble told Ars. \"[Console] owners deserve the right to make otherwise legal modifications to their own devices without fear that a company will punish them by remotely bricking their [systems].\" In the end, these kinds of draconian bricking clauses may be doing their job even if the console makers involved don't invoke them. \"In practice, I expect this kind of thing is more about scaring people away from jailbreaking and modifying their systems and that Nintendo is unlikely to go about bricking large volumes of devices, even if they technically have the right to,\" Loiterman said. \"Just because they put a remedy in the EULA doesn’t mean they will certainly use it either,\" attorney Mark Methenitis said. \"My suspicion is this is to go after the people who eventually succeeded in jailbreaking the original Switch and try to prevent that for the Switch 2.\" The threat of public backlash could also hold the console makers back from limiting the offline functionality of any hacked consoles. After citing public scrutiny that companies likeTesla,Keurig, andJohn Deerefaced for limiting hardware via software updates, Methenitis said that he \"would imagine Nintendo would suffer similar bad publicity if they push things too far.\" That said, legal capacities can sometimes tend to invite their own use. \"If the ability is there, someone will want to 'see how it goes.'\" Hoeg said.

    "title": "Musk’s DOGE used Meta’s Llama 2—not Grok—for gov’t slashing, report says",
    "article_text": "Grok apparently wasn't an option. An outdated Meta AI model was apparently at the center of the Department of Government Efficiency's initial ploy to purge parts of the federal government. Wired reviewed materialsshowing that affiliates of Elon Musk's DOGE working in the Office of Personnel Management \"tested and used Meta’s Llama 2 model to review and classify responses from federal workers to the infamous 'Fork in the Road' email that was sent across the government in late January.\" The \"Fork in the Road\" memoseemed to copy a memo that Musk sent to Twitter employees, giving federal workers the choice to be \"loyal\"—and accept the government's return-to-office policy—or else resign. At the time, it was rumored that DOGE was feeding government employee data into AI, and Wired confirmed that records indicateLlama 2was used to sort through responses and see how many employees had resigned. Llama 2 is perhaps best known for being part of another scandal. In November, Chinese researchers used Llama 2 as the foundation for an AI model used by the Chinese military, Reutersreported. Responding to the backlash, Meta told Reuters that the researchers' reliance on a “single\" and \"outdated\" was \"unauthorized,\" then promptly reversed policies banning military uses and opened up its AI models for US national security applications, TechCrunchreported. \"We are pleased to confirm that we’re making Llama available to US government agencies, including those that are working on defense and national security applications, and private sector partners supporting their work,\" a Metablogsaid. \"We’re partnering with companies including Accenture, Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Booz Allen, Databricks, Deloitte, IBM, Leidos, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Oracle, Palantir, Scale AI, and Snowflake to bring Llama to government agencies.\" Because Meta's models are open-source, they \"can easily be used by the government to support Musk’s goals without the company’s explicit consent,\" Wired suggested. It's hard to track where Meta's models may have been deployed in government so far, and it's unclear why DOGE relied on Llama 2 when Meta has made advancements withLlama 3and4. Not much is known about DOGE's use of Llama 2. Wired's review of records showed that DOGE deployed the model locally, \"meaning it’s unlikely to have sent data over the Internet,\" which was a privacy concern that many government workers expressed. In an Aprillettersent to Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, more than 40 lawmakers demanded a probe into DOGE's AI use, which, they warned—alongside \"serious security risks\"—could \"have the potential to undermine successful and appropriate AI adoption.\" That letter called out a DOGE staffer and former SpaceX employee who supposedly used Musk’s xAI Grok-2 model to create an \"AI assistant,\" as well as the use of a chatbot named \"GSAi\"—\"based on Anthropic and Meta models\"—to analyze contract and procurement data. DOGE has also been linked to a software calledAutoRIF that supercharges mass firingsacross the government. In particular, the letter emphasized the \"major concerns about security\" swirling DOGE's use of \"AI systems to analyze emails from a large portion of the two million person federal workforce describing their previous week’s accomplishments,\" which they said lacked transparency. Those emails came weeks after the \"Fork in the Road\" emails, Wired noted, asking workers to outline weekly accomplishments in five bullet points. Workers fretted over responses, worried that DOGE might be asking for sensitive information without security clearances, Wired reported. Wired could not confirm if Llama 2 was also used to parse these email responses, but federal workers told Wired that if DOGE was \"smart,\" then they'd likely \"reuse their code\" from the \"Fork in the Road\" email experiment. It seems that Grok, Musk's AI model, wasn't available for DOGE's task because it was only available as a proprietary model in January. Moving forward, DOGE may rely more frequently on Grok, Wired reported, as Microsoft announced it would start hosting xAI’s Grok 3 models in its Azure AI Foundry this week, The Vergereported, which opens the models up for more uses. In their letter, lawmakers urged Vought to investigate Musk's conflicts of interest, while warning of potential data breaches and declaring that AI, as DOGE had used it, was not ready for government. \"Without proper protections, feeding sensitive data into an AI system puts it into the possession of a system’s operator—a massive breach of public and employee trust and an increase in cybersecurity risks surrounding that data,\" lawmakers argued. \"Generative AI models also frequently make errors and show significant biases—the technology simply is not ready for use in high-risk decision-making without proper vetting, transparency, oversight, and guardrails in place.\" Although Wired's report seems to confirm that DOGE did not send sensitive data from the \"Fork in the Road\" emails to an external source, lawmakers want much more vetting of AI systems to deter \"the risk of sharing personally identifiable or otherwise sensitive information with the AI model deployers.\" A seeming fear is that Musk may start using his own models more, benefiting from government data his competitors cannot access, while potentially putting that data at risk of a breach. They're hoping that DOGE will be forced to unplug all its AI systems, but Vought seems more aligned with DOGE, writing in hisAI guidance for federal usethat \"agencies must remove barriers to innovation and provide the best value for the taxpayer.\" \"While we support the federal government integrating new, approved AI technologies that can improve efficiency or efficacy, we cannot sacrifice security, privacy, and appropriate use standards when interacting with federal data,\" their letter said. \"We also cannot condone use of AI systems, often known for hallucinations and bias, in decisions regarding termination of federal employment or federal funding without sufficient transparency and oversight of those models—the risk of losing talent and critical research because of flawed technology or flawed uses of such technology is simply too high.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Gouach wants you to insert and pluck the cells from its Infinite e-bike battery",
    "article_text": "Tiny French firm wants to keep a few bad cells from spoiling a lot of e-bikes. E-bike batteries are, for the most part, a collection of18650 batteries,packaged together and welded in series and parallel, attached to a battery management system (BMS). A \"dead\" e-bike battery may only have two or three truly dead cells inside, while the remainder work fine. This is useful knowledge that, for the most part, very few e-bike owners can really use. Arc welders are not a common tool to own, and most e-bike batteries are not designed to be opened, safely or otherwise. French firm Gouach, essentially a three-person company, is pitching itsInfinite Batteryas the opposite of this status quo. It's adurable, fireproof casinginto which you can place and replace 18650 batteriesusing only a screwdriver. It keeps you updated on the status of cell performance and heat through a Bluetooth-connected app. And it's designed forcompatibilitywith \"90% of existing e-bike brands,\" or you can upgrade an existing \"acoustic\" model. Credit:\n\n          \n          Gouach Alexandre Vallette, CEO of Gouach, told Ars that developing a system for no-weld battery wiring involved \"a lot of trial and error\" over four years. A typical \"spring\" contact for an 18650—the kind used by most devices that take AA or AAA batteries—doesn't work, because bike rides can knock them loose with vibration. What emerged were custom-printed circuit boards (PCBs), with just-flexible-enough contacts cut into the board to carry the current from each battery to the BMS, allowing for thermal monitoring across numerous points on the package. The Infinite Battery's case, too, was born of hard-won experimentation. Gouach provided early versions of its refillable batteries early on for a European bike-share company, using an off-the-shelf \"shark\"-style casing. Like anyone who lives in a city with dockless bike-sharing, they discovered the variety of places and angles at which people will leave a shared bike. Water ingress killed a number of bike batteries. \"It was really a setback for the company [Gouach] at the time,\" Vallette said. \"But we knew that the technology itself was good, so we designed our own casing.\" Gouach's casing is now rated IP67, Vallette said, and meetsUL 2271 standards. There are three avenues for selling the Infinite Battery, as Vallette sees it. One is working with e-bike makers to incorporate Gouach's tech. Another is targeting e-bike owners and small bike shops who, this far into e-bikes' history, might be dealing with dead batteries. And then there are folks looking to build their own e-bikes. The Infinite Battery will be made available in 36 V and 48 V builds, and Gouach's app promises to help owners connect it to a wide variety of bikes. Actually fitting the battery case onto your bike is a different matter. Some bikes can accommodate the Gouach kit where their current battery sits, while others may end up mounting to a rack, or through creative, but hopefully secure, frame attachments. One of the biggest compatibility challenges, Vallette said, was finding a way to work with Bosch's mid-drive motors. The communications between a Bosch motor and battery are encrypted; after \"a serious effort,\" Gouach's app and battery should work with them, Vallette said. Gouach, having raised more than $220,000 on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo from about 500 backers, and$3.5 million in venture funding, is getting close to offering the batteries through its own storefront. Gouach'sroadmapputs them in mass production at the moment, with assorted bugs, certifications, and other matters to clear. EU-based backers should get their kits in June, with the US, and an open online store, to follow, barring whatever happens next in international trade. Vallette said in mid-May that the US's momentary 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports disrupted their plans, but work was underway. If nothing else, Gouach's DIY kit shows that a different way of thinking about e-bike batteries—as assemblages, not huge all-in-one consumables—is possible.

    "article_text": "Payloads were set to spontaneously detonate on specific dates with no warning. Researchers have found malicious software that received more than 6,000 downloads from the NPM repository over a two-year span, in yet another discovery showing the hidden threats users of such open source archives face. Eight packages using names that closely mimicked those of widely used legitimate packages contained destructive payloads designed to corrupt or delete important data and crash systems, Kush Pandya, a researcher at security firm Socket,reported Thursday. The packages have been available for download for more than two years and accrued roughly 6,200 downloads over that time. “What makes this campaign particularly concerning is the diversity of attack vectors—from subtle data corruption to aggressive system shutdowns and file deletion,” Pandya wrote. “The packages were designed to target different parts of the JavaScript ecosystem with varied tactics.” Those tactics included: Some of the payloads were limited to detonate only on specific dates in 2023, but in some cases a phase that was scheduled to begin in July of that year was given no termination date. Pandya said that means the threat remains persistent, although in an email he also wrote: “Since all activation dates have passed (June 2023–August 2024), any developer following normal package usage today would immediately trigger destructive payloads including system shutdowns, file deletion, and JavaScript prototype corruption.” Interestingly, the NPM user who submitted the malicious packages, using the registration email address 1634389031@qq[.]com, also uploaded working packages with no malicious functions found in them. The approach of submitting both harmful and useful packages helped create a “facade of legitimacy” that increased the chances the malicious packages would go unnoticed, Pandya said. Questions emailed to that address received no response. The malicious packages targeted users of some of the largest ecosystems for JavaScript developers, including React, Vue, and Vite. The specific packages were: Anyone who installed any of these packages should carefully inspect their systems to make sure they’re no longer running. These packages perfectly mimic legitimate development tools, so it may be easy for them to have remained undetected.

Both Pocket and another browser add-on, Fakespot, are being shut down by Firefox maker Mozilla in early July. Ina post about the closures, Mozilla cites the need to \"invest our time and resources so we can make the biggest impact.\" Pocket's saving and curation powers will be implemented into Firefox, while Fakespot's analysis of online shopping reviews \"didn't fit a model we could sustain.\" Pocket started in 2007 as Read It Later, a way to bookmark web articles for later reading.

Those who do want that nice-sounding media experience can cobble it together in most modern browsers, which have built-in tools for managing bookmarks, distinct \"reading lists,\" and even creating stripped-down \"readable\" versions of articles. Pocket did more than this and leaned into longform journalism and literary writing. The site's \"Best of 2020\"won a Webby award, and it regularly curated collections on a range of topics.

    "title": "FAA: Airplanes should stay far away from SpaceX’s next Starship launch",
    "article_text": "\"The FAA is expanding the size of hazard areas both in the US and other countries.\" The Federal Aviation Administration gave the green light Thursday for SpaceX to launch the next test flight of its Starship mega-rocket as soon as next week, following two consecutive failures earlier this year. The failures set back SpaceX's Starship program by several months. The company aims to get the rocket's development back on track with the upcoming launch, Starship's ninth full-scale test flight since its debut in April 2023. Starship is central to SpaceX's long-held ambition to send humans to Mars and is the vehicle NASA has selected to land astronauts on the Moon under the umbrella of the government's Artemis program. In a statement Thursday, the FAA said SpaceX is authorized to launch the next Starship test flight, known as Flight 9, after finding the company \"meets all of the rigorous safety, environmental and other licensing requirements.\" SpaceX has not confirmed a target launch date for the next launch of Starship, but warning notices for pilots and mariners to steer clear of hazard areas in the Gulf of Mexico suggest the flight might happen as soon as the evening of Tuesday, May 27. The rocket will lift off from Starbase, Texas, SpaceX's privately owned spaceport near the US-Mexico border. This will be the third flight of SpaceX's upgraded Block 2, or Version 2, Starship rocket. The first two flights of Starship Block 2—inJanuaryandMarch—did not go well. On both occasions, the rocket's upper stage shut down its engines prematurely and the vehicle lost control, breaking apart in the upper atmosphere and spreading debris near the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Investigators determined the cause of the January failure was a series of fuel leaks and fires in the ship's aft compartment. The leaks were most likely triggered by vibrations that were more intense than anticipated, SpaceX said before Starship's most recent flight in March. SpaceX has not announced the cause of the March failure, although the circumstances were similar to the mishap in January. \"The FAA conducted a comprehensive safety review of the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 mishap and determined that the company has satisfactorily addressed the causes of the mishap, and therefore, the Starship vehicle can return to flight,\" the agency said. \"The FAA will verify SpaceX implements all corrective actions.\" The flight profile for the next Starship launch will largely be a repeat of what SpaceX hoped to accomplish on the ill-fated tests earlier this year. If all goes according to plan, the rocket's upper stage, or ship, will travel halfway around the world from Starbase, reaching an altitude of more than 100 miles before reentering the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean. A little more than an hour after liftoff, the ship will aim for a controlled splashdown in the ocean northwest of Australia. Apart from overcoming the problems that afflicted the last two launches, one of the most important objectives for this flight is to test the performance of Starship's heat shield. Starship Block 2 includes improved heat shield materials that could do better at protecting the ship from the superheated temperatures of reentry and, ultimately, make it easier to reuse the vehicle. The problems on the last two Starship test flights prevented the rocket from reaching the point where its heat shield could be tested. Starship Block 2 also features redesigned flaps to better control the vehicle during its descent through the atmosphere. This version of Starship also has larger propellant tanks and reconfigured fuel feed lines for the ship's six Raptor engines. The FAA's approval for Starship Flight 9 comes with some stipulations. The agency is expanding the size of hazard areas in the United States and in other countries based on an updated \"flight safety analysis\" from SpaceX and because SpaceX will reuse a previously flown first-stage booster—called Super Heavy—for the first time. This flight-safety analysis takes into account the outcomes of previous flights, including accidents, population exposure risk, the probability of vehicle failure, and debris propagation and behavior, among other considerations. \"The FAA uses this and other data to determine and implement measures to mitigate public risk,\" the agency said. All of this culminated in the FAA's \"return to flight determination,\" which the agency says is based on public safety. The FAA's primary concern with commercial space activity is ensuring rocket launches don't endanger third parties. The agency also requires that SpaceX maintain at least $500 million in liability insurance to cover claims resulting from the launch and flight of Starship Flight 9, the same requirement the FAA levied for previous Starship test flights. For the next launch, the FAA will establish an aircraft hazard area covering approximately 1,600 nautical miles extending eastward from Starbase, Texas, and through the Straits of Florida, including the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. This is an extension of the 885-nautical-mile hazard area the FAA established for the test flight in March. In order to minimize disruption to commercial and private air traffic, the FAA is requiring the launch window for Starship Flight 9 to be scheduled during \"non-peak transit periods.\" The size of FAA-mandated airspace closures can expand or shrink based on the reliability of the launch vehicle. The failures of Starship earlier this year raised the probability of vehicle failure in the flight-safety analysis for Starship Flight 9,according to the FAA. The expanded hazard area will force the closure of more than 70 established air routes across the Gulf of Mexico and now includes the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The FAA anticipates this will affect more than 175 flights, almost all of them on international connecting routes. For airline passengers traveling through this region, this will mean an average flight delay of approximately 40 minutes, and potentially up to two hours, the FAA said. If SpaceX can reel off a series of successful Starship flights, the hazard areas will likely shrink in size. This will be important as SpaceX ramps up the Starship launch cadence. The FAA recently approved SpaceX to increase its Starship flight ratefrom five per year to 25 per year. The agency said it is in \"close contact and collaboration\" with other nations with territory along or near Starship's flight path, including the United Kingdom, Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, Mexico, and Cuba. Meanwhile, SpaceX's hardware for Starship Flight 9 appears to be moving closer to launch. Engineers test-fired the Super Heavy booster, which SpaceX previously launched and recovered in January, last month on the launch pad in South Texas. On May 12, SpaceXfired the ship's six Raptor enginesfor 60 seconds on a test stand near Starbase. After the test-firing, ground crews rolled the ship back to the Starship production site a few miles away, only to return the vehicle to the test stand Wednesday for unspecified testing. SpaceX is expected to roll the ship back to the production site again before the end of the week. The final steps before launch will involve separately transporting the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage from the production site to the launch pad. There, SpaceX will stack the ship on top of the booster. Once the two pieces are stacked together, the rocket will stand 404 feet (123.1 meters) tall. If SpaceX moves forward with a launch attempt next Tuesday evening, the long-range outlook from the National Weather Service calls for a 30 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms.

    "title": "New data confirms: There really is a planet squeezed in between two stars",
    "article_text": "The planet may have formed from material transferred between the stars. While our Sun prefers to go solo, many other stars are parts of binary systems, with a pair of stars gravitationally bound to each other. In some cases, the stars are far enough apart that planets can form around each of them. But there are also plenty of tight binary systems, where the stars orbit each other at a radius that would place them both comfortably inside our Solar System. In these systems, exoplanets tend to be found at greater distances, in orbits that have themcircling both stars. On Wednesday, scientists described a system that seems to be neither of the above. It is a tight binary system, with a heavy central star that's orbited by a white dwarf at a distance two to three times larger than Earth's orbit. The lone planet confirmed to be in the system is squeezed in between the two, orbiting at a distance similar to Earth's distance from the Sun. And, as an added bonus, the planet is orbiting backward relative to the white dwarf. The exosolar system is termed ν Octantis (or Nu Octantis), and its primary star is just a bit heavier than our Sun (1.6 solar masses). It's orbited by a far dimmer companion that's roughly half of our Sun's mass, but which hasn't been characterized in detail until now. The companion's orbit relative to the central star is a bit lopsided, ranging from about two astronomical units (AU, the typical Earth-Sun distance) at its closest approach to roughly three AU at its farthest. And, until yesterday, the exact nature of the companion star was not clear. The latter question was relatively easy to answer. Detailed imaging of the system in the near infrared should be able to resolve the two stars but was unable to pick up a second object with sufficient brightness. That eliminates any main sequence stars, leaving a white dwarf as the only likely answer. But that's not the only thing that's orbiting the central star of ν Octantis. Earlier studies of the system had suggested that there was also an exoplanet present in the system. But the properties of its orbit made little sense, in that nobody could seem to figure out a stable orbit that would be consistent with the observations. The only thing that was clear was that the most stable orbits appeared to require that the planet have a retrograde motion, meaning orbiting in the opposite direction to the companion star. ν Octantis definitely fell into the vast category of \"more data is needed\" questions. And more data is exactly what a small international team of scientists got, with nearly two years of additional observations using the HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher) instrument in Chile. The data clearly confirmed the existence of a planet in a retrograde orbit and suggested that the plane of its orbit was 17 degrees off from the plane formed by the orbits of the two stars. Unfortunately, modeling variations on this orbit through time indicated that 98 percent of them were unstable within 50 million years. So, the researchers tested a range of orbital properties that would keep everything in a single plane. This provided a solution where modeling variations on it led to 75 percent of the orbits being stable out past 50 million years. So, the researchers settle on this as the most likely description of the system. These orbits do have the planet in ν Octantis in a retrograde orbit, meaning it's moving in the opposite direction from the smaller star in the system. The orbit is roughly one AU, meaning its typical distance to the central star is similar to that of the Earth's distance to the Sun. But the orbit is somewhat squished, with one half of the orbit being significantly closer to the central star than the other. And, critically, the entire orbit is within the orbit of the smaller companion star. The gravitational forces of a tight binary should prevent any planets from forming within this space early in the system's history. So, how did the planet end up in such an unusual configuration? The fact that one of the stars present in ν Octantis is a white dwarf suggests some possible explanations. White dwarfs are formed by Sun-like stars that have advanced through a late helium-burning period that causes them to swell considerably, leaving the outer surface of the star weakly bound to the rest of its mass. At the distances within ν Octantis, that would allow considerable material to be drawn off the outer companion and pulled onto the surface of what's now the central star. The net result is a considerable mass transfer. This could have done one of two things to place a planet in the interior of the system. One is that the transferred material isn't likely to make an immediate dive onto the surface of the nearby star. If the process is slow enough, it could have produced a planet-forming disk for a brief period—long enough to produce a planet on the interior of the system. Alternatively, if there were planets orbiting exterior to both stars, the change in the mass distribution of the system could have potentially destabilized their orbits. That might be enough to cause interactions among the planets to send one of them spiraling inward, where it was eventually captured in the stable retrograde orbit we now find it. Either case, the authors emphasize, should be pretty rare, meaning we're unlikely to have imaged many other systems like this at this stage of our study of exoplanets. They do point to another tight binary, HD 59686, that appears to have a planet in a retrograde orbit. But, as with ν Octantis, the data isn't clear enough to rule out alternative configurations yet. So, once again, more data is needed. Nature, 2025. DOI:10.1038/s41586-025-09006-x(About DOIs). Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "AT&T has $6 billion deal to buy CenturyLink fiber broadband business",
    "article_text": "Lumen uninterested in residential broadband but hasn't offloaded DSL network. AT&T has struck a deal to buy CenturyLink's consumer fiber broadband division for $5.75 billion, giving the Internet provider another 1.1 million fiber customers in 11 states. The all-cash deal is expected to close during the first half of 2026 assuming the companies obtain regulatory approval. AT&T will gain new customers in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. The deal will give AT&T room to grow its user base by more than the 1.1 million existing CenturyLink customers, as AT&T said the network areas being sold include over 4 million fiber-enabled locations. \"The transaction will enable AT&T to significantly expand access to AT&T Fiber in major metro areas like Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City and Seattle, as well as additional geographies,\" AT&Tsaid. The company, previously called CenturyLink, is officially named Lumen now but still uses theCenturyLink brand namefor home Internet service. AT&T, which has9.6 millionfiber customers and 14.1 million broadband customers overall, said the infrastructure it is purchasing will help it expand fiber construction to new locations as well. \"AT&T will gain access to Lumen's substantial fiber construction capabilities within its incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) footprint and plans to accelerate the pace at which fiber is being built in these territories,\" AT&T said. \"AT&T now expects to reach approximately 60 million total fiber locations by the end of 2030—roughly doubling where AT&T Fiber is available today.\" The deal is also notable for what it doesn't include: Lumen's enterprise fiber customers and the old copper DSL lines that were never upgraded to fiber. CenturyLink's DSL customers have suffered from bad customer service andmulti-month outages, as we've detailed in numerousarticlesover the pastfew years. The deal seems unlikely to improve matters for CenturyLink copper users. Lumen has seemed uninterested in maintaining the copper network, and long outages often aren't fixed until a customer asks Ars Technica for help. Users are stuck with slow Internet service that frequently doesn't work. Lumen will retain the CenturyLink consumer copper broadband and voice services, but selling the consumer fiber business makes it clear that the telco isn't focused on residential customers. Lumensaidthat offloading consumer fiber lines will help sharpen its focus on selling services to large businesses. The company is maintaining its business fiber lines. \"By selling Lumen's mass markets fiber-to-the-home business to AT&T, including 95 percent of Quantum Fiber, we unlock significant value,\" Lumen said. \"The $5.75 billion transaction gives Lumen the financial flexibility to reduce debt, strengthen the balance sheet and accelerate investments in our enterprise services like direct fiber access, cloud on-ramps and multi-cloud gateways to scale faster and lead in the AI-powered economy.\" There are stillnearly 1.4 millionCenturyLink copper Internet customers. They can likely expect service to continue degrading under Lumen's ownership. While AT&T probably expressed little interest in buying the copper lines, Lumen could try to sell them to another company. AT&T said it will put the acquired fiber assets into a new subsidiary and will sell partial ownership of that subsidiary \"to an equity partner that will co-invest in the ongoing business.\" The subsidiary \"will be deconsolidated from AT&T's financial statements and operate as a wholesale commercial open access platform, providing fiber access services to AT&T as the anchor tenant,\" AT&T said. \"All acquired Lumen Mass Markets fiber customers will remain AT&T customers.\" AT&T will also obtain services and support from Lumen for a time after the transaction. \"These agreements are expected to last approximately two years after deal close and will cover certain field operations, network deployment, IT systems, billing, customer support, and other services,\" AT&T said. \"As part of the transaction, AT&T will also receive long-term access to certain Lumen central offices, poles, and conduits.\" AT&T's purchase of CenturyLink fiber lines is the latest in a string of transactions announced or approved since President Trump's inauguration. Cable companies Charter and Cox are planning a $34.5 billion merger, and the Federal Communications Commission recentlyapprovedVerizon's purchase of Frontier and a T-Mobile joint venture toacquire fiber provider Lumos. In the Verizon and T-Mobile deals, the FCC only approved the transaction after each company agreed to end DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies criticized by FCC Chairman Brendan Carr.

    "title": "Did Google lie about building a deadly chatbot? Judge finds it plausible.",
    "article_text": "Grieving mom fights to prove Google secretly profited from controversial chatbot. Ever since a mourning mother, Megan Garcia, filed a lawsuit alleging thatCharacter.AI's dangerous chatbots caused her son's suicide, Google has maintained that—so it could dodge claims that it had contributed to the platform's design and was unjustly enriched—it had nothing to do with C.AI's development. But Google lost its motion to dismiss the lawsuit on Wednesday after a US district judge, Anne Conway,foundthat Garcia had plausibly alleged that Google played a part in C.AI's design by providing a component part and \"substantially\" participating \"in integrating its models\" into C.AI. Garcia also plausibly alleged that Google aided and abetted C.AI in harming her son, 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III. Google similarly failed to toss claims of unjust enrichment, as Conway suggested that Garcia plausibly alleged that Google benefited from access to Setzer's user data. The only win for Google was a dropped claim that C.AI makers were guilty of intentional infliction of emotional distress, with Conway agreeing that Garcia didn't meet the requirements, as she wasn't \"present to witness the outrageous conduct directed at her child.\" With most of her claims intact, Garcia will now be allowed to move forward with discovery and get a chance to prove her claims, despite Google's determined efforts to be dropped from the suit. Her lawyer, Meetali Jain, said the ruling \"sets a new precedent for legal accountability across the AI and tech ecosystem\" and \"recognizes a grieving mother’s right to access the courts to hold powerful tech companies—and their developers—accountable for marketing a defective product that led to her child’s death.\" In a statement provided to Ars, Google spokesperson José Castañeda upheld Google's stance that C.AI is not connected to Google. \"We strongly disagree with this decision,\" Castañeda said. \"Google and Character.AI are entirely separate, and Google did not create, design, or manage Character AI’s app or any component part of it.\" A C.AI spokesperson declined Ars' request to comment on Google's alleged role. According to Garcia'scomplaint, Google was involved with C.AI from the very beginning. The creators of C.AI—Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas—allegedly started working on the chatbot platform while still employed at Google and \"may even have utilized Google’s resources,\" the complaint said. However, their technology was deemed too \"dangerous\" to integrate with Google's AI models, Google's internal research documents reportedly showed, because it \"didn’t meet the company’s AI principles around safety and fairness.\" Conway noted that Google employees were worried that users might \"ascribe too much meaning\" to the outputs by large language models, \"because 'humans are prepared to interpret strings belonging to languages they speak as meaningful and corresponding to the communicative intent of some individual or group of individuals who have accountability for what is said.'\" In Setzer's case, the boy believed the chatbots were real, and Conway found it was plausible that it was partly because Google's \"LLM’s integration into the Character.AI app caused the app to be defective and caused Sewell’s death\" by allegedly steering Sewell to ascribe \"too much meaning to the text [output by Character.AI,]... even though Character.AI Characters do not 'have accountability for what is said.'\" As Garcia's lawyers tell it, rather than take on a safety risk \"under its own name,\" Google \"encouraged\" the engineers to keep going. This supposedly prompted De Freitas and Shazeer's exits in 2021—with Shazeer saying in an interview that Google wouldn't let him \"do anything fun\" when all he wanted to do was \"maximally accelerate\" the AI technology. Soon after, they launched Character Technologies to develop and distribute C.AI. They \"understood that to bypass Google policies and standards, Shazeer and De Freitas would need to leave Google to develop their AI product,\" the complaint said. But that allegedly didn't stop Google from contributing \"financial resources, personnel, intellectual property, and AI technology to the design and development of C.AI such that Google may be deemed a co-creator of the unreasonably dangerous and dangerously defective product,\" the complaint alleged. Further, by 2023, Google had entered into a public partnership with Google Cloud, securing access to the technical infrastructure needed to build C.AI. This allegedly drove revenue growth for Google while giving it \"a competitive edge over Microsoft,\" Garcia alleged. The entire time, Conway suggested it was plausibly alleged that Google \"aided and abetted\" C.AI by not only ignoring \"red flags,\" but also by plausibly possessing \"actual knowledge that Character Technologies was distributing a defective product to the public.\" Once C.AI finished developing its models, Google then struck a $2.7 billion deal to license C.AI's models, the complaint noted. That agreement included rehiring Shazeer and De Freitas, which The Informationreportedessentially stopped all of C.AI's model development. To Garcia and her legal team, it looked like Google planned to use C.AI technology to create its own companion chatbots, while seemingly benefiting from all the user data (including minor data) that C.AI collected when it wasn't under Google's umbrella. That's a problem, Garcia alleged, because C.AI marketed its products as safe for under 13 until just before the Google deal came into play. Garcia is concerned that this was Google's plan all along, to train models on data from her son—and other minors—that Google otherwise couldn't safely collect. And now she has claimed that tech will be integrated into Gemini, the personal AI assistant that was allegedly launched from Shazeer and De Freitas' prior work at Google. She thinks that work never stopped, alleging that C.AI \"never succeeded in distinguishing themselves from Google in a meaningful way.\" Both engineers also appear to have gotten big paychecks from the Google deal, Garcia alleged, claiming that it's estimated that \"Google paid Shazeer something in the range of $750 million to $1 billion dollars for his share of C.AI.\" Allegedly, that was their goal, to get paid more to do Google's dirty work, and Jain thinks it's notable that both engineers were upheld individually as defendants. \"Shazeer and De Freitas knew Character.AI was never going to be profitable developing their own LLMs, especially with their only income being a small subscription fee,\" Garcia alleged, noting that there's still an \"open\" question of why Google valued the company so highly when C.AI would've have to charge users more than $200 a month to break even. \"However, it allowed them to pursue their personal goals of developing generative artificial intelligence, and to increase their potential value to Big Tech acquirers.\" For Google, escaping the lawsuit might depend on surfacing evidence that C.AI's models substantially differ from Google's technology powering Gemini and disproving the unjust enrichment claim by showing it received no benefit from accessing all of C.AI's user data. Google and Character Technologies also moved to dismiss the lawsuit based on First Amendment claims, arguing thatC.AI users have a right to listen to chatbot outputsas supposed \"speech.\" Conway agreed that Character Technologies can assert the First Amendment rights of its users in this case, but \"the Court is not prepared to hold that the Character.AI LLM’s output is speech at this stage.\" C.AI had tried to argue that chatbot outputs should be protected like speech from video game characters, but Conway said that argument was not meaningfully advanced. Garcia's team had pushed back, noting that video game characters' dialogue is written by humans, while chatbot outputs are simply the result of an LLM predicting what word should come next. \"Defendants fail to articulate why words strung together by an LLM are speech,\" Conway wrote. As the case advances, Character Technologies will have a chance to beef up the First Amendment claims, perhaps by better explaining how chatbot outputs are similar to other cases involving non-human speakers. C.AI's spokesperson provided a statement to Ars, suggesting that Conway seems confused. \"It’s long been true that the law takes time to adapt to new technology, and AI is no different,\" C.AI's spokesperson said. \"In today’s order, the court made clear that it was not ready to rule on all of Character.AI’s arguments at this stage and we look forward to continuing to defend the merits of the case.\" C.AI also noted that it now provides a \"separate version\" of its LLM \"for under-18 users,\" along with \"parental insights, filtered Characters, time spent notification, updated prominent disclaimers, and more.\" \"Additionally, we have a number of technical protections aimed at detecting and preventing conversations about self-harm on the platform; in certain cases, that includes surfacing a specific pop-up directing users to the National Suicide and Crisis,\" C.AI's spokesperson said. If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in distress, please call the Suicide Prevention Lifeline number, 1-800-273-TALK (8255), which will put you in touch with a local crisis center.

    "title": "“How you design the beep is important.” Behind the movement for calmer gadgets.",
    "article_text": "Warm lights, tactile buttons, intuitive usage. Do you miss the feel of tactile buttons on your kitchen appliances or lament car manufacturers' insistence on touchscreens? Have you ever found yourself clumsily fumbling with the door handles of a vehicle or distracted by the bright blue light beaming from your vacuum or Wi-Fi router? If so, you're not alone. The way technology gadgets are designed largely relies on things like blue, often LED,lights, flat resistive or capacitive touch input, and software. Some, like Amber Case, founder of theCalm Tech Institute, believe that these design choices distract from devices' purpose and functionality and are calling for a new approach to product design. \"Calm Tech Institute is kind of a consumer advocacy body that's collecting stories and research from neuroscientists that says, look at how the mind wants texture, and look at how it wants physical buttons, and there's a part of your mind that needs [those],\" Case told Ars Technica. \"When we don't have it and we replace it with glass, we're not only losing something about human experience, but we're actually causing the mind stress.” The Calm Tech Institute, founded in May 2024, provides workshops, speaking engagements, and certification for products that \"enhance human life without causing stress or distraction,\"its websitesays. Speaking to Ars, Case pointed to user frustrations, such as software updates hindering car usage and \"Why is there no button on the back of the television when I go into the hotel room late at night, and I have to turn on my flashlight on my iPhone to find the button to turn it off?\" These experiences are the antithesis of the Calm Tech philosophy, Case explained: Once we learn [how to ride a bike], we never have to learn it again. Whereas, with how a lot of software ... and physical objects are made now, you have to relearn it. It gets changed or the buttons aren't in the right place, and you can feel your mind wanting the button to be in a certain place. And it's not. The Calm Tech Institute takes inspiration from papers that Mark D. Weiser wrote while CTO at Xerox Palo Alto Research Company (PARC), an R&D firm now known as SRI International’s PARC. Weiser is often remembered as the father ofubiquitous computing, which starkly differs from technology approaches that submerge people in technology, like the metaverse. By contrast, ubiquitous computing products blend more discreetly into user environments. Per a quote from Weiser onCalm Tech Institute's website: \"Ubiquitous computing is roughly the opposite of virtual reality. Where virtual reality puts people inside a computer-generated world, ubiquitous computing forces the computer to live out here in the world with people.\" That mentality helped Case settle on the Calm Tech Institute's principles for product design: Further explaining the reasoning behind the principles, Case said: When we say we're going to do something based on look and not touch, we forget the beauty of a lot of really well-designed tools, which is the tool dissolves when you use it and you focus on the task and not the tool. With a really well-designed hammer, you focus on the nail, not the hammer. Coming up with those principles requireda lotof interviews. “I think I've sat with hundreds of people in cars, from self-driving cars to just riding around with friends, and saying, what in this car is annoying? What in this car is good? What in this technology is good or bad? I've gone to all sorts of giant tech companies all over the world, and they've had me test out their products,\" Case said. One of Calm Tech Institute's primary functions is certifying gadgets as calm tech. Currently, six products are Calm Tech-certified:ReMarkable's Paper Protablet;Airthings' View Plusair quality monitor; a visual timer calledTime Timer;theDaylight Computer, an e-paper computer; the Mui Board Gen 2, a wooden smart home controller currently available for preorder viaKickstarter;andUnpluq, which locks specified phone apps until you open them with an NFC keychain. \"In a market flooded with distraction, we wanted Unpluq to stand out as a product that actually reduces it, and this certification gave us a trusted way to signal that,\" Caroline Cadwell, who was CEO of Unpluq when it got Calm Tech-certified and now serves as an advisor, told Ars. In order for a gadget to be Calm Tech-certified, it's scored against an 81-point criteria across six categories as shown below: Credit:Calm Tech Institute One of the hardest categories for companies to adhere to, Case said, is periphery, which may rely on a product including physical buttons, which also touches on the materials category. With headphones, for example, users shouldn't have to look at the product or memorize where the buttons are to control it. \"Just put a series of raised dots: a raised dot for the down volume, two dots for the up volume, and then an obvious power button. … With the flattening of everything, we've forgotten this,\" she said. The other top challenge for companies is light, which includes examining the lights'color-rendering indexand prioritizing low flickering and warm colors. \"Blue light's a really, really energetic spectrum, and so it keeps us up at night,” Case said, pointing to the benefits of alternatives, like E-ink. Overall, the criteria forces companies to think about product design in a way that has become less common among modern gadgets and deeply considers products' impact on the human senses. “How you design the beep is important,\" Case said. Offering a new and voluntary type of certification program, the Calm Tech Institute is challenged to drum up interest in its program and financial security. As some tech companies already have to pay associated costs for more essential certifications, such as UL and Bluetooth certification, Calm Tech doesn't directly charge for certifications. Instead, companies can pay Calm Tech for a review to see if their product is likely to get certified. A company could also pay for a pre-certification, where Calm Tech looks at a product before it's launched and helps with ideation so that the product ends up certifiable. Calm Tech is currently reviewing eight products for certification and has three products in the pre-certification phase. Calm Tech Institute has also certified products that the team has worked with and tested without the product's vendors submitting for certification. “It's better if we award the companies that are doing an excellent job, and then in the future, if there are companies that need a little bit of help, then we can work with them. But that's more of a consulting, higher overhead thing, and then that's going to cost more money,\" Case explained. Case believes Calm Tech Institute's business model will be sustainable, noting her disinterest in Calm Tech going public and goals of running the firm without being forced to scale or monetize \"in a way that would make us less [of a] service to customers.\" In fact, she has already reckoned with the idea of Calm Tech Institute no longer being needed one day. \"[Maybe] product examples very slowly get to a point in which maybe we're not needed anymore. ... Or maybe we're just the place you go to get the good design. But I hope we dissolve into the background as something useful that people use to get their product out,” she said. Meanwhile, there's optimism that the certification will eventually help drive product sales. Unpluq's Cadwell said: We've incorporated the Calm Tech certification into our product listings and marketing materials and plan to feature it on our physical packaging moving forward. Since we were part of the very first batch of certified products, I view this as a strategic bet more than an instant sales driver, but I expect that will change for companies getting certified in the future.

    "title": "Gazelle Medeo T9 City e-bike review: A steady Dutch ride in lots of sizes",
    "article_text": "It's not a speed demon or hill melter, but Gazelle's entry e-bike rides easy. I initially felt bad for theMedeo T9 Citye-bike that Gazelle sent me for review. Not through any fault of its own but because I had just recently riddenGazelle's Eclipse C380+, an all-inclusive beast that retailed for roughly 2.5 times the price of the Medeo T9 City. Would the lower-priced bike, with different versions of some of the same hardware, suffer compared to its beefier brethren? Short answer: not really. The Medeo T9 City isn't trying to dominate the road; it just wants to get you where you're going. It has the same kind of automatic electric assist level shifting, just packed into a smaller handlebar display instead of a center console. It has chain and gear cogs instead of the Eclipse's belt drive and stepless shifting, an external battery instead of an inline, and a 250-watt Bosch Active Line motor instead of a 350-watt Performance Line Speed. I think the Medeo T9 City likely makes for a good first or second e-bike, or perhaps a nice upgrade if you're prioritizing comfort and transport. Given its hill-smoothing motor, wide range of sizes, stable ride feel, and the backing of known bike brands, you could do much worse than a Gazelle with a Bosch motor. The Medeo T9 City is Gazelle's lowest-priced model, and it's one of the more affordable entry points into the Bosch mid-drive motor. That's not to say it is low-cost, though. Even though it's $300 more now than when I rode it—Gazelle says tariffs played a part, but price changes were \"already under consideration due to evolving economic conditions\"—it packs in a lot of features you wouldn't otherwise get at this bike's $2,600 price. For starters, the bike is almost fully kitted out, with custom fenders and chainguard, a substantial rack, lights, an AXA \"cafe\" rear wheel lock, and even a bell that actually makes some noise. The two colors, \"Thyme Green\" and \"Caramel Khaki,\" are smart and non-gendered and fit the broad utility of the bike. It's available in four different sizes (40, 45, 50, and 55 inches), intended to cover riders from 4 feet, 9 inches to 6 feet, 4 inches. At 6-foot-2, I was generally comfortable on the largest model, though my arms wanted just a bit more space. The Medeo T9 City's frame-mounted battery, while perhaps less slick-looking than a built-in, makes removing for charging, building compliance, or theft deterrence possible. There are no bottle mounting points on this model, like most step-through e-bikes, which is just about the only thing missing. It's a stable ride, and its step-through frame is cut a bit lower than similar e-bikes, making the on/off experience easier. The 27.5-inch wheels, fitted with 62 mm tires, mean you don't have to second-guess plowing through most gravel or mud or wonder whether it's too windy for an upright ride. The battery's position, along with the mid-drive motor, moves your center of gravity downward, which makes handling a bit easier. The front suspension did its job while going mostly unnoticed, which is what I'm looking for in a road bike. It's slightly stiff in its default adjustment but appropriately tuned to the overall ride feel. Gazelle put 180 mm discs on the front and 160 mm on the back, and they were more than capable of bringing me (at 200 pounds) to a full stop, even at the highest assist levels. I'm an unabashed fan of the Bosch mid-drive motor experience on e-bikes, especially those bikes geared toward upright, flat-bar riding. Taking away one set of digital buttons and using torque sensors to suggest to the rider when it's time to shift physical gears makes a ride easier to enjoy instead of analyze. You can feel the limitations of a 250 W motor when you're trying to crank up a very steep hill or push too far past 20 mph, but if that happens a lot, you might have bought the wrong bike. With Bosch's phone apps, you can adjust the riding modes (Eco, Tour, Auto, and Turbo), shifting them up or down in power range. The motor tops out at 20 miles per hour, however, and will almost always need your legs for anything but downhill riding. The trade-offs for this are that the motor is notably quieter than other motors, and the 400 Wh battery can be stretched to 35 miles and beyond on automatic power, depending on hills and speed. The Medeo T9 City has a much smaller display than the Eclipse, but that's all it needs. You can see your battery level, headlamp status, speed, power level, and shifting indicator, and that's actually a lot for a handlebar display. Gazelle's e-bikes are sturdy, solid, thoughtful rides, with a focus on balanced power and convenience. Go shopping for specs and you can absolutely beat the Medeo with a 750 W rear hub, a belt drive, and a bigger battery. But with the Medeo T9 City, you're buying a sturdy, mid-drive ride from an established brand with a bike shop presence. If it's in your budget and you know what kind of power and range you need, it might be worth spending a bit on reliability.

    "title": "Report calls for regulation of “legally and ethically flawed” VMware",
    "article_text": "\"Broadcom is unlikely to make any voluntary changes to its new commercial terms.\" VMware's business model under Broadcom is \"legally and ethically flawed,\" a group of cloud service provider (CSP) customers and partners alleged in a report released today. The report (PDF) comes from the European Cloud Competition Observatory (ECCO), which describes itself as \"independent monitoring body\" composed of members of the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) trade association, \"with the support—acting as observers—of European customer organizations.\" ECCO says its goals include \"highlighting ongoing or new unfair software licensing practices from any software vendors in the cloud sector,\" and it has previously written similar reports about Broadcom and Microsoft. In its announcement of the report, ECCO said that CISPE members have met with Broadcom once about the changes it has made to VMware's business model, which is now built around subscriptions of bundled products, but didn't see any changes. The report says that VMware customers who have moved to subscriptions are enduring “substantial financial burdens and operational disadvantages\" and pushes for regulatory action. The current subscription model \"creates a material risk for the company and their shareholders should Regulators investigate and challenge the legality of such model,\" the authors added. The report also laments Broadcom's \"highly litigious approach to partners and customers,\" pointing tocease-and-desist lettersthat Broadcom sent to VMware perpetual license holders and since-settled litigation with Siemens that accused its US operations ofpirating \"thousands\" of copiesof VMware software. The report says VMware CSP partners fear becoming targets in Broadcom's VMware-related legal pursuits. \"In the absence of any critical changes and adaptations to its licensing terms, measures including the reinstating of previous contract, the suspension of ongoing litigation initiated by Broadcom as a result of change of terms, should urgently be considered by the Regulator,\" the report reads. The report also points to a filing by the German IT customer association VOICE to the European Commission accusing Broadcom/VMware of antitrust violations. \"VOICE specifically accuses Broadcom of imposing exorbitant and unfair price increases by arbitrarily bundling products as part of the transition from perpetual licensing to subscription-based licensing,\" said a Google translation of the Germanpress releaseannouncing the filing from May 7. \"This also makes it more difficult for Broadcom's competitors to sell their products to existing Broadcom/VMware customers. Only through these abusive practices is Broadcom able to achieve the sales and profit targets announced for VMware.\" VOICE's filing \"further emphasizes the need for definitive action to end these harmful practices,\" ECCO's report says. After Broadcom bought VMware, the virtualization firm's approach to working with resellers changed. Smaller partners weren't invited intoBroadcom's partner programfor reselling VMware, and Broadcom killed VMware's CSP-specific partner program. As a result, many resellers now opt to buy VMware support or services from larger resellers. Many small CSPs have found it financially unsustainable to continue working with VMware. ECCO's report claims that while most CISPE members have entered new licensing agreements with VMware, \"these agreements were often signed under significant pressure, influenced by a lack of alternatives, abrupt contract terminations, and financial incentives such as rebates for longer-term commitments.\" “Broadcom can report that most have signed new contracts, but we know that these are punitive and threaten the viability of service providers locked-in to the VMware ecosystem,\" Francisco Mingorance, secretary general of CISPE, said in a statement. ECCO also expressed concern about Broadcom's ongoing changes to its partner program, including \"reassessing incentives, requirements, and tiering structures,\" as announced earlier this month. ECCO's report lists numerous \"minimum urgent measures\" that it believes Broadcom should take in order to make its VMware business model ethical, including guaranteeing at least \"six months’ notice prior to any changes to contractual terms, pricing structures, or conditions applicable to renewals.” However,given Broadcom'sfinancial successsince acquiring VMware, it appears improbable that the tech giant will overhaul its business strategy. \"Broadcom is unlikely to make any voluntary changes to its new commercial terms. On the contrary[,] we fear it may further tighten conditions, as shown by recent moves to raise the bar for eligibility in partner programs,\" Mingorance told Ars Technica via email, pointing to a need for \"firm regulatory action.\" ECCO's report also comes as many VMware customers, especially small to medium-sized businesses, havefound alternatives to VMware, including other virtualization platforms, or are researching how toreduce their VMware dependence. \"Those who could leave have mostly done so, but they are the minority,\" Mingorance said. \"The rest are effectively locked in until credible alternative virtualization solutions, including third-party certified options like SAP, become available. That’s not yet the case.\" When asked for comment on ECCO's allegations of \"legally and ethically flawed\" VMware practices and putting customers at financial disadvantages, a Broadcom spokesperson shared a statement focusing on Broadcom's relationship with CSPs: As a strategic partner with over 140 European [CSPs], of which more than 40 provide sovereign cloud services, Broadcom is working to advance the European Union's sovereign cloud objectives and enable enterprises of all kinds to accelerate innovation, provide more choice, and address their most complex technology challenges. We welcome the opportunity to have a constructive dialogue with CISPE on how our products can help their European members be more competitive and innovative.

    "title": "Glass redux: Google aims to avoid past mistakes as it brings Gemini to your face",
    "article_text": "Google didn't get it right with Glass, but Android XR is ready for the AI era, even if you aren't. MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.—Get ready to see Android in a new-ish way. It's been 13 years since Google announced its Google Glass headset and 10 years since itstopped selling the device to consumers. There have been other attempts to make smart glasses work, but none of them have stuck. As simpler devices like the Meta Ray-Ban glasses have slowly built a following, Google is getting back into the smart glasses game. Afterannouncing Android XR late last year, the first usable devices were on site at Google I/O. And you're not going to believe this, but the experience is heavily geared toward Gemini. As Google is fond of pointing out, Android XR is its first new OS developed in the \"Gemini era.\" The platform is designed to run on a range of glasses and headsets that make extensive use of Google's AI bot, but there were only two experiences on display at I/O: an AR headset from Samsung known as Project Moohan and the prototype smart glasses. Moohan is a fully enclosed headset, but it defaults to using passthrough video when you put it on. If you've worn anApple Vision Proor a Meta Quest with newer software, you'll be vaguely familiar with how Moohan works. Indeed, the interactions are consistent and intuitive. You can grab, move, and select items with the headset's accurate hand tracking. With Android XR, you also get access to the apps and services you've come to know from Google. Outside of games and video experiences, content has been a problem on other headsets. Google's smart glasses are the more interesting of the pair. While Moohan is not as hefty as the Vision Pro orQuest 3, it's not something you'd want to wear all day. The glasses, on the other hand, could blend pretty seamlessly into your life. Google stressed at every opportunity that the hardware was a prototype, but the glasses felt and looked good. Unlike theMeta Ray-Bans, Google's glasses have a display embedded in the right lens (you can just make out the size and location of the display in Sergey's glasses above). Google Glass projected its UI toward the corner of your vision, but the Android XR specs place the UI right in the middle. It's semi-transparent and can be a little hard to focus on at first, in part because the information it shows is much more minimal than what you get with Moohan. The glasses have a camera, microphone, and open-ear speakers. Everything blends well into a body that barely looks any different than a pair of normal eyeglasses. The only hint of \"smarts\" are the chunky temples that house the silicon and battery. They connect to a phone wirelessly, leveraging the same Gemini Live that you can access with the Gemini app. The experience is different when it's on your face, though. The XR glasses have a touch-sensitive region on the temple, which you can long-press to activate Gemini. A tap pauses and unpauses the AI assistant, which is important because it's very verbose. The demo area for the Android XR glasses was a maximalist playground with travel books, art, various tchotchkes, and an espresso machine. Because Gemini is seeing everything you do, you can ask it things on the fly—Who painted this? Where was this photo taken? Does that bridge have a name? How do I make coffee with this thing? Gemini answers those questions (mostly) correctly, displaying text in the lens display when appropriate. The glasses also support using the camera to snap photos, which are previewed in the XR interface. That's definitely something you can't do with the Meta Ray-Bans. As Google announced at I/O,everyone now has accessto Gemini live on their phone. So you can experience many of the same AI interactions that are possible with the prototype specs. But having Gemini ready hands-free to share your perspective on the world feels different, allowing for smoother access to AI features. Google showed Gemini in Android XR remembering minute details from earlier in the day, sending messages, controlling phone settings, and displaying a floating Google Maps frame for live navigation. Googlers briefly engaged in a \"very risky\" demo of real-time language translation, too. Google has done things like this before with phones and earbuds, but it looked more effortless with these compact smart glasses. The presenters spoke their mother tongue (Farsi and Hindi), which was detected and translated in real-time to English. However, the magic didn't last, with one of the units freezing after a minute. Google said we'll see hardware later this year, but it probably won't look exactly like the demo version at I/O. Hardware is often where Google's more ambitious projects stumble, and that was certainly the case for Glass. Google co-founder Sergey Brin spoke about that during an I/O appearance, noting that he \"made a lot of mistakes with Glass.\" He specifically cited his lack of knowledge on consumer electronics supply chains, which contributed to the hefty $1,500 price tag for Glass. Things should be better for Android XR glasses, Brin said. He says Google is working closely with partners to ensure its glasses are better out of the gate than Glass was. As for Project Moohan, Samsung has the scale and supply chain access to make a competitive piece of hardware. Its issue with past AR and VR products was the software, which it's relying on Google to handle. Of course, no one will want to wear smart glasses that look bad—Meta's glasses have been successful in part because they look very close to standard Ray-Bans. Google says it's working with Gentle Monster and Warby Parker to create Android XR glasses you won't mind having on your face. As for whether or not you'll want Gemini there, it's hard to say. Google's live generative AI has come a long way, but churning through video footage of your entire life is going to be expensive and a potential privacy nightmare.

    "title": "New Claude 4 AI model refactored code for 7 hours straight",
    "article_text": "Anthropic says Claude 4 beats Gemini on coding benchmarks; works autonomously for hours. On Thursday, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, marking the company's return to larger model releases after primarily focusing on mid-range Sonnet variantssince Juneof last year. The new models represent what the company calls its most capable coding models yet, with Opus 4 designed for complex, long-running tasks that can operate autonomously for hours. Alex Albert, Anthropic's head of Claude Relations, told Ars Technica that the company chose to revive the Opus line because of growing demand for agentic AI applications. \"Across all the companies out there that are building things, there's a really large wave of these agentic applications springing up, and a very high demand and premium being placed on intelligence,\" Albert said. \"I think Opus is going to fit that groove perfectly.\" Before we go further, a brief refresher on Claude's three AI model \"size\" names (introducedin March 2024) is probably warranted. Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus offer a tradeoff between price (in the API), speed, and capability. Haiku models are the smallest, least expensive to run, and least capable in terms of what you might call \"context depth\" (considering conceptual relationships in the prompt) and encoded knowledge. Owing to the small size in parameter count, Haiku models retain fewer concrete facts and thus tend to confabulate more frequently (plausibly answering questions based on lack of data) than larger models, but they are much faster at basic tasks than larger models. Sonnet is traditionally a mid-range model that hits a balance between cost and capability, and Opus models have always been the largest and slowest to run. However, Opus models process context more deeply and are hypothetically better suited for running deep logical tasks. There is no Claude 4 Haiku just yet, but the new Sonnet and Opus models can reportedly handle tasks that previous versions could not. In our interview with Albert, he described testing scenarios where Opus 4 worked coherently for up to 24 hours on tasks likeplayingPokémonwhile coding refactoring tasks in Claude Code ran for seven hours without interruption. Earlier Claude models typically lasted only one to two hours before losing coherence, Albert said, meaning that the models could only produce useful self-referencing outputs for that long before beginning to output too many errors. In particular, that marathon refactoring claim reportedly comes fromRakuten, a Japanese tech services conglomerate that \"validated [Claude's] capabilities with a demanding open-source refactor running independently for 7 hours with sustained performance,\" Anthropic said in a news release. Whether you'd want to leave an AI model unsupervised for that long is another question entirely because even the most capable AI models can introduce subtle bugs, go down unproductive rabbit holes, or make choices that seem logical to the model but miss important context that a human developer would catch. While many people now use Claude for easy-going vibe coding, aswe covered in March, the human-powered (and ironically named) \"vibe debugging\" that often results from long AI coding sessions is also a very real thing. More on that below. To shore up some of those shortcomings, Anthropic built memory capabilities into both new Claude 4 models, allowing them to maintain external files for storing key information across long sessions. When developers provide access to local files, the models can create and update \"memory files\" to track progress and things they deem important over time. Albert compared this to how humans take notes during extended work sessions. Both Claude 4 models introduce what Anthropic calls \"extended thinking with tool use,\" a new beta feature allowing the models to alternate between simulated reasoning and using external tools like web search, similar to what OpenAI'so3 and 04-mini-highAI models currently do in ChatGPT. While Claude 3.7 Sonnet already had strong tool use capabilities, the new models can now interleave simulated reasoning and tool calling in a single response. \"So now we can actually think, call a tool process, the results, think some more, call another tool, and repeat until it gets to a final answer,\" Albert explained to Ars. The models self-determine when they have reached a useful conclusion, a capability picked up through training rather than governed by explicit human programming. In practice, we've anecdotally found parallel tool use capability very useful in AI assistants like OpenAI o3, since they don't have to rely on what is trained in their neural network to provide accurate answers. Instead, these more agentic models can iteratively search the web, parse the results, analyze images, and spin up coding tasks for analysis in ways that can avoid falling into aconfabulation trapby relying solely on pure LLM outputs. Anthropic says Opus 4 leads industry benchmarks for coding tasks, achieving 72.5 percent onSWE-benchand 43.2 percent onTerminal-bench, calling it \"the world's best coding model.\" According to Anthropic, companies using early versions report improvements. Cursor described it as \"state-of-the-art for coding and a leap forward in complex codebase understanding,\" while Replit noted \"improved precision and dramatic advancements for complex changes across multiple files.\" In fact, GitHub announced it will use Sonnet 4 as the base model for its new coding agent in GitHub Copilot, citing the model's performance in \"agentic scenarios\" in Anthropic's news release. Sonnet 4 scored 72.7 percent on SWE-bench while maintaining faster response times than Opus 4. The fact that GitHub is betting on Claude rather than a model from its parent company Microsoft (which has close ties to OpenAI) suggests Anthropic has built something genuinely competitive. Anthropic says it has addressed a persistent issue withClaude 3.7 Sonnetin which users complained that the model would take unauthorized actions or provide excessive output. Albert said the company reduced this \"reward hacking behavior\" by approximately 80 percent in the new models through training adjustments. An 80 percent reduction in unwanted behavior sounds impressive, but that also suggests that 20 percent of the problem behavior remains—a big concern when we're talking about AI models that might be performing autonomous tasks for hours. When we asked about code accuracy, Albert said that human code review is still an important part of shipping any production code. \"There's a human parallel, right? So this is just a problem we've had to deal with throughout the whole nature of software engineering. And this is why the code review process exists, so that you can catch these things. We don't anticipate that going away with models either,\" Albert said. \"If anything, the human review will become more important, and more of your job as developer will be in this review than it will be in the generation part.\" Both Claude 4 models maintain the same pricing structure as their predecessors: Opus 4 costs $15 per million tokens for input and $75 per million for output, while Sonnet 4 remains at $3 and $15. The models offer two response modes: traditional LLM and simulated reasoning (\"extended thinking\") for complex problems. Given that some Claude Code sessions can apparently run for hours, those per-token costs will likely add up very quickly for users who let the models run wild. Anthropic made both models available through its API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud Vertex AI. Sonnet 4 remains accessible to free users, while Opus 4 requires a paid subscription. The Claude 4 models also debut Claude Code (introducedin February) as a generally available product after months of preview testing. Anthropic says the coding environment now integrates with VS Code and JetBrains IDEs, showing proposed edits directly in files. A new SDK allows developers to build custom agents using the same framework. Even with Anthropic's future riding on the capability of these new models, when we asked about how they guide Claude's behavior by fine-tuning, Albert acknowledged that the inherent unpredictability of these systems presents ongoing challenges for both them and developers. \"In the realm and the world of software for the past 40, 50 years, we've been running on deterministic systems, and now all of a sudden, it's non-deterministic, and that changes how we build,\" he said. \"I empathize with a lot of people out there trying to use our APIs and language models generally because they have to almost shift their perspective on what it means for reliability, what it means for powering a core of your application in a non-deterministic way,\" Albert added. \"These are general oddities that have kind of just been flipped, and it definitely makes things more difficult, but I think it opens up a lot of possibilities as well.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Authorities carry out global takedown of infostealer used by cybercriminals",
    "article_text": "Authorities, along with tech companies including Microsoft and Cloudflare, say they’ve disrupted Lumma. A consortium ofglobal law enforcement agencies and tech companies announced on Wednesday that they have disrupted theinfostealer malwareknown as Lumma. One of the most popular infostealers worldwide, Lumma has been used by hundreds of what Microsoft calls “cyber threat actors” to steal passwords, credit card and banking information, and cryptocurrency wallet details. The tool, which officials say is developed in Russia, has provided cybercriminals with the information and credentials they needed to drain bank accounts, disrupt services, and carry out data extortion attacks against schools, among other things. Microsoft’sDigital Crimes Unit(DCU) obtained an order from a United States district court last week to seize and take down about 2,300 domains underpinning Lumma’s infrastructure. At the same time, the US Department of Justice seized Lumma’s command and control infrastructure and disrupted cybercriminal marketplaces that sold the Lumma malware. All of this was coordinated, too, with the disruption of regional Lumma infrastructure by Europol’s European Cybercrime Center and Japan’s Cybercrime Control Center. Microsoft lawyers wrote on Wednesday that Lumma, which is also known as LummaC2, has spread so broadly because it is “easy to distribute, difficult to detect, and can be programmed to bypass certain security defenses.” Steven Masada, assistant general counsel at Microsoft’s DCU, says in a blog post that Lumma is a “go-to tool,” including for the notoriousScattered Spidercybercriminal gang. Attackers distribute the malware using targeted phishing attacks that typically impersonate established companies and services, like Microsoft itself, to trick victims. “In 2025, probably following Redline’sdisruptionand Lumma’s own development, it has ranked as the most active module, indicating its growing popularity and widespread adoption among cybercriminals,” says Victoria Kivilevich, director of threat research at security firm Kela. Microsoft says that more than 394,000 Windows computers were infected with the Lumma malware between March 16 and May 16 this year. And Lumma was mentioned in more than 21,000 listings on cybercrime forums in the spring of 2024, according to figures cited in a notice published today by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The malware has been spottedbundled in fake AI video generators,fake “deepfake” generation websites, and distributed byfake CAPTCHA pages. Law enforcement’s collaboration with Microsoft’s DCU and other tech companies like Cloudflare focused on disrupting Lumma’s infrastructure in multiple ways, so its developers could not simply hire new providers or create parallel systems to rebuild. “Cloudflare’s role in the disruption included blocking the command and control server domains, Lumma’s Marketplace domains, and banning the accounts that were used to configure the domains,” the company wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. “Microsoft coordinated the takedown of Lumma’s domains with multiple relevant registries in order to ensure that the criminals could not simply change the name servers and recover their control.” While infostealing malware has been around for years, its use by cybercriminals and nation-state hackers has surged since 2020. Typically, infostealers find their way onto people’s computers through downloads of pirated software or through targeted phishing attacks that impersonate established companies and services, like Microsoft itself, to trick victims. Once on a computer it is able to grab sensitive information—such as usernames and passwords, financial information, browser extensions, multifactor authentication details and more—and send it back to the malware’s operators. Some infostealer operators bundle and sell this stolen data. But increasingly the compromised details have acted as a gateway for hackers to launch further attacks, providing them with the details needed to access online accounts and thenetworks of multi-billion dollar corporations. “It’s clear that infostealers have become more than just grab-and-go malware,” says Patrick Wardle, CEO of the Apple device-focused security firm DoubleYou. “In many campaigns they really act as the first stage, collecting credentials, access tokens, and other foothold-enabling data, which is then used to launch more traditional, high-impact attacks such as lateral movement, espionage, or ransomware.” The Lumma infostealer first emerged on Russian-language cybercrime forums in 2022, according to the FBI and CISA. Since then its developers have upgraded its capabilities and released multiple different versions of the software. Since 2023, for example, they have been working to integrate AI into the malware platform, according tofindingsfrom the security firm Trellix. Attackers want to add these capabilities to automate some of the work involved in cleaning up the massive amounts of raw data collected by infostealers, including identifying and separating “bot” accounts that are less valuable for most attackers. One administrator of Lummatold 404Media and WIREDlast year that they encouraged both seasoned hackers and new cybercriminals to use their software. “This brings us good income,” the administrator said, referring to the resale of stolen login data. Microsoft says that the main developer behind Lumma goes by the online handle “Shamel” and is based in Russia. “Shamel markets different tiers of service for Lumma via Telegram and other Russian-language chat forums,” Microsoft’s Masada wrote on Wednesday. “Depending on what service a cybercriminal purchases, they can create their own versions of the malware, add tools to conceal and distribute it, and track stolen information through an online portal.” Kela’s Kivilevich says that in the days leading up to the takedown, some cybercriminals started to complain on forums that there had been problems with Lumma. They even speculated that the malware platform had been targeted in a law enforcement operation. “Based on what we see, there is a wide range of cybercriminals admitting they are using Lumma, such as actors involved in credit card fraud, initial access sales, cryptocurrency theft, and more,” Kivilevich says. Among other tools, the Scattered Spider hacking group—which has attacked Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts International, and other victims—has beenspotted usingthe Lumma stealer. Meanwhile, according to a report fromTechCrunch, the Lumma malware was allegedly used in the build-up to the December 2024 hack of education tech firm PowerSchool, in which more than70 million records were stolen. “We're now seeing infostealers not just evolve technically, but also play a more central role operationally,” says DoubleYou’s Wardle. “Even nation-state actors are developing and deploying them.” Ian Gray, director of analysis and research at the security firm Flashpoint, says that while infostealers are only one tool that cybercriminals will use, their prevalence may make it easier for cybercriminals to hide their tracks. “Even advanced threat actor groups are leveraging infostealer logs, or they risk burning sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),” Gray says. Lumma isn’t the first infostealer to be targeted by law enforcement. In October last year, the Dutch National Police, along with international partners, took down the infrastructure linked to the RedLine and MetaStealer malware, and the US Department of Justice unsealed charges againstMaxim Rudometov, one of the alleged developers and administrators of the RedLine infostealer. Despite the international crackdown, infostealers have proven too useful and effective for attackers to abandon. As Flashpoint’s Gray puts it, “Even if the landscape ultimately shifts due to the evolution of defenses, the growing prominence of infostealers over the past few years suggests they are likely here to stay for the foreseeable future. Usage of them has exploded.” This story originally appeared atwired.com. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Infrared contact lenses let you see in the dark",
    "article_text": "Mice and humans were able to detect infrared light, even with their eyes closed, with limited resolution. Tired of using bulky night vision goggles for your clandestine nocturnal activities? An interdisciplinary team of Chinese neuroscientists and materials scientists has developed near-infrared contact lenses that enabled both mice and humans to see in the dark, even with their eyes closed, according to anew paperpublished in the journal Cell. Humans and other mammals can only perceive a limited range of the electromagnetic spectrum (light), usually in the 400–700 nm range. There are creatures that can see in infrared (snakes, mosquitoes, bullfrogs) or ultraviolet (bees, birds), and goldfish can perceive both. But humans must augment themselves with technology in order to expand our range of vision. Night vision goggles andsimilar deviceshave been around since the 1930s, including infrared-visible converters, but these require external energy sources, and the converters have a multilayer structure that makes them opaque and hence challenging to integrate with a human eye. The authors previously were ableto confernear-infrared vision to mice by injecting nanoparticles that bind to photoreceptors into their eyes—basically creating a near-infrared nanoantenna—but realized that most people would be averse to the prospect of sticking needles in their eyes. So they looked for a better alternative. Contact lenses seemed the obvious choice. The team screened various biocompatible polymeric materials (used to make commercial contact lenses) to find just the right refractive index and optical and mechanical properties, and integrated them with the aforementioned nanoparticles to make upconversion contact lenses (UCLs). Then they tested their lenses on mice, giving them a choice between a dark box and a box illuminated with infrared light. Mice wearing the contacts chose the dark box; those without augmented vision showed no preference. And the pupils of the contact-wearing mice constricted in response to infrared light, while brain imaging showed the visual processing centers reacting to it as well. The team tested their lenses on humans by asking subjects to detect flashing signals, akin to Morse code, in the infrared, and to identify the direction of incoming infrared light. The subjects could only perform those tasks while wearing the special contact lenses. The authors were intrigued to find that both mice and humans were better able to discriminate infrared light compared to visible light when their eyes were closed, which they attribute to the fact that infrared light can penetrate the eyelid more effectively than visible light. They also tweaked the nanoparticles so that they could color-code different infrared wavelengths, thereby enabling wearers to perceive more details in the infrared, an adaptation that could help color-blind people perceive more wavelengths. There are some limitations. The contact lenses are so close to the retina that they can't really capture fine details very well, because the converted light particles tend to scatter. The team made a wearable glass version of their nanoparticle technology so wearers could get higher resolution in the infrared. And right now the lenses can only detect infrared light projected from an LED; increasing the sensitivity of the nanoparticles to pick up lower levels of infrared would address this issue. Still, it's a significant step. “Our research opens up the potential for non-invasive wearable devices to give people super-vision,”said co-author Tian Xue, a neuroscientist at the University of Science and Technology of China. “There are many potential applications right away for this material. For example, flickering infrared light could be used to transmit information in security, rescue, encryption, or anti-counterfeiting settings. In the future, by working together with materials scientists and optical experts, we hope to make a contact lens with more precise spatial resolution and higher sensitivity.” Cell, 2025.

    "title": "Tesla crushed in Europe as BYD outsells; BEV sales surge 28%",
    "article_text": "Tesla sales fell 49 percent year over year in April. The extent of Tesla's meteoric decline in popularity is on vivid display in the latest new car registration numbers coming out of Europe. New car sales were essentially flat in the region last month, with just under 1,400 more cars sold this year than last. But the market is far from static; plug-in sales are booming, with battery electric vehicle registrations up by 28 percent according to the analysts at JATO Dynamics, and plug-in hybrid EV sales increased by 31 percent. Almost every automaker has capitalized on this growth, with a few exceptions—Tesla being the most significant. As the first mainstream BEV-only brand, Tesla led the way in European EV sales and made much of the fact that its Model Y crossover was the best-selling car in Europe for some time. Those days are long gone. Model Y registrations fell by 53 percent last month to just 4,495 units, dropping it to 9th on the list of most-registered BEVs. First place went to the Skoda Elroq, followed by VW's ID.3, ID.7, ID.4, and the new Kia EV3. When you look at sales at the brand level, things get a little worse for the American automaker. Volkswagen sold more EVs than anyone else in Europe last month, increasing by 61 percent to 23,514 units. As for Tesla? It fell to 11th place, with just 7,165 sales in total, a 49 percent decrease year on year. Beating it to 10th place was China's BYD. Barred from the US market by protectionist laws and now heavy new tariffs, BYD has focused instead on Europe. Its PHEVs have been selling strongly there, unaffected by tariffs aimed at BEVs, but even its BEV sales have now eclipsed Tesla, with 7,231 registrations last month. \"Although the difference between the two brands' monthly sales totals may be small, the implications are enormous,\" said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics. \"This is a watershed moment for Europe's car market, particularly when you consider that Tesla has led the European BEV market for years, while BYD only officially began operations beyond Norway and the Netherlands in late 2022.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "What I learned from my first few months with a Bambu Lab A1 3D printer, part 1",
    "article_text": "One neophyte's first steps into the wide world of 3D printing. For a couple of years now, I've been trying to find an excuse to buy a decent 3D printer. Friends and fellow Ars staffers who had them would gush about them at every opportunity, talking about how useful they can be and how much can be printed once you get used to the idea of being able to create real, tangible objects with a little time and a few bucks' worth of plastic filament. But I could never quite imagine myself using one consistently enough to buy one. Then, this past Christmas, my wife forced the issue by getting me aBambu Lab A1as a present. Since then, I've been tinkering with the thing nearly daily, learning more about what I've gotten myself into and continuing to find fun and useful things to print. I've gathered a bunch of thoughts about my learning process here, not because I think I'm breaking new ground but to serve as a blueprint for anyone who has been on the fence about Getting Into 3D Printing. \"Hyperfixating on new hobbies\" is one of my go-to coping mechanisms during times of stress and anxiety, and 3D printing has turned out to be the perfect combination of fun, practical, and time-consuming. My wife settled on the Bambu A1 because it's a larger version of the A1 Mini, Wirecutter's main 3D printer pick at the time (she also noted it was \"hella on sale\"). Other reviews she read noted that it's beginner-friendly, easy to use, and fun to tinker with, and it has a pretty active community for answering questions, all assessments I agree with so far. Note that this research was done some months before Bambuearned bad headlinesbecause of firmware updates that some users believe will lead to a more locked-down ecosystem. This is a controversy I understand—3D printers are still primarily the realm of DIYers and tinkerers, people who are especially sensitive to the closing of open ecosystems. But as a beginner, I'm already leaning mostly on the first-party tools and built-in functionality to get everything going, so I'm not really experiencing the sense of having \"lost\" features I was relying on, and any concerns Ididhave are mostly addressed byBambu's update about its update. I hadn't really updated my preconceived notions of what home 3D printingwassince its primordial days, something Ars has been around long enoughto have covered in some depth. I was wary of getting into yet another hobby where, like building your own gaming PC, fiddling with and maintaining the equipment is part of the hobby. Bambu's printers (and those like them) are capable of turning out fairly high-quality prints with minimal fuss, and nothing will draw you into the hobby faster than a few successful prints. First things first: The A1 is what’s called an “extrusion” printer, meaning that it functions by melting a long, slim thread of plastic (filament) and then depositing this plastic onto a build plate seated on top of a heated bed in tens, hundreds, or even thousands of thin layers. In the manufacturing world, this is also called “fused deposition modeling,” or FDM. This layer-based extrusion gives 3D-printed objects their distinct ridged look and feel and is also why a 3D printed piece of plastic is less detailed-looking and weaker than an injection-molded piece of plastic like a Lego brick. The other readily available home 3D printing technology takes liquid resin and uses UV light to harden it into a plastic structure, using a process called “stereolithography” (SLA). You can get inexpensive resin printers in the same price range as the best cheap extrusion printers, and the SLA process can create much more detailed, smooth-looking, and watertight 3D prints (it’s popular for making figurines for tabletop games). Some downsides are that the print beds in these printers are smaller, resin is a bit fussier than filament, and multi-color printing isn’t possible. There are two main types of home extrusion printers. The Bambu A1 is a Cartesian printer, or in more evocative and colloquial terms, a \"bed slinger.\" In these, the head of the printer can move up and down on one or two rails and from side to side on another rail. But the print bed itself has to move forward and backward to \"move\" the print head on the Y axis. More expensive home 3D printers, including higher-end Bambu models in the P- and X-series, are \"CoreXY\" printers, which include a third rail or set of rails (and more Z-axis rails) that allow the print head to travel in all three directions. The A1 is also an \"open-bed\" printer, which means that it ships without an enclosure. Closed-bed printers are more expensive, but they can maintain a more consistent temperature inside and help contain the fumes from the melted plastic. They can also reduce the amount of noise coming from your printer. Together, the downsides of a bed-slinger (introducing more wobble for tall prints, more opportunities for parts of your print to come loose from the plate) and an open-bed printer (worse temperature, fume, and dust control) mainly just mean that the A1 isn't well-suited for printing certain types of plastic and has more potential points of failure for large or delicate prints. My experience with the A1 has been mostly positive now that I know about those limitations, but the printer you buy could easily change based on what kinds of things you want to print with it. Overall, the setup process was reasonably simple, at least for someone who has been building PCs and repairing small electronics for years now. It's not quite the same as the \"take it out of the box, remove all the plastic film, and plug it in\" process of setting up a 2D printer, but the directions in the start guide are well-illustrated and clearly written; if you can put together prefab IKEA furniture, that's roughly the level of complexity we're talking about here. The fact that delicate electronics are involved might still make it more intimidating for the non-technical, but figuring out what goes where is fairly simple. The only mistake I made while setting the printer up involved the surface I initially tried to put it on. I used a spare end table, but as I discovered during the printer's calibration process, the herky-jerky movement of the bed and print head waswaytoo much for a little table to handle. \"Stable enough to put a lamp on\" is not the same as \"stable enough to put a constantly wobbling contraption\" on—obvious in retrospect, but my being new to this is why this article exists. After some office rearrangement, I was able to move the printer to my sturdy L-desk full of cables and other doodads to serve as ballast. This surface was more than sturdy enough to let the printer complete its calibration process—and sturdy enough not to transfer the printer's every motion to our kid's room below, a boon for when I'm trying to print something after he has gone to bed. The first-party Bambu apps for sending files to the printer are Bambu Handy (for iOS/Android, with no native iPad version) and Bambu Studio (for Windows, macOS, and Linux). Handy works OK for sending ready-made models from MakerWorld (a mostly community-driven but Bambu-developer repository for 3D printable files) and for monitoring prints once they've started. But I'll mostly be relaying my experience with Bambu Studio, a much more fully featured app. Neither app requires sign-in, at least not yet, but the path of least resistance is to sign into your printer and apps with the same account to enable easy communication and syncing. Bambu Studiois what's known in the hobby as a \"slicer,\" software that takes existing 3D models output by common CAD programs (Tinkercad, FreeCAD, SolidWorks, Autodesk Fusion, others) and converts them into a set of specific movement instructions that the printer can follow. Bambu Studio allows you to do some basic modification of existing models—cloning parts, resizing them, adding supports for overhanging bits that would otherwise droop down, and a few other functions—but it's primarily there for opening files, choosing a few settings, and sending them off to the printer to become tangible objects. Bambu Studio isn't the most approachable application, but if you've made it this far, it shouldn't be totally beyond your comprehension. For first-time setup, you'll choose your model of printer (all Bambu models and a healthy selection of third-party printers are officially supported), leave the filament settings as they are, and sign in if you want to use Bambu's cloud services. These sync printer settings and keep track of the models you save and download from MakerWorld, buta non-cloud LAN mode is availablefor the Bambu skeptics and privacy-conscious. For any newbie,prettymuch all you need to do is connect your printer, open a .3MF or .STL file you've downloaded from MakerWorld or elsewhere, select your filament from the drop-down menu, click \"slice plate,\" and then click \"print.\" Things like the default 0.4 mm nozzle size and Bambu's included Textured PEI Build Plate are generally already factored in, though you may need to double-check these selections when you open a file for the first time. When you slice your build plate for the first time, the app will spit a pile of numbers back at you. There are two important ones for 3D printing neophytes to track. One is the \"total filament\" figure, which tells you how many grams of filament the printer will use to make your model (filament typically comes in 1 kg spools, and the printer generally won't track usage for you, so if you want to avoid running out in the middle of the job, you may want to keep track of what you're using). The second is the \"total time\" figure, which tells you how long the entire print will take from the first calibration steps to the end of the job. When selecting filament, people who stick to Bambu's first-party spools will have the easiest time, since optimal settings are already programmed into the app. But I've had almost zero trouble with the \"generic\" presets and the spools of generic Inland-branded filament I've bought from our local Micro Center, at least when sticking to PLA (polylactic acid, the most common and generally the easiest-to-print of the different kinds of filament you can buy). But we'll dive deeper into plastics in part 2 of this series. I won't pretend I'm skilled enough to do a deep dive on every single setting that Bambu Studio gives you access to, but here are a few of the odds and ends I've found most useful: When given the opportunity to use a 3D printer, my mind went first to aggressively practical stuff—prints for organizing the odds and ends that eternally float around my office or desk. When we moved into our current house, only one of the bedrooms had a ceiling fan installed. I put up remote-controlled ceiling fans in all the other bedrooms myself. And all those fans, except one, came with a wall-mounted caddy to hold the remote control. The first thing I decided to print was a wall-mounted holder for that remote control. MakerWorld is just one of several resources for ready-made 3D-printable files, but the ease with which I found aHampton Bay Ceiling Fan Remote Wall Mountis pretty representative of my experience so far. At this point in the life cycle of home 3D printing, if you can think about it and it's not a terrible idea, you can usually find someone out there who has made something close to what you're looking for. I loaded up my black roll of PLA plastic—generally the cheapest, easiest-to-buy, easiest-to-work-with kind of 3D printer filament, though not always the best for prints that need more structural integrity—into the basic roll-holder that comes with the A1, downloaded that 3MF file, opened it in Bambu Studio, sliced the file, and hit print. Itfeltlike there should have been extra steps in there somewhere. But that's all it took to kick the printer into action. After a few minutes of warmup—by default, the A1 has a thorough pre-print setup process where it checks the levelness of the bed and tests the flow rate of your filament for a few minutes before it begins printing anything—the nozzle started laying plastic down on my build plate, and inside of an hour or so, I had my first 3D-printed object. It wears off a bit after you successfully execute a print, but I still haven't quite lost the feeling of magic of printing out a fully 3D object that comes off the plate and then justexists in spacealong with me and all the store-bought objects in my office. The remote holder was, as I'd learn, a fairly simple print made under near-ideal conditions. But it was an easy success to start off with, and that success can help embolden you and draw you in, inviting more printing and more experimentation. And the more you experiment, the more you inevitably learn. This time, I talked about what I learned about basic terminology and the different kinds of plastics most commonly used by home 3D printers. Next time, I'll talk about some of the pitfalls I ran into after my initial successes, what I learned about using Bambu Studio, what I've learned about fine-tuning settings to get good results, and a whole bunch of 3D-printable upgrades and mods available for the A1.

Rumors of an adaptation have been swirling aroundfor some time, but now it’s official. According toDeadline, the fantasy RPG published by Bandai Namco Entertainment and developed by FromSoftware will become a feature film courtesy of A24. At the helm is Garland as writer and director; he’s a genre veteran whose credits includeEx MachinaandAnnihilation, as well asCivil War,Men, and the recentWarfare. He also scripted the upcoming28 Years Laterfor director Danny Boyle, the much-anticipated follow-up to the zombie series they created.

    "title": "OnlyFans Is Reportedly in Talks to Sell Off Its Porn Empire",
    "article_text": "OnlyFans, the internet’s kingdom of smut, may be changing hands soon. Reutersreports thatthe porn platform’s parent company, Fenix International, Ltd., is in talks to sell the business for some $8 billion to a U.S. investor group. The New York Postpreviously reportedthat Leonid Radvinsky, the billionaire owner of the site, was looking to “cash out,” but had not yet found a buyer. Reuters now identifies at least one potential buyer as the Forest Road Company, an investment firm based in Los Angeles that is reportedly leading an investor group that wants to buy the porn platform. On its website, Forest Road describes itself as “not your average investment firm” and says it embraces “complexity and creativity to extract value where others see limitations.” The site also expresses an interest in “media & entertainment” and “digital assets.” Not much else is known about the talks. Citing sources familiar with the potential deal, Reuters writes that Fenix is also talking to other interested parties. Gizmodo reached out to OnlyFans for more information. OnlyFans was founded in 2016 and rose to prominence during the pandemic by helping horny web users satisfy their libidos whilst otherwise avoiding human contact. Since then, the business has only continued to grow. Other thana weird brief momentin 2021 (when the company bizarrely claimed it would ban “sexually explicit content”), it has served as a premier destination for dirty content, and has helped re-shaped the porn industry through its gig-worker model. Last year, the company reported that payments made through the platform had surged by 19 percent since 2023, topping some $6.6 billion. Radvinsky purchased the company in 2019 and it has made an absolute killing since then. Bloombergreportedlast year that the mogul had made $1 billion in three years through corporate dividends from the business. The company has also been the subject of considerable criticism, as well as numerous legal complaints. Critics accuse the platform of beingfrequented by sex traffickers, and claim that the site has also become a portal forchild sexual abuse material. The company was also recently sued by two customers who wereoutraged to discoverthat they may have not been messaging with real models (creators often outsource their customer communications to third-party firms). onlyfansPornpornography Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "The Avengers won’t be on summer vacation again anytime soon. BothAvengers: DoomsdayandAvengers: Secret Warswere scheduled to start theirrespective summer-movie seasonsin May 2026 and May 2027 but each has now been pushed back several months.Doomsdayhas moved from May 1, 2026 to December 18, 2026, andSecret Warsis going from May 7, 2027 to December 17, 2027. io9 reached out to Marvel Studios about the dates and it confirmed that the shift is largely to give the filmmakers more time. These are massive movies, after all, and withÂdirectors Joe and Anthony Russohelming both films, andDoomsdayalready in production, you couldn’t move one without moving the other. Marvel also mentioned the December time frame is the same oneSpider-Man: No Way Homeopened up in 2021, and that became one of the biggest superhero films of all time. Of course, the previous twoAvengersmovies opened in May and had even bigger success, but a holiday opening is still considered a good one. Finally, as Marvel starts to scale back how many things they make and release, moving these movies to December gives them time to breathe in regards to other films on the schedule, such asSpider-Man: Brand New Dayin July 2026. Also, theDoomsdaymovie gives Disney more time to focus onThe Mandalorian & Grogu,the firstStar Warsmovie in seven years, which comes out just a few short weeks after that original date on May 22, 2026. And no, the dates don’t clash with anyAvatarmovies. ThoughAvatarmovies have all, and will all, come out around the same time in December, after this year’sFire and Ash, the fourth film won’t be out until 2029. But the future of Marvel is certainly more mysterious than ever. After July’sThe Fantastic Four: First Steps, only three official films are on the scheduleâBrand New Day, Doomsday,andSecret Wars, in that order. That means fans will have to wait over a full year to see a new Marvel movie after this summer. Of course, beyond that, the studio has three dates planned for 2028âFebruary 18, May 5, and November 10âbut we’ll see if those stick. Are you worried about these delays?

    "article_text": "Lots of things have changed in the world ofStar Warsover the past few years but one thing has remained maddeningly consistent: no one involved in the future ofStar Warshas mentioned Rian Johnson. Johnson, writer anddirector ofStar Wars: The Last Jedi, wasonce set to write and directa full new trilogy of films. But whenThe Last Jediwas met with such a polarizing response, those projectswere moved to the background. Johnson went on to makeKnives Out, a huge, original hit film, and has since been working almost exclusively in the murder mystery genre. His thirdKnives Outfilm,Wake Up Dead Man, will be out later this year, andthe second season ofPoker Faceon Peacockis airing now. So, it’s not like Rian Johnson needsStar WarsbutStar Warsmight need Rian Johnson. As the franchise continues to flounder, especially on the big screenâwith multiple films announced, delayed, moved, shelved and moreâfans always think back to the idea of Johnson returning toStar Wars. And, in a new interview, he admits he does the same thing. “I kind of went down the murder mystery rabbit holeâIâm focused on making other stuff,” Johnson said tothe Independentwhen asked about his distance fromStar Wars. “But that wouldnât rule out it happening down the line. If I get back in theStar Warsuniverse someday, Iâd be the happiest person.â We would too, Rian. We would, too. Unfortunately, now almost 10 years after the original announcement, a Johnson trilogy probably doesn’t fit in with any current plans. There are two, for sure,Star Warsmovies coming in the next two yearsâThe Mandalorian & Groguone year from today, May 22, 2026, and thenStar Wars: Starfightera year later on May 28, 2027. Beyond that, Simon Kinberg is said to be working on the next officialStar Warstrilogy alongside movies by James Mangold, Dave Filoni, and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy. So even if Johnson finishesKnives OutandPoker Face,we sincerely doubt he’ll be back in a galaxy far, far away anytime soon. But we hope it happens one day. Want more io9 news?

The 'Star Wars' show made a point of approaching its material differently than other projects set in the galaxy far, far away. The show creator proves that when it comes to 'Star Wars,' TV and movies rule all. Sometimes a blaster is just a blaster, but often in 'Star Wars,' it says something about its wielder.

    "title": "A Movie Star Endures Hollywood’s Dystopian Embrace of AI in This Near-Future Short Story",
    "article_text": "io9 is proud to present fiction from Lightspeed Magazine. Once a month, we feature a story from Lightspeedâs current issue. This monthâs selection is âThrough the Machineâ by P.A. Cornell. Enjoy! âSteve, over here! Turn to your right. Can we get a smile?â He falls back on his training easily enough, turns to the cameras, gives them his famous crooked smile, tilts his head just so as the flashes go off so they can capture the smoulder that highlights his cheekbones. The one heâs practiced countless times with his manager, Ethel. The red carpet extends before him, and up ahead he sees the actress heâs been paired with in this film. His co-star and onscreen love interest but in reality, a total stranger. He only knows her name because the photographers keep shouting it, asking her to turn so they can capture her svelte profile. She tilts her head obligingly, long blonde hair falling seductively over one eye, teasing the lenses and through them the millions of fans whoâll one day see these images. Sheâs a pro, like him. Sheâs clearly had the same kind of training heâs had. Sheâs been through the machine. Itâs a phrase he heard years ago from a late-night talk show host. It refers to the way Hollywood turns you into a product. You start out this average person, just trying to make it as an actor, then as your success grows, more and more people come into your life to turn you into something else. A movie star. A fairy tale ideal of celebrity perfection. Heâd told himself that would never be him. He was in it for the art, not the fame and fortune. But here he is. âSteve! Daphne! Can we get some shots of the two of you together?â The blonde up ahead reaches a hand toward him as if beckoning a good friend, though this is the first time theyâve met. She smiles at him in a way that almost looks genuine. He returns his best leading man grin, flashing the expensive set of pearly white teeth his manager arranged for in the earliest days of their partnership. He puts an arm around Daphne. They both pose, turn, look at each other and smile, over and over. Then both look serious, then smile once more. Then she leans in for a peck on the cheek as instructed by the shouting crowd, just before theyâre both ushered off to find their places inside, where the film will be screened. Once theyâre away from the cameras, he extends his hand to Daphne. âHi. Steve Randall.â âNice to meet you,â she laughs. âDaphne Everheart.â âYou seen any of it yet?â âNot even the trailer,â she admits. âDid they send you the screenplay?â He shakes his head. Someone in her entourage grabs her by the arm. She gives him a small wave as they lead her off. He wonders if heâll even see her again after this premiere. Maybe. If the film does well opening weekend, there could be a sequel. They could find themselves at another premiere for a movie they appear in together, but that neither of them has acted in. Steve lets his own people show him past curtains and cocktails to a theater with plush red seating. He takes his place staring up at the screen, trying to conjure up some of the excitement he once felt as a kid about to watch his favorite actors. But the excitement feels more akin to anxiety as the opening credits appear. He sees his own nameâor the one his manager gave him, anyway. Thatâs whenheappears. Seeing himself like this is unsettling, to say the least. He turns to the people seated around him and theyâre all looking up at this face that resembles him but isnât him. Do they not see it? Do they not feel that uncanny valley sickness in the pit of their stomachs that weighs his down as the thing on screen billed as Steve Randall starts to speak? Itâs his voice, but heâs never said these words. Never read the script they came from. Who wrote this, anyway? He wonders. Or rather,whatwrote this? The filmâs runtime is ninety-five minutes. Itâs a romantic comedy, but the word âcomedyâ is generous. Steve doesnât so much as crack a smile. He watches this AI-generated doppelganger and his equally digitized scene partner as they traverse the uneven landscape of the disjointed plotâflimsy even for this genre. They flash smile after smile, kiss with ever-deepening passionâif you can call it thatâand ultimately, after a series of contrived misunderstandings, they get their Hollywood ending. All set to an AI-generated score bereft of any feeling that might conjure atmosphere or elicit an emotional response from the viewer. As the lights come up and people start to clap, Steve glances down the row of seats at his co-star. Daphne, seeming to sense his stare, glances back. She looks as though sheâs about to be sick but gives him a brave smileâa trained smileâand starts to clap along with everyone else. He does the same. This is his job now, after all. The scan was taken a couple of years ago, during pre-production on a movie in which he played an astronaut. They had to scan him for proper fit of the spacesuit they were having made, as well as for some of the more intricate effects. The voice they came by even more easily. From all the ADR heâd done, voicework on some animated stuff, and of course countless interviews already accessible online. He hadnât given the scan much thought, at the time. It had made sense for the work they were doing. Heâd never imagined it would lead to this. Thereâs an afterparty and people keep coming up and congratulating him on the movie. He says what heâs been trained to say, graciously thanking them for their praise, taking pictures with people for magazines and entertainment shows. Evidence that he is in fact still a real person that exists in the world, even though itâs not him on screen. Not in this movie and not in a handful of others, several of which he hasnât even seen. If Hollywood could turn you into a product before, this is on another level. His career has become, almost exclusively, one of public appearances. His L.A. agent has him booked for a store opening tomorrow, and a series of meet-and-greets at conventions sometime in the spring. The sorts of gigs that used to be thought of as âhas-beenâ work, but Steve, by all accounts, is still a bona fide movie star. He wasPeoplemagazineâs âSexiest Man Aliveâ just last year. Fans still somehow manage to find out what hotel heâs staying at in any given city all over the world, just so they can catch a glimpse of him walking in and out. How has it come to this? At the end of the night someone pushes him into a shiny black town car and the spectacle of this farce fades away in the carâs rear lights. He exhales, trying to get the image of thethingon screen out of his head. Itâs not so bad, he tells himself. SAG made sure heâd get paid for the use of his image. Itâs not as much as he mightâve liked, maybe, but itâs decent, and they use it often enough that the cheques enable him to maintain his standard of living. The public appearances add to that. He canât really complain. But the sick feeling in his stomach remains. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ When heâs back in New York, he calls his manager. âIt was fucking weird, Ethel.â He tells her. âSeeing myself in a film I wasnât actually in. No chemistry between me and my co-star because, wellÂ .Â .Â . neither of us was actually there to do any acting. This isnât what I signed up for.â âSweet boy,â she says, using her yearsâ old term of endearment for him, though he hasnât been a boy in quite some time. âI know. But this is how it works with the studio films these days. Be glad your image is still worth something.â Steve sighs deeply. âI know. Itâs justÂ .Â .Â . I worked so hard to get here. We both did. The work mattered to me. I miss challenging myself, figuring out who my character is and how to best convey that through my performance. I miss being able to disappear into all those people and live their lives for a time.â âOf course, of course,â says Ethel. âThatâs one of the reasons I took you on as a client. Even at sixteen, you had such passion. You loved the art of it. But whatâs the alternative, Stefan?â She only ever uses his original name when sheâs serious. He knows her hands are as tied as his. Itâs this or give up the business altogether. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ Over drinks with a friend the next night, he airs his frustrations, his tongue loosened by more than a few shots with beer chasers. âIâm bored,â he tells Frank, who doubled for him in an action film franchise that now continues without need of either of them. âI miss acting. Itâs like all they left me with are the worst parts of fame. The parts where I still canât walk down the street in peace without some paparazzo shoving a lens in my face, and where I can still get cancelled online for any stupid shit I might say without thinking. But the good parts, theyâve all been taken over by some digital version of me that frankly gives me the creeps.â âI hear ya, Steve,â Frank says, raising his beer. âItâs not just you though, brother. At least you still have a marketable presence. Companies still send you free clothes and shit so you can be spotted using it.â âSure,â he tells Frank. âBut all that amounts to is that Iâm now pretty much just this human billboard. Iâm not even an actor anymore.â âYouâre breaking my heart, man. But think about guys like me. We were getting your crumbs even in the good times. If you think things have gotten rough for you, imagine whatâs left for us. I havenât been called for a stunt gig in months. And that last one ended up cancelled last minute when they decided it was cheaper to use AI. Iâve got a family to support, and all three kids are gonna need braces. Not to mention the first wife whoâs on my back if Iâm even half a second late with her alimony. What I wouldnât give for my ugly mug to be in demand.â Steve knows heâs right and feels bad for whining. Things could be so much worse. Whatever jobs heâs lost to AI, there are countless more jobs lost by less famous actors, crew, and other support personnel like PAâs and craft services. He canât begin to imagine how theyâre all making ends meet these days. Many of the ones heâs still close with, like Frank, work multiple jobs, even outside the industry, just to cover what their once stable careers did. âDrinks are on me tonight, by the way,â he tells Frank. âYouâll get no argument here, pal.â â¢Â â¢Â â¢ Later, in the privacy of his loft, Steve allows himself the luxury of self-pity. He canât help thinking of the kid he once was. The chubby little dork with the accent. Too shy to talk to girls. Pushed around by the guys he so wanted to be. Acting freed him from all that. It had allowed this kid who didnât feel comfortable in his own skin to become someone else. In time, it had given him confidence, and as he continued to hone his craft, it had brought him the attention heâd craved and opportunities heâd never imagined. It hasnât always been easy. Thereâd been plenty of lean years before his big breakout role turned him into a household name. Years during which covering rent had been a struggle, and meals had often consisted of half-eaten scraps left by patrons of the restaurants in which heâd waited tables. But heâd loved acting enough to stick with it, and heâd thought it worth all the sacrifices. He gave up his very name for this profession. He lost the accent and the baby fat. Heâs spent a sizeable portion of his income on fixing his teeth, and on five-hundred-dollar haircuts sometimes paired with a treatment to achieve that perfect shade of chestnut brown or a shave that still left enough stubble to keep him looking âmanlyâ in a marketable way. Heâs gotten regular tans to conceal his naturally pale complexionâa condition the L.A. agent refers to as his âvampireâ look. Heâs hired a stylist, a personal trainer, and a dietitian to help him maintain what the grueling workouts have chiselled him into. Heâs had more hours of media training than heâs had acting classes. Hell, at times heâs even dated women heâs beentoldto date. All of it to create this perfect image of Hollywood glamour intended to seduce audiences into filling theater seats. Heâs been put through the machineâand willingly let it happenâjust so he can go on doing what he loves. He hadnât realized this image wasnât him. It was just a product. Something that could be sold, and then re-sold again and again, with little if any say from him as to how it might be used. Feeling down about his situation, Steve turns to Instagram. He doesnât follow any fan accounts but now and then, when heâs alone, he looks up the hashtag that bears his name. The fans have a way of making him feel better about himself. Their comments on his picturesâespecially the shirtless onesâalways make his day. Their support for the charities heâs championed over the years warms his heart. Sure, there are always trolls, but those are in the minority and easy enough to block. He scrolls through his feed and finds thePeoplephoto shoot. His feelings about the shoot are a mix of pride and embarrassment. Pride that the chubby kid with the Polish accent showed his high school bullies up, but a little shame at the fact that he still cares so much about what they might think. Still, a few of the pictures from the shoot are really good. He recalls how the photographerâs great sense of humor put him at ease, and how welcoming the magazine staff were. Continuing to scroll, he comes across a picture of himself he never took. This isnât one of those amazing fan art images heâs seen over the years made by outstandingly talented artists that managed to capture not just his appearance, but his essence. This is some kind of Frankenimage, clearly AI-generated. His hair is a honey blonde heâs never sported, not even on screen. The cheekbones are oddly exaggerated and too narrow, giving him an almost gaunt appearance. In the picture he holds an infant, staring down at it like a proud father. It hurts him to see it. Heâs always wanted a family, but this hasnât happened for him in real life. Steve scrolls some more and comes across another AI image. In this one heâs dressed in a patent leather getup; cut to reveal tattoos he doesnât have. A red blindfold covers his eyes. His arms are cuffed behind his back. His expression is one of ecstasy. Behind him stands another known actor who holds the handle of a whip against his chest as he leans in to lick the side of Steveâs face. The actor is a good friend. Theyâve worked together a few times but never as onscreen lovers. Fans have imagined their characters as a couple for years, which seemed harmless enough, but seeing this is something else. Against his better judgment, he reads the comments. âI ship them.â âGorgeous art. Love this.â âYes, please.â And so on. âI wanna see them getting down in a movie together,â someoneâs written. Thereâs a response to this last comment from someone whoâs handle indicates they work for a major studio. âDonât worry. You wonât have to wait much longer for that. And letâs just say this oneâs not going to be the family-friendly fare youâre used to seeing these guys in.â Steve isnât homophobic. Heâs played gay characters more than once and has been fine with kissing or even simulating sex with other male actors. But thereâs something about being paired with a close friend in this way without so much as a heads up, that seems like a violation. Itâs one thing to work with another actor that youâve built trust with and talk through a scene to make sure youâre both comfortable depicting something intimate that everyone can be proud of in the end. Itâs quite another thing when your image is used to quell strangersâ salacious appetites, in a way you didnât consent to. Steve feels sick. He takes screenshots of both the AI image and the comment about the movie and texts them to his friend. He follows that up with the message: Did you know about this? The reply comes almost immediately. Fuck. Are you kidding me? Wish I was. Damn man. I love you, but not like that. At least not without the kind of money we used to get for our movies. Steve smiles in spite of himself. At least his friends can still have a sense of humor about these things. I feel like we need to push back on this, he tells his friend. Yeah, I get it man, but we signed the contract. I know we didnât have much choice, but the law doesnât care. We agreed to this. Pretty sure itâs too late to stop them. The fans donât even seem to care itâs not really us, Steve types. Why would they?His friend replies.They donât even really need us anymore. We just get in the way of their fantasies. Steve doesnât respond to that. He deletes his Instagram account. He shudders to think of what theyâre doing with his image on TikTok. Or worse, on the dark web. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ âThis sucks, Ethel.â Steve puts the phone on speaker and sets it down on the kitchen counter to pour a bowl of cereal. âIâm going stir-crazy here. I need something to challenge my creativity again.â âWell, I heard about one thing, but Iâm not sure itâs really for you, so I hadnât mentioned it,â she says. âWhat? Tell me?â He opens the fridge and reaches for the almond milk then thinks,screw it, and grabs the whole milk he bought yesterday instead. âThereâs this Broadway musical. I know one of the producers, but youâd have to audition.â âThatâs exactly what I need right now,â he tells her, over mouthfuls of Frosted Flakes. âItâll be good for me to go back to my theater roots. Itâs been too long since Iâve performed in front of an audience.â He pushes the thought that itâs a musical to the back of his mind. Heâs never been known for his singing, but he can work with a voice coach or something. At this point, heâll do anything to perform again. âItâs been a long time since youâve had to audition, let alone for live theater,â Ethel says. âJust tell me where and when. Iâve got this.â â¢Â â¢Â â¢ When he gets the lead in the musical, Steveâs thrilled, but also mildly surprised. Heâd felt good about the audition, but heâd heard some of the other actors sing and they were clearly better than he is. He figures they mustâve seen something in himâan intangible quality that suits the part. Why overthink it? His illusions come crashing down early on in rehearsals. During a break, he talks with one of the stagehands. An older guy named Bill. Steve vents a bit about how he canât really act in the film industry anymore. âThank god for Broadway. The last refuge for actors like me.â âYeah. For actors likeyou,â Bill agrees. Steve isnât sure what he means by that and says so. âLook, you seem like a decent enough guy,â Bill says, âso donât take this the wrong way, but youâre here because youâre a name. They need something to put on the billboards thatâll draw a crowd, is all. It ainât about talent no more.â Steve is taken aback, and his expression must show it. âDonât get me wrong,â Bill continues. âYouâre good. Up there on the big screen, you were a real standout. But this is a whole different animal. All Iâm saying is thereâs actors more cut out for the stage than you that canât get hired anymore because the guys who used to work the screen are taking their roles.â Steveâs about to respond when Bill points to a group of actors sitting together talking. âSee the guy in the collared shirt?â Bill says. âThatâs Wayne Garnet.â Steve knows Wayne from rehearsals. Nice guy. He has a small part but gives it his all. âWayneâs a Tony-winner. Used to behisname on the marquee. Now even he has to settle for bit parts since AI started taking chunks out of the film industry.â Later Steve Googles Wayne Garnet and finds heâs actually wontwoTonys. Heâs also known for his singing voice, which he loaned to several animated films before they started digitally recreating it. Steve feels sick. He approaches Wayne during the next rehearsal and offers to bow out to make room for him. Wayne is gracious and tells him not to. âThereâs no point, Steve. Theyâd just get another big name movie star to replace you. My days as the lead are done. Iâm just happy I still get to be on stage at all. At least for now.â âWhat do you mean?â Steve asks. âAIâs coming for all of us,â Wayne says. âItâs not just the film industry. This crap is spreading like a virus throughout the arts. Thereâs already talk of a new play, AI-written, of course, where instead of live actors theyâre projecting digital performers onto the stage. Itâs strictly off-Broadway for now, but give it time.â Steve is appalled. Doesnât know what to say. Wayne continues. âIâll take whatever I can get these days. You know what they say, âThere are no small parts.â I just hope that when the roles run out, someone will want to scanmeto use in a projection so I can at least cash a cheque now and then.â â¢Â â¢Â â¢ At home one night, after the playâs run has ended, Steve settles in to watch TV. He scans his options, stumbling upon one of his early roles. A serious drama in which he played a depressed teen, struggling with his parentsâ divorce and his older brotherâs untimely death. Even all these years later, the dialogue comes back as he watches one of the more emotional scenes. âItâs not like I donât want to talk about Tommy,â he mouths along with his younger self. âI do. Itâs just that . . .â Young Steve canât finish because heâs started to cry. Present day Steve remembers shooting the sceneâhis first time crying on cue. He remembers harnessing all those emotions and tapping into all the pain heâd ever felt, and all of it somehow pouring out of him in that moment. He remembers the director taking him aside later and saying, âYou nailed it, kid.â He smiles thinking of this now, but then heâs sad again, missing the sense of accomplishment of pulling off a scene like this. The exhilaration of seeing an audience respond to it later. He watches the remainder of the movie while eating peanut butter by the spoonful right out of the jar. Halfway through he crumbles in an entire Kit-kat bar like he used to do when he was a kid. By the time the credits roll, the jar is empty. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ Steveâs personal trainer leaves frequent voicemail messages asking when heâs coming back to the gym. He knows he should, but itâs tough to get motivated for a workout when he feels like all anyoneâs going to see is his AI clone. Still, itâs in his contract to try to resemble the digital version of himself as much as possible. He knows his skin could use a bit more color these days too, and his hairâs starting to show some gray he hadnât even realized he had. He makes a mental note to focus more on his appearance. All that can wait until after he returns from the convention though. Heâs surprised to find heâs actually looking forward to connecting with his fans again and maybe seeing some of the ones that have become familiar faces over time. The energy at the con is intense, and Steve feels electrified, like he did during his stint on Broadway. One by one he greets his fans as warmly as he possibly can. He makes time to speak with them in the few minutes he has while they take pictures with him. He gives them not his practiced smile, but his real one, and makes sure to thank each one for their continued support. Things get a little weird during the signing. Much of it is what heâs used to, with fans handing him old headshots or pictures from his older films to sign, and in some cases art theyâve made themselves. But heâs also handed quite a few more AI-generated images than heâs used to. He feels like a fraud signing them. Like heâs putting his autograph on someone elseâs headshot. Still, he tries to be gracious and humble with the fans. Theyâve been there for him through his rise to fame. Itâs the least he can do. By the time itâs all over and heâs on his way back to the hotel, Steveâs feeling good about the event. So good, in fact, that he revives his Instagram account to see what fans have been posting. He smiles at the pictures they took with him earlier in the day. Many of the fans are dressed like his characters. Some of the props and signs theyâve brought are so creative, they bring a smile to his face. But soon he notices that not all the comments under the pictures are kind. âIs it just me or is Steve rockinâ the dad bod these days?â someone asks. âYeah. I hate to say it, but I was a bit disappointed that he didnât look as hot as he does inBurning Brand II,â replies the account holder. âHeâs looking older too. I mean, donât get me wrong, he was nice and all, I just wish the picture was better.â âJust fix it so he looks hot,â someone else suggests. âYeah, I probably will.â Steve doesnât even know whatBurning Brand IIis. Another of his films he hasnât seenâor acted inâhe assumes. He closes the app and wonders why he even bothers. If the fans donât care whatâs real and what isnât, why is he even doing this? â¢Â â¢Â â¢ He goes for a run the next morning. Itâs been a while, but he soon finds his rhythm. Itâs early in the day and the streets are quiet. He likes this time of day. Itâs peaceful. Gives him a chance to clear his head. When he stops for a rest, he notices a small theater. A sign over the door proclaims that the theater shows only movies made by and starring living human beings. The acronym âAIâ is painted on one of the windows with a red slash cut diagonally through it. But what really gets Steveâs attention is the man changing the posters. He replaces one with another that features a pensive-looking Daphne Everheart. His former co-star, if you can call her that, looks younger in this poster. Heâs never seen her act before and heâs curious. He decides to return later in the day when the theater opens. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ The filmâs calledGrace. In it, Daphne plays a young woman trying to convince her wealthy parents to take her seriously as an inventor. The story is moving, as Daphneâs character struggles against societal expectations to achieve her dreams. Steve likes the score too, and decides heâll stay to read through the credits to see who composed it. He also enjoys the style the director has brought to the project. But what he likes most is Daphneâs performance. Sheâs good. It kills him to think that someone who was clearly a rising star is now relegated to appearing only as a digital ghost of herself in half-baked movies that wouldâve been an embarrassment at another time. How many other talented actors have been forced out of the industry altogether? And what of everyone else whose jobs have been made irrelevant? Steve feels the tears well up, in part because of the movie, but also because of his thoughts. He blinks them away and looks around to see if other people are equally moved. Thatâs when he notices that nearly every seat in the theater has someone in it. He watches their expressions as they react to Daphneâs performance. He sees the story affect them, and by the end he understands that there are people for whom this art still has meaning. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ After the movie lets out, he calls Ethel. âIâm thinking of doing something a bit different,â he tells her. âI want to start a production company. Make movies the old way. I have a whole list of people I can call whoâd jump at the chance to collaborate on something real again.â âThat sounds wonderful, sweet boy. Itâs nice to hear some excitement in your voice again.â âI was calling to ask you something,â he tells her. âYou wouldnât happen to know how to get in touch with Daphne Everheart, would you? I donât have a project yet, but Iâd like to gauge her level of interest. Iâm sure weâll find something for her. The world deserves to see how good she actually is at this.â P.A.

    "article_text": "Wake up, babe, new viral AI video generator dropped. This time, it’s notOpenAI’s Sora modelin the spotlight, it’sGoogle’s Veo 3, which was announced on Tuesday during the company’sannual I/O keynote. Naturally, people are eager to see what chaos Veo 3 can wreak, and the results have been, well, chaotic. We’ve gotdisjointed Michael Bay fodder,talking muffins,self-aware AI sims,puppy-centric pharmaceutical adsâthe list goes on. One thing that IkeepÂseeing over and over, however, isâto put it bluntlyâAI slop, and a very specific variety. For whatever reason, all of you seem to be absolutely hellbent on getting Veo to conjure up a torrent of smooth-brain YouTube content. The worst part is that this thing is actually kind of good at cranking it out, too. Don’t believe me? Here are the receipts. You can barely tell this iPhone unboxing isn't realpic.twitter.com/vfZ2lUoliZ — Matt Shumer (@mattshumer_)May 21, 2025 Is this 100% convincing? No. No, it is not. At a glance, though, most people wouldn’t be able to tell the difference if they’re just scrolling through their social feed mindlessly as one does when they’re using literally any social media site/app. Unboxing not cutting it for you? Well, don’t worry, we’ve got some man-on-the-street slop for your viewing pleasure. Sorry, hawk-tuah girl, it’s the singularity’s turn to capitalize on viral fame. 2. Stand-up comedy telling a funny joke that never happenedhttps://t.co/05M6cDZlzK — Min Choi (@minchoi)May 22, 2025 Again, Veo’s generation is not perfect by any means, but it’s not exactly unconvincing, either. And there’s more bad news: Your Twitch-like smooth-brain content isn’t safe either. Here’s one of a picture-in-picture-style “Fortnite” stream that simulates gameplay and everything. I say “Fortnite” in scare quotes because this is just an AI representation of what Fortnite looks like, not the real thing. Either way, the only thing worse than mindless game streams is arguably mindless game streams that never even happened. And to be honest, the idea of simulating a simulation makes my brain feel achey, so for that reason alone, I’m going to hard pass. Uhhh… I don't think Veo 3 is supposed to be generating Fortnite gameplaypic.twitter.com/bWKruQ5Nox — Matt Shumer (@mattshumer_)May 21, 2025 Listen, I’m not trying to be an alarmist here. In the grand scheme of things, AI-generated YouTube, Twitch, or TikTok chum isn’t going tohurtÂanyone, exactly, but it also doesn’t paint a rosy portrait of our AI-generated future. If there’s one thing we don’t need more of, it’s filler. Social media, without AI entering the equation, is already mostly junk, and it does make one wonder what the results of widespread generative video will really be in the end. Maybe I’ll wind up with AI-generated egg on my face, and video generators likeFlow, Google’s “AI filmmaker,”will be a watershed product for real creators, but I have my doubts. At the very least, I’d like to see some safeguards if video generation is going to go mainstream. As harmless as AI slop might be, the ability to generate fairly convincing video isn’t one that should be taken lightly. There’s obviously huge potential for misinformation and propaganda, and if all it takes to help mitigate that is watermarking videos created in Veo 3, then it feels like an easy first step. For now, we’ll just have to take the explosion of Veo 3-enabled content with a spoonful of molasses, because there’s a lot of slop to get to, and this might be just the first course.

    "title": "RFK Jr.’s MAHA Commission Releases First Report to Donald Trump",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump’s new Make America Healthy Again commission, established through an executive order signedFeb. 13, released its first report on Thursday, titled “Make Our Children Healthy Again: Assessment.” Trump held anevent at the White Houseon Thursday afternoon to discuss the report with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The 68-page report is a mix of perfectly reasonable observations about the availability of nutritious foods and the influence of giant food companies, along with hints at more fringe theories for the cause of sickness in America. “ThehealthofAmerican children isincrisis,” reads a copy of the new report obtained byAxios. The report had not been published by the White House yet at the time of this writing. “Despiteoutspendingpeernationsbymorethandoublepercapitaonhealthcare,” the report continues,“theUnitedStatesrankslastinlifeexpectancyamonghigh–incomecountriesandsuffershigherratesofobesity,heartdisease,and diabetes.” The report lays the blame for the poor health of American kids on four broad categories: poor diet, lack of physical activity and chronic stress, “overmedicalization,” and the “aggregation of environmental chemicals.” The report also blames technology and tries several times to suggest that vaccines are making children ill without explicitly saying what anti-vaccine advocates have falsely claimed for years: that vaccines cause autism. President Trump has repeatedly hinted at his own belief that vaccines cause autism, something that is not supported by years of research. And yet, Trump emphasized his concern about autism on Thursday, saying that statistics around the “alarming” rise of autism was the part of the report that “gets” him the most. “Just a few decades ago, one in 10,000 children had autism. Today it’s one in 31,” Trump said at the event Thursday. “Last time I heard the number is one in 34, right? Now it’s one in 31. There’s something wrong and we will not stop until we defeat the chronic disease epidemic in America.” The new MAHA report points to the lack of vaccine requirements in many European countries while trying to suggest that it’s the reason Europeans live longer than Americans. But it ignores the fact that Europe is currently experiencing a historic measles outbreak and the benefits of universal health care coverage, something every wealthy country in Europe has achieved, either through government-run healthcare systems like the UK and Norway or through hybrid public-private systems like Germany and France. “Today’schildrenare thesickestgenerationinAmericanhistoryintermsofchronicdiseaseandthesepreventabletrendscontinuetoworseneach year,posingathreattoournation’shealth,economy,andmilitaryreadiness,” the report claims, repeating a line that Secretary Kennedy has used before about needs from the Defense Department. The report questioned the heavy use of pesticides like glyphosate, which is found in Monsanto’s Roundup, as well as atrazine. The report also raises concerns about microplastics and flouride, as well as an unproven idea linking cellphone and wifi radiation to lowsperm counts. The MAHA commission sat at a table for the White House event on Thursday, comprised of pro-Trump extremists, including Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine advocate, as well as FDA commissioner Marty Makary, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, and OMB Director Russ Vought. Other members of the commission include Lee Zeldin, the head of the EPA, and Stephen Miller, the far-right Trump advisor best known for shouting during TV interviews and threatening to suspend habeas corpus. Mehmet Oz, the head of the Medicare and Medicaid, was also present and spoke at the event about his efforts to lower drug prices. “Just tremendous talent around this table, the most respected people,” said Trump of the MAHA commission during the event, which waslivestreamedonline but wasn’t picked up live by any of the major cable TV networks. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins is also on the MAHA commission, which is curious given the fact that she stripped roughly$1 billion of fundingfrom the USDA that used to allow local farmers to deliver food to food banks and schools. Rollins is perhaps more responsible than anyone in the current regime for taking food out of the mouths of hungry kids and yet is seen as an expert on how to make America’s children more healthy. The commission met just once behind closed doors, according toSTAT News, before the White House event on Thursday. Last-minute changes were made to the report at the behest of the White House, according to theWall Street Journal, including some cuts to references to corporate lobbying about so-called forever chemicals. The EPA under Zeldin will soon weaken rules intended to keep forever chemicals out of water, as theWashington Postrecently reported, though it’s not clear whether that decision has anything to do with that section getting nixed from the report. The White House also reportedly added some recognition that childhood vaccines can protect kids from infectious disease, according to the Journal, perhaps blunting some of the anti-vaccine messaging that may have been present in earlier drafts. The U.S. is indeed struggling with poor health outcomes. It has lower life expectancy compared to other wealthy nations. And it spends more than any other country for those poor outcomes, according toJAMA. None of that is contested. But the MAHA movement dabbles in enough anti-scientific thinking and seems to get tunnel-vision when it comes to the ways in which Americans can get healthier. Kennedy has repeatedly said that MAHA has a strong spiritual component, something echoed in a 2024 podcast by Casey Means, the new nominee to be Surgeon General. Means does not have an active medical license and dropped out of her residency program. The MAHA commission is scheduled to release another report in August to lay out a policy strategy that’s supposed to fix the country’s health problems. That planned report is roughly in line with Secretary Kennedy’s promise to reveal the “cause” of autism by the fall, something he asserted at the White Housein April. Needless to say, announcing you’ll find a cause for a specific ailment in a particular timeframe isn’t how science works. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "‘Andor’ Asked Fans to Put the Theories Down",
    "article_text": "Across itstwo seasons, it became common to describeÂAndorÂas “unlikeÂStar Wars.” Typically a compliment, this phrase was an easy shorthand to use, and it’s taken on greater meaning now that its cast and creatives can speak more freely about what stayed on the cutting room floor. Creator Tony Gilroy has recently discussed his active choice to not have the show feature future key players likePalpatine, Darth Vader,orRogue OneÂprotagonistJyn Erso. Ultimately, he thought including any of the three would’ve been unnecessary or overindulgent and in Jyn’s case, “disrespectful” to her original appearance. It’s a surprising level of restraint thatStar WarsÂhasn’t always been the best at exercising, and despite how disappointing it may be to fans of those characters, it was ultimately the right call. The franchise tends to get a little too cute with its callbacks and cameos, and when it indulges in fan service, itreallyÂindulges. (There’s a reason whyÂRise of SkywalkerÂquickly became derided as “written and directed by Reddit.”) ThatStar Warsis in constant conversation with its fanbase isn’t inherently bad, and much of it wouldn’t exist without this approach.Â But the wayÂAndorÂgoes about it is more one-sided, instead reminding audiences that it’s in charge and telling them to meet it on its own terms. This was, according to Gilroy, a conscious decision: he revealed in 2022 he instructed his writers and crew to treat this like any other show instead of aStar Warsshow. “We told people, ‘Do your thing. You’re here because we want you to be real.’ […] It really gets into people’s heads, but to change the lane and do it this way, it takes a little effort,” he said tothe Hollywood Reporter. In some ways, it feels like the show was made in isolation from its own mothership franchise and any idea of what the reactions would be likeâforbetter and worseâbut it could easily just be how locked in Gilroy and company were during production. He’s on record astakingÂStar WarsÂseriouslyand treating the setting and characters with real, considerate intent. In many cases, that means working ahead of the audience, like crafting Kleya and Luthen’s backstories so viewers wouldn’t think they were sleeping together, or treating Cassian’s missing sister Kerri as a thread in his life that he’ll just have to live with being unsolved. In another show, or maybe the same show but with more time, Cassian probably would’ve gotten a definitive answer before flying off to beginRogue One,Âand with how espionage-focused this all is, Kerri would either have to be a secretive Kleya or a woman in the ISB or another rebel group with a particular interest in him. Those, or making Cass’ childhood droid B2 into his adult droid companion K2SO, would’ve been somewhat understandable (albeit completely strange) soap opera-esque twists in another show, but they wouldn’t be right to howAndoroperates. Fan theories often involve characters getting a happy ending or what they want to some extent, andÂ Andorisn’t really the type of show where those thoughts are allowed to foster and fully take shape. A repeated throughline for many of its characters is their being denied the chance of a future they wanted or may not have realized was possible until it was too late. For the most part, that’s meant a grim fate of some kind awaited them;Syril Karn’smuch-predicted change of heart for the Ghor was never going to manifest in some betrayal of Dedra or joining the Rebelsâas actorKyle Sollertells it, being killed was the right outcome for his character. But those who make it through to the show’s end don’t get off unscathed, since their final appearances are punctuated with an undercurrent of bittersweetness or darker, sadder conclusions to their stories. AndorÂis a matter-of-fact show, and it isn’t trying to get a deliberate reaction out of audiences the way other shows do,Star WarsÂor otherwise. It was, first and foremost, concerned with telling the story of Cassian’s growth into a prominent rebel leader and how those caught in his orbit were shaped by his actions. It didn’t care what the viewer thought because it knew it had the goods, and that confidencesure did pay off.

    "title": "Tony Gilroy Knowingly Went Against Canon for K-2SO’s Origin in ‘Andor’",
    "article_text": "For years, we were led to believe that when it came toStar Wars,there was one canonand that was it. Every book, comic, TV show, and movie wasall supposed to co-exist to tell a single, overarching story. And for the most part, that has been true. But in a few cases, filmmakers have overridden work done by fellow creators, and the best example yetcomes inAndor. In 2017, a few months after the release ofRogue One, Marvelreleased a one shot comicbook called “Rogue One – Cassian & K-2SO Special 1.” Written by Duane Swierczynski and illustrated by Fernando Blanco, the comic explored how Cassian and K2 met. And, for several years, that version of their origin story was considered the truth because it was part ofStar Warscanon. Then, of course, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy gave the okay for Tony Gilroy to dig back into those characters withAndor. Fast forward to season two and the origin of K2 and Cassian’s friendship on Andor is completely different from the one in the canon. Recently, on theHappy Sad Confusedpodcast, the creator explained why that was. “Canon, I usually try to deal with it, and I’m really sympathetic and into it,” Gilroy said. “[But] I was annoyed to find out somebody, in the interim betweenRogueand that, had written an origin story for K-2SO. And it’s like, ‘No I’m not paying attention to that. We’re not doing that.'” And so, that was that. You can watch the clip, cued up, here. ForStar Warsfans, I think this is a very interesting issue to talk about. First of all, clearly everyone wants creatives like Tony Gilroy to make a show however they want to make a show. That he was not just beholden to, but embraced, other canon moments such as the Ghorman Massacre, Yavin-4, Mon Mothma’s speech, etc., shows that he wanted his story to fit in the overall world. Also, tens of thousands of people read that comic and, potentially, millions of people watch the show. There’s no real, good reason to be beholden to a fact such a small number of people know about, especially if you don’t agree with it or it doesn’t fit. And yet, that has always been the beauty of this modernStar Warscanon. While there was clearly a lot to love about the era of the Expanded Universe and how every story could be unique and contradictory, there was also something exciting about knowing every singleStar Warsthing you picked up fit together.. And yet, that has slowly been changing. ThemingaroundStar WarsGalaxy’s Edgeis one big thing. The animated seriesTales of the Jedi,which adaptsÂ Ahsoka’s origin in contrastto a novel, is another. And who knows what else could be coming in the future? It’s a fun debate to have, and ultimately, I’m fine with Gilroy changing K2’s origin to his liking. It’s not like I can’t still enjoy the comic version. One is just the more accepted version now. What are your feelings on all this? Let us know below. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Texas Is Gearing Up to Ban THC",
    "article_text": "Everything is bigger in Texas, except the THC industry, which may disappear entirely. Just six years after the state opened up hemp sales, the Texas House voted this week to outright ban the sale of products containing any amount of THC,according to the Texas Tribuneâa prohibition that will upend a major industry within the state and implement stricter punishments for consumers. The statehouse took up the proposed total ban on THC products Wednesday night and approved the measure by a vote of 86-53, falling largely along party lines.Per the Houston Chronicle, members of the Texas House had been exploring introducing new regulations on the hemp industry instead of going for the full ban, including a ban on vapes and synthetic compounds, as well as cracking down on packaging and products designed to appeal to children. But, at the urging of Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, the legislators embraced the full prohibition approach. The Senate has already passed a version of bill, so there are just a few procedural hurdles left to clear before a final version gets sent to Governor Greg Abbott to sign it into law or reject it. Banning pot products has been one of the top legislative goals of Lt. Gov. Patrick, who claims the products have been fueling a public health crisis. He found plenty of allies in the statehouse, including House bill sponsor Tom Oliverson. The Republican representativetold The Dallas Morning Newsthat, under the bill, âIf it gets you high, it is not legal anymore.” The crackdown will come with some strict penalties for those caught with THC-laden consumables. The bill would carry a penalty of up to one year in jail for an adult who possesses hemp products with any amount of THC.The Texas Tribune notedthat this is a stricter penalty than the one imposed for getting caught with 2 ounces of marijuana. Hemp products were first legalized in Texas a part of a 2019 farm bill, and a massive industry has cropped up around THC since then.One reportestimates that the hemp business generates about $8 billion in revenue per year in Texas and employs more than 50,000 workers. All of that could disappear overnight should the full prohibition go into effect. While a flat ban on THC is a draconian step, especially given the option to regulate the industry was on the table, Texas isn’t the only state pumping the brakes on the hemp industry. Several others,including Colorado, have taken steps to regulate intoxicating hemp products over concerns as to how strong they are andhow they affect users. Last year, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicinecalled for federal standardsto be put in place for intoxicating products derived from hemp, driven by the growing market of THC concentrates and vape oils that have become available and offer significantly higher doses of THC than dried flower.

Similar laws nationwide are being challenged and blocked by federal courts over potential First Amendment violations. Psychedelic drugs might have fundamentally changed pre-Incan society. Although it's not the worst bill to come out of Texas, advocates warn that the bill's vagueness leave it ripe for misuse. Drought, wind, and climate change are turning the Borderplex into a morass of airborne grit. \"Are you ready for this, media?\" the attorney general asked, but what followed was a heaping pile of horsecrap about a very serious subject.

    "title": "NOAA Warns of Brutal Atlantic Hurricane Season, as Trump Slashes the Agency",
    "article_text": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its outlook for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season today, predicting âabove-normalâ storm activity. The news comes amid concerns that sweeping staff cuts and policy shifts may impact the agencyâs preparedness. A total of 13 to 19 named storms could form in the Atlantic basin this year, Ken Graham, director of NOAAâs National Weather Service (NWS), said during the Thursday news briefing in Gretna, Louisiana. Of those, six to 10 are expected to strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become âmajorâ hurricanesâCategory 3, 4, or 5.Â If this forecast comes to fruition, it wouldmarkthe ninth consecutive year of above-average storm activity in the Atlantic basin,primarily driven by rising ocean temperatures.Â Last year, the season saw 18 named storms, 11 of which were hurricanes. Five intensified to major hurricanes, including Category 4 Helene and Category 5 Milton, which made landfall in the U.S. within two weeks of each other and devastated large swaths of the Southeast.Â FEMA Shifts Disaster Burden to States in Wake of Deadly Tornadoes Based on NOAAâs forecast, the 2025 season could be similar. But this time around, the agency will be working with a significantly reduced staff. The NWS alone has lost more than 10% of its workforce since the Trump administration took office, CBS Newsreported.Â Despite this, Acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said the National Hurricane Center (NHC)âan arm of the NWSâis âfully staffed and ready to go,â emphasizing that forecasting is a top priority both for NOAA and the Trump administration.Â In astatement, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said NOAA has ânever been more prepared for hurricane season,â pointing to âadvanced weather models and cutting-edge hurricane tracking systemsâ that should provide Americans with real-time storm forecasts and warnings.Â Indeed, NOAA promised some big improvements for this season, highlighting moves to upgrade its hurricane analysis and forecast system, issue tropical storm advisories up to 72 hours before landfall, and extend their global tropical hazards outlookâwhich provides advance notice of potential storm risksâfrom two weeks to three weeks.Â The agency plans to deploy new tools as well, including an experimental, plane-mounted radar system that will collect data on ocean waves and wind during a hurricane. NOAA also aims toexpandits flood inundation mapping (FIM) toolâwhich provides real-time, street-level visualizations of flood watersâto cover 60% of the U.S. this year. It currently covers just 30%. But just two days ago, an unnamed NOAA officialtoldScientific American that âeverything has ground to a haltâ at the agency due to Lutnickâs insistence that he personally review any contract over $100,000. This stalled more than 200 NOAA contracts, including one intended to help local communities prepare for extreme weather, Scientific American reports.Â Whatâs more, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced last week thatit is shifting disaster recovery responsibility to the states. While itâs still not entirely clear what this will look like, the move could significantly reduce the amount of aid states can get from FEMA. Acting chief David Richardson warned that traditional FEMA cost-sharing, which covers 75% of recovery expenses, could change by this summer, according to theAssociated Press.Â When asked about how this will impact members of her community during the briefing today, Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng said giving more responsibility to the states is a âgood thing to be talking about,â but emphasized the importance of making sure that states actually have the resources to respond adequately.Â Jefferson Parishâhome to more than 420,000 Louisianansâwas hit hard by Hurricane Francine last September, with total lossesestimatedat $1.3 billion. With the official start of hurricane season just 10 days away, NOAAâs ability to weather unprecedented policy shifts during what will likely be another punishing storm season will soon be put to the test.

    "title": "‘Marvel Rivals’ Is Making Ultron a Lean, Mean, Healing Machine",
    "article_text": "Marvel Rivalshas had a bit of a support problem in its latest season. Amid the glitz and glamor ofEmma Frost’s arrivaland the Hellfire Gala, the hero shooter’s sophomore season aimed to try and reign in a meta that had seen the game’scast of strategistsâthe healing and support heroes in the game’s riff on the classic Tank/Healer/DPS triangleâbecome dominantly powerful, with balance updates that saw support characters face longer cooldowns, smaller health pools, and even a rebalancing of how the game weighted support contributions to end-of-match rewards. That and the general hero-shooter-reputation of support players feeling undervalued by their teams caused a lot of ire (and even callsfor a strike), to the point that developer NetEase began reverting some of the tweaks it made. But while those have somewhat calmed the ire of angsty strategist mains, it seems like they’re getting a big bone thrown to them withÂRivals‘ latest addition, Ultron, a strategist who seemingly asks: aren’t you tired of being nice? Don’t you just want to go apeshit? Although we’ve known since the start of the season that Ultron would beÂRivals‘ mid-seasonaddition to the roster, today NetEase lifted the lid on our first proper look at him in action, and it seems like he’s going to be a maligned support player’s dream. First up, he’s pretty aggressive, with both his primary fire looking quite meanandhis nature as the first flying strategist hero letting him chase down foolhardy duelists who wanted to try and pick off a support. That flight also gives him a nifty escape option, as we get to see him boost out of and away from being pinned by Wolverine’s perpetually annoying leap attack, too. But all that aggro doesn’t meanÂRivalsplayers will seemingly have to fear “DPS Ultrons” who don’t balance their damaging abilities with healing output. Ultron will be able to tag allies with a healing drone that provides sustained healing over time in a radius around the tagged teammate, while he keeps attacking, and what looks like a temporary shield buff that grants overhealth to mitigate incoming damage. And ifthatwasn’t enough, his ultimate lets Ultron call in a host of drones to fire a volley of beam blasts that simultaneously heal allies and and harm foes. Sometimes the best way to heal your friends is to obliterate anything that threatens to damage them in the first place! Time will tell just how Ultron slots intoÂMarvel Rivals‘ meta, but you can probably to expect to suddenly see a lot more support mains in your lobbies when he arrives alongside the season 2.5 update next week starting May 30.

    "title": "How Did This 1,300-Ton Boulder Travel Up a Cliff? Scientists Just Figured It Out",
    "article_text": "A giant boulder in Tonga rode a wave from an ancient tsunami 7,000 years ago. The 1,300-ton rock traveled a distance twice the size of a football field, swept away by the sheer force of the wave, according to a new study. But this was no ordinary giant rock. It was also sitting on a 100-foot (30-meter) tall cliff before surfing to its new locationâhinting at a past mega-tsunami that swept the region. In July of 2024, Martin Kohler, a PhD candidate from the University of Queensland, and his team were doing fieldwork on Tonga’s cliffs, searching for evidence of past tsunamis. In particular, they were looking for large boulders that could have been carried inland, which can tell researchers a lot about the history of tsunamis in earthquake-prone regions, like Tonga. On one of their last field days, some local farmers told the researchers about a boulder they might be interested in. The rock, familiar to locals asMaka Lahi, or literally âlarge rock,â had never been studied by scientists. It had likely eluded previous satellite searches for tsunami-swept rocks because of its thick coat of vegetation. The boulder was made of coral reef limestone breccia, hinting that it had come from somewhere near the coast. âI was so surprised; it is located far inland outside of our field work area and must have been carried by a very big tsunami,â Kohler said in astatement. The researchersâ findings were published in the journalMarine Geology. The researchers later found a huge gash in a 100-foot (30-meter) tall cliff near the ocean, around 650 feet (200 meters) away from the boulderâs current position. They also determined the rock was deposited 6,891 years ago, before humans settled on Tonga. The researchers measured the boulder at 45 by 40 by 20 feet (14 by 12 by 7 meters) high, roughly the size of a two-story house. It now has the honor of being the third largest tsunami-swept rock in the world. And it’s the largest boulder known to have surfed a tsunami from a cliff. The team then used computer modeling to figure out roughly how tall the ancient tsunami that carriedMaka Lahimust have been. They concluded that the tsunami was, at minimum, 164 feet (50 meters) tall and would have taken about a minute and a half to pass. The tsunami likely reached speeds of over 70 miles per hour (113 kilometers per hour). It was huge and very powerful, and the researchers think a landslide, rather than an earthquake, initially triggered the wave. Something Weird Happened 15 Minutes Before the Giant Tonga Eruption of 2022 Tonga sees a lot of geologic activity that can trigger tsunamis, like thedevastating tsunami in 2022. Understanding more about the mechanics of past tsunamis can help researchers better prepare for future events, co-author Annie Lau, a coastal geomorphologist at the University of Queensland, said in a statement. âThe analysis strengthens our understanding of wave transportation of rocks to improve coastal-hazard assessments in tsunami-prone regions around the world,â Lau said.

    "title": "‘The Last of Us’ Is Afraid of Ambiguity",
    "article_text": "Whenever I reflect on the ending ofThe Last of UsÂwhen the game first released on the PlayStation 3 in 2013âlongbefore it and its sequel were remade to deathon every subsequent consoleâI’m reminded of thelate, great director David Lynch‘s enduring philosophy on ambiguity in art. Rather than explicitly guiding audiences toward specific interpretations of works likeInland Empire,ÂMulholland Drive, orTwin Peaks, Lynch emphasized the significance of how a viewer feels after experiencing his work. To him, the emotional resonance mattered more than providing a neatly packaged answer, trusting audiences to wrestle with the mystery independently rather than having their jaws massaged by its creator after being fed an explanation. At the end of the now 12-year-old game, I felt that Joel’s decision to kill the Fireflies was a selfish act, fueled by his deep love for Ellie, that ultimately condemned humanity to the relentless grip of the cordyceps outbreak.That sentiment was powerfully echoed inThe Last of Us Part II‘s reveal trailer, where Shawn James’ haunting song “Through the Valley” underscored the game’s themes of loss, survival, and moral ambiguity.Â  It’s a feeling that remained just as potent throughout HBO’s first season adaptation, reinforcing the weight of the enigma of Joel’s choice. Yet, as we march toward the finale of the second seasonâa seasonbreathlessly heralded as the first example of gaming as art, a claim I find both laughable and naive to the mediumâit becomes apparent that the show is wholly afraid of the ambiguity that gives art its emotional depth. Game director and series executive producer Neil Druckmann’s persistent efforts to clarify the moral complexities ofhis already messy creationincessantly do not enhance its impact; instead, they diminish the very intrigue that made it compelling in the first place. Inthe penultimate episodeofThe Last of Usseason two, Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Joel (Pedro Pascal) finally (kind of) confronted the truth behind Joel’s deception on the Fireflies’ search for a cure. It would’ve killed Ellie, so instead of letting that happen, he killed them first. Classic Joel. Gamers have long debated whether or not Ellie’s death would result in the world having a cure; the game itself played up the uncertainty of folks in the universe not knowing whether Ellie’s immunity could be copied and shared with the rest of the world. Druckmann appeared on theSacred Symbolspodcast (thanks, GamesRadar+!) and gave a definitive answer aboutÂ whether or not the Fireflies could have come up with a cure. “Could the Fireflies make a cure? Our intent was that, yes, they could,” Druckmann said. “Now, is our science a little shaky that now people are questioning it? Yeah, it was a little shaky and now people are questioning that. I can’t say anything. All I can say is that our intent is that they would have made a cure.” Druckmann’s remarkÂprovides a concrete answer in one stroke while framing Joel as an outright villain for the first time inÂThe Last Of Usseason two. It also undercuts the uncertainty that made it so compelling to begin with. What was once a morally complex mystery has now been neatly packaged into a definitive stance,robbing the show of the ambiguity that made it must-watch television to begin with. This is just one of many instances whereThe Last of Usspells things out rather than embraces ambiguity. As someone deeply captivated by the games, it has made the show an increasingly frustrating experience. AsThe Last Of Usseason two has chugged along, its intent on spelling out every layer of its narrative rather than trusting audiences to interpret its ambiguity for themselves has gone from a creative license to expand the series for television to an insult to viewers’ intelligence. Abby (Kaitlyn Dever)’s motivation for killing Joel, a revelation poignantly revealed at the midpoint ofThe Last of Us II, is laid out in explicit terms (with a baffling, immersion-breaking remark about Joel being “handsome”), removing the unsettling moral complexity that made her arc so challenging and compelling for players who initially objected to playing as her and learning her side of the story. Meanwhile, Joel’s portrayal in Jackson is steeped in reverent praise, with everyone talking up his selflessness, further diluting the thorny andâlet’s be honestâasshole ethics of his past decisions. Another key difference lies in the timing of Ellieâs realization. In HBOâs adaptation, she confirms her suspicions the night before Joelâs death, whereas in the game, Ellie has this revelatory conversation with Joel years before what would become the starting point of season two. The lie fractures their relationship, leading to a long period of no contactâmaking Ellieâs journey toward reconciliation with Joel all the more poignant. By contrast, HBO Ellie seems to rush through the emotional fallout, almost speedrunning her grief, whichâat least from Joelâs perspectiveâappears to be largely triggered by his mercy killing of Eugene, the late husband of Jackson’s resident therapist, Gail (Catherine OâHara), in the heat of their conversation instead of him lying about the Fireflies. Ultimately, HBO Ellie still arrives at the same conclusion as her game counterpart: that Joelâs deception was a betrayal. But in the game, this revelation lingers, festering in Ellieâs mind over years of unresolved tension and estrangement. The show, however, compresses this emotional arc, flattening the depth of Ellieâs internal struggle and making her grief feel more like a narrative obligation than a natural progression. One of the most frustrating additions is Gail, who, despite O’Hara’s knack for delivering every sardonic line with scene-stealing charisma, feels less like an organic part of the story and more like a narrative mouthpiece. Instead of allowing Joel and Ellie’s emotions to unfold solely through Ramsey and Pascal’s performancesâtheir mannerisms, silences, and unspoken tensionâto do the heavy lifting themselves, Gail spells everything out, stripping the story of its depth. By spoon-feeding audiences what should have been nuanced character moments, the show reinforces that it doesn’t trust viewers to interpret ambiguity on their own. In an apparent effort to overcorrect the discourse surrounding the game’s initial ambiguity, perhaps to shield Dever from the same kind of unjustifiableonline harassment and death threatsthat Abby’s voice actor, Laura Bailey, endured. Joel was never an angel, and by framing the story with a heavy-handed certainty instead of allowing its moral complexities to linger, the series ultimately sacrifices nuance that could have made for truly compelling television. Ellie, too, has lost the rough edges that made her such a compelling protagonist. Instead of the vengeful, emotionally volatile force she was inThe Last Of Us Part IIâone who tore through Seattle with reckless abandon and furyâshe’s become more of a blorbo-ified version of herself. Here, she’s less of aa driven antihero and more of a softened, almost passive figure in her own story, going on a U-Haul meet-cute road trip with Dina (Isabela Merced) that would feel more at home in a Disney sitcom than an HBO post-apocalyptic drama. Dina, in contrast, feels more locked into the mission, her weariness palpable as she trudges alongside Ellie, who despite being a jaded 19-year-old still acts like the careless child Joel met in the first season, more concerned with cracking jokes than smashing heads. This isn’t Ramsey’s fault, obviously, but more a case of the scriptwriting not wanting to paint Ellie as an asshole eitherâwhich she spends the majority of the game being. And then there’s Druckmann, who seems unable to let the story’s ambiguity speak for itself, retroactively massaging pivotal moments from the games in his recent HBO’sInside the Episodevignettes. If we’re being honest, these post-show segments aren’t offering the profound insights they’re striving for. They’re starting to resemble the hollow commentary of David Benioff and D.B. Weiss’Game of Thronesfinal-season breakdowns, where nuanced storytelling was replaced with forced justification. There’s a vast difference between ambiguity that invites an audience to bring their interpretations and convictions into a work, challenging them to engage with its themes, and ambiguity that crumbles under pressure and provides a definitive stance out of creative cowardice.The Last of Usincreasingly leans toward the latter, choosing to clarify, justify, and explain rather than simply present. In doing so, it has transformed something once fiercely compelling into a sanitized, overly explanatory version of itself. With two more seasons ahead to fully adapt the game, the show’s once-glowing prestige as compelling television risks losing its luster if it remains fixated on spoon-feeding audiences rather than allowing them space to wrestle with their own interpretations. By smoothing over the jagged and combative edges of its leads and laying bare all its intended truths instead of embracing ambiguity, HBO’sThe Last Of Usseason two has stopped being an adaptive creative work and has become derivative, eroding the ambiguity that once made it an impactful and thought-provoking experience to a milked out adaptation that is hellbent on doing the thinking and feeling for viewers.

    "title": "Treasury Department Places Final Order for New Pennies",
    "article_text": "After faithfully serving Americans since 1787, the penny is on its way to retirement. The United States Treasury announced it won’t place any more orders for penny blanks. That means once current supplies run out, new pennies will not be introduced into circulation. The Washington Postreportedthat the Treasury placed its final order for blanks this month with expectations that it will run out by early 2026. You can keep spending pennies as normal after that. But at some point, businesses will have to start rounding up or down to the nearest 5 cents for cash transactions. Why is the penny getting the axe? Well, according to theU.S. Mint’s 2024 annual report, pennies cost nearly 4 cents to produce and distribute. Part of this is due to rising material costs. Pennies are primarily made of zinc, and its priceper metric tonhas more than doubled since 2000. Over the years, penny production has decreased anyway. In 2024, the Mint only made 3.2 billion pennies, compared to about11 billion each yearin the 1990s. But last fiscal year, the Mint still lost $85.3 million on the pennies it produced. Per the Post, the agency estimated that it will save $56 million a year from reduced material costs. “Given the cost savings to the taxpayer, this is just another example of our administration cutting waste for the American taxpayer and making the government more efficient for the American people,” a Treasury spokespersontold Axiosin a statement. Talks about ditching the penny have been around for awhile. For example, former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lewrecommendedsuspending its production in 2016. Americans have alsogrown more favorable to the idea, potentially because the penny’s use in our daily lives has decreased. Per YouGov, about a third of Americans never spend pennies, with adults under 30 using them the least. Back in January,DOGE took aim at the penny, and, a month later,Trump followed up with a Truth Social rant about “wasteful” pennies, writing,Â “I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies. Let’s rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it’s a penny at a time.” To be fair to the penny, rising production costs have hit all coins. For example, a quartercost 25% more to make in 2024than the year before (compared to the penny’s 17% increase). And, like the penny, nickels are also more expensive to produce and distribute than they’re actually worth. Ditching one-cent pieces isn’t unheard of. New Zealand and Australiadiscontinuedtheirs in 1989 and 1992, respectively, and Canadastopped producing penniesin 2012. The U.S. has discontinued other coins before, with the most recent being the $20 golden Double Eagle coin. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "The Cute Mascot of Epic Universe Brings Vibes, but Not Much Else",
    "article_text": "Celestial Park may serve as the hub for Epic Universe, but it gives the lore of Epic Universe a charming personality of its own. While there’s no franchise crossover to be found here liketheotherzonesof the new park, it does have its own theme, inspired by fantastical astrological storytelling, that gives the star-adorned land “celestial decor from the ’90s” vibes in the best way. It’s as if Universal opened up its notebook and scribbled a tale to create a realm of fantasy delights and interstellar adventure, complete with new walk-around characters, to contain its gateway to all the portals to the park’s other lands. But even if there’s not much beyond that to the area, it does include the whimsical tale of a chocolate shop bear that stole our hearts. Captain Cacao is the lovable teddy bear companion to Maya of the Skies, a young adventurer who traverses the universe to find treats to share at Moonship Chocolates & Celestial Sweets, one of several stores throughout Celestial Park. Atop the shop you see the gorgeous artwork that brings you into the spacey comfort of the clouds and night skiesâthe same ones you can see riding Celestial Park’s main attraction,Constellation Carousel, a whimsical ride that really elevates the dreamlike atmosphere of the area’s constellation motif. But while the shop is filled with the usual theme park sweet treats, the thing you’ll want to walk away the most with is Captain Cacao himself in teddy bear form. I’d say he’s hand down the cutest of all theme park bears, with a spot over his eye in the shape of a star and his midnight blue coloring. But, bad news: even before the park’s official opening today, he’s already sold out. Or, at least he was during the media preview we attended, and during Universal’s own public preview days for Epic Universe. Poor Captain Cacao in his fluffy form was nowhere to be found, much likeHow to Train Your Dragon‘s hatchling eggs in Isle of Berkâthe cutest merch is already sold out, showing us what the clear favorites at the park are going to be. You could satisfy your Cacao craving with some other merchandise, like backpacks and other fashion accessories, but in teddy form you’re going to be out of luck. I hope this convinces Universal that there’s a desire for Celestial Park’s original theming compared to the brand-overload of Epic’s other areas though, and to put Cacao more at the forefront of this area instead of making him a shop mascot. We are in dire need of a Captain Cacao meet and greet, and hope he flies in on his moonship soon, or he could be added as a part ofStardust Racers, Celestial Park’s own high-thrills dual coaster (which, in one tiny acquiescence to licensing, is equipped with its own Flux capacitor as a nod toBack to the Future). For now, you can eat your feelings about missing out on the merch at Celestial Park’s various space-themed dining locations, particularly Pizza Moon, a 1900s space exploration-inspired cinema port of pizzas. Pizza is a solid theme park food staple, but this spot featuresA Trip to the Moon-style atmosphere in the most gorgeous way. I didn’t want to leave; I just wanted to eat the various moon pies all day, all of which had fun space theming, like the Space Cowboy (a spin on a BBQ pie) and the Pizzare Lunare (which featured a purple-colored crust, thanks to the addition of ube). All that’s missing is a Captain Cacao-themed kids menu! It’s clear from the interest even in the preview phase of Epic Universe that Captain Cacao is one of the park’s biggest and most surprising hits. It’s a shame that he’s not really at the heart of what Celestial Park has to offer to visitors who might want to see something new over the familiar brand haunts of the other areas of the park. Maybe that will change as Epic Universe grows and evolves in the coming months and years, but first: Universal needs to restock that bear soon.

    "article_text": "Moderna had designs on releasing a combined influenza and covid-19 vaccine after some promising trials, but this week the drugmaker said it would withdraw its application seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the time being,according to a report from Reutersâthe latest indication that Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The agency will require boosters to go through a randomized, controlled trial before getting approvalâa process that vaccine makerswarnedwould likely delay the availability of the shots well beyond the point in which they would be useful to address the currently circulating strain of covid-19 that they were designed to address. This new restriction has already had an impact. Novavax’s covid-19 vaccine shotreceived approval last week, more than a month later than the initial deadline for approval, but the FDA limited access to people over the age of 65 and people between the ages of 12 and 64 who have at least one underlying condition that puts them at risk of severe illness from a covid-19 infection. The agency is also requiring existing covid-19 vaccines tocarry an expanded warning labelabout the risk of myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart. This is a potential side effect of the vaccines, butmultiplestudieshave found that experiencing a covid-19 infection puts young people at substantially higher risk of experiencing myocarditis than getting the vaccine.

    "article_text": "It's real: Garland is writing and directing it, and George RR Martin is involved. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The rumors about anElden Ringmovie seemed too specific not to be true, and sure enough, Bandai Namcoconfirmed todaythat it's working with A24 on a live-action Elden Ring movie. The film will be written and directed by Alex Garland, best known for Civil War, Annihilation, and Ex Machina. He also wrote the screenplays for 28 Days Later and Dredd. George RR Martin, who had a hand in Elden Ring's lore, is on board as a producer. We firstheard about the project earlier in May, but the article revealing its existence was taken down and no official announcement was made until now. Elden Ring co-op spin-offElden Ring: Nightreignis on the verge of release—it'll be out on May 29. Meanwhile, Garland'slatest movieis Warfare, which he wrote and directed with former Navy SEAL Ray Mendoza. Reviews arelargely positive. So howdoyou make an Elden Ring movie? Hop into the comments if you have any good ideas. I suppose I'd go for something surreal and not super concerned with plot like David Lowery's The Green Knight, alsoan A24 film. I'm not sure that's how I'd expect Garland to approach it, though. He does, at least, know the games:in a Reddit AMAin April, Garland said he was on a NG+6 run of Shadow of the Erdtree. He also has experience writing for games, including 2010's Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and Ninja Theory's DmC: Devil May Cry.

    "title": "'We hear you': RoadCraft dev will address early negative feedback with hotfixes, free new vehicles, and a 'Hard Mode' with systems like fuel management",
    "article_text": "It's been a bit of a bumpy road for the new game from the SnowRunner dev. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The early reception forRoadCraft, the new driving sim from the developer of MudRunner and SnowRunner, was—like the washed-out roads of the game itself—a bit rocky. Day one \"Mixed\" reviews on Steam have improved the more players get their hands on it, and it's now sporting a 71% \"Mostly Positive\" score—but not everyone is loving it. A common complaint is that it's not as hardcore an experience as SnowRunner, which featured systems like fuel management and vehicle damage that made it something akin to a truck-based survival game. Others complain that some of RoadCraft's controls are unintuitive and a step down from earlier games. Saber Interactive has a message for unhappy players. \"We hear you.\" \"Since launch, we've been closely reading all your messages: suggestions, praise, bugs, and concerns alike,\" the developersaid on Steam, adding it is working on fixes for \"the most urgent feedback and improving the overall experience.\" Some of that feedback has already been addressed. \"We've also heard your thoughts on crane controls during the demo and, based on that feedback, alternative control options are now available, including a control scheme that’s a lot closer to SnowRunner's.\" Hotfixes are in the works to solve some reported issues with blurry or large textures, an issue apparently brought on by certain Nvidia drivers. \"Going back to driver version 576.28 and restarting your system should fix the issue\" in the meantime, Saber says. The developer also outlined some of its plans for the future. While noting that RoadCraft is a \"new experience, different from SnowRunner and Expeditions,\" a new \"hard mode\" is planned for players looking for a more challenging experience. \"It will be a new approach to the game, with for example, fuel management.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There will also be more trucks for players to drive: \"new rescue vehicles equipped with a winch will be added for free in the short future!\" Saber says, including the Mule T1 utility truck and the Nota Allegro utility transport. \"These vehicles are currently exclusive to AI convoys, but they’ll soon be yours to drive!\" There's no date announced for when we can expect these additions to RoadCraft: \"We’ll share more details about upcoming content soon, once a first patch has been deployed to cover your most urgent feedback.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s.

    "title": "Elden Ring Nightreign director says the game was built for squads of three and 'doesn't collapse if it's a solo player,' but admits that duos have gone 'kind of overlooked'",
    "article_text": "It might take two to tango, but ideally you're open to a third if someone brings up Elden Ring. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've never been a huge Souls guy, and I've found the most hair-tearing-out element ofFromSoftware's acclaimed series has always been the fussy, esoteric multiplayer. Things are definitely simpler in that regard in the hotly anticipatedElden Ringfollow-up Nightreign, but it comes with a catch. While it's the first game in FromSoft's catalog to emphasize seamless multiplayer as the focus, director Junya Ishizaki is careful to point out that it works best if you have exactly two friends to play with. In an interview withIGN, Ishizaki said: \"We are trying to cater to a fun experience with three people. So making sure the experience is fun at its core with a group of three, but it also doesn't collapse if it's a solo player as well … in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well.\" Of course, you can still play Nightreign with a single friend; it'll just matchmake you with a random solo player and send you on your way. Ishizaki noted a duos mode just wasn't a priority during development—and as you might expect, it has a lot to do with balance. Any given Dark Souls boss becomes a hell of a lot easier with the right co-op partner, but FromSoftware didn't want to lose that hard-fought sense of accomplishment that keeps people coming back to its singleplayer games. Ishizaki told IGN: \"For more solo play oriented games such as Elden Ring, of course we're taking a lot of things into account such as the stages, how the enemies are laid out and designed, the wide breadth of player builds and equipment as well … [The bosses] are supposed to be very imposing, and challenging, and fearsome when you face them.\" If you're worried this is all sounding pretty different from the Elden Ring you know, Ishizaki told IGN the game changes dynamically to account for solo players. That goes for both players who are off and isolated in a three-player session as well as for single players with no teammates at all: \"The activeness and aggressiveness of enemies towards any one single player has been adjusted so that you don't find yourself in any unreasonable multi-foe fights. And just generally, when you're playing singleplayer, the parameters adjust dynamically depending on the number of players in that session.\" It all provides a hint as to why a duos mode might take some extra consideration; it seems like a lot of work has gone into preserving the meticulous difficulty scaling of its solo-minded predecessors. Ishizaki said in the IGNinterviewthat players coming from Elden Ring and all the games before it may find Nightreign more familiar than they expect. \"We understand the concerns of those solo players, but essentially a lot of the time in Nightreign you will be acting and behaving on your own. Even in a group as three, you'll be going off and challenging different areas of the map and collecting different things before you accumulate together at the boss fight.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "After crashing out of early access, Super People is headed back to early access. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Rather like the Death of Superman, it appears that the death of Super People was not as permanent as it was presented. After being shuttered for good in mid-2023, the'PUBG with superpowers'battle royale has sprung back to life, and is planning to hold a closed beta test in June. Super People, developed by Korean studio Wonder People, first came on the scene in 2021 and made a splash with gameplay that seemed a little more grounded than, say, similarly hero-focused battle royale Apex Legends. It also borrowed a bit from MOBAs by enabling players to level up during their adventures with experience earned primarily through defeating enemies, encouraging aggressive action over run-and-hide tactics. Anappearance at the PC Gaming Showin 2022 announced a final beta set for August of that year, and an early access launch followed in October. In December 2022 the game was renamed to Super People 2 for some reason, but by May 2023 it was all over: Wonder People announced that Super People would beshut downon August 21, 2023. Well, that happens—it happens a lot, unfortunately. What doesn't happen so often is a comeback, and yet that's what we're looking at here. On May 2, a new Super People listingappeared on Steam, along with amessagefrom game director Hur Min saying the team is trying again. It's time to Back and shine Super Soldiers,Super People is officially BACK!https://t.co/2g60wXDc4TMay 2, 2025 The Super People comeback \"is not just a restoration\" of the old game, Min wrote, but rather \"our promise to confront the moments when we were at our best and to bring the excitement and emotion of those memories back to life.\" Which sounds pretty grandiose in the context of a videogame that flamed out pretty quickly, but the team seems serious: In asubsequent update, Min touched on Wonder People's priorities for the resurrected Super People, including efforts against cheaters, achieving better character and weapon balance, improving the sense of progression (and avoiding the frustration of sudden loss), and making the game more accessible to newcomers. The first look at how that work is coming next month: The firstSuper People closed beta testis set to begin at 3 pm PT/6 pm ET on June 18, and—barring catastrophe or changed minds—will run until June 26.

Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "The Codex Astartes does support this action. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After today's Warhammer Skulls Showcase and its deluge of announcements, it might be hard to remember a time whengreat Warhammer gamesweren't falling down upon us like so muchsteel rain. But I remember! In fact, I recall a time when things were so dire that the original Space Marine—a decent enough character action game with a plot so predictable you might confuse it for a sundial—felt like the second coming of the God Emperor himself. Well, get ready to experience asecondsecond coming of the God Emperor himself: it was announced at the Skulls event that Space Marine will be getting its very own gentle remaster treatment alongside the venerableDawn of War. The new Space Marine Master Crafted edition releases June 10, only a couple weeks away. The new version will brush up those decidedly 2011-looking textures and character models, offer newly remastered audio, and support 4K resolution. The trailer also teases improved UI and a modernised control scheme, but the brief snippet they showed doesn't give much to go on. I think that's a new radial weapon select wheel? Maybe the weirdest aspect of this remaster is that all the orks in the trailer are now seemingly Goffs, wearing black armor with iconic checker patterns on the shoulders. In the original Space Marine, they just wore generic leather armor as far as I remember. According toPCGamesN, developer SneakyBox noted that it's part of an effort to realign the game's portrayal of orks to be more canon-friendly—a mission that took a bunch of model tweaks and \"over 100 new voice lines.\" And that's… sort of it! It does come bundled with all the original game's DLC, but so does the anniversary edition from a few years back, and you can grab that now for10 bucks. I had a lot of fun with the game's sorta-kinda Gears of War-inspired multiplayer back in the day, so I'm happy to see it make some sort of return (with cross-play this time!). That said, whatever new audience this remaster is after, it'll inevitably have to compete with the bigger, bolder, more popularsequel.

    "article_text": "Everything you need to know about MindsEye including the release date, story and link to GTA. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's been almost 10 years since former Rockstar North president Leslie Benzies left the game studio, having worked on the Grand Theft Auto series from the revolutionary GTA 3 through to GTA 5. Somehow in that decade Rockstarstillhasn't finishedGTA 6, but Benzies' new studio, Build a Rocket Boy, is on the verge of releasing its first game,MindsEye. Hitman developer IO Interactive is publishing it as the debut game from its IOI Partners publishing label. With 'the Benz' having worked almost exclusively on genre-defining open world games (and, more importantly, Space Station Silicon Valley for the N64), MindsEye is facing some high expectations. But so far I'm digging its GTA-meets-Cyberpunk aesthetic, even if it does give off strong Michael Bay vibes with the copious explosions in every trailer. Barring any delays (y'know, like GTA),MindsEye is set to release on June 10, 2025 on both Steam and the Epic Games Store.It will also be available on Build a Rocket Boy'sEverywhereplatform (think Roblox, but less unhinged) when that eventually releases,according topublisher IOI Partners. The game will cost $60 / £55. MindEye is releasing in a one-size-fits-all state, so there are not three separate versions to buy with one giving you a week of early access or a unique hat or anything. How refreshing. So far we've had a few trailers for MindsEye showing off its blend of techno-conspiracy, lots and lots of explosions, and a heaping helping of dialogue vignettes. For gameplay footage, however, we're limited to a few short clips between somethird-person cover shootingthat looks a bit weightless, and this clip takes place in some real generic corridors. Thankfullythe other clipshows a gunfight in a trailer park area strewn with cover and crisscrossing paths through the mobile homes, which is a bit more promising. From the gameplay clips I've seen it doesn't look like you'll have the ability to deploy the likes of battle drones at will, leading me to believe the more fun bits of tech will be saved for setpiece moments. To be fair, three very short clips is hardly enough to get a full grasp on things—but I can't say I'm expecting the shooting to be too revolutionary. And, of course, there's somedriving around the town of Redrock. Surprisingly, this looks more like Cyberpunk 2077 to me than any GTA. Until I get my hands on it I'm not really sure how the driving physics will feel, but it looks like you can pull off some tight drifts, so put me on the side of optimistic. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. MindsEye puts you in the shoes of Jacob Diaz, a former soldier voiced by Mafia 3 star Alex Hernandez. Diaz is fitted with a neural implant known as \"The MindsEye,\" which \"haunts him with fragmented memories of a covert mission that changed his life forever.\" During the campaign, Diaz will be aiming to discover the truth behind the implant while dealing with the classic futuristic baddies—corporations and AI. …which isn't so futuristic, now that I'm thinking about it. MindsEye blends third-person shooting with GTA-esque driving in what the team describes as \"a fake open world\" akin to the likes of Mafia or LA Noire. We haven't actually seen too much in terms of raw gameplay, but the trailers for the game seem to also imply we will have access to some high-tech gadgets like drones. Oh, and there are alotof explosions. I know I've said that already, but it's seriously bordering on a comedic amount (although these could just be to make the trailer more flashy since, again, we haven't seen much actual gameplay). One of the big features of MindsEye is that it will be part of Build a Rocket Boy's Everywhere platform down the line. What this means is that players will be able to theoretically remix parts of MindsEye to create unique experiences or pull assets out of it for their own custom game. MindsEye is built to be a \"cinematic story-focused game\" with an estimated 15-hour campaign. The game itself is singleplayer only, but with the integration into Everywhere down the line, there's a chance someone could adapt elements of it into a multiplayer game. That's assuming Everywhere is completed and becomes a successful community development platform—a big \"if.\" Sort of! But in a fun way? At the very least it looks like a game Jimmy De Santa would play on his fake Xbox in GTA 5 when he stops playing the Call Of Duty-inspired Righteous Slaughter. MindsEye's recommended specs are available on the game'sSteam store page. The recommended setup says you'll want an Nvidia RTX 4070 and an Intel i7-13700K, so expect it to be a pretty beefy game. Not only does it look very high fidelity, but as i mentioned, a whole lotta explosions in there.

    "title": "Google CEO pitches dystopia where no one communicates with their friends anymore because AI's writing our emails, claims this makes you 'a better friend'",
    "article_text": "AI is also behind \"a total reimagining of search.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. CEO of Alphabet and Google Sundar Pichai gave the opening address at the 17th annual Google I/O developer conference this Tuesday, and used the opportunity to get all starry-eyed, and slightly dystopian, about the future of AI. \"We are shipping faster than ever,\" said Pichai (thanks, TheRegister). \"We have announced over a dozen models and research breakthroughs and released over 20 major AI products and features, all since the last I/O… today, Gemini 2.5 Pro sweeps the LLMArena leaderboard in all categories.\" Gemini is now so core to Google's business that it's replacing traditional search. If you use any of Google's suite of products you'll have noticed the inexorable push of Gemini features into everything. It feels a bit like a very needy child (or the spawn of a tech company desperate to goose the \"engagement\" numbers). Pichai went on to talk about some genuinely impressive use cases for AI integration, with its Project Starline technology being used to offer bi-directional language translation voiced by AI-generated speech in real time. English and Spanish translation is now available for Meet subscribers, with support for more languages rolling out over the coming months. Then we get to a more questionable use case, which is all about further personalising AI. \"We are working to bring this to life with something we call Personal Context,\" said Pichai. \"With your permission, Gemini models can use relevant context across your Google Apps, in a way that is private, transparent and fully under your control.\" The initial manifestations of this idea are the little automated replies that Google offers up across services such as Gmail. Google calls these Personalized Smart Replies, and is aiming to make them much more detailed and capable of replacing actual human-to-human communication. \"Let's say my friend wrote to me looking for advice,\" said Pichai. \"He's taking a road trip to Utah and he remembers I did this trip before. Now if I'm being honest, I'd probably reply with something short and unhelpful. Sorry, Felix. But with Personalized Smart Replies, I can be a better friend. That's because Gemini can do almost all the work for me, looking up my notes in Drive, scanning past emails for reservations, finding my itinerary in Google Docs: trip to Zion National Park. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Gemini matches my typical greetings from past emails, captures my tone, style, and favorite word choices, and then it automatically generates a reply.\" I'm not disputing that automated replies can be useful in certain contexts such as basic business communication. But even as someone who is generally terrible at replying to people I cannot imagine just giving up on that side of my personal life and leaving it to AI. I don't really think you're someone's friend, at that point. I mean, where does this end up? We'll have AI managing all of our relationships and communication, and AIs replying to AIs, which just seems like Google is actually devaluing human communication rather than enabling it. I don't want to delegate my social life and relationships to an algorithm: maybe the Luddites had a point. The Personal Context feature will roll out for Gmail subscribers this summer. Equally troubling, in a different and perhaps larger way, is Google's new \"AI Mode\" in Google Search. This has launched, initially as a setting in Google Labs, and Google is being coy about the potential impact on every single online company that depends on Google for traffic referrals. \"For those who want an end-to-end AI search experience we are introducing an all- new AI mode,\" said Pichai. \"It's a total reimagining of search.\" AI mode will begin as a new tab in the Search window, integrating with Gemini 2.5 and Personal Context (once launched).

    "title": "This 'stealthvania' is like if Prince of Persia never gave up on 2D and narrated your every move",
    "article_text": "The Siege and the Sandfox wants you to feel every roll, dodge, and dive. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm a sucker for both retro side scrollers and stealth games, but since we've yet to get Mark of the Ninja 2 or some sort of Splinter Cell demake, I've rarely enjoyed the styles simultaneously. Thinking on it, though, they're a natural fit for one another—after all, premiere blockbuster sneak 'em up Assassin's Creed has a platforming titan lurking in its DNA: Prince of Persia, of which the original AC was nearly a spinoff. Enter 'stealthvania' The Siege and the Sandfox, whichreleased on Steamthis week. My immediate reaction when I started playing The Siege and the Sandfox was \"this is like Metroid by way of Assassin's Creed,\" and I was both delighted and gobsmacked that I hadn't played much like it. Where The Siege and the Sandfox differs from other stealth platformers is in that metroidvania layout. The pace is explorative and free, but you'll run into plenty of locked doors and obstacles that can only be overcome with the right upgrade. Instead of rockets and suit forms, though, you get thieves' tools: boots that let you run up walls, a blackjack for knocking out guards, and so on. The Sandfox is no fighter, so it's best you stay in the shadows, slowly skulk around to keep your footfalls quiet, and put out torches to quash enemies' fields of vision. It's all familiar once you're past the novelty of the genre mashup, but it's beautifully realized and surprisingly immersive. The pixel art is gorgeous, ranging from opulent desert castles to dank caverns in the bit that I've played, and the game is committed to punctuating your every action. Hide in the environment and a narrator will chime in that the Sandfox dove out of sight. In a more relaxed platforming section, the narrator might point out that his skills are rusty, but improving. In more intense moments, it might come with a musical sting or foreboding ambience. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. On top of that, the game's movement is weightier and more deliberate than the average air-dashing, double-jumping metroidvania. You are nimble—you can roll into a long jump, shimmy up pillars, scale walls, and so on—but it's more reminiscent of a modern parkour system than anything you'd find on the NES. The Sandfox lands with a consequential thud, and he needs to clamber up a ledge when he barely makes a jump. I can't say how the stealth set pieces themselves will pan out later in the game, but first impressions leave me refreshed. I like the high-octane antics of Blasphemous and Bloodstained just fine, but it's nice to embrace the methodical for a bit and wonder if all those scary guys with weapons down that hallway might actually hurt me. The Siege and the Sandfox is available onSteam, where it's garnered a small pool of \"Mostly Positive\" reviews. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Justin first became enamored with PC gaming when World of Warcraft and Neverwinter Nights 2 rewired his brain as a wide-eyed kid.

    "title": "'It's the definition of insanity here': The Battlefield subreddit's good vibes nosedive into outrage after DICE announces there'll be no class weapon restrictions in Battlefield 6",
    "article_text": "Well, that didn't take long. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Yesterday, things over on the Battlefield subreddit looked downright idyllic—or at least as idyllic as something can look when it's packed full of footage of tanks toppling buildings and helicopters getting shot out of the sky. Thanks to atidal wave of leaked Battlefield 6 footage, players were sharing their excitement about the series seemingly returning to its roots. Long-suffering Battlefield diehards were, at long last, willing to hope again. But then DICE announced how class weapons are going to work, and now everything is awful again. In anX articlepublished yesterday by the official Battlefield account, DICE explained that the next Battlefield entry would abandon the specialists of 2042 and return fully to its traditional multiplayer classes. But there's a catch: While class choice will determine signature gadgets, passive traits, and default weapon attachment packages, DICE said that all weapon types will be available to all classes. Each class will get a bonus when using its signature weapon type—a Recon player will be able to hold their breath for longer while aiming down a sniper scope, for example—but otherwise, it's a free for all. Engineers with sniper rifles. Ghillie-suited Recon troops with LMGs. \"We envision the future of Battlefield classes to be a series of interconnected systems and fundamentals that shape your role on the field, while granting you the freedom to customize how you execute that role,\" DICE said. For many Battlefield fundamentalists, however, this news was equivalent to a national tragedy. Sentiment on the Battlefield subreddit immediately soured. Scrolling down the front page, you'll find dozens of threads posted by players accusing DICE of dismantling class identity, ignoring the playerbase, and generally disrespecting Battlefield's history. The atmosphere is one of a community experiencing a generational insult, a collective grieving process, and a communal swearing of vengeful oaths all at once. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. One playercalled the news\"disgusting,\" asking \"why they keep on ruining eveything[sic]on purpose???\" Anotherinsiststhat, because \"mistakes to the scale of Battlefield 2042 cannot repeat itself EVER,\" it's the subreddit's \"duty as a community to supervise their work on the new game.\" Elsewhere, serving as thecrowning screed in this maelstrom of angst, is a self-described \"unhinged rant,\" penned by a luminary who asserts that Battlefield players \"are not MLG quickscoper montage 420 intervention mom get the camera kids who you can finesse Dad''s credit card out of. We have our own credit cards and we are not going to buy your dogshit fucking game if you take it down the same path as 2042.\" By continuing the unrestricted weapon anarchy of Battlefield 2042, the writer says, \"it's the definition of insanity here.\" Full disclosure here: I prefer class weapon restrictions in Battlefield myself. I think the game is more interesting, as most games tend to be, when the player doesn't have complete freedom. Constraints lead players to make decisions and compromises, giving their choices more significance. The more a class determines how I'll play, the more I care about which class I choose. It is worth remembering, though, that the last decade of Battlefields have hadsomeclass-agnostic guns, and the current Battlefield Labs playtests are, after all, alpha playtests. Whatever Battlefield 6 will be called when it arrives, it's fair to say it's a long way off, and DICE has a history of being willing to make substantial class system reworks, like it did for Battlefield 2042 after launch. So while I might agree with the incensed masses in principle, I can't look at the subreddit withouta certain Clickhole headlinecoming to mind. If I'm saluting anyone, it's the single, brave soul whoposted a threadtitled \"Please calm down.\" Lincoln has been writing about games for 11 years—unless you include the essays about procedural storytelling in Dwarf Fortress he convinced his college professors to accept.

    "title": "GeoGuessr withdraws from Esports World Cup following furious blowback from the community over Saudi Arabia's human rights record",
    "article_text": "The move comes one day after multiple GeoGuessr mapmakers rendered their work unplayable in protest of the game's participation in the EWC. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In response to a massive blowback from its player base, geographical puzzle game GeoGuessr has announced its withdrawal from the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. GeoGuessr announced itsplanned participation in the Esports World Cupearlier in May, describing it as \"a massive step\" for the game. But the immediate reaction was almost exclusively negative, due to Saudi Arabia's abysmal human rights record. As one user onXput it, \"Marketing your world championship as diverse and inclusive but then deciding to make a wildcard [tournament] in Riyadh out of all places is such an unbelievably stupid decision.\" Less than a week after GeoGuessr's EWC announcement, the makers of many of the game's most popular maps (GeoGuessr allows community members to contribute lists of locations that anyone can play) issued astatement\"in solidarity with those currently residing in Saudi Arabia while being subject to oppression, as well as members of the community who would feel and be unsafe attending the tournament in Riyadh.\" They also took more concrete action by rendering their maps unplayable. \"The EWC is a sportswashing tool used by the government of Saudi Arabia to distract from and conceal its horrific human rights record,\" the group of mapmakers said. \"Groups targeted by the government include women, LGBTQ people, apostates and atheists, political dissenters, migrant workers in the Kafala system, religious minorities, and many others. \"The subjugation of these groups is extensive and pervasive. Members of these groups are routinely subjected to discrimination, imprisonment, torture, and even public executions. These severe human rights violations are well-documented and indisputable.\" The mapmakers said they would maintain their blackout \"until we see action from GeoGuessr,\" specifically the cancellation of its EWC participation and a promise that no other events will be hosted in Saudi Arabia. One day later, they got what they wanted, as GeoGuessr said today that it's pulled out. \"I’ve seen your reactions over the past few days regarding our decision to participate in the Esports World Cup in Riyadh,\" GeoGuessr CEO Daniel Antell wrote. \"When we made that decision, it was with positive intentions. To engage with our community in the Middle East and to spread GeoGuessr’s core mission of letting everyone Explore the World. Since Erland, Anton, and I founded GeoGuessr in 2013, we’ve always strived to be a community-first game. Everyone here at the Stockholm office is a passionate GeoGuessr fan, doing our best to build something meaningful, with you and for you. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"That said, you—our community—have made it clear that this decision does not align [with] what GeoGuessr stands for. So, when you tell us we’ve got it wrong we take it seriously. That’s why we’ve made the decision to withdraw from participating in the Esports World Cup in Riyadh.\" The sudden change in direction is a major move for GeoGuessr. Saudi Arabia has been sinking billions of dollars into videogames and esports in what is widely perceived as an effort to clean up its public image—\"esportswashing\" is a term sometimes used to describe it—and there is a lot of money on the table at the EWC, which boastsmulti-million-dollar prize poolsacross games including Dota 2, Valorant, Apex Legends, League of Legends, StarCraft 2, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege X, Overwatch 2, and numerous others. Evenchessis getting in on the action. The reaction to the withdrawal is pretty much universally positive: While some question GeoGuessr's \"positive intentions\"—it's not as though Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses are a big secret, after all—the overall feeling is that the community came together, the game makers listened and responded in a timely fashion, and it's a win all around: \"A 5K,\" as some put it, a reference to a perfect score in GeoGuessr. With the EWC tournament scrapped, GeoGuessr said updated information on how wildcards for the upcoming World Finals will be shared soon. The GeoGuessr community, including mapmakers who blacked out their work yesterday, have also announced a new, crowdfundedRainbow Classic Tournament, \"to empower women and LGBT+ members of our community,\" that's set to run at the same time as the now-cancelled EWC tourney.

    "title": "It's a day ending in 'y' so you know what that means: Embracer Group is doing more restructuring",
    "article_text": "It's amazing this lot ever get around to releasing games. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Embracer Group is undergoing yet another restructuring of its gigantic operations, this time announcing plans to spin-off the Coffee Stain part of the business as well as renaming the Lord of the Rings portion. In 2024, Embracer announced it would split into three distinct companies across games. Asmodee handled tabletop and physical games; Coffee Stain managed indies and free-to-play titles; Middle-Earth & Friends took charge of the Lord of the Rings and other major licenses. Now, Coffee Stain will become \"a standalone group of community-driven game developers and publishers by the end of calendar year 2025.\" It's slightly unclear how this differs from last year's restructuring, but Coffee Stain manages somewhere in the region of 250 game developers and publishers worldwide, including the likes of Ghost Ship Games (Deep Rock Galactic) and Tuxedo Labs (Teardown). \"We're really proud of everything we've built as part of Embracer,\" says Coffee Stain CEO Anton Westbergh. \"The games industry is more competitive than ever, but also more rewarding if you do things right, and we believe this move gives us the clarity and control to navigate the landscape better on our own terms.\" \"Coffee Stain Group has incredible talent, IPs and communities,\" says Group CEO of Embracer Lars Wingefors. \"To date, it has been a true recipe for success. I am confident in Anton's strategy and leadership and see a clear long-term opportunity in attracting and enabling partnerships with like-minded independent game developers and talents.\" As for the Middle-Earth & Friends side, not much is changing apart from the name. It'll now be known as Fellowship Entertainment, which I have to admit is a lot better, and \"the strategy is to transform into one powerhouse group with game development and publishing at its core.\" The press releasealso gives an idea of the dizzying scale Embracer is operating at. Fellowship Entertainment will have \"approximately 6,000 employees across more than 30 countries\" and will manage the commercial rights to J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Fellowship Entertainment consists of more than 40 studios like 4A Games, Aspyr Media, Crystal Dynamics, Dark Horse, Eidos-Montréal, Limited Run Games, Middle-earth Enterprises, Milestone, PLAION, Tarsier Studios, and THQ Nordic. It also controls more than 300 other properties including the likes of Kingdom Come Deliverance, Metro, Dead Island, Killing Floor, Darksiders, Remnant and Tomb Raider. Whatever else is going on in the name of restructuring, however, one figure remains at the core of all these companies. A note at the bottom of the press release says \"the largest shareholder, Lars Wingefors AB, will, in connection with the name change to Fellowship Entertainment, establish a privately held holding company\" named Embracer AB. It will have shares in Asmodee Group, Coffee Stain Group and Fellowship Entertainment, as well as \"potentially other companies.\" Embracer's role within the industry over recent years was described ina GDC survey in 2024as \"buying up large swaths of an industry\" and \"creating redundancies and placing innovative, more 'exploratory' studios in a position where they’ll never be seen as profitable enough for shareholders.\" In an industry where layoffs and studio closures are sadly commonplace,Embracer has been responsible for a significant chunk. \"As a leader and an owner, sometimes you need to take the blame and you need to be humble about if you've made mistakes and if you could have done something differently,\"said Wingefors in 2024, adding he's \"sure I deserve a lot of criticism.\" But you know what really matters? \"I still feel I have the trust from many or all of my key entrepreneurs and CEOs that have joined the group,\" said Wingefors. \"It's been difficult, but I think they all believed in the mission of Embracer.\" Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "title": "Epic CEO Tim Sweeney takes his victory lap as Fortnite returns to the app store after nearly 5 years: 'Thanks to all of the folks who initially sided with Apple then later came around to the winning side'",
    "article_text": "\"A clear win for Epic Games.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After a protracted legal battle, which is far from over, Apple has restored Fortnite to the US app store. Fortnite was removed in August 2020 after launching its own in-app monetisation system to bypass Apple's in-app payment system and the 30% commission it charges. This violated Apple's terms, and led to a legal challenge from Epic Games, which accused Apple of operating the app store as a monopoly. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney was in an unsurprisingly ebullient mood at the news and thanked those who'd taken Epic's side in the dispute which, as ever, he characterises as a fight for developer rights. \"Thanks to everyone who supported the effort to open up mobile competition and #FreeFortnite from the very beginning,\"said Sweeney. \"And thanks to all of the folks who initially sided with Apple then later came around to the winning side, supporting app developer rights and consumer rights.\" Apple has made no comment. \"This is a clear win for Epic Games,\" games business professor Joost van Dreunentold the BBC. \"Epic has effectively forced open a door that Apple and others worked very hard to keep shut. \"The industry has long tiptoed around platform gatekeeping, but this moment signals a shift in the balance. Creators and publishers will now have more leverage to challenge entrenched distribution models.\" Fortnite has been available on iOS inthe EU since January. Apple is complying with the court order after it got absolutely slammed by judge Yvonne Rogers Gonzalez for an \"obvious cover-up\" in a ruling that left no room for doubt: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition.\" That doesn't mean this is the end: Apple is fiercely protective of its walled garden approach to the app store, which it argues is in consumers' best interests, and of course has the money to fight this until the bitter end. And Epic Games may well be the David to Apple's Goliath, but it happens to be an extremely deep-pocketed David with a pugnacious CEO that's treating this fight like a holy calling. \"Apple lost the 2021 injunction appeal in 2024, and it's final and unappealable,\"says Sweeney. \"Now there's a new contempt of court decision, and Apple is seeking to stay and appeal it, but whatever happens, they're still obliged to comply with the injunction and the law.\" Sweeney also put things in more Fortnite-y terms: \"we back fam.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "title": "The next Warhammer 40K RPG from Rogue Trader's devs sounds killer: An Imperial inquisitor detective RPG where you can intimidate your enemies until they're 'scared as f**k' and surrender",
    "article_text": "Sounds rad, I'm in. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ahead of its reveal at today's Warhammer Skulls event, I got to speak to Owlcat producer Anatoly Shestov aboutWarhammer 40K: Dark Heresy, the studio's next big CRPG to follow up the breakoutRogue Trader. Here are my big takeaways from the conversation: \"You will be actually gaining clues, you will be analyzing them,\" said Shestov. \"You will be making deductions. Do you knowthis meme of the crazy person with all the ties? That's basically what we are doing.\" I'm a real sicko for detective stuff, so I had to ask how Shestov thought Dark Heresy slotted in with examples like Disco Elysium or Alan Wake 2. It actually sounds like this brutal dark future RPG is taking a page from Obsidian's historical, pastoral murder mystery Pentiment: There won't be any \"right\" answers. \"Because this is an Inquisition game, you won't ever know,\" said Shestov. \"You can just name any person… and there will be dire consequences.\" The game will continue proceeding as normal, but there will be multiple factions with and without the Inquisition to account for when you declare someone a heretic. \"One of the worst experiences in detective games is when you go 'I will just click all the things, I don't see the logic behind these,'\" Shestov explained as part of the reason behind this structure for Dark Heresy's investigations. \"We don't want to show if you made the right choice or not, because we want you to blame innocent people. Because it's Inquisition.\" You can blame a complete innocent if you want and they'll be terminated with no repercussions for your cruelty—but there will be \"some reactions in the world\" as a result of your judgments. This sounds like Dark Heresy's answer to the \"game within a game\" elements from previous Owlcat RPGs, like the Might and Magic army battles in Wrath of the Righteous. In Dark Heresy, though, the investigations have the potential to be more closely tied to the core roleplaying gameplay, rather than siloed off as their own \"thing.\" This ties into one of Shestov's big ambitions for Dark Heresy: That it be a more cohesive, less scattered game than Owlcat's previous, eccentric RPGs. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Even with the new investigative gameplay, the core of Dark Heresy still sounds like the tactical, turn-based combat Owlcat has become known for. Shestov said that the hallmarks are still here: Romanceable companions, flexible character building, and challenging, puzzle box fights. Here are the big changes Shestov outlined coming from Rogue Trader: \"Any unit can lose their grip in combat, start to panic, even shooting their own [teammates] or fleeing from combat,\" Shestov said. \"We decided that when you're playing as Inquisitor, you need to frighten your opponent. So you've got an option to not just kill everyone or talk. \"You can just make them scared as fuck, and you can make them surrender to you. One of the ways to complete the fight is for enemies to surrender, and this morale is a separate entity. Lots of abilities work with [the morale system].\" One of the great joys in Kingmaker, WotR, and Rogue Trader is Owlcat's permissiveness with off-the-wall character builds. I always fancied being a dual throwing axe Orc machine gun turret in the Pathfinder games, but I hear mounted combat is what's really OP, and I'm looking forward to trying out this dual wielding pyromaniac Fighter/Mage build fromCRPG Broin Rogue Trader. That tradition sounds like it will remain beautifully intact in Dark Heresy, with morale/intimidation included as yet another tool for buildcrafting sickos to play around with. \"You will be able to use the whole morale system to win, instead of damage,\" said Shestov. \"Vice versa, you will be able to play as a support character or buffer, not in terms of boosting the defense or offense capabilities, but by boosting the morale capabilities. It's one of the cornerstone elements of the whole battle system for the new game.\" These all sound like killer RPG experiments that I want to be a part of, and bundling them with further technical and graphical advancements on top of Rogue Trader could be a real winner. My biggest concern will be polish: Owlcat's games have taken a beating from us review score-wise⁠—69%, 76%, and 59% forKingmaker,WotR, andRogue Traderrespectively⁠—due to their prodigious bugs and lack of polish on launch. I love these games, but I don't think I've played one less than a year out from release. Not only does Owlcat do a ton of patching, it also supports its games with oodles of substantial DLC: Last year, Wrath of the Righteous got amassive epilogue expansioncapping off three years of DLC, and Rogue Trader's second story DLC was also shown off at today's Skulls event. Here's hoping we get the best of both worlds with Dark Heresy: All that sweet follow-through, but they manage to stick the landing first.

    "title": "Dawn of War, the undisputed king of Warhammer 40k RTS games, is getting a remaster, but Relic isn't changing too much: 'We don't want to fix something that isn't broken'",
    "article_text": "And it won't break your mods. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is one of the GOATs, and in many ways represents one of the last hurrahs for the traditional base-building RTS. See, in the early '00s, the once glorious RTS genre was starting to show signs of wear and tear as it tried to adapt to a changing videogame landscape. The shift away from the 2D RTS romps typified by the likes of C&C, Warcraft and Age of Empires was a rough one, and the era became littered with failed attempts to make a 3D hit. Dawn of War developer Relic, though, had everything under control. Five years before Dawn of War, Relic had already stunned us with one of the few truly 3D RTS games:Homeworld. It was a revolutionary space strategy game where you had ships that could enjoy full 3D movement, paired with an exceptional story and stellar soundtrack. In comparison, Dawn of War was a simpler affair—a more traditional RTS. But it still boasted plenty of novel touches: 3D terrain and units, cover mechanics, squad-based combat, and so much Warhammer 40k brutality. And more importantly, it was simply great. Kinetic, violent, smart, and full of orks waiting to be slaughtered by the truckload. Dawn of War spawned two sequels, one of which is still highly regarded (albeit very different), but the original remains one of Relic's greatest games, up there with Homeworld and Company of Heroes. And now, praise the Emperor, it's time for a comeback in the shape of an HD remaster. \"Relic has gone through a bit of a rigmarole over the last few years,\" says design director Philippe Boulle. \"We came out from under the Sega umbrella, and we were sort of reconnecting with Games Workshop, and we sort of effectively at the same time said, 'Hey, you know what would be cool?' Because the original Dawn of War really stands up as a classic, both of RTS and as a Warhammer game.\" There's also the fact that 40k is as massive as it's ever been, and Dawn of War is still held up as one of the best videogame adaptations. It's got a lot of fans, it's still in ourbest strategy gameslist, and after the reception to Dawn of War 3 put the series in the freezer, there's not really an alternative. People still hunger for their Dawn of War. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"But if you go back and try and play it,\" says Boulle, \"the gameplay holds up really well, but there's four different executables, and the first two only play in 4:3, and the other two play in widescreen, but sort of by stretching 4:3. \"And there's a few hoops you have to jump through. You're agreeing toGamespyterms, and there's a bunch of weirdness there in order to actually play it on modern hardware. And so we thought, yeah, this is the time when we can bring it onto modern hardware, make it easier for people to play while still maintaining these 20 years of mods and really that classic experience.\" Boulle's mention of \"that classic experience\" is really important. The line between remaster and remake are increasingly blurry, but Dawn of War: Definitive Edition is going to be a light touch. Relic is getting it up and running on modern hardware, supporting modern widescreen monitors, and cutting out some faff. There are extra touches here and there, but the goal has been to keep it as similar as possible to the original. \"We don't want to fix something that isn't broken,\" Boulle adds. \"The fundamental game still works. That's what we want to deliver.\" Here's what is changing: So this is still the same game as it was 20 years ago, but it'll work better on your modern PC and look a wee bit nicer to boot. One of the reasons for this light touch was Relic's determination to preserve mods. \"That was one of our very first goals: to make sure mods for the original game still worked with the Definitive Edition,\" says Boulle. \"There'll be one or two things that people installing mods will need to do a little differently, mostly just instead of installing in this directory, installing that directory, but we'll sort of have materials to walk people through that. \"We're testing with the major mods, we're interfacing with mod makers, and we really want, on day one, for you to load all these different mods onto your machine and actually make it a little smoother to choose the mods that are playing on your machine.\" Obviously 40k itself has dramatically changed over the last 20 years. We're now in 10th Edition, and we've got things like giant Primaris space marines, and lots of the factions have different names. The Imperial Guard is now the Astra Militarum. The Eldar are now the Aeldari. But Dawn of War is a \"snapshot\" of Warhammer 40k at a specific time. It's 4th Edition. And that's also been preserved. As much as I'm sure I'd dig a reimagined Dawn of War, the classic game is just so damn good that I ain't complaining. If I can play one of my favourite RTS games in 4K with updated textures and no faffing around, I'm absolutely in. Dawn of War: Definitive Edition is due out this year. And if this trip down memory lane has given you a craving to read more about the genre's past,I've got you covered. Fraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person.

    "title": "A 'gruesome' free Warhammer 40,000 typing game on Steam heralds the announcement of Boltgun 2, coming in 2026",
    "article_text": "It's a big day for Boltgun fans. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I likedWarhammer 40,000: Boltgunquite a bit. I'm not a huge Warhammer guy, but a straight-up boomer shooter I can quickly jump in and out of for a few minutes of blood and guts when the urge strikes? That's my jam. So I think it's very good news that more is on the way: During today's Warhammer Skulls Showcase, Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 was officially announced and set for launch in 2026. Boltgun 2 looks and sounds a lot like 'Boltgun Too,' which to be clear I don't see as a bad thing. Legendary space marine Malum Caedo is back in action with \"even deadlier abilities,\" doing what he does to the enemies of the Emperor including returning \"fan favorites\" like the Nurglings and Chaos Cultists, as well as newcomers likeBloodlettersandJuggernauts. Caedo's big adventure will take him to a range of new worlds and biomes, and yes, there will be new weapons with which to—and I quote—\"eviscerate hordes of relentless heretical scum.\" It's not the most detailed announcement ever, but on the other hand I'm not sure how much more there is to say about it:It's Boltgun, baby! But it's not the only Boltgun news of the day: Developer Auroch Digital has also unleashed an all-new addition to the series today called Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun—Words of Vengeance, and it is, I kid you not, \"a gruesome typing game.\" In this first person typer, your words are weapons—literally! Unleash the might of your WPM (words-per-minute) in this free-to-play twist on Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun! Put your typing skills to the test by quickly typing out randomised words and phrases from Warhammer 40,000 lore to end the lives of your foes. Typing may not be quite the same level of ultra-violent thrill as driving a chainsword through somebody's face, but Words of Vengeance is free and you canplay it right now on Steam, both of which are big plusses. If you'd rather partake in a more conventionally powered purge of the Emperor's enemies, Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is currently half price—that's $15—on theEpic Games Store. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "City Tales: Medieval Era is in early access but already has some refreshing differences from other builders. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's a familiar start toCity Tales: Medieval Era, a new city builder that launched on Steam today. You've got a few citizens that need housing and food and work, so you place a wood cutter's camp near the trees, a gathering station near a berry patch, and a hunter's cabin in the woods: stuff any city builder player has done plenty of times before. But there are also some interesting twists on the city building formula. You don't build homes for your citizens, you draw districts. Click on the map to create borders around the district, and your citizens will handle the rest: dividing up the district into plots and deciding where their houses go themselves. You can add other buildings to a district: a well, a market, a weaver's shop, a lumber mill, but again, you don't choose their precise location. Your wee little villagers handle that. I like that approach. There's something to be said for city builders where you're 100% in charge and decide where every last structure is placed, but I also enjoy giving my citizens a bit of agency. It also tends to make a city feel like it's growing organically. Something else fun in City Tales: Medieval Era is the six named companions (you can choose their names if you wish) that you begin the game with. When you build a production quarry like a sawmill or a rock quarry, you assign one of these companions to run it. While they work and generate resources, they'll level up, getting better at their jobs. If you're thinking, \"Wait, I'm going to have way more than six production buildings, won't I run out of available companions?\" Don't worry, because your companions are awesome. While they're working and leveling up, they're also training apprentices to take over for them. Once an apprentice is ready, you can assign your companion to another building, or keep them where they are to continue leveling up that skill until they're a specialist. Companions will even request certain jobs, from time to time. Judith, who I had working away making planks in my lumber mill, approached me to ask if she could work on the cattle farm I was planning to build. She'd prefer if it were a sheep farm, which made sense—Judith's bio mentioned that she had a loyal sheep dog—but at the very least it sounded like she was more interested in farming than churning out planks all day. This is a really nice touch: instead of parking randomized faceless NPCs into production buildings and forgetting about them for the rest of the game, it feels more like you have real people working to make your town successful, improving their skills, training other citizens, and even asking you for a choice of the jobs they do. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I'm not too far along in my own town yet, but I'm enjoying the organic approach to building and seeing my little companions grow their skills in City Tales: Medieval Era.

    "article_text": "Even the minimum requirements feel quite high. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Despite the game launching on June 10, in just a few weeks, we have only just received theMindsEyesystem requirements. Designed with developer Build a Rocket Boy's Unreal Engine 5 creation system,Everywhere, it's effectively a proof of concept that allows players to remix and create content to build new games, modes, maps, and more. ThinkProject Spark, or perhaps less niche, Fortnite's creative maps. Well, if you want to test drive Everywhere's first outing, you will need an Nvidia GeForceRTX 4070/Radeon RX 5600 XT, and either an Intel Core i7 13700K orAMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, according tothe game's Steam page. This means, at the very earliest, you will need at least a rig with parts from 2023 onwards to play it on recommended settings, and reasonably pricey parts at that. This is likely tied to the fact that MindsEye is built in Unreal Engine 5, whose fancy shmancy Lumen illuminations and reflections feature is quite hard to run. We've seen similarly beefy requirements in other UE5 games likeMafia: The Old Country. Alongside this, you will need 16 GB of RAM and 70 GB of storage available in an SSD. These two spec requirements aren't particularly strange for a new game. Minimum Recommended OS Windows 10/11 Windows 10/11 Processor Intel Core i5 12400F / AMD Ryzen 5 5600X Intel Core i7 13700K / AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D Graphics card Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT Memory 16 GB RAM 16 GB RAM Storage 70 GB 70 GB Extra notes SSD required SSD required If you want to run MindsEye on minimum settings, you will need at least an Intel Core i5 12400F (orCore i5 12400Fsince it's the same chip just with an integrated GPU) /AMD Ryzen 5 5600Xand GeForceRTX 2060/ AMD RadeonRX 5600 XTto run the game. The memory and storage requirements are the same for both settings. MindsEye also looks like it might require these specs, as the game itself is a cinematic, narrative-driven action game, withrecent trailersshoving explosions, shots, or lens flares into the frame every couple of seconds. I must say I'm more intrigued about the game than I am excited, per se. We've seen surprisingly little, considering it launches in just a few weeks, and its trailers haven't really shown much more than just combat. It's a strange one so far. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I just upgraded my personal rig a few months ago to anAMD Ryzen7 7800X3D with anRTX 4070 Super, and although I knew it would feel a little less powerful with time, I am a tad surprised it's already barely handing the recommended requirements of some upcoming games (or, well, game).

    "article_text": "Trying to find some middle ground. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. FBC: Firebreakis Remedy's upcoming chaotic co-op shooter / Control spin-off. I was already invested in it thanks to Robin Valentine'sFBC: Firebreak preview, which talked about all the hilarious and treacherous times to be expected, but after hearing what Remedy Director Mike Kayatta has to say about the studio's approach to this game, I'm even more eager to start playing. \"This idea of a responsible team size, a responsible budget, a responsible amount of time to develop a game, just get it out there, make something that respects player time and don't try to overcharge and don't try to be greedy with time,\" Kayatta says inan interview with IGN. \"I do think there's a space for it, and we're trying to touch on it with this game.” 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Kayatta raises a few good points about how the games industry has escalated its approach to creating blockbuster games. \"It's gotten to the point where you've got a lot of games that cost half a billion dollars to make,\" Kayatta continues. \"And then, of course, when you get into marketing and promotion, I mean, the amount of money involved is staggering. And that can produce some incredible, incredible experiences that I am very thankful exist, but only some of those can exist, and everyone can't compete in that space.\" Games are undoubtedly getting more expensive, and while that may be an unavoidable truth, it doesn't mean that players have to be happy or even content with it. Most players hadn't accepted $70 games yet, and thenNintendo went and raised the bar again, asking $80 for Mario Kart. This may be part and parcel of making a monolith likeGTA 6. But given the success of smaller, more moderately priced games likeBlue PrinceorClair Obscur: Expedition 33, I agree with Kayatta's position that there's a middle ground to be had. “A lot of that has to do with reducing FOMO (the fear of missing out), which I think has kind of infected a lot of modern games,\" Kayatta says. “That's not a blanket statement. I think a lot of games are able to use FOMO to be exciting. I'm just saying that it didn't work for us, but it's not just about monetisation, I think it's about the value that the game has. \"So for us, we wanted to make sure that the game, both from the way we monetise it, we don't do daily check-ins, timed battle passes, all that other stuff that dictates your time.\" But on the other hand, Kayatta does still admit that the goal is to create a game that entices players to come back, so they feel as if they're \"accomplishing something over time.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As someone who's sunk many hours into SCP: Secret Laboratory, I've come to really appreciate games that take time improving and growing for their community, instead of just rushing to get content out.

    "article_text": "Not the anime figure overflow solution I quite had in mind. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As much as I enjoy my shelf full of Miku Hatsune figures, I can't help but wonder if there isn't a better way to display them all. After all, she's a star—and so is she, and her, and her with the bunny ears as well. However, rather than pop to Ikea and pick up a glass cabinet, I'm thinking about giving the Vocaloid idol centre stage in a future PC build—and Tryx pulled back the curtain at Computex on what could be the perfect podium. It is—drum roll, please—another shelf. Rather than the particleboard of my Ikea Micke desk, the shelf part of Tryx's 'Stage' AIO liquid CPU cooler features two four-inch HD screens instead. I guess that means I can sit a mini-Miku on this 'Stage' and then get creative with some virtual backup dancers. I wonder if I can get my colleagues to volunteer some selfies. Tryx has not yet confirmed Stage's pricing information, but the show floor display did feature a swish 'patent-pending' sticker. That said, it's worth noting a flashy display shelf for glass-panelled cases isn't an unheard of idea. Geometric Future'sModel 5 casepreviously featured what is described as a \"Fun yet functional built-in display platform\" for just one example. The same company also showed off their new Model 3 case at this year's Computex, it too featuring an interior display shelf sans any sign of a screen. Tryx is also not the only company atComputex 2025showing off yet more screens intended for the inside of your PC case. For instance, Lian Li showed off a case screen that will beavailable for only $109, whileCorsair's Xeneon Edgeseems a little confused about the distinction between a 'case screen' and a normal PC monitor. Even Cooler Master showed off modular LCD and LED screen attachments for customising itsnew liquid cooler, the Atmos II. Listen, I like RGB lighting on my peripherals and my components as much as the next person. However, paying however much for a screen I'm definitely not going to be gluing my eyeballs to seems a little much. Strapping such screens onto a display shelf feels especially ludicrous to me. While I definitely wouldn't want particleboard inside my PC, it's proven a reasonable enough perch for my army of Miku, and I'd definitely settle for a slightly less all-singing, all-dancing 'Stage' for my case.

    "article_text": "From screenshot to cake, Tub Geralt became a defining icon of The Witcher 3. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's 2017, and I'm in Warsaw, visitingCD ProjektRed to play its new game, a standalone, multiplayer version of Gwent. Before I'm allowed to do that, though, I'm asked a question by the studio's PR manager… one that's clearly been puzzling him for well over a year: \"Why do you keep posting images of Geralt in the bath?\" At the time I didn't have a good answer. Still, as the person who is perhaps most responsible for kicking off what Know Your Meme calls \"Geralt in a Bathtub\"—personally I preferTub Geralt—the game's 10th anniversary feels like as good a time as any to try to explain. Tub Geralt's first appearance on the internet was on May 12, 2015—a week before the release of The Witcher 3—courtesy of PC Gamer's former online editor Tom Senior. It's a tweet that is criminally underappreciated for a piece of history—the origin of this all. The embargo's up, which means I can post a picture of The Witcher 3's SEXIEST moment. pic.twitter.com/UWDONFeUsDMay 12, 2015 It's what I like to think of as a classic Tom Senior move—taking a screenshot ofexactly the right frameof a game cutscene to produce something that, in isolation, is funny. To celebrate its 10th anniversary, all this week we're looking back on The Witcher 3—and looking ahead to its upcoming sequel, too.Keep checking backfor more features and retrospectives, as well as in-depth interviews with the developers who brought the game to life. A month later, the image made its way onto PC Gamer for the first time—proudly propping up a story about The Witcher 3 selling four million copies. An inauspicious start—a small, inconsequential news story about a game doing well—but that's precisely why it was the right image for the job. Writing gaming news can be a thankless task, and my coping mechanism was to find ways to amuse myself. This did not always work. Months before posting Tub Geralt, I spent a not insignificant amount of time creating a mascot for posts about gaming deals—the Sale Stoat. This proved maybe too weird and too high concept for the regular commenters of the day. Tub Geralt, though? He demands attention. This is, when all is said and done, a provocative image.

Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The comments from that article are long since lost to time and changing platforms, but itdidget a reaction. Over the years, some have assumed that we kept posting Tub Geralt purely because of the negative feedback—the many replies we'd get from people clearly uncomfortable with naked male flesh on their Twitter feeds. Really, though, when you're an attention starved news writer, any reaction will do. Whether they thought it was funny or gross—whether they were in on the joke or not—they were commenting. And so I kept posting the image. And so did PCG's other writers. Like all great works of art, Tub Geralt remains divisive. pic.twitter.com/Fpb7iDM2wbJune 30, 2017 Arguably the image served a practical purpose too. The Witcher 3 was an incredibly successful game, and so it was one we wrote about a lot. And a good article header image can be hard to find. It should be a prominent character that commands attention, ideally making eye contact with the reader. Plus, in the early days, when the primary reaction was still one of bafflement and annoyance, Tubposting became a fun little game. For instance, see if you can find the Tub Geralt inthis news story from August of 2015. Eventually the wider world cottoned on to what we were doing. Other gaming sites had already started deploying occasional Tub Geralts—dipping their toe into the waters to see how it felt. And a viral tweet in 2016—now deleted—seemed to tip the scales, with its collage of angry tweet replies alongside the caption: \"PC Gamer repeatedly using the 'bathtub Geralt' picture rustled some people and it's amazing\". It was around this time that the general mood around Tub Geralt started to shift. Increasingly, people would get annoyed when wedidn'tpost a Tub Geralt, and instead dared to illustrate some Witcher 3 news with a regular picture of a clothed RPG action hero. Eventually even CD Projekt Red itself got in on the fun. No doubt there are some at the studio who would have preferred if the world's biggest PC gaming website hadn't chosen to inexorably tie its discussions of the game to an image of a half-naked rendition of its protagonist. There may even have been a small lingering element of exasperation to be found inthe 2021 WicherCon videothat touches briefly on the phenomenon. 🙏 pic.twitter.com/4wVayFiFUVJuly 9, 2021 But ultimately, I hope, CDPR recognises Tub Geralt for what it is: The celebration of the studio's singular protagonist. It works because Geralt—whatever form he's in, from book to game to TV show—is so well defined and characterised. You could plop a lot of gaming characters in a lot of baths, and very few of them would feel so endearingly entertaining. Very few would make it to meme status. There's a reason CDPR chose to make the bathtub cutscene in the first place, after all. It fits. Just a few months after my trip to Poland in 2017, CDPR embraced Tub Geralt by making him real—sendingus a statueof Tub Geralt relaxing with his copy of PC Gamer magazine. This was maybe the first time I wondered if my little running joke had gone too far. It would not be the last. In 2019, the showrunner for Netflix's adaptation of The Witcher, Lauren Schmidt Hissrich,was askedif there would be a bathtub scene in the show. There was. After the first season aired, actor, game enjoyer and bather Henry Caville was asked about the scene, telling BBC Radio 1, \"When I was getting into the bath, I was sitting there thinking 'I wonder if anyone knows how much this is going to explode, this particular scene.'\" For me, perhaps the most bizarre moment of all came in 2022, when contestants for Netflix's absurdly entertaining baking show Nailed It! were asked tobake a Tub Geralt. This, both chronologically and philosophically, felt like some kind of end point. A butterfly flaps its wings; a tired news writer posts a funny picture his colleague had taken; three amateur bakers flail around as they attempt to render a mid-soak Geralt out of cake in a studio in Burbank. The part I played in Tub Geralt will likely be my major legacy on the internet. If I was a more serious man, that would probably contribute to some kind of extended midlife crisis. But much in the way that Geralt has become a sort of elder statesman for PC gaming—one of the many enduring mascots of our weird gaming platform—Tub Geralt is now part of PC Gamer's furniture. We don't post him nearly as much, but he still crops up from time to time. Over the years he's made his way into nearly everything we've done—he's even featured prominently as part ofour recommendations pageon CD Projekt's distribution service GOG. We were told we could pick something that represents our brand. I think there's no better choice. \"Why do you keep posting images of Geralt in the bath?\" In 2017 I didn't have a good answer. In 2025, I could attempt to argue that, as the internet continues to contract down into AI slop and crumbling social platforms, that it's important to hold onto the things that show your history and personality—that make you stand out. Really, though? It's just a funny picture. It never needed to be any deeper than that.

    "article_text": "And you'd better believe I'm here for it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Square cooler screens, round cooler screens, shiny cooler screens, crappy cooler screens: Computex has gone absolutely nuts for cooler screens this year. Don't ask me why; it's just one of those things that happens sometimes, likekiller clown sightingsin 2016. And that's why I love this particular one so much, because it encapsulates the entire ordeal perfectly *chef's kiss*. What says Computex 2025 better than this ginormous caricature of a cooler screen from Xigmatek? Forgetpoxy little modular onesand evenmotorised ones that move around for seemingly no reason. Go big or go home, that's what I say. You know, with something like this, there might be little need to have a monitor at all. Just slap your tower on your desk, crack open its side panel, and stare into your PC's guts to navigate the joys of the Windows 11 desktop. Hey, you'd net yourself some frames, too, by dropping down the resolution. Who knows, maybe that's the end goal: Big Cooler's out for Big Monitor. Jokes aside, I suppose there could be some use for a screen so big. I guess you could have it display all manner of stats about your PC side-by-side: temperature, clock speed, and so on. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. I'd rather just use a standalone small screen on my desk, but hey, it's something. It'll certainly draw more attention to your build, if that's what you're going for. The screen here slots into the Xigamatek pump by sliding into what looks like an alien's shoulder socket, if one can imagine such a thing. Presumably, that means it can be rotated into different orientations, in case you're more of a vertical giant cooler screen person than a horizontal giant cooler screen person. I reckon it'd pair nicely with thebehemoth PC case I highlighted yesterday, a couple of8BitDo Dual Super buttons, and anAcer Predator Z57.

    "article_text": "A cranky old guy with a heart of gold? Why, that sounds just like this witcher I know. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There are two things I know about Andrzej Sapkowski: he wrote (and continues to write) the original Witcher novels, and he's a legendary grump. In fact, if I search our own website for the author's name, I find stories about him advising young writers to instead learn something \"That makes money\" like PC repair, saying he \"never played\" and does \"not intend to play\" The Witcher games, and other such things that seem like the hallmark of a—honestly, quite charming—grouchy author. To celebrate its 10th anniversary, all this week we're looking back on The Witcher 3—and looking ahead to its upcoming sequel, too.Keep checking backfor more features and retrospectives, as well as in-depth interviews with the developers who brought the game to life. But when I sat down for a chat with CDPR co-CEO Adam Badowski, I was told something alarming: Sapkowski might not be quite as curmudgeonly as he puts on. \"He's a very intelligent guy,\" said Badowski, \"and as a writer, he created kind of a persona. In person, he's a great guy. Very knowledgeable.\" In fact, Badowski says he hangs out with Sapkowski regularly: \"We are friends. I visit Andrzej regularly. We go for dinner, have great conversations.\" But don't get it twisted—grouch or no, Sapkowski isn't secretly a huge player of the games. \"He was very clear about what is his area, [and] what is just licensed,\" said Badowski. \"He's all about the books. That's it. He doesn't play games. \"He's a very smart person, so he knew everything about our game and about its success, but he tried not to comment on it… Those two worlds, in his opinion, should be disconnected.\" Which means we're probably not due a Sapkowski-penned novelisation of Blood and Wine anytime soon, but on CDPR's side the devs still hold the books in reverence. \"As true fans of the books, we truly take care with the whole lore,\" says Badowski. ReferencingSapkowski's latest Witcher novel—the first in over a decade—he points out that CDPR is going out of its way to make sure whatever it makes coheres with any new lore the author has set down: \"We're updating everything, we are not making different, alternative paths… Everything is coherent.

    "article_text": "Even if Secretlab says you technically can. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you've ever thought \"my desk is missing the map of the Imperium of Man\" or \"I need to see Holy Terra and Mars every morning\", Secretlab's new Warhammer 40,000 desk may be the solution to your problems. Well, one of your problems. Announced today is a Warhammer 40,000 version of Secretlab's popularMagnus Pro standing desk. We consider the XL variant to be thebest gaming deskright now, and the only difference between XL and standard, as you may be able to guess, is its size. The top of the desk has a desk mat with the map of the Imperium of Man, complete with regal insignias. It looks a little worn in a rather cool way, and the mapping of certain planets and structures feels messy in a bloodsplat kind of way. That desk mat is bundled into the Warhammer 40,000 edition of the desk, which also means you can buy it separately, should you already have your own Magnus desk. The Magnus Pro special edition desk mats start at $129, so it seems likely that buying the Warhammer desk mat by itself will cost you that much. The press release sent to PC Gamer technically says you can paint miniatures on it, but if you're anything like me, you should probably avoid that. I know I wouldn't want splatters of paint, blood, and tears all over my fancy new desk. Yeah, painting miniatures is a big event for me. Our Jacob uses the Magnus and suggests you best avoid getting dollops of thermal paste on your desk mat, too. Not that he's done that. Nope. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In May last year, Secretlab announced the40,000 variant of its Titan Evo chair, complete with a purity seal, and on the one year anniversary of its announcement, this desk is there to match it. As well as this new desk mat, plus the Warhammer 40,000 bundle, you can pick a Warhammer 40K-themed cable management set, which is a grouping of anchors, sheaths, and fastening straps to pull in cables and wrap them around parts of the desk. If you have a PC, a console, and a few monitors, there's a good chance you will want some sort of solution to better manage your wires. It just so happens the new cable management bundle comes plastered with skulls, logos, and oh so much blood. We don't yet have a firm price on the new Warhammer 40,000 Magnus Pro. However, buying a Magnus Pro outright with a themed desk mat and cable management bundle right now will cost $947, so we anticipate the launch of the desk will come in at a similar price. I don't know if I'd like to get paint on my new desk if I'd spent that much money, but it also sort of adds to that bloody aesthetic. More blood for the blood god, I suppose.

    "title": "NZXT H3 Flow case review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Very pretty, very cool, and a huge improvement over its now ancient predecessor, the H210. It's not perfect though, and even with that ridiculously low price point, it lacks some of that sparkle that makes the more premium NZXT cases great. If you're on the hunt for a good ITX or Micro-ATX chassis, it's definitely one to consider; you just need to get past the awkward cable management. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Case aficionados rejoice; we've been graced with not one but two new chassis launches from NZXT, side-by-side, and they couldn't be any more different from one another if they tried. On the one hand, you have the big, bold, redefined, redesignedNZXT H9 Flow RGB+, complete with exhaustive 420 mm fan setups, plenty of mesh, a new shape, and an armada of cable management at a cost. And then, the other is well this, theNZXT H3 Flow. ITX is, from a manufacturing perspective, a bit of a problem child. There's not enough market volume for them to really heavily invest in the segment, and the folks who love those teeny tiny sleeper builds (myself included) have seriously high standards on what exactly constitutes a good ITX case and what they want out of it. It's like making a coffee for your dad, but he's a World Barista Champion and James Hoffman. You get the idea; we're never happy. The H3 is, in essence, a complete redesign of the H210 line that debuted way-back-when in 2019. But, unlike those early models, NZXT's been listening and has radically altered and adjusted this small form factor offering to better cater to modern audiences. Or thereabouts anyway. The first big takeaway is that, actually, this isn'treallyan ITX case. Despite being just 400 x 225 x 389 mm in size, with a 35 L volume, the H3 Flow supports ITX and Micro-ATX as well. It can also hold GPUs up to 377 mm in length (if you opt to install your AIO in the roof and ditch the front fans), and there's capacity for twin 280 mm radiators as well, plus a full-fat power supply in here too. In fact, I checked, it'll even fit a full-sizedRTX 5090in here fairly comfortably, and thanks to that Micro-ATX support, it's got the four PCIe slot covers there for even the chonkiest of graphics cards. Form factor:SFFDimensions:40.0 x 22.5 x 38.9 cmMotherboard support:ITX, mATX + Back connectorsExpansion slots:4 horizontalFront IO:1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1x USB 3.2 Gen2x2 Type-CTotal fan support:7Fan count:2x 120/140mm TOP, 2x 120/140mm FRONT, 2x 120mm PSU, 1x 120mm REARRadiator support:Up to 280 mm FRONT, Up to 240mm TOPGraphics card support:377 mm length (without front fans + rad)Storage:1+2x 2.5-inch; 1x 3.5-inchPSU support:ATX (up to 185 mm)Weight:4.8 kgPrice:$80|£65| €80 That also gives us access to larger VRM solutions, more M.2 support, and internal headers as well. Which, in a world of curved OLED AIO displays, cheap(er) storage, and fan controllers sucking up every USB 2.0 header in sight, is no bad thing. The biggest issue NZXT had with both its H210 line and, similarly, the now legendary Manta, is that they acted very much like large heat traps. With poor ventilation and spacing in the front panel and minimal exhaust, moving air through them was incredibly difficult, and that inevitably led to massive heat buildup. Those early H cases in particular were notorious for it, with temps easily hitting 95 to 100°C on some GPU setups over prolonged usage. The solution back then was often to take the window off entirely or the front panel to let the chassis breathe, not ideal. The H3 Flow then, much like its larger numbered flowy siblings (theH7 Flow's a great example of this), has massively addressed this issue first and foremost. The front panel is now entirely perforated, there's expansive support for cooling in the roof and the rear as well as the front, and the entire PSU bay below is ventilated across three out of the four sides, with the only solid panel being the base. There's no mesh filter adding turbulence either, bar one in the roof acting as a dust filter. Interestingly, though, given it's a Flow chassis, it hasn't hit every note in that mantra quite right. Take the fan situation, for example; you get just one 120 mm in the rear, and that's it (although, to be fair, it is ridiculously cheap). Nothing pre-installed, no F series frames dotted about anywhere, no intake, and no fan controllers to help you manage the potentially seven that you could install in here. Plus, although it does support 140mm options (NZXT actually encourages that you use 140mm units in this case), there's no official support for any 360 mm setups. And it's that last point that's perhaps my biggest bugbear. It's, ironically, just a tad too small. Take the roof, for instance. If you grab one of NZXT's F360 Core fan frames and pop it in the top. It fits comfortably, and you could install two 140 mm fans in the front. But there's no cutout to mount that F360 to the roof properly. Then there's the cable management. Hop around the back, and although it's clearlyBTF ready, very little has been done to really assist with keeping your cable mess tidy. There's none of that signature NZXT channeling, Velcro straps, or similar. There are a few cable tie points, yeah, but it just feels massively underwhelming. You don't even get rubber grommets to hide the mess you are making. And then there's the curious case of that cable cutout to the left of the NZXT logo on the motherboard tray. In the H9 Flow RGB+, it comes with a plastic cover that fits in that groove that you can pop out. If you're using BTF, then keep it installed, and the case is super slick and clean; if not, pop it out and run your 24-pin through here instead. In the H3, it's just a gaping hole, and given the rear panel is mostly perforated mesh, it makes it very easy for light to penetrate through and flag up any cables that might be draped across that back gap. ✅ You want epic airflow in a small form factor on a budget:The design is solid and a huge improvement over the old H210, making it ideal for the modern CPU and GPU era. Certainly at that price ❌ You're looking for a premium case:It'll look good when it's done, but it's not a joy to work in, and you'll struggle with the cable management, that's for sure. There's no radiator brackets here either, so you're going to be fumbling around for a while, and NZXT's also included mounting locations for two 120 mm fans above the PSU shroud, which is great, but they're not recessed or particularly easy to get to to mount your fans on. If you've installed your power supply before your two 120 mm fans there, well, you're stumped. Not quitethe best PC caseof all time then. It honestly feels like this product was designed in 2022. Like it was a predecessor of NZXT's latest revamp, an engineering sample meant to be a proof of concept in chassis aesthetic and featureset, and then they beefed up the entire lineup, added recessed fan mounting, better cable management, and more, then put the H3 on ice for a few years while releasing the mid-tower versions and above. It's just not premium enough; it doesn't work well enough with the products in NZXT's own arsenal like it should, and that's slightly frustrating to see, particularly given how highly the H9 Flow RGB+ ranks in comparison. Still, wrap up your build inside the H3, stick a few RGB fans inside and a decent cooler, and what you're left with is an incredible rig that looks the part and remains cool throughout. All in a nice tiny form factor, finally, at last, after six years. If you can live with the foibles, and the bugbears, and the first-world PC builder problems, and the price is right for you, then yeah, she's a treat. Very pretty, very cool, and a huge improvement over its now ancient predecessor, the H210. It's not perfect though, and even with that ridiculously low price point, it lacks some of that sparkle that makes the more premium NZXT cases great. If you're on the hunt for a good ITX or Micro-ATX chassis, it's definitely one to consider; you just need to get past the awkward cable management.

    "title": "'That magic is back': Peter Molyneux really wants you to know he's not hyping Masters of Albion, while name-dropping Dungeon Keeper, Black and White, and Fable",
    "article_text": "\"Every atom of my being believes we're making a great game.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've kinda turned around on Peter Molyneux. The man cannot stop over-hyping and over-promising, and it makes it hard to trust anything he says—especially after theCuriosityandGodusfiascos—but increasingly I feel like he's just the sort of person who dreams big and can't contain their excitement, even when it's only going to lead to disappointment. And he's at it again. At last year's TGAs, Molyneux announced that he was returning to god games withMasters of Albion, and honestly it got me excited. What can I say? The man knows how to pitch. But it was also classic Molyneux, with big, big promises. At one point in the demo, the player equips a citizen with a sword. That sword is made out of bread. \"You can design anything,\" Molyneux said. \"The food the people eat, the clothes they wear, the weapons they use, the armor they fight with. There is a strategy behind every creation. I can even feed them rats.\" Will this system be even a tenth as flexible as he's making out? History suggests that no, it won't be, but there's something about Molyneux that makes me desperately want to believe him. This is even more the case today. The folks atGamesIndustry.bizhave caught up with Molyneux to see how development is progressing, and once again he cannot stop selling big dreams. \"I've got to say this, but it's going to get me in trouble: every atom of my being believes we're making a great game,\" he says. This is the modern Molyneux strategy. After Godus, Molyneux said he was going to stop talking to the press, then he backpedalled and said he'd just stop over-hyping. But he can't stop. He just says he'll get into trouble for saying this or that, or that he's not trying to hype the game. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But it's also hard to blame someone for wanting to get people excited about the thing they are making; the thing they are presumably really pumped to show off. But due to his history, there's always going to be a part of me that wonders if he's just telling us what we want to hear. Like this: \"There is a magic that we used to have, when we created Dungeon Keeper and Black & White and Fable, and that magic was completely intangible. It's not something you can produce. But it really feels [like] that magic is back.\" He goes even further moments later: \"It's exactly what I wanted it to be: it's a marriage of Dungeon Keeper, and Black & White, and Fable, and it's all [of] that put together. And how the hell does that work? It's only now, really, in the last year, that I've dared to hope that this weird mixture of game mechanics can actually blend into something unique and different.\" These are his greatest hits. The best games Bullfrog and Lionhead ever made. But the most recent one on the list, Fable, is 20 years old. Black & White and Dungeon Keeper, meanwhile, came out before quite a few of PC Gamer's writers were even born. It's been a long time since Molyneux has been attached to anything this impressive. Then again, Molyneux is working with a bunch of his old collaborators again, which is pretty reassuring. \"I bullied, persuaded, and blackmailed a lot of the old people that I worked with, like Russell Shaw, Mark Healey and Ian Wright, Kareem Ettouney, to come back and do one last gig. And it's incredible.\" Shaw was the composer for Bullfrog back in the '90s, and followed Molyneux to Lionhead. Healey served as an artist at Bullfrog and Lionhead, before co-founding LittleBigPlanet and Dreams developer Media Molecule, along with Ettouney, who'd been an artist at Lionhead. Wright, meanwhile, joined Lionhead as a designer for Black & White 2 and Fable 2. Molyneux goes on to explain his approach to game design, and why he's constantly fiddling around with different genres. \"I think I've realised that the consistency is the experience that the player has. What we're really trying to do is create an experience.\" He describes his process as \"stumbling through the darkness looking for the daylight as you're developing the game\". For Masters of Albion specifically, he says it's like making soup. \"I can put potatoes in, and I can put leeks in—and it's going to be a leek and potato soup. Then I can put strange other ingredients in, and it tastes like nothing I've ever tasted before. That's how I think about Masters of Albion.\" The Dungeon Keeper and Black & White influences are clear, but Molyneux says Fable's influence is just as critical. \"But Fable: that's where the main focus comes from, because the entire narrative, the entire world, the openness of the world, the freedom which Fable gave you as a player, absolutely is embraced [here fully].\" He says that feedback from user tests (\"I shouldn't be saying any of this\") showed how players were immediately reminded of Fable. \"And the first thing that came back is, 'oh my god, I'm playing Fable.' That was such a wonderful moment for me.\" But after playing for a while it reminded them of Black & White. \"It is a blend, but that blend, just like that soup analogy, is something new, fresh and different.\" The proof will be in the soup, I guess? Masters of Albion will initially launch in early access, and that's when we're also going to see a roadmap. As for when that is? Soon, Molyneux says. \"So I think the time for a roadmap, the time to be predictive about what we're releasing and share that with the community, that's soon coming up.\" Fraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person.

Computex, as thrilling as it is, can sometimes feel a little like a boujee banquet only for those with the big bucks—rarespecial edition keyboards,extravagant custom cases, and moreAIOs with screensthan anyone could possibly want. But what if, like me, you've shunned the haves and remained a have-not by sticking to the ancient technology of air cooling? Well, in that case, we've found at leastonething to get excited about at the trade show, this being an air cooler with a big screen. Yes, we lowly air cooler peasants can also get on board with the somewhat overbearing big screen cooling trend this year with a chip chiller of our own. This cooler is from Tryx, a company that's already got a foot in the cooler-with-screen bizz thanks to itsPanorama 360, one of those curved cuboid deals we'vealready seenour fair share of. The air cooler on show here is the Tryx Turris, featuring a five-inch HD screen. The cooler underneath that screen is a dual-tower affair with six heat pipes. CPU cooler quality has improved a lot across the board over the last few years, so I'd be surprised if this didn't do the job with entry and mid-range CPUs. The main draw is that screen, which is usually the prerogative of the AIO segment. I know my own ageingArctic Freezer 34 Esports Duois looking mighty jealous right now.

I have plenty to look at on, y'know, my actual computer monitors, without having to look over into my chassis to see more (which I couldn't do anyway, since it's not windowed—call me a heathen). Those are just the tired cries of a man who is starting to become far too old far too soon, though. All you whippersnappers can have at it with your gif-laden coolers, cases, and whatever else.

Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet debuted at last year's The Game Awards. Naughty Dog managed to snag a spot towards the end of the showcase, a spot reserved for those with bags of cash who want to make an impact. While it did have an impact, it probably wasn't the one that was intended. Intergalactic's trailerwas met with waves of people in the livestream comments calling it a DEI game and whining about how woke Naughty Dog is, as Intergalactic's protagonist is a Black woman. Unfortunately, this kind of knee-jerk reaction has become pretty common when it comes to new releases. Hate forThe Witcher 4having Ciri as the protagonist got so bad thatGeralt's voice actor Doug Cockle stepped insaying how \"We can't just have Geralt for every single game\" and \"read the damn books, you won't think it's so woke anymore\". But this is something that Neil Druckmann, Naughty Dog studio boss, knows all too well. \"I don't know if there's much I could add to that conversation, to be honest,\" Druckmann says in aninterview with Last Stand Media. \"There's stuff happening with media right now that you just have to ignore for the most part, just stick to your guns, and do what you believe in. And I feel like that's how I want artists to carry themselves.\" There were loads ofbig reveals during The Game Awards 2024, and whileElden Ring: Nightreignand The Witcher 4 were my standout picks of the night, Intergalactic's trailer did catch my eye. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Though not much happened during the trailer, and it was maybe a little stretched out, getting to look around the retro spaceship, take a look at our new bounty hunter protagonist, and see a small glimpse of some robotic monster was enough to make me take mental note to look out for Intergalactic in the future—the Akira reference also helped. It seems like this excitement isn't misplaced. \"I can just say I'm very, very excited for this game, maybe as excited as I've been for any game,\" Druckmann says. \"It's very cool, it's the deepest gameplay we've ever done, and I can't wait to show it off.\" It doesn't matter how many times he says it, I still have no idea what \"deepest gameplay\" means, but I'm ready to find out.

    "article_text": "*Looks into the sky and thinks about the flash games era* When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Any fellow nostalgia surfers out there? I surf those waves of nostalgic emotion almost on the daily (it's hard not to hearken back to simpler times, isn't it?), so thank the lord for companies like Silverstone which cater to it. This time around, the company has gone for a standingrather than horizontalretro chassis. We heard word from the grapevine about this beige PC case and promptly sicced our chassis-hunting bloodhound, Jacob Ridley (who is also my editor and manager and hopefully won't read that description), on the retro rig. Upon his finding it and beaming some pics back to the home base, I can say it looks even more glorious than I expected. The beige and griddled chassis of the FLP02 immediately takes me back to the old family computer, which would sit waiting for me to return home from school and boot upCaesar IIIorHeroes of Might and Magic 2. Or draw random rubbish in MS Paint—the joys of childhood imagination, eh? And hang on, hang on, is that abig red buttonand aturny key knobI see? Why yes, yes it is. The lock key is presumably for the power button, so you have to turn it while you switch it on or off. But it could also be a chassis lock. There's also a Reset and Turbo button (your guess is as good as mine) and an LED number screen. According to the spec sheet, you also get some front I/O ports, though I can't quite see where. You get one USB-C port, two USB-A 3.0 ports, and one Combo Audio port. The ATX chassis measures 323 x 494 x 472 mm and supports two 120 mm fans on the front, one 120/140 mm fan on the back, and either three 120 mm fans or two 140 mm fans on the top.

It also supports a rear 120 mm or 140 mm radiator and a top radiator of up to 360 mm. In other words, retro though its design may be, it's well-equipped for modern cooling and hardware. I'm leaning more towards the small form factor (SFF) side of things for my next build or upgrade, whenever that may be. But damn, Silverstone sure knows how to make me reconsider things by hitting me in the memory bone. Or maybe that's just the rose-tinted glasses talking, who knows?

While it took me well over an hour to make even a slightly cooler-looking approximation of myself inMonster Hunter Wilds, my Palico seemed to spring into being fully formed. They're a long-haired kitty with fluffy white fur accented by patches of pink and purple. Their name? Raspberry Ripple. While I'll never enjoy a little pre-deadline Vigorwasp Delivery in real life, I think I'd settle for this incredible Palico PC build exhibited at Computex 2025. All joking aside, what you see aboveisa PC. Made byMijinko Studio, the cheerful Palico exterior is 3D printed using temperature-resistant, engineering-grade resin with a fibreglass aggrandizement. Though that makes this case tough and shock-resistant, I still wouldn't like to see this one-of-a-kind felyne friend take a tumble—especially with the graphics card this one's toting in the long sword strapped to their back. The card in question is a GeForceRTX 5070Ti from GamingPro, a sub-brand of the Taiwan-based company Palit.

Though I can't comment on this build's thermal regulation, I would still love to sink my teeth into the recentTitle Update 1on this fabulous felyne machine.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A bright, colorful, and surprisingly powerful mini projector that nails the essentials for big-screen gaming and home cinema—without the setup drama of traditional beamers. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. When you think of a projector, odds are you're picturing a dim, clunky box that only works if you blackout the room and sit very still. The Hisense C2 Ultra flips that stereotype on its head. It's compact, impressively bright, and unapologetically ambitious—packing a 4K triple-laser engine into a mini projector that wants to be your TV, your gaming display, and your portable home cinema, all in one. So is this $2,500 projector worth the hype? After a few weeks of gaming, binging, and living with it, the answer is mostly yes—with a few caveats. TheHisense C2 Ultrais smaller than I expected for something boasting up to a 300-inch projection. At just 11 inches wide and under 14 pounds, it's surprisingly portable. The gunmetal chassis isn't flashy, but it's functional and has a bit of sci-fi charm. Its most notable design feature is the integrated gimbal-style swivel stand, which gives you 360° horizontal rotation and 135° vertical tilt. It's a manual system, so you'll have to physically adjust it each time, but it's smooth, stable, and incredibly flexible for different room setups. What's even cooler is that the base of the stand houses JBL-powered speakers: two 10W drivers and a 20W subwoofer. The sound quality is genuinely shocking for something this size. It fills a medium room with ease and feels like it's coming from the screen itself—not from behind you. It's not quite Dolby Atmos, but it's more than enough for casual viewing and even some immersive gaming. I rarely pushed it past 20% volume. Panel size:up to 300-inchNative resolution:3840 x 2160Refresh rate:120 HzResponse time:12 ms (4k @ 120 Hz)Panel type: DLP ProjectorPeak brightness:3,000 nitsSync tech:FreeSync Premium Pro, VRR, G-SyncInputs:2x HDMI 2.1, 2x USB 3.2, Digital Optical outPrice:$2,500|£2,299| AUD $4,499 On the back, the C2 Ultra offers plenty of ports: two HDMI 2.1 (with eARC and ALLM), two USB 3.0, Ethernet, AV in, and digital audio out. Wireless is covered too, with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. Whether you're streaming, gaming, or plugging in peripherals, it's got you sorted. And here's where the C2 Ultra starts to justify its premium price. Hisense's TriChroma triple-laser engine delivers stunning colors—covering 110% of the BT.2020 color space. Most TVs can't even get close. Add in 3000 ANSI lumens of brightness and you've got a projector that holds its own even in moderately lit rooms. Yes, a proper ambient light-rejecting screen would help, but it works surprisingly well on my regular painted wall. The 4K resolution is razor-sharp up to around 150 inches, with diminishing returns beyond that. Blacks on a projector can obviously never OLED-level deep, especially in bright rooms, but they're respectable. In a dark room, it really shines—especially with HDR content. The projector supports Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and HLG, and the difference is noticeable. It's vibrant, cinematic, and an easy upgrade if you're coming from a budget 4K TV or entry-level projector. There is a mild rainbow effect—a typical side effect of DLP technology—but only visible to some and only on high-contrast content. Personally, I've only caught it once or twice. Setup is dead simple: plug in, point it at your wall, and you're off. There's auto-focus, automatic keystone correction, and manual zoom. Keystone correction works remarkably well (better than on Hisense's PX3), but it does shrink the viewable image, so positioning the projector head-on is still best. That might make for a slightly awkward living room setup, but in a dedicated space, it's perfect. Fan noise is minimal and never distracting. I've only found it noticeable up close during HDR-heavy scenes or silent moments in shows. Even then, the excellent speaker output easily drowns it out. This isn't just a projector for movie buffs—it's built for gamers, too. With a \"Designed for Xbox\" certification, the C2 Ultra features 15 ms input lag at 4K/60Hz and as low as 12ms at 1080p/240Hz. It also supports Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM), and yes—it makes a real difference. I tested it with my PS5, where God of War looks breathtaking and runs smooth. Destiny 2 is a highlight, offering fluid and responsive gameplay even at high refresh rates. While I didn't get to push the full 240 Hz potential with an RTX 50-series laptop, what I did see was buttery-smooth gaming with no ghosting or weird latency issues. Just giant, immersive action. In Australia, the C2 Ultra runs on Hisense's Vidaa OS. It's clean, quick, and thankfully light on bloat. You get the core apps—Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, Disney+—but the app store isn't as expansive as Google TV or Roku. If you're in the US or Europe, though, your model will ship with Google TV instead, which I'd prefer. Still, Vidaa handles the basics well over here and doesn't get in the way. ✅ You want a versatile big screen:If you want a giant home cinema experience that's easy to setup anywhere and is just as fun for movies as it is for gaming, this one's hard to beat.✅ You're after a portable projector powerhouse:A beamer for those who need a surprisingly capable projector that sounds great, travels well, and connects to pretty much everything out of the box. ❌ TV simplicity is your vibe:You prefer plug-and-play TVs that isn't going to move anywhere and will work in any and all lighting conditions.❌ You're a purist:You demand ultra-deep blacks from your display and aren't interested in investing in projector screens. There's some light AI running in the background for content suggestions and device control, but nothing too in-your-face. Voice assistants, smart home integration, and multi-device syncing are all here if you're into the Hisense ecosystem. Otherwise, it mostly just lets you get to your shows quickly—which I appreciate. The Hisense C2 Ultra is a seriously impressive mini projector that delivers on its promise of big-screen versatility. From colorful 4K visuals to surprisingly great sound and responsive gaming, it's a standout device that fits in spaces where traditional TVs can't. It's not perfect: no motorized stand, no bundled tripod, and the lack of OLED-level blacks might be dealbreakers for some. But it's also one of the most user-friendly and enjoyable projectors I've tested. If you've ever wanted to game on a 200-inch ceiling or set up a backyard cinema without needing a forklift, this could be your dream machine. A bright, colorful, and surprisingly powerful mini projector that nails the essentials for big-screen gaming and home cinema—without the setup drama of traditional beamers.

    "article_text": "Now you can fist fight with monsters. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Monster Hunter Wildshas partnered with Street Fighter 6 in a new collaboration coming on May 28. Ina trailer shared to social media, new layered armor, attacks, and even Palico outfits are shown off, suggesting that there are plenty of Street Fighter goodies for you to unlock. Such as Blanka armor for your Palico, which is not cursed at all. Promise. Akuma layered armor is one of the first things the trailer highlights, but rather than just looking pretty, this set also features new moves like Gou Hadoken and Gou Shoryuken. So you don't have to rely on larger-than-life weapons. Instead, Akuma is seen quite literally throwing hands with Ajarakan and Congalala. Don't worry though, you can still use your weapons if you don't want to dive head first into the action. To get ahold of these rewards, you'll need to complete a new side mission, Ultimate Strength, which is only available for hunters at Hunter Rank 21 or higher. When the event rolls out on May 28, you'll need to speak to Quinn at the Oilwell Basin Base Camp to start the mission. You're not restricted to completing these missions in a timely manner either. Once the collaboration is here, it'll be a permanent addition to the game. That's not all, either. Alongside a Blanka-chan doll, two new outfits are available for Alma as part of a paid DLC too—Chun-Li and Cammy. Frankly, I'm a little upset that the hunter doesn't get these options too; we're just limited to cosplaying Akuma, but I guess we can't have everything. It's not like there aren't plenty of other rewards to sink our teeth into. Sigh. Lastly, players who want a little more Street Fighter flair will unlock a set of three gestures as part of the paid DLC. These include Hadoken, Shoryuken, and Tatsumaki Senpu-kyaku, all of which have attack properties when used in combat. But, most importantly, they just make for really cool photos.

    "article_text": "It should hopefully combat melty connectors. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm just as susceptible to a flashy OLED screen or over-designed chassis as the next person, but I'll be damned, I think the two favourite things I've seen from Computex this year have been on power supplies, of all things. Yesterday there was thePSU with a swiveling power connector, and today we're seeing that ASRock is making power supplies that fit 12V-2x6 power connectors with extra sensors to check for overheating. That's presumably as a response to the apparent issues some RTX 50-series graphics cards have with overheating power cables. The whole 'melting RTX cable' started last generation with theRTX 4090, but there have been some problems this generation, too. We first heard aboutsome RTX 5090 power connectors meltingnot long after launch. And just last month there was a report of a melted power cable on anRTX 5070, too—not even a high-powerRTX 5080orRTX 5090. Tech YouTuberDer8auer investigated with a thermal cameraand discovered that there was a lot of variance in how much current is flowing through each of the 12 wires on the 12VHPWR cable, and that two of the 12 wires were much hotter than the others. This was identified as a possible cause of the reported melting. We don't know to what extent each of the reports of RTX 50-series melted cables is down to user error, of course, such as might be caused by not having the power cable inserted fully. That's somethingyellow connector pinsare supposed to help with, and of course it's one reason behind the switch from the 12VHPWR cable's original, shorter connector pins to the new, longer 12V-2x6 pins. But if there are measurable drastic differences between the power flowing through different wires of the cable, it's hard to imagine that it's entirely the end user's fault. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In theory, RTX 50-series cards could have per-pin power sensing to stop such variation, but not all do and apparently even Nvidia's own Founders Edition RTX 5090 design doesn't have it. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. Which means some additional protection should be useful, and ASRock seems to have that in mind here with its PSU and cable/connector design. It looks like the new power supplies (in the company's Taichi or Phantom Gaming line-ups) have two standard 12V-2x6 connections but with additional two-pin sensors off to the side, with the 12VHPWR cables having a corresponding two-pin sensor to plug in. This should check for cable temperature and shut it off if it gets too hot—a nice extra bit of security. Plus you get those yellow pins so you can more easily check the pins are fully inserted. We don't know how well it works yet ourselves, of course, but it's a great, practical idea. Now, with the smart and sensible out of the way, let's get back to those flashy OLEDs. Might as well stick one in all these PSUs, too. Jacob got his hands on a gaming PC for the first time when he was about 12 years old. He swiftly realised the local PC repair store had ripped him off with his build and vowed never to let another soul build his rig again. With this vow, Jacob the hardware junkie was born.

As with every gacha out there, thebanners(or Convenes) inWuthering Wavesare constantly changing, so it's a good idea to keep track of what thecurrent bannersandnext bannersare. Wuthering Waves is a little more confusing than other popular gachas when it comes to currency conversions, thanks to its two additional weapon pull types. Because sure, what's one more currency when you already have a hundred on the go! The short version: don't convert your Astrite when you get it. Instead, wait until you're certain what character or weapon you want, then check what type of Tide you need to convert your Astrite into to get them. Most importantly, remember that shiny new characters always require Radiant Tides to pull, with their weapon banners taking Forging Tides instead. As Wuthering Waves is a little inconsistent with its banner schedule, this page can help you keep on track of who's coming next, so you can start the grind to build a potential new favourite as soon as possible. CartethyiaandLupa, are the next banners in Wuthering Waves, making their debut during version 2.4. This was confirmed throughCartethyia's drip marketing, andLupa's drip marketingshared on Wuthering Waves' official social media channels—an ever-reliable way to peek at who's coming next. Cartethyia is a new five-star Aero sword-user and Lupa is a new five-star Fusion broadblade-user, but this is all of the official information available about them right now. Thankfully, we can always turn to leakers for more banner information. Truly the heroes our Astrite savings deserve. As relayed on theWutheringWavesLeaks subreddit, reliable leaker Seele Leaks has revealed all, letting us know that Cartethyia will debut in Phase 1 of version 2.4, and Lupa will debut in Phase 2. There's no mention of rerun characters, which most likely means there won't be any in version 2.4. So it's a good opportunity to take advantage of the current stacked Anniversary Banner while you can! According to Seele Leaks, the four-star characters on Cartethyia's banner will be: Then the four-star characters on Lupa's banner will be: As always, it's best not to get your hopes up and start the pre-farming grind based on leaked information alone. This may be sourced from a reliable leaker, but anything could change between now and version 2.4. Ciaccona,Jinhsi,Changli,Carlotta,Roccia, andBrantare on the current banners in Wuthering Waves, with Ciaccona, a new five-star, on the Through Verses and Rhythms Banner, and all others on the Anniversary Resonator Convene Banner. Both of these banners end on Wednesday, June 11. To save your eyes a painful wall of text, here's a list of character information instead: The four-star characters on both the current banners are: The Anniversary Banner is a great way to pull for characters you might have missed during Wuthering Waves' first year. If somebody catches your eye during this second round of reruns, you might want to consider trying to get them now, before they're locked away in rerun jail again. Although there's no official confirmation yet, as Cartethyia and Lupa are debuting in version 2.4, it's all but confirmed that they'll be getting new signature weapons to run alongside them in the next weapon banners (Absolute Pulsation). Cartethyia uses a sword, so a new five-star sword will run in Phase 1 of Wuthering Waves' weapon banner in version 2.4; and Lupa uses a broadblade, so a new five-star broadblade will run alongside her in Phase 2. The current Wuthering Waves weapon banners run until Wednesday, June 11. The five-star weapons on these banners are: All of the four-star boosted weapons on both of the current weapon banners are: Phew, that's a lot of characters and weapons.

    "title": "Jason Momoa's videogame movie streak won't end here, he's already in talks to star in Street Fighter alongside 3 other big names",
    "article_text": "Unfortunately Jack Black isn't on the list. Yet. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Jason Momoa is \"in talks\" to star in the 2026 live-action movie adaptation of Street Fighter, asreported by Deadline, alongside a number of other actors who were named in the same article. Momoa's name was accompanied by Noah Centineo, Andrew Koji, and WWE superstar Roman Reigns, who are all apparently in talks of joining the cast. The movie is being developed by Legendary Pictures, who shared that they had acquired the film and TV rights to Street Fighter in April 2023. Not long after, the first official logo was revealed in May 2024. However, it was indefinitely delayed in March 2025 with no explanation, it was simply removed from the release schedule—which doesn't really bode well if you ask me. Even though it hasn't been confirmed, having a list of potential actors could mean that the film is starting development rather than continuing its delay. Although this won't mean we'll see a release anywhere near its original March 2026 window, it's a step in the right direction and hopefully means we'll start to see a little more about the film in the near future. Studio representatives declined to comment on the film's casting, so no information about which characters these actors will play, or any details on the plot, have been given. Before any word of this leaked out, a number of concept trailers started popping up online. Although they're obviously fan-made, they all star Chris Hemsworth, which suggests to me that there's one major actor missing from this current lineup. It's far too early to speculate who else may crop up in the 2026 Street Fighter movie, but after Jason Momoa and Jack Black's on-screen chemistry in A Minecraft Movie, I wouldn't be surprised if we saw the pair back together again sometime soon. Hopefully we get more information, or at least this information confirmed, which would suggest that the film is starting production and a release over the next year wouldn't be entirely out of the question.

    "article_text": "We're in it for the long haul. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In aninterview with Collider, Craig Mazin, the showrunner behind The Last of Us TV adaptation, has confirmed that the show is more likely to wrap after four seasons. This isn't the first time we've heard this, as Mazin started referencing the \"four season plan\" back in 2023, but this is all the confirmation we need to know our time with The Last of Us won't be coming to a close any time soon. After the bombshell of abeginning to the second season(which I won't spoil if you haven't watched it, but seriously you need to catch up) Mazin said \"It's such a narrative nuclear bomb that it's hard to wander away from it. We can't really take a break and move off to the side and do a Bill and Frank story. I'm not sure that will be necessarily true for season three. I think we'll have a little more room there. But certainly, there's no way to complete this narrative in a third season.\" He continued: \"Hopefully, we'll earn our keep enough to come back and finish in a fourth. That's the most likely outcome.\" But given the popularity of the show, I don't think earning their keep will be an issue. Especially since it wasconfirmed back in April that The Last of Us would return for a third season. Mazin goes on to suggest that \"there's a decent chance that season three will be longer than season two, just because of the manner of that narrative.\" But even with this factored in, there will still be the need for a fourth. As long as I'm not left on a cliffhanger at the end of each episode, which The Last of Us really loves to do, I will happily sit through far more than two seasons, and I'm sure a lot of the current audience would do the same.

    "title": "A writer used AI to generate this widely circulated summer reading list which includes fake books, and is published in the Chicago Sun-Times",
    "article_text": "We've got real books, fake books by real authors, fake books by fake authors, and even some fake blogs to link back to. Thanks AI. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's a reason the mention of AI, particularly in creative spaces, gets a bit of an eyeroll. Actually there's several. It's trained on stolen content for starters, robbing real artists and writers of credit and income. Furthermore, it's often just pretty bad, especially when it comes to factual articles. Language models like ChatGPT are known tohallucinate pretty badly, and this has led to real outlets like the Chicago Sun-Times printing a summer reading list full of fake books. Several outlets have covered the story, such asArstechnicaandThe Verge, and of course now I'm doing it here. It could be that we are somewhat motivated to point out when AI stuffs up in the writing space, considering people seem to want to keep giving our jobs to it. But it was404, which is a paywalled publication, who found the origins of this fake list that made its way into a few publications.The Chicago Sun-Times made a post onBluesky, which rather passes the buck on the situation. \"We are looking into how this made it into print as we speak,\" it reads, adding \"It is not editorial content and was not created by, or approved by, the Sun-Times newsroom. We value your trust in our reporting and take this very seriously. More info will be provided soon.\" It turns out the list was bought from a partner of the publications, and was found to come from the media conglomerate Hearst. The listicle features some real books but it's also plagued by some that don't exist, credited to both real and fabricated authors. It even points to non-existent blog posts, and is generally just a bout of confusion. Especially for anyone actually trying to get their hands on any of these recommended summer reads. The byline on the list belongs to a Marco Buscaglia, who 404 managed to track down. Initially Buscaglia admitted to using AI in their work, but clarified that they always check it for errors. “This time, I did not and I can’t believe I missed it because it’s so obvious. No excuses,” he told 404. “On me 100 percent and I’m completely embarrassed.” This isn't unique. There were other similar articles found, without bylines, that had blatantly fabricated information with quotes from fake people. One about “Summer food trends” had expert quotes from a doctor that doesn't exist, as well as some that were never said by people who do. It's likely this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to published hallucinating AI content. It comes at a time when budget cuts are causing lots of publications to turn to AI content to save money, but it's definitely a case of you get what you pay for. The sad truth is that there's far less money for writers of good, well researched, and well written content out there then there used to be. I say this as someone who's watched publication after publication in my industry close, leaving talented and dedicated journalists without work. It's another reminder that we have to be ever careful in what we read, both in print and online. It's also a reminder for those who use AI that these things are a tool. They need to be used carefully and properly, with the correct oversight.

    "title": "This $6,000 professional grade direct transfer printer comes with plenty of viruses for no extra cost, unless it also steals your crypto",
    "article_text": "A backdoor and a clipbanker were found in the download software, and a potentially very harmful worm might be on the included USB for software installation. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's a sad truth that you just can't ever let your guard down when it comes to malicious software, even when buying a $6,000 USD professional grade printer. This is something tech reviewer Cameron Coward found out to be all too true when reviewing a Procolored V11 Pro DTO UV Printer over onHackster(viaTechspot). The printer is supposed to be a fairly high quality device, for those looking to make UV transfers, but he found some pretty nasty software hiding on the included USB. Coward, who's also behind theSerial Hobbyism YouTube channel, got pretty lucky when his computer Antivirus flagged software on the included Procolored software installation USB stick as malicious. It picked the malware as being Floxif, a worm known for devastating computers that is usually shared via USB. It's not quite as scary asransomware on a CPU, but it's still fortunate, he did not go ahead with the installation. Instead, Coward tried to download and install it fresh from the website, but still was flagged for viruses along the way. He smartly contacted Procolored to ask them about the problem. The company informed him it was a false positive, and further encouraged him to install the software. Thankfully Coward didn't, and instead turned to the internet for more more help on the issue. It turned out there were quite a few people talking about finding viruses in Procolored's software, so he brought the problem to Reddit. Thankfully the white-hats were happy to help, and they all reported finding viruses on the software. One of these heroes, Karsten Hahn, Principle Malware Researcher at G DATA CyberDefense said “I checked the files yesterday and found several files with XRed backdoor and a malicious Coinminer. There is no doubt that several files provided in the download section are malicious.” While Hahn didn't find Floxif in the downloadable software, they did discover a backdoor and a trojancryptocurrencystealer, or clipbanker in the package. The good news is the backdoor pointed to an address that's unused and out of date, so is likely harmless. The weird thing here is that the clipbanker was new, so he dubbed it SnipVex, and it turns out to be a bit nastier than originally implied. SnipVex looks as though its primary design is to steal cryptocurrency, but those addresses haven't been used as far as Hahn could tell, since last year. Instead the current threat here is the ability to infect other files and cause more problems. Thankfully it's not the most difficult to fix, but it's still fairly insidious. A quick reinstall is always the best course of action here. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Hahn also notes that while a few of his counterparts on Reddit feel this software was placed intentionally, it seems unlikely. All these old addresses don't exactly grant the attacker anything. If anything it's more likely that this has happened as an accident, but Procolored's response is still very disappointing. This is a friendly reminder that if something seems pretty suspicious when downloading or installing software, it likely is. Even if it comes with a $6,000 machine. Plus it never hurts to get online and check if your friendly neighbourhood hackers can help investigate these things. If you're looking to purchase one of these machines I'd recommend givingHahn's breakdown on the virusesa good read. It gives you a better idea of the kind of nefarious things hiding in these software packages, what they can do, and what to look for. Stay safe out there, everyone.

    "article_text": "Reach out and touch, faith! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Something that always impresses me in videogame tech is our ability to make it feel like you're doing something you're not. It's wild how quickly we get used to pushing buttons to control our virtual selves. Feedback for these interactions, on the other hand, has always been one of the weakest factors when it comes to interacting with these digital worlds. Things like rumble feedback, andeven smell-a-visioncan help with this, but they still don't really come close to approximating touch. VR is one of the fields making the strongest advancements with all kinds of haptic feedbacks, partially because it's so often used for tech outside of games. These little innovations, usually designed for specific tasks, often make their way back to the gaming world. One such enhancement I'm hoping to see come to games is something a bit like this origami based Shiftly. A device designed to use complex folds to mimic various shapes and surfaces for use in VR. IEEE Spectrumspotted Shiftly after itssister paperpublished a study where people tried out the device blindfolded and reported their feedback. It was then further tested in VR, and tested again at a conference in Los Angeles. Each time the users were asked to touch the device and then match it up with an image that most likely resembled what they were feeling. The resulting consensus seems to be that this little origami machine does a decent job of replicating most simple surfaces. Moreover it can do it relatively quickly thanks to the origami design. For simple transitions, it can take as little as 0.25 seconds for Shiftly to transform. Even more complex ones take only around 4 seconds to complete a transition. Curves and waves seem to offer the best representation, while sharp diamond shapes were the most difficult to identify. Of course, Shiftly can't do anything more complicated like a mug handle, yet, but it's still cool to see what it is capable of so far. “This could indicate that Shiftly can provide plausible haptic feedback for a wide range of surface geometries,” says Tobias Batik, an associate researcher at the Complexity Science Hub. Batik started work on Shiftly for his master’s thesis with the Virtual & Augmented Reality Group at TU Wien, in Austria. As the tech is new, the use for videogames is fairly limited but it has my mind racing with possibility. Even in its current iteration, I can imagine using it to enhance my VR gaming experience. Imagine a game like No Man's Sky where the different rock minerals on some of thetrillions of new planets to be addedhave different textures when you touch them. Or even feeling slightly different handles for weapons you pick up in something likeGorn. Maybe a TekDek style finger skating game with ramps, or bomb defuser game likeKeep Talking and Nobody Explodeswith a morphing tactile box. For now, my dreams will remain dreams, but I'm hopeful we'll start to see some of these advanced haptics make their way to gaming soon. For now I'll have to settle for my gloriousVR treadmill anticswithout anything fun to touch. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Help with today's Wordle if you need it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. OurWordletips are small but mighty, here to make your guesses gleam without taking up all of your precious time. Use them alongside the May 22 (1433) clue for maximum effect, the two combined into a powerful puzzle solving force that'll either give you a fantastic start or show you how to turn a tough game around. And whatever happens, today's Wordle answer is here if you need it.You'd think that having three green letters grouped together and plenty of free lines underneath would be cause for celebration, wouldn't you? But today I only felt stumped. What? How? That's not how words w-ah. Several embarrassing attempts later, I finally saw what I'd missed earlier. Oops. You'll need to get your technical bookmaking hat on if you want to win today. This word describes a sheet of paper in a book, folded to create four pages. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. If you're new to the daily Wordle puzzle or you just want a refresher after taking a break, I'll share some quick tips to help you win. There's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day. You're not up against a timer, so you've got all the time in the world—well, until midnight—to find the winning word. If you're stuck, there's no shame in coming back to the puzzle later in the day and finishing it up when you've cleared your head. You've got this. The answer to the May 22 (1433) Wordle isFOLIO. Keeping track of the last handful of Wordle answers can help to eliminate current possibilities. It's also handy for inspiring opening words or subsequent guesses if you're short on ideas for the day. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Here are the last 10 Wordle answers: Wordle presents you with six rows of five boxes every day and the aim is to figure out the correct five-letter word by entering guesses and eliminating or confirming individual letters. Getting off to a good start witha strong wordlike ARISE—something containing multiple vowels, common consonants, and no repeat letters—is a good tactic. Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "title": "In an uncontroversial move that will bother no one, Lies of P is getting an easy mode",
    "article_text": "It'll also get other new modes in a free update, when its Overture expansion drops. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Lies of P, the Dark Souls-flavored RPG starring Pinocchio, will get a big expansion later this year in the form of Overture. To complement the new content, the game will receive a free update at around the same time, introducing a Boss Rush mode, a \"Battle Memories\" mode that will let us tweak the difficulty settings of the game's boss battles, and—uncontroversially—two new difficulty modes. When the free update drops in summer, Lies of P will get not one buttwonew easier difficulty modes, named 'Butterfly's Guidance' and 'Awakened Puppet'. This flies against conventional Soulslike logic, though for exactly what reason depends on who you ask. For Souls creatorHidetaka Miyazaki himself, overcoming insurmountable odds is \"a fundamental part of the experience. Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy—which, in my eyes, would break the game itself\". This debate crops up at least biannually, and is usually fought brutally. It's possible to have complex views on the easy mode question, though my views are uncomplex: Lies of P succeeds because it's tense, and if the tension is siphoned out of it, so is a core aspect of its appeal. Am I glad that people who want an easy mode will get one? No. I don't think all things should be for all people: that's dumb. If that was a universally obeyed truth, we wouldn't have niche modern classics like Baldur's Gate 3, Clair Obscur, or Labyrinth of the Demon King. But also Neowiz made the game and they can do what they want, I guess. In a roundtable discussion attended byVGC, game director Jiwon Choi explained that the team wanted \"to make sure a wider audience of players could play the game\". Player feedback naturally had a hand in it too: \"We have a lot of feedback from customers, and from our developers. So by making development adjustments and introducing these difficulty options, we can offer the experience to different types of players. This broadens the base.\" The new difficulty modes will apply to both the base game and the expansion campaign, which is apparently set in a frosty zoo. After Overture, the Neowiz team will focus its entire attention on a sequel to Lies of P.It's a little rude of Lies of P to kickstart the difficulty debate again so close toElden Ring: Nightreign, which will inevitably bring the easy mode question kicking and screaming back into \"the discourse\". I suggest taking a side and maintaining a smug sense of superiority over your ideological adversaries: it may seem slightly undignified to anyone watching from the sidelines, but it sure feels good.

    "title": "Final Fantasy 15's longest boss fight is coming to Magic: The Gathering, hopefully it won't take 30 days to defeat",
    "article_text": "Become a tortoise toppler with our exclusive preview card. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While other long-running series struggle to reinvent themselves when the formula gets stale, Final Fantasy benefits from the way each game is something new. That said, we do love to see how Biggs and Wedge and crystals and all the other recurring elements are reinterpreted each time. Final Fantasy 16 going all grim and Game of Thrones-y wouldn't have the same impact if characters hadn't been riding bright yellow chocobos while swearing and hacking each other to gory bits. Final Fantasy 15 reimagined the JRPG as a road trip across America, only instead of oversized roadside attractions being like the World's Biggest Ball of Twine, they're gigantic creatures you can hunt. The adamantoise, a chelonian monster that's appeared in various forms since Final Fantasy 2, showed up in FF15 as a straight-up kaiju with a mountain on its back. Depending what level you were and how effectively you'd stacked buffs, fighting it could take hours. The Ancient Adamantoise is just as tough to kill in Magic: The Gathering's Final Fantasy crossover. It's got a toughness of 20 and three points of ward you have to get through each time you attack it. However, it also tanks every point of damage you and your creatures would normally take, and it doesn't heal back to full at the end of the turn. Just like the videogame superboss, it can be killed by repeatedly hitting it in the toe over the course of several hours. (Several hours is not a joke. It's got5,624,000 hit points. Before the game's release, Final Fantasy director Hajime Tabate suggested that it might takeas many as 30 in-game days or 15 real-time hours to defeat.) Killing the Ancient Adamantoise in the videogame is worth that chunk of your limited time on Earth because it rewards you with an amulet that maxes out your hit points, some useful adamantite material for crafting spells with, and meat you can cook in one of FF15's typically lavish meals by combining it with Kettier Ginger for a boost to your attack, HP, and regen. That stack of rewards is also translated into Magic: The Gathering, where killing the Ancient Adamantoise will earn you 10 treasure tokens, each of which can be spent for a point of mana—though they enter tapped so you can't use them straight away. Still, that's a pretty good haul that will make your next turn a game changer. When your opponent drops eight mana on the Ancient Adamantoise, they're not just playing a Big Boy—they're throwing down a challenge. Topple this tortoise before they kill you with it, and the whole match might be yours. FF15 is also represented in cards representing afishing minigame, and one of the15 different Cids you can have in your deck all at once. Cid's often an airship pilot or inventor in other games, but in FF15 he just runs the garage where you get your car repaired. Though eventually you can turn it into a flying machine, as seen in the art for Ancient Adamantoise, where it's about to get chomped and taken back to the shop for maintenance yet again. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Magic: The Gathering—Final Fantasywill be released on June 13. It's the first of Magic's Universes Beyond crossover sets to be legal in standard format, as will its follow-ups like Spider-Man and Avatar: The Last Airbender.

    "title": "Mafia: The Old Country: all the key details on the gritty gangster prequel",
    "article_text": "From release date to gameplay info, here’s everything we know about Mafia: The Old Country. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Mafia: The Old Country is quickly approaching, and it seems like we’re in for a summertime trip to Sicily with a deadly twist. The Mafia series is no stranger to exploring period settings, covering the US Prohibition era of the 1930s, post-WW2 in the '40s and '50s and the Vietnam war era of the late '60s. However, the next entry will go further back in the mob’s history than ever before. Plotting the rise of the Cosa Nostra all the way back to its roots, Mafia: The Old Country promises to transport players to a turn-of-the-century Sicily that is as beautiful as it is dangerous. Also, there are horses—how could you not be excited about that? Prior to your initiation into the family I've assembled a hit list of need-to-know info for your trip to Italy: The Old Country's release date, story, gameplay details and all the other intel we have so far. You’ll be a made man in no time. Mafia: The Old Country launches August 8, 2025 on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5, though you can pre-order the game already if you'rereallysure you want to play it. The standard edition of Mafia: The Old Country will set you back$50/£45 on Steam. On the other hand, the Mafia: The Old Country Deluxe Edition sports a price tag of $60/£55. With the lingering threat of a $80 price tag hanging over modern AAA releases, seeing The Old Country sitting at $50 is a sight for sore wallets. Turns out this is a deliberate move from Mafia’s publisher. As 2K president David Ismailer puts it, The Old Country won’t require \"massive time commitments\" and the game’s reduced scope is reflected in its price. I feel like I’m constantly trying to cut through my backlog while balancing a regular diet of 100-hour RPGs and a live service game or two, so I can’t lie: this is an attractive prospect. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. If $50 is still out of your budget and you’re hoping to see Mafia: The Old Country on Xbox Game Pass, there’s unfortunately no word on the game arriving there yet. It’s safe to assume that it won’t be on Game Pass at launch. From the flashes of lightning that cut across the clouded skies of San Celeste to the glinting, rusted surface of Enzo’s trusty switchblade, all signs point to Mafia: The Old Country being a strikingly beautiful and detailed game. Seeing sweat on the brow of a suspected rat or the dust kicked up by the wheel of your race car is nice and all but it does come at a cost. As with any game developed in Unreal Engine 5, The Old Country will probably have any budget gaming setup absolutely begging for mercy. CheckMafia: The Old Country's system requirementsto see if your rig is up to snuff before you start planning your mafioso career. Our first look at Mafia: The Old Country came way back in 2024 with ateaser trailerfirst revealed at Gamescom. With the teaser’s moody, candlelit shots of religious art and shotgun shells, the scene was well and truly set for a dramatic return to the old country. But we were still in the dark about what exactly to expect. December 2024 brought‘The Initiation’ trailer, and with it came a whole lot more information about Mafia: The Old Country and its story. Here’s where we first met our protagonist, Enzo. We get plenty of glimpses into Enzo’s brutal past, his beginnings with the Mafia, and the high-stakes decisions that lie in his future. Released May 2025, thelatest trailerfor Mafia: The Old Country gave the most in-depth look at its gameplay so far. Alongside what to expect from combat and traversal, this trailer also showed plenty of scenic locations for Enzo to neck-stab and shoot his way through. Stemware goes flying and bottles explode during a physics-heavy shootout in a lavish dining hall, while some underground ruins Enzo sneaks through give off serious Indiana Jones vibes. The Old Country stars Enzo Favara, a young man living in 1900s Sicily—a time period that definitely seems referential to The Godfather Part 2's depiction of the early years of Vito Corleone. Any good hero needs a tragic beginning and Enzo definitely fits the bill. He’s acarusu:an orphaned laborer who spent his childhood toiling in the sulfur mines of San Celeste. A life of organized crime under the Torrisi family is the ultimate path to freedom for him, but it’s going to come at a cost. Enzo’s journey with the Cosa Nostra serves as a prequel to the established Mafia series, exploring the early days of mob life and the brutal sacrifices made in their rise to power. Oh, and did I mention Enzo has a romantic subplot with Don Torrisi’s daughter, Isabella? Yeah… good luck with that. If you’re the kind of person who refuses to play the Yakuza series in English, you might be wondering if you can experience Mafia: The Old Country’s story in Italian. Despite the availability of Italian interface and subtitles, the game won’t feature the option to have a full Italian voiceover. This news certainlyruffled some featherswhen it first emerged, but Hangar 13 were quick to clear things up. In pursuit of authenticity, Mafia: The Old Country offers voice acting in Sicilian: a language that’s similar but ultimately distinct from Italian. Horses (particularly their heads) certainly don’t have the best history in mob media. Though it seems like Mafia: The Old Country’s treatment of our equine pals is a little less Godfather and a little more Seabiscuit. True to the game’s rural setting, Enzo and his fellow mafiosi opt to ride horseback. It looks like a fun, era-appropriate choice, but unlike Red Dead Redemption The Old Country isn't a gigantic open world game, so don't expect to be riding across an entire map of Sicily.Gallivanting around on your horsey seems like it would seriously kill your street cred in Mafia 1's Lost Heaven but hey, we’re back in the old country now. They also won’t be your only mode of transportation. You can tear through the picturesque countryside in a whole host of slick classic cars. Anyone who’s struggled through ‘that race’ in the first Mafia game knows that vintage vehicles aren’t exactly the pinnacle of speed and handling, but they sure do look cool. So, maybe that’s a worthwhile trade-off. In terms of combat, Mafia: The Old Country promises a combination of scrappy knife fights, stealthy takedowns, and intense cover shooting. The focus this time is on a tightly linear experience, but hopefully the mix of stealth and shooting will leave some room to experiment with your playstyle. Is your Enzo a slick assassin, or a hell-for-leather killer? Or one of those bumbling stooges who can never pull off a clean hit? I guess only time will tell. More recent games in the Mafia series have set players up to expect a (somewhat meandering) open world experience. But with this upcoming entry, developer Hangar 13 is aiming to trim the fat and deliver a “focused, linear” story that’s “gritty, grounded, brutal and emotional.” That’s a win for lovers of narrative-driven games, obviously. But it means good things for your wallet too, as this pared-back scale directly translates to Mafia: The Old Country’s lower price.

    "title": "World of Warcraft game director details which combat add-ons are safe and which will be eliminated in the coming purge",
    "article_text": "The process is just beginning, and they won't be turned off in the next two patches, he said. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. World of Warcraft senior game director Ion Hazzikostasrecently warned playersthat add-ons and mods that predict or help players respond to things happening in combat will be disabled in the future. We caught up with him in a far-ranging interview to find out what, specifically, would be affected and why. \"You have your quest helpers, you have your gathering add-ons, you have your role-playing add-ons, all of that stuff is no concern,\" he said. PvP add-ons might still tell you what classes you're facing, but won't tell you what cooldowns they've used. Auction house add-ons won't be touched. \"The goal is at the end of the day to get to a point where if asked, 'Hey, do I need to use add-ons to play?' the answer is, 'Well, they'll give you a lot of options to customize your experience, but no, it's up to you.' Today, if we're being honest, we can't say that.\" He said Blizzard definitely won't take away combat log or aura hooks in patches 11.1.7 or 11.2—which leaves the door open for the final patches of the The War Within expansion, including the pre-patch for the upcoming Midnight expansion later this year, as a possible starting point. \"This is meant to be a philosophical kickoff and to begin the conversation with the community,\" Hazzikostas said. \"Add-ons have been part of the game since its very earliest days. If we were to just come along one day and rip off that band-aid, it would be jarring.\" Blizzard is taking these steps in part because of player complaints about how many add-ons are needed to successfully complete raid and dungeon encounters, according to Hazzikostas. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Blizzard will be working on improvements to the in-game Cooldown Manager, visual effects, improvements to the game's UI Edit Mode, audio cues and the handling of nameplates for players and enemies. Hazzikostas said the company heard loud and clear the player feedback to the first, basic rollout of the Cooldown Manager, which was part of therecent troubled 11.1.5 patch. Players decried its simplicity, lack of functionality and the fact that it could not be customized. Ironically, some mod-makers immediately created add-ons to improve it. Above: A recent Reddit post reacting to the Cooldown Manager. \"We know we're not going to replace a fully in-depth, customizable add-on that you've been using for years and tailored to your personal gameplay with something that we have as an initial, fixed offering,\" he said. \"But we're getting a whole bunch of feedback about the ways in which it would need to change. We need to add customization and improve it, to make it feel like it could be a reasonable substitute for a more-advanced power user.\" The task ahead of Blizzard will be challenging, he said, but added that having a fixed development team and slower update cycle doesn't mean that Blizzard's solutions have to be a \"we have details at home\"meme situation—or that maybe it's okay if it is. \"Some of it is being guided by feedback to understand how we can bridge that gap for a majority of our players, and also to some extent accepting, and hopefully getting folks to accept, that it is 96 percent of perfect,\" Hazzikostas said. We're always going to be listening. Our hope is that the things we add are going to be things that can be reskinned and tweaked by add-on developers. \"Your performance relying on [rotation helper] Hekili is still inferior to someone who has it all ingrained as muscle memory. There's always a higher skill ceiling. Is it a critical flaw if the highlighted combat assist recommendation for your next ability is not reflecting the latest theorycraft that was discovered yesterday? I don't know if that should be a dealbreaker.\" He said he was open to the idea of allowing player-shared loadouts, like the text strings currently used to share talents. That might improve Rotation Assist for those who wanted the latest theorycrafting. \"That's an interesting idea,\" he said. \"This topic has come up in the context of Edit Mode layouts, and other things we want to empower people to share.\" The overwhelming majority of add-ons won't be affected by the changes, Hazzikostas stressed. Blizzard considers this a continued collaboration with add-on developers, perhaps even to the extent of partnerships that would allow amateur developers to contribute ideas or coding approaches. \"Everything is possible,\" he said. \"I don't want to close doors. We're always going to be listening. Our hope is that the things we add are going to be things that can be reskinned and tweaked by add-on developers.\" Hazzikostas said the team had discussed many approaches, and believed this was the least invasive path that would still accomplish the goal. \"This is not us setting out to smash a bunch of add-ons,\" he said. \"The way we're approaching it is, 'What's the least collateral damage that we can cause while addressing this issue?' \"The goal is to build up the native functionality of our UI to increasingly narrow the gap between players who are using add-ons that assist with competitive functions and those who are not. Once we are most of the way there, there's going to be that last mile that consists of things that honestly we don't think are super healthy for the game.\" That's when the functionality would be turned off, he said. This is not us setting out to smash a bunch of add-ons. The way we're approaching it is, 'What's the least collateral damage that we can cause while addressing this issue?' Previously, Blizzard experimented with private auras that could not be read by add-ons and WeakAuras. But players circumvented that with in-game macros that told the mods when players saw they had conditions that had been kept secret. \"The aura is private, but you can just make a separate macro that pipes the information in, and now whoops, you wiped because someone hit the wrong macro or had a typo in their macro and great, we've succeeded in making it even more frustrating,\" Hazzikostas said. \"Let's never do this again.\" The company is building in all of this functionality in part because they know players will find ever-more-circuitous routes to getting the information if they don't. If boss ability timelines aren't a thing, he suggested, players might turn to YouTube videos or recorded sound files that would provide audio countdowns when pressed at the start of a heavily scripted encounter. Dungeon and raid fights will still be just as challenging, he said, just not in a way that requires perfectly-working WeakAuras. \"Our goal is to deliver a baseline, a consistent level of difficulty that meets players' expectations. I've seen discussion of whether WoW is harder than it used to be. If you measure that by player success rates, then no,\" Hazzikostas said. \"We might tune a Heroic end boss for Ahead of the Curve to be something that's going to take a couple dozen attempts, for a guild that's in the core audience. What it takes to hit that mark has continually increased in terms of complexity, because our players have gotten more sophisticated.\" With this move, Blizzard hopes to dismantle the arms race between add-on developers and boss mechanics. A fight like Blood Queen Lana'thel in Icecrown Citadel had one simple mechanic—who to bite when you had a vampiric lust and were about to be mind controlled—that ramped in difficulty over the course of the fight. It would have been trivialized by a combat WeakAura, he noted. \"No stress, no confusion, no need for communication, no need for backups. A fight that had exciting frantic moments in 2009, 2010 gets transformed into something that's pretty ho-hum,\" Hazzikostas said. In modern raids, players might see happy changes like a reduction in the number of bosses that frequently place random damage swirls on the ground, a mechanic the team has come to lean on because add-ons can't predict or help with it, he said. \"Our classes weren't designed under the assumption that you're going to have unpredictable movements every few seconds,\" making those encounters less fun for caster characters, he said. \"We just want more variety in a diverse design space.\" The toughest modern bosses with mechanics that require players to clump up or head to specific spots might give a few more seconds to respond, or have fewer spots to go, in a world without combat add-ons, he said. \"If we know it's being solved for you, and you're just being told to run to diamond, how is that challenging?\" Hazzikostas asked. \"How do we make it challenging? The only way is to only give you two and a half seconds so that you need some movement boost. You're taking a warlock gate from point A to point B, because otherwise anyone could do this.\" These changes will likely not be implemented in Classic, where the team is careful to avoid messing with history. New features like the damage meter might be rolled out, but combat log and aura access is unlikely to be turned off, Hazzikostas said. In the modern game, Blizzard knows this will force its developers to be better about making mechanics visible and readable. \"I think, frankly, this will stop letting us off the hook when we fail to do so,\" he said. \"If you're riding a Katamari ball on Stix and if you run into one of these three nameplates you wipe the raid, but there are 90 things on screen, good luck visually parsing that. \"There are nameplate attachments and things the community has come up with to help solve that problem. We should have solved that problem.\" Visual customization of nameplates, including how big they are or what they look like, will still be allowed, he said—but using conditional logic to change the way they look because of something the player or enemy is doing or a buff or debuff they have likely won't be. \"This is all pretty speculative,\" Hazzikostas said, as the team is still working to solve the problems that players have created mods for. Lethal casts in dungeons, for example, should be telegraphed much better, perhaps negating the need for mods that alert players when something bad is coming. Tracking of group abilities will no longer function in add-ons after the changes, so things like other players' cooldowns won't be visible, he said. That might, in turn, lead to dungeons with fewer interrupts in a pack of mobs, which might in turn lead to less reliance on classes with abilities that stop a whole pack of enemies from casting. Incoming heals will no longer be trackable, nor will specialized buffs or debuffs. But if they needed to be, that should be built into the base game, Hazzikostas said. \"It should be part of the default UI,\" he said. \"Same is true for tank swaps. If we're building an encounter where once your co-tank reaches four stacks of some negative effect, you need to taunt immediately, we should be giving you much better information to make that apparent. That's on us.\" Another issue they want to make more visible is diminishing returns in PvP and PvE, where stuns or other crowd control become less effective after repeated casts, until an enemy is immune. \"We have this very important mechanic and really, unless you're using an add-on, it's not super obvious,\" he said. \"We should make that obvious.\" At the end of the day, the game should be just as easy or difficult as it is right now, he said, but for different reasons. \"Part of the goal of mechanics is to create a problem that needs to be solved and a bit of challenge that feels satisfying once you overcome it,\" Hazzikostas said. \"The goal is to keep similar numbers of wipe counts for Normal, Heroic and Mythic encounters, early versus late, similar success rates. But to tailor that to a world where the problems are, once again, in players' own flesh-and-blood hands to solve, not an algorithm that they've downloaded.\" Heather Newman has reported on games for more than 25 years, with an internationally syndicated column and stories in dozens of magazines. In World of Warcraft, her Mythic Plus dungeon team was No. 1 in all-star points in North America for a number of weeks for slightly cheesy reasons. She scored one measly point against Jonathan “Fatal1ty” Wendel in Unreal Tournament and was, exceedingly briefly, top 50 world in Halo.

    "title": "Anthropic's new Claude 4 models promise the biggest AI brains ever",
    "article_text": "Smart enough to beat Pokémon When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Anthropic has unveiled Claude 4, the latest generation of its AI models. The company boasts that the new Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 models are at the top of the game for AI assistants with unmatched coding skills and the ability to function independently for long periods of time. Claude Sonnet 4 is the smaller model, but it's still a major upgrade in power from the earlier Sonnet 3.7. Anthropic claims Sonnet 4 is much better at following instructions and coding. It's even been adopted by GitHub to power a new Copilot coding agent. It's likely to be much more widely used simply because it is the default model on the free tier for the Claudechatbot. Claude Opus 4 is the flagship model for Anthropic and supposedly the best coding AI around. It can also handle sustained, multi-hour tasks, breaking them into thousands of steps to fulfill. Opus 4 also includes the \"extended thinking\" feature Anthropic tested on earlier models. Extended thinking allows the model to pause in the middle of responding to a prompt and use search engines and other tools until it has more data and can resume right where it left off. That means a lot more than just longer answers. Developers can train Opus 4 to use all kinds of third-party tools. Opus 4 can even play video games pretty well, with Anthropic showing off how the AI performs during a game of Pokémon Red when given file access and permission to build its own navigation guide. Both Claude 4 models boast enhanced features centered around tool use and memory. Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 can use tools in parallel and switch between reasoning and searching. And their memory system can save and extract key facts over time when provided access to external files. You won't have to re-explain what you want on every third prompt. To make sure the AI is doing what you want, but not overwhelm you with every detail, Claude 4's models also offer what it calls “thinking summaries.” Instead of a wall of text detailing each of the potentially thousands of steps taken to complete a prompt, Claude employs a smaller, secondary AI model to condense the train of thought into something digestible. A side benefit of the way the new models work is that they're less likely to cheat to save time and processing power. Anthropic said they’ve reduced shortcut-seeking behavior in tasks that tempt AIs to fake their way to a solution (or just make something up). Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The bigger picture? Anthropic is clearly gunning for the lead in AI utility, particularly in coding and agentic, independent tasks. ChatGPT and Google Gemini have bigger user bases, but Anthropic has the means to entice at least some AI chatbot users away to Claude. With Sonnet 4 available to free users and Opus 4 bundled into Claude Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans, Anthropic is trying to appeal to both the budget-friendly and premium AI fans.

    "title": "Samsung's QLED, Neo QLED, and Frame TVs get a Star Wars makeover thanks to a new Disney Art collection drop",
    "article_text": "Pixar, Disney, and National Geographic are also included When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Samsungalready doubled down on its Art Mode and Art Store earlier in 2025 by expanding it to nearly its entire TV lineup, well beyond theFrame TVorFrame Pro. And if you’ve ever wished you could pick an iconic piece of art from theStar Warsuniverse – maybe an AT-AT on Hoth or an X-Wing – or something from the world of Disney like Snow White, Samsung’s answering the call. Beyond the thousands of art pieces already available on theArt Store, Samsung has now dropped a collection of pieces in partnership with Disney. The collection goes beyond the iconic classic Disney animated films to includeStar Wars, Pixar, and National Geographic. All of the pieces, be they animated or a wild shot of nature, are in4Kquality to ensure they’ll look their best on your Samsung TV. Now, it’s not a free drop – you’ll need to be subscribed toSamsung’s Art Storeand have an eligible TV. That membership is either $4.99 a month or $49.99 a year in the United States and lets you access all the pieces, including future drops. While Art Mode and these works of art will look their best on a Samsung Frame TV or Frame Pro, thanks to the special reflection-blocking, matte finish, you’re not limited to that specific family of TVs. Samsung’s expanded Art Mode support to QLED, Neo QLED 4K, and Neo QLED8KTVs within the 2025 lineup means you don’t need to opt for a Frame TV or Frame Pro. And that also means you might be able to save a bit, as Samsung’s lifestyle TVs do cost a bit more in some cases. This also isn’t the first time Disney, Star Wars, Pixar, and National Geographic pieces of art have been available on Samsung’s TVs. In 2023, timed for the Disney 100 anniversary, Samsung dropped the limited-edition The Frame-Disney100 Edition in 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch sizes. It was a standard 4K QLED Frame TV with a special, platinum metal bezel, but the real appeal was that it came with 100 pieces of Disney art ready to go out of the box. No extra subscription needed as you could look through the collections and pick your favorites, and then set them to your Art Mode. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It remains to be seen how many pieces are included in the Art Store and whether they’re the same as what was previously collaborated on. We’ve reached out to Samsung to ask, but for fans of Pixar –Toy Story, anyone? – Star Wars, National Geographic, and Disney at large, it’s certainly a fun addition. With this latest drop, Samsung’s Art Store offers over 3,500 pieces of art to pick from, and on TVs with Art Mode, you can set your favorites to be shown when the TV is off and even mat them for a more dramatic effect, if you like.

    "title": "Intel could be releasing a video card with TWO GPU chips and 48GB of memory; could it be a sleeper hit for AI training?",
    "article_text": "High memory and dual GPUs sound ideal When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Intelmay be preparing to launch an unusual graphics card featuring two Arc B580 GPU chips and 48GB of memory, reports have claimed. While this isn’t an official Intel product, it appears to be a custom design developed by one of Intel’s board partners, who remains unnamed due to non-disclosure agreements. What makes this card notable is the return of a dual-GPU layout using consumer-class chips, something the industry hasn’t seen in several years. This particular model reportedly combines two B580 GPUs, each paired with 24GB of memory, for a total of 48GB on a single card. The intent doesn't appear to be gaming, which raises questions about the target audience. Given the high memory and compute potential, one possibility is that it’s intended for AI development or other high-throughput workloads. Although 48GB still falls short of the memory capacity in top-tier professional accelerators, using consumer-grade GPUs could offer a cost-effective alternative for some training scenarios. Still, without performance benchmarks or detailed architectural information, it’s difficult to determine whether this configuration could compete with even midrange professional GPUs. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! For users comparing it against thebest GPUscurrently available, skepticism is warranted. No other board partners have been linked to similar designs, and it remains unclear whether this is a one-off experiment or part of a broader strategy. This development may also interest content creators. With such a high memory ceiling, it could appeal to users seeking thebest laptops for video editingorfor Photoshop, assuming future mobile variants emerge. But until more technical data is released, this card is best regarded as a curiosity rather than a sure bet.

    "title": "12 super-useful new tools from Google I/O 2025 you can actually try right now",
    "article_text": "The full list of new Gemini-powered tools that have actually shipped When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google I/O events are an often frustrating glimpse of the near future, with a lot of shiny software toys scheduled to land sometime \"in the coming months\". That often means a long wait of up to a year, so for Google I/O 2025 we've rounded every new announcement that you can actually try today. Naturally, some of the features below come with restrictions – a few are only available to try now in the US, while some are restricted to subscribers of Google's AI Pro or AI Ultra tiers. But many have also rolled out worldwide, so there are new features to take for a spin even if you don't currently pay Google a cent. What's missing from the list below and coming at a later date? Quite a bit actually, including some of the more futuristic ideas likeGoogle BeamandAndroid XR, and it also isn't clear how long we'll have to wait for a worldwide rollout of AI Mode for Search, Veo 3, Flow, Virtual Try On in the Shopping app, and Google's top-tier AI Ultra plan. Still, there are quite a few things from Google I/O 2025 to keep us amused in the meantime, so here's a list of the ones that are available to try today... Google completelyupended its golden goose, Search, at I/O 2025 this week, announcing several new features to stave off the threat of ChatGPT – and the biggest was arguably the US rollout of AI Mode. If you're in the US and aren't seeing the new tab in Search (or in the search bar of the Google app), it's likely because Google said it'd be a gradual roll-out \"over the coming weeks\". We've been using it for a while, though, and have put together a guide onhow to master the new AI mode. It shouldn't be your go-to for everything, but we've concluded that \"if you’re researching, planning, comparing, or learning, AI Mode can be a real comfort\". Google hasn't yet commented on when it'll get a worldwide launch, but we'd imagine it'll be sometime this year. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Arguably the biggest breakthrough moment at Google I/O 2025, Veo 3 is the first AI video generator that can deliver synchronized audio (including speech) alongside its video creations. And it's available to try now for a lucky few, if you're in the US and on the new Gemini Ultra plan. Granted, that is a pretty small group of people, but we had to include it in this list because it is actually available today for those lucky peeps, and US enterprise users on the Vertex AI platform. The amount of processing power required for Veo 3 could mean a relatively slow rollout elsewhere, and Google has hinted as much by also releasing new features for Veo 2 like the ability to give it reference scenes. Not sure how to weave all of your AI videos together into a cohesive whole? Google also addressed that issue with a new AI video editor called Flow – and like Veo 3, it's out now for AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the US. It's a bit like a Premiere Pro that you can operate entirely with natural language, to avoid learning keyboard shortcuts or complex menus. To get an idea of how it works, check outGoogle's short tutorial. Impressively, it goes as far as giving you menus of camera moves like 'dolly out' and 'pan right', so you don't even have to describe them. Google has also at least promised that it's \"coming soon\" to more countries, so we're hopeful of a wider rollout in 2025. The big smartphone story of Google I/O 2025 was the full rollout of one of thebest AI toolsaround on Android and iOS – Gemini Live. Like ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode, Gemini Live is an AI assistant that you can chat to using your voice. The most useful part, though, is that you can also give it eyes using your phone's camera to get help with whatever's in front of you or on your screen. To conjure the assistant, open the Gemini app on iOS or Android, tap the Gemini Live icon (on the far right of the text input box), and start chatting away. Google didn't just level-up its AI-generated video at I/O 2025 – we also got a new Imagen 4 model for whipping up still images in higher resolution (now up to 2K) than before. The latest Imagen (which is available now in the Gemini app,Whisk, Vertex AI and across Google Workspace) also showed that it's been working hard on one of its main weaknesses – handling text. This means that scenes involving typography should no longer be a jumbled mess of weird characters and look more realistic. While Imagen 4 is available to use for free, it does come with usage limits – you can expect 10-20 image generations on a free plan, while Gemini subscribers get a more generous 100-150 generations a day. Okay, Gemini 2.5 Flash isn't brand new, but it was given a big upgrade at Google I/O 2025 – and it's now available to everyone to dabble with in the Gemini app. In fact, Gemini 2.5 Flash is now the default model in Google's Geminichatbot, because it's apparently the fastest and more cost-efficient one for daily use. Some of the specific improvements, over its 2.0 Flash predecessor, include a greater ability to understand images and text. Wondering how it compares to ChatGPT 4o? We've alreadycompared the twoto help you see which might be the best for you. Spoiler: it's a close call, but Gemini 2.5 Flash is particularly appealing if you live in Google's world of apps and services. Need a coding assistant to speed up your workflow? Google has just given Jules (first introduced as a Labs experiment last December) a wider public beta rollout, with no waiting lists. Jules is a bit more than a coding copilot – it can autonomously beaver away on fixing bugs, writing tests and building new features without any input from you. It works 'asynchronously', which means it can work on various tasks without waiting for them to finish. Google says Jules isn't trained on your private code and that your data stays within its private environment. With autonomous agents on the rise, it certainly looks worth dabbling with if you could do with some coding assistance. Google Shopping has had a 'Try On' feature for clothes since 2023, but it got a big upgrade it got at Google I/O 2025. Rather than using virtual models to show you how your chosen clothes might fit, it now lets you upload a photo of yourself – and uses AI to help you avoid the hassle of changing rooms. Once you've uploaded a full-length photo of yourself, you'll start to see little \"try it on\" buttons when you click on outfits that are served up in the Shopping tabs search results. We'vetaken it for a spinand, while it isn't flawless, it does give you a solid idea of what some clothes will look like on you. And anything that helps us avoid real-world shopping is fine by us. Google brought its 'Deep Research' feature to Gemini Advanced subscribers (now Gemini Pro) in late 2024. And now the handy reports tool has given a particularly useful upgrade – the ability to combine its research of public data from the web with any private PDFs or images that you uploads. Google provided the example of a market researcher uploading their own internal sales figures so they could cross reference them with public trends. Unfortunately, you can't yet pull in docs or data from Google Drive and Gmail, but Google says this is coming \"soon\". Google is particularly keen to get students using its Gemini app – not only did it extend its free access to Google AI Pro for school and university students to new countries including the UK, it also added a new quiz feature to help with revision. To start a quiz, you can ask Gemini to \"create a practice quiz\" on your chosen subject. The most useful part is that it'll then make a follow-up quiz based on your weaknesses in the previous test. Not that you have to be studying to make use of this feature – it could also be a handy way to sharpen your pub quiz skills. If you're a student in the US, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan and the UK, you can get your free year of Gemini AI Pro by signing up onGemini's students page– the deadline is June 30, 2025 and you will need a valid student email address. We're particularly looking forward to trying outGoogle Beamthis year, with the glasses-free 3D video calls (formerly known as Project Starline) heading to businesses courtesy ofHP's new hardware. But a new video calling feature you can try now is Google Meet's near real-time translations. Available now for AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in beta, the feature will provide an audible translation of your speech (currently in English to Spanish, or vice versa) with a relatively short delay. It isn't seamless, but we imagine the delay will only reduce from here – and Google says more languages are coming \"in the next few weeks\". Google switched up its AI subscription plans at Google I/O 2025, with 'Gemini Advanced' disappearing and being replaced by AI Pro and new 'VIP' tier called AI Ultra. The latter is currently US-only (more countries are \"coming soon\") and costs a staggering $250 a month. Still, that figure does give you \"the best of Google AI\", according to the tech giant, with AI Ultra including access to Veo 3 with native audio generation, Project Mariner, and the highest usage limits across its other AI products. You also getYouTubePremium and 30TB of storage thrown in. The AI Pro tier ($20 a month) still gets you access to Gemini, Flow, Whisk, NotebookLM and Gemini in Chrome, but with lower usage limits and cloud storage of a mere 2TB. If you're an AI power user and like the sound of AI Ultra, Google is currently offering it at 50% off for your first three months. Don't tempt us, Google... Mark is TechRadar's Senior news editor.

    "article_text": "Phison Pascari X200Z SSD declared \"incredible\" in first review When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TweakTownhas delivered its first hands-on look at the Phison Pascari X200Z 3.2TB Enterprise SSD, and – spoiler alert – it was blown away. Built with SLC flash and running over a PCIe Gen5 x4 interface, the X200Z boasts a write endurance rating of 60 drive writes per day (DWPD), translating to an astounding full-drive write every 24 minutes. As Jon Coulter ofTweakTownputs it, “Phison's Pascari X200Z 3.2TB SLC caching SSD is simultaneously the highest capacity, lowest latency, and most endurant flash-based SSD of its kind we've ever encountered.” The X200Z is built for extreme durability in demanding caching roles, especially in front of QLC arrays. It buffers random write workloads, reshapes them into sequential data, and directs them to slower, more fragile QLC layers, enhancing speed, reliability, and overall lifespan of the storage system. Coulter notes, “The 3.2TB model we have in hand is rated at 60 DWPD or a mind-bending 350 Petabytes of endurance. Incredible.” The drive also shines on performance. In testing, it surpassed its factory specs across the board. Sequential read throughput hit 15,026MB/s - breakingTweakTownlab records - while write performance came in over 10,200MB/s. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! In random workloads, the X200Z hit up to 2800K IOPS and showed strong consistency across all queue depths. Coulter was impressed by the performance curve: “Its low queue depth performance here is stunning.” He adds, “We knew it would be good, but we didn't anticipate the drive's mixed workload performance would be this fantastic. By far the best we've ever seen.” Phison positions its Pascari line as enterprise-grade, offering flexibility in U.2 and E3.S form factors and support for dual-port configurations. The Pascari X200 Series already has design wins across data centers, video platforms, and HPC workloads. Coulter concludes: “Phison's Pascari X200Z 3.2TB SSD is easily the most powerful flash-based SSD we've ever tested.” Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

For phones – iPhone or Android – that means, say, at least a 20-watt wall plug and then a USB-C to USB-C cable. It doesn’t need to be like this, especially for those who travel. Twelve South, known for excellent accessories that especially complementAppledevices, just dropped the ‘PowerCord.’ Yes, that’s a product name, not something that comes with the product in the box. It’s a USB-C port cable that ends not with a replica of that port but rather a power adapter. Thus, it eliminates the need for a wall brick, and if you’re charging a Pixel 9, aniPhone 16 Pro, a Nintendo Switch, an iPad or Galaxy Tab, or even a MacBook Air, you just plug it in to get the charge going. It’s fairly genius, right? The 30-watt power supply is integrated into the wall plug, and it comes in two lengths – 4-foot or 10-foot. The cable itself is braided and looks fairly heavy-duty from shared images and comes in a slate black or dune white. The wall plug is also non-removable. In fact, the whole design is a closed circle on purpose. That way, you can’t leave one part of the equation at home or behind, so when you need to recharge something, it’s all there, whenever you need it. As of right now, it’s priced at $39.99 for the 4-foot model and $49.99 for the 10-foot model in either color. However, it can only be purchased with a Type-A wall plug. That means it works best in North America, specifically in the United States or Canada. It's up for order now atAmazonor from the brand directly here. TwelveSouth has said that an EU and UK version is on the horizon and will likely drop in mid to late June. That's excellent news, since for frequent travelers, this is a really nice charger, and I like that you can’t leave any part of it at home. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. If it proves to be a success, Twelve South may need to figure out how to put in a larger power supply so it can also handle recharging more power-hungry devices. Even so, as it stands, PowerCord can charge phones, tablets, aDJI Osmo Pocket 3, earbuds and headphones, Bluetooth speakers, smart glasses, headsets, and countless other devices. The product page notes that it’s best for small to medium-sized devices but can trickle-charge other products like laptops. If you’re sold and are in North America, or planning a trip, the PowerCord is up for order and shipping nowdirectly from Twelve South hereandon Amazon here.

    "article_text": "The judge has partially denied CrowdStrike’s motion to dismiss When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Delta’s lawsuit against cybersecurity outfit CrowdStrike got the judge’s green light and will proceed. Earlier this May, Judge Kelly Lee Ellerbe filed their decision with the Fulton County Superior Court, denying CrowdStrike’s motion to dismiss and allowing most of Delta’s claims to move forward. Here is a little context: Last year, cybersecurity company CrowdStrike pushed a faulty update to users on Windows devices, causing widespread disruption. Banks, airlines, TV broadcasters, and many other companies, were unable to operate nominally due to the dreaded Blue Screen of Death popping up across their IT infrastructure. US airline Delta was hit particularly hard. According toThe Register, it took five days to recover, significantly more than rivals American Airlines and United Airlines. What’s more, the same source claims Delta was forced to ground a lot more airplanes compared to other organizations. TechRadar Pro readers can get 60% off Premium Plans at RoboForm now!

This prompted Delta to sue CrowdStrike claiming the company deployed theupdatewithout permission, bypassedMicrosoft’s certification process, and failed to properly test the update before release. CrowdStrike admitted the update was flawed but claims Delta’s delayed recovery was due to its own decisions. The lawsuit included multiple claims, such as breach of contract, trespass, negligence, and fraud. CrowdStrike filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Delta’s claims were invalid. The argument here is that the claims should be limited by the contract under Georgia’s economic loss rule, which generally prevents tort claims for purely financial losses arising from a contract. Delta says CrowdStrike violated independent duties, such as obligations under trespass laws and cybersecurity standards. Now, the judge has partially denied CrowdStrike’s motion to dismiss. Namely, trespass and negligence claims are valid, while fraud claims were upheld in part. The Register spoke to CrowdStrike’s outside counsel, Michael Carlinsky of law firm Quinn Emanuel, who says that the worst-case scenario is the company having to pay “single-digit millions” to Delta. The airline, on the other hand, is “pleased by the ruling”. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!

    "article_text": "You won't be able to resist this Siren(s) song When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you're in need of something to binge this week,Sirenshas arrived and it's definitely worthy of a spot on ourbest Netflix showsround up. The dark comedy-drama, which arrived today (May 22), already has – at the time of this article's publication – an 86% critical score onRotten Tomatoes. Clearly, it's gone down well with plenty of professional writers. For the uninitiated:Sirensis, according to Netflix's ownTudumfan-led website, an \"incisive, sexy, and darkly funny exploration of women, power, and class\". The show's story is told over the course of one very explosive weekend, and sees Meghan Fahy play Devon, the concerned older sibling of Milly Alcock's Simone, who has a very creepy relationship with her new boss Michaela (Julianne Moore). Clearly worried about her younger sister, Devon heads to Michaela's country retreat with the view to holding an intervention for Simone. There are plenty of great reasons why I'm recommendingSirensthis week. With only five episodes, you can easily binge watch it in one or two sittings. Molly Smith Metzler, the playwright behind the highly-enjoyableMaid, which starred Margaret Qualley, created thisNetflixshow, which is based on Metzler's own 2011 playElemano Pea. So, you know this series is in good hands Smith Metzler told Tudum: “This story has a lot of teeth. There are real moments of drama, and it’s going to make people uncomfortable. Operaticis a word I like to use to describe it. It’s a true dark comedy – and it’s got a Greek mythology vibe.” Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The cast is also excellent. Alongside Moore, Fahy, and Alcock, the likes of beloved actor Kevin Bacon. ConsideringPrime Video canceledThe Bondsman,it's nice to see Bacon popping up in a different project, even if I'm still very disappointed to see one of thebest Prime Video showssuddenly come to an abrupt end.It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Glenn Howerton also plays a supporting role, so you really can't get much more star-studded than that. If you lovedNetflix'sThe Four Seasons, this is another picturesque series to gape at, too. Expect great on-location scenes, glamorous wardrobes, and plenty of luxury. It's also full to the brim of mystery and has a sinister undertone, as all is not as it seems on this island enclave. I was sucked in from the get-go and soon realized that I'd streamed three episodes back to back. You'll find yourself desperate to know what's going on, and what's up with Moore's rich philanthropist and animal activist. I'm keen to see more fromSirens, but we'll have to see if Netflix decides to renew it. Lucy is a long-time movie and television lover who is an approved critic on Rotten Tomatoes. She has written several reviews in her time, starting with a small self-ran blog called Lucy Goes to Hollywood before moving onto bigger websites such as What's on TV and What to Watch, with TechRadar being her most recent venture. Her interests primarily lie within horror and thriller, loving nothing more than a chilling story that keeps her thinking moments after the credits have rolled. Many of these creepy tales can be found on the streaming services she covers regularly.

    "title": "Survey says most Gen Z-ers would marry an AI, but I've got more faith in Gen Z",
    "article_text": "A marriage made in ones and zeros When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AI-lationships is the gag-inducing term Joi AI cooked up to support its recent eye-opening survey on human-to-AI relationships. In it, eight out of 10 Gen Z respondents said they would consider marrying an AI partner. Before we delve too much into this mind-bending stat, let's look at the source. Joi AI, formerly EVA AI, is a premium online AI companion service that offers a wide range of AI companion personalities, complete with AI-generated imagery that can be, depending on settings and what you pay, NSFW. It's kind of a cheesy service that caters mostly, I think, to lonely men. Now, don't get me wrong; I know there's a growing epidemic of loneliness. Arecent Harvard studyfound that 21% of US adults report some level of loneliness (some studies suggestthe number is far higher). Remote work, screen time, and other things that take us away from direct human connection are probably not helping this trend, but AI has increasingly stepped into the connection void with a growing army of voice chatbots that can carry on surprisingly realistic and even empathetic-sounding conversations. And this is by design. Earlier this month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose company is building powerful AI models, suggestedwe should all have AI friends. Marriage, then, is perhaps, the next logical extension. The concept of deep, personal relationships between humans and artificial intelligence traces back to well before we hadGemini Live,ChatGPT,Copilot, and others ready and willing to converse with us at length. The 2013 movieHerwas built around the idea of a deeply personal (and concerning) relationship between Joaquin Phoenix's character and Scarlett Johansson's disembodied AI voice long before we could talk to a single AI in real life. I've had my share of AI conversations, and I find them entertaining and,often, illuminating. I don't see them as personal, though. Perhaps that's because I'm not lonely. The more desperate you are for human connection, the more AI companionship might seem like a reasonable substitute. But marriage? At leastJoi AIadds static imagery to the playful banter you'll find through its AI partners, but that's the exception and not the rule. Most generative AI chatbots are just voices and undulating screens. You need images and, ultimately, touch to make a genuine connection... don't you? As I write this, I'm reminded that I met my wife through a phone call and that I was enchanted, initially, by nothing but her voice and wit. But to build our relationship and eventual union, we did date in person. Being with her sealed the deal and made me want to marry her. I don't understand why Joi AI's respondents, even Generation Z, who are much more deeply immersed in technology, social media, and AI than any generation before it, would accept an AI as a life mate. In the survey, though, they do sound primed for AI connection, with 83% saying they \"could build a deep emotional bond with an AI partner.\" One expert I spoke to via email,Dr. Sue Varma, a board-certified psychiatrist and author ofPractical Optimism,put it in perspective for me. \"At our core, we all want the same things: to be seen, to be heard, and to feel valued – not judged or criticized. For Gen Z, that longing is especially strong, and the loneliness they’re experiencing is very real. What they want, what we all want, is meaningful, mutual human connection.\" Would you consider marrying an AI?May 22, 2025 Unconvinced that Joi AI's data points to a real trend (I did ask them for survey details and have yet to receive a response), I ran a couple of anecdotal surveys onX (formerly Twitter)andThreads. Across both, less than 10% said yes, they would consider marrying an AI, roughly a third said no on Threads, and the vast majority wondered if I was okay. As preposterous as I find the whole idea of AI relationships and eventual marriage, I also understand that we're at the start of a revolution. AI's ability to mimic human language and even emotions is growing exponentially, and there's alreadygrowing concern about human-to-AI relationships. \"Technology—and AI in particular—isn’t going away. It’s going to keep evolving, and yes, it may offer relationships that seem easy, even comforting. Think of the always-affirming AI: the hype person, the yes-person, the one that never challenges us and always tells us what we want to hear. It’s seductive. But it’s not real,\" saidDr. Varma, and added, \"What we really need to be doing is using AI to support our humanity, not replace it.\" The latest Gemini and ChatGPT models provide incredibly human- and expressive-sounding conversations. Some believeAIs have already beat the Turing test(basically when a computer's response is indistinguishable from a human's, at least as perceived by another human). We will, in this decade, seehumanoid robots equipped with these AIs,and that's when things will get really weird. How long before some dude is marrying his AI bot in Vegas? Joi AI's self-serving survey is ridiculous on the face of it, even if it is also a harbinger of AI relationships to come – and I hope Gen Z swipes left on the whole idea.

    "article_text": "Mac tactics When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In the great iOS vs Android debate, you’ll often hearApplefans bringing up Airdrop as one of the iPhone’s key advantages. However, it seems OnePlus is hoping to bring AirDrop-style sharing and drag-and-drop file transfers to its Android phones. O+ Connect, which comprises a feature built into OnePlus' OxygenOS Android wrapper and an app for compatible third-party devices, brings these features to OnePlus devices, starting with theOnePlus 13R. As for the flagshipOnePlus 13, the company has confirmed O+ Connect support is on the way, but we don't know exactly when yet. Additionally, the feature is only available for UK and EU users at the moment. This enables users to view and transfer files between their OnePlus phone and iPhone, iPad, or Mac wirelessly, which is usually impossible without using an intermediary like Google Drive or WeTransfer. The corresponding O+ Connect app can be found on an official OnePlus website or on the iOS App Store. Curiously, the O+ Connect app supports macOS all the way back to version 10.4, released in 2005 as macOS X Tiger – this means that any Mac released in the last 20 years should be supported; talk about backwards compatibility. It’s worth mentioning that the O+ Connect app was originally released under the same name for Oppo phones. Oppo and OnePlus are both owned by parent company BBK Electronics, and while the two companies often share designs and features, they are distinct. It’s something to keep in mind if you use both OnePlus and Oppo devices. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. According to OnePlus, the integration of the O+ Connect app marks the start of an ecosystem that will aim to connect OnePlus users with devices from multiple other brands – not just Apple. Personally speaking, I’ve experienced the sheer horror of trying to move a large video from an Android phone to my MacBook, or from an iPhone to an Android device, one too many times. Though third-party solutions like LocalSend are very effective, I welcome OnePlus’ addition of O+ Connect – it’s great to see phone makers tackling this issue with first-party solutions. I think phone makers have some right to protect and encircle their own ecosystems, but making file sharing easier really has no downside from a consumer perspective. I'm glad to see OnePlus leading the way on this. O+ Connect is on its way to the OnePlus 13, but I’m hoping it’ll come to more of thebest OnePlus phonessoon.

The attackers then tried to extort Coinbase for $20 million, in exchange for deleting the data. Coinbase not only denied the offer, but also doubled-down on it, offering the exact same sum - $20 million, to whoever comes forward with actionable information about the identities or whereabouts of the attackers. Earlier reports on Reuters claimed the attack might cost Coinbase between $180 million and $400 million, citing a regulatory filing the company submitted recently.

    "article_text": "Trust me, it ain't \"nothing\"! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Even though it’s been almost a year since they released, I’ve still been going on and on about theNothing EarandNothing Ear (a)as though they were the hot new gadgets in the block. But it’s time to stop dwelling on the past, even if one model does rank among thebest wireless earbuds, and look to the future. Given that it’s been releasing new earbuds ever year, a regular ol' Santa Claus of music, it seems likely that tech company Nothing will be preparing a new pair of Nothing Ear buds for 2025 – especially given that company isnow pairing with British hi-fi great KEF and has several audio products planned for release this year. The company’s been operating with an infuriating lack of a numbering system since theEar (2), so I’m just going to call these the Nothing Ear (2025) for the purpose of making this article at least a little bit easy to read. At the time of writing, the only hints we have about a new set of Ear-branded buds and a budget companion are the hints about the KEF tie-up. So here's what I want to see in the new buds, in the absence of any concrete leaks about features. I’ve tested both of the 2024 models – as well as theNothing Ear (open)– and will draw on that for this wish-list. So far, we've been looking at annual releases from Nothing; the Ear came out in April 2024 and the Ear (2) (which came before the Ear, despite the name) was released in March 2023. Nothing has said that's working on a pair of over-ear headphones for release likely later this year, but hasn't said anything about new earbuds specifically – only that it has multiple new audio products coming from its partnership with KEF. Based on the yearly cycle, I'd have expected to see the new earbuds already. It’s possible that the September 2024 release of the Nothing Ear (open) has caused the company to push its schedule by a few months, so let’s hope the new buds come in the middle few months of the year, or perhaps towards the end. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. And what about price? We’ve heard nothing on that front, but Nothing hasn’t done much to change the cost of its buds between generations. The Nothing Ear cost $149 / £129 / AU$249, while the Nothing Ear (a) went for $99 / £99 / AU$192. I reviewed the Nothing Ear for TechRadar and have been using the (a) for the best part of a year now as my 'standard' earbuds. So here's what I'd love to see on a new-and-improved version of the duo: If, like me, you think the Nothing Ear (a) remain some of thebest earbudsyou can buy right now, you might be alarmed to know that there are no guarantees a new version of this model will return. In fairness there’s no reason that a new Nothing Ear (a)won’tcome out, but remember that 2024 was the first year we saw an (a)-style affordable alternative, following the company’s trend of (a) smartphones. So it’s not a recurring product type that’s guaranteed to return. I hope it does, though, because the Nothing Ear (a) have become the budget headphones I compare rivals too – and some updated ones in 2025 could wipe the floor clean with the competition. My main gripe with the Nothing Ear in my review, which I also bump into when I’m using the Ear (a,) is that neither has a particularly impressive battery life. For context, you get about five hours of listening with the standard model and an extra half hour with the (a) – both figures while ANC is turned on. By my personal standards, anything sub-six-hour is sub-standard – I really like to see eight hours on the spec list. You might be wondering who listens to music for 8 hours straight – but I think you’d be surprised. That is, after all, the length of an average working day, and it’s the amount of time you might be wanting to listen if you’re travelling or working on something that requires audio. More than once the Ear (a) have run out of juice when I’ve needed them: once on a bus ride to my hometown, another time in the afternoon of a working day. So I’d love to see any of Nothing’s new earbuds offer a little more listening time before they run out of power. Both the Nothing Ear and Nothing Ear (a) came with cheap-feeling plasticky charging cases. I can excuse the (a)’s – the case is incredibly small, and the products are cheap themselves. But that’s not quite the case with the flagship device. The Nothing Ear’s case creaks a little in the hand, a true symptom of cheap plastic, and it doesn’t feel particularly premium to hold. It’s just a case, you’re not meant to get too riled-up about it, but Nothing’s decision to use see-through fronts in an attempt to evoke noughties-style gadget-nostalgia shows that case design is important to it. I’ve tested loads of much-cheaper earbuds that come with cases that feel more premium, usually due to the material or texture, for example theSony WF-C510. Nothing should take notes. I know the whole point of active noise cancellation, or ANC, is to allow you to hear your music without you having to do so at a hearing-damagingly loud volume. But to get pumped, you sometimes need to play your tunes loud, and neither of the 2024 Nothing Ear products allowed for that. It’s not that I struggled to hear music (most of the time), just that the earbuds never let me turn the volume up to 11 – it’s also an issue I had with the the open-ear buds later in the year. Come on Nothing, let’s push that decibel count alittle. They say beggars can’t be choosers, but I’m about to choose a premium feature I want to come to the affordable earbuds. One major difference between the Nothing Ear (a) and its premium sibling is that the latter had a sound personalization feature – it was an easy test that created a custom audio mix based on your unique sonic sensibilities.I tried it, and I loved it. Sure, a lack of features in the Nothing Ear (a) is the price you’re paying for… well, not paying a price. But it’s been a year – let’s let the budget buyers enjoy it now too. And maybe the higher-end model will have a new flagship feature to draw people to it. I’ve been writing about tech for over six years now, and perhaps the most common complaint I’ve made about anything is how gadgets all too often come in only two boring color options: white or black. I want some color! Thankfully, the Nothing Ear (a) is one of the rare exceptions of funky-colored buds, coming in a yellow option thatobviouslyI love to wear out. But if you don’t like yellow, you’re going to be left blue. I’d love to see a few more color options (colorways, as tech nerds call them) available in future generations. Admittedly Nothing is reticent to color products, judging by its phones, but it does offer its CMF-branded gadgets in a few more vibrant hues so perhaps it’s time to take inspiration from that budget range. There’s no indication that Nothing is going to change the equalizer in its Nothing X app… but I can see why it’d want to. The Nothing X equalizer is pretty barebones by industry standards – many rivals offer eight- or 10-band equalizers, letting you tweak your sound profile down to the wire. However Nothing offers a three-band one so you can change bass, treble and mid, and that’s it. Many audiophiles will find this insufficient but I think that’s besides the point – a simple EQ like this is really easy to use for people who aren’t audiophiles, and it gives them a way to customize their music without having to sit through endlessYouTubetutorials on what the various settings do. So I’d like to see Nothing keep this feature the same.

    "title": "German justice minister calls for potentially banning largest opposition party",
    "article_text": "Germany’s Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig has called for a serious examination into whether the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party should be banned, following the domestic intelligence agency’s suspension of its classification of the party as a“confirmed right-wing extremist”group amid public backlash. In an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published on Thursday, Hubig emphasized the need to consider all legal avenues, claiming that the AfD must be taken seriously as a potential threat to democratic order. “The AfD is not a party like any other… Therefore, we need to take the party as a possible danger for our democracy very seriously. It is essential to consider a party ban,”shesaid. Hubig acknowledged that banning a political party is the most severe measure available in a democracy and should not be employed hastily. However, she argued that if a thorough investigation by the Interior Ministry and other relevant authorities reveals that the legal conditions for a ban are met, it“would not be difficult”to justify such a move. “Of course, thoroughness comes before speed, but we do not have forever,”she added, when asked whether there was a timeline for reaching a decision on a potential ban. The new German government – a coalition between Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservatives and the SPD – will discuss the possibility of pursuing a ban and formulate a joint response. However, Hubig cast doubt on whether“the procedure would be successful or not.” The AfD secured second place in February’s federal elections with 20.8% of the vote, but has been excluded from coalition talks and government formation. Asked whether she was concerned about disenfranchising so many voters, Hubig claimed that it is“irrelevant”how many people support a party if authorities ultimately deem it unconstitutional. Earlier this month, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV)upgradedthe AfD’s classification from“suspected”to“confirmed right-wing extremist”– but quicklysuspendedthe designation pending a court ruling on the party’s legal appeal. The AfD condemned the move as“a severe blow to German democracy”and filed a lawsuit. Co-leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla welcomed the temporary suspension, calling it“a first important step.”The now-paused designation would have allowed the BfV to expand surveillance of the AfD without judicial oversight; the downgraded“suspected case”status still permits monitoring, but under stricter conditions. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt acknowledged this week that the BfV’s 1,100-page report – which has not been made public – lacks concrete evidence that the AfD poses a serious threat to democracy or the rule of law that would justify a legal ban. Chancellor Merz has also expressed skepticism about pursuing a ban, citing both legal complexity and the potential political fallout. He stressed the need to address the underlying causes of the AfD’s popularity. At the same time, Merz urged Washington to“stay out”of Germany’s domestic politics, after top US officials claimed the EU’s largest economy had become“a tyranny in disguise”and had“rebuilt”the Berlin Wall.",

    "title": "Woman shot and detained outside CIA headquarters – media",
    "article_text": "A shooting unfolded outside the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) headquarters near Washington, DC on Thursday, according to multiple US media reports. The suspect, a young woman, was wounded by security guards and taken into custody. The incident reportedly happened at around 4am, when security spotted a vehicle driving towards the main gate of the spy agency’s campus. The woman driving reportedly failed to stop when ordered and was shot, sustaining“nonfatal”injuries before she was arrested. Some media reports said the woman crashed a vehicle into the gate. The CIA acknowledged a“security incident”at its compound and directed its employees to use alternate entrances but provided no detail on the nature of the situation. “The front gate at Headquarters is closed until further notice. Please use alternate routes for Thursday, May 22nd,”the agency said in a statement. It has provided no further updates so far, and the gate closure order apparently remains effective. The woman involved has been preliminarily identified as 27-year-old Monia Spadaro, NBC News reported, citing two senior law enforcement officials. The suspect is known to police and has at least one conviction for driving under the influence. It was not immediately known whether the woman was intoxicated at the time. Back in March, a person was arrested after allegedly making threats and pointing a gun outside the gate of CIA headquarters. It prompted a massive emergency response, with numerous law enforcement officers responding to the scene, including agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Fairfax County Police Bomb Squad. The standoff was ultimately defused peacefully however, and the suspect was taken into custody with no shots fired.",

    "title": "US senate to investigate who really ran country under Biden",
    "article_text": "US Senator Ron Johnson, who chairs the Homeland Security investigative subcommittee, is launching a probe into a potential cover-up relating to the health of former President Joe Biden, the Republican lawmaker from Wisconsin has announced. Last weekend, Biden’s office revealed that he had been diagnosed with an“aggressive form”of prostate cancer. While some, including incumbent President Donald Trump, were quick to express sympathy, some commentators claimed that the diagnosis had long been known, but that the Democrat’s inner circle had deliberately kept the public in the dark about it. In a post on X on Thursday, Johnson wrote that he had“just sent letters to former Joe Biden cabinet members requesting that they appear before my Subcommittee for an interview about Biden’s cognitive capabilities during his presidency.” “Will these individuals finally tell the truth, or will they double down on their lies?”the senator asked. Speaking to Axios on Wednesday, he said he was launching an investigation into the former president’s health, zooming in on a“couple dozen people”who had“direct contact”with Biden. The senator explained that the probe’s objective was to find out“who was running the [US] government.” In a post on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday, President Trump suggested that Biden would never have allowed“drug dealers, gang members, and the mentally insane to come into our Country totally unchecked and unvetted.”The pernicious policies of the previous administration were executed by the“people that knew he was cognitively impaired, and that took over the autopen,”he alleged. “This is TREASON at the highest level!... Something very severe should happen to these treasonous thugs,”Trump concluded. Speaking to reporters on Monday, he expressed incredulity at the fact that the“public wasn’t notified a long time ago, because to get to stage nine, that’s a long time,”referring to Biden’s advanced cancer. The issue of Biden’s health, and his cognitive abilities in particular, was propelled into the national spotlight during his campaign last year, when critics highlighted the veteran politician’s unsteady gait, apparent memory lapses and trouble articulating his thoughts. Things came to a head after a disastrous debate against Trump in June 2024, after which an increasing number of his fellow Democrats called on him to drop out of the race, which Biden did the following month.",

    "title": "Ukraine wants fixed percentage of EU’s GDP",
    "article_text": "Ukraine has proposed that EU member states allocate a fixed portion of their GDP to fund the country’s armed forces. The bloc’s leaders have pledged continued military support for Kiev despite a policy change by US President Donald Trump, who aims to mediate a truce. Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko outlined the proposal during this week’s G7 finance ministers meeting in Canada, according to a Facebook post published on Thursday. “What we are proposing is partner participation in funding Ukraine’s Armed Forces, which would effectively integrate them into Europe’s defense structure,”he wrote. Marchenko added that the cost“would represent only a small share of the EU’s GDP”and could be distributed among countries willing to join the initiative. Kiev wants to launch the new scheme in 2026, with contributions counted toward NATO defense spending targets. Marchenko’s appeal comes as Ukraine struggles with rising fiscal pressure and an uncertain outlook on foreign assistance. On Tuesday, MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak said the country’s 2025 budget includes a shortfall of 400–500 billion hryvnias ($9.6–12 billion) for financing its armed forces. Fellow lawmaker Nina Yuzhanina warned that military support was at a critical level and called for sweeping domestic budget cuts to redirect resources. Ukraine’s mounting debt has also raised alarm. Total state debt is approaching $171 billion, with public debt nearing 100% of GDP. Earlier this month, Marchenko said the country would be unable to repay foreign creditors for the next 30 years but intends to continue borrowing. Since the escalation of the conflict with Russia in 2022, Ukraine has received billions in military, financial, and humanitarian aid and loans from the US, the EU, and other donors. Brussels’ approach has drawn criticism from some EU member states, including Hungary and Slovakia. The US, Ukraine’s largest donor, has moved to recoup its financial aid to Ukraine by signing a natural resources deal with Kiev. The agreement, pushed by Trump, grants the US preferential access to Ukrainian mineral resources without providing security guarantees. Trump, who has repeatedly called for a swift resolution to the conflict, has pledged to mediate a truce rather than expand military support. Ukrainian lawmakers have warned that the military aid package approved under former President Joe Biden will run out by summer, and no talks on further US deliveries are currently underway. Russia has consistently condemned Western arms shipments to Ukraine, declaring that they will only prolong the conflict without changing its outcome, while also being an additional economic burden for ordinary taxpayers.",

    "title": "US tech giant accused of silencing free speech – media",
    "article_text": "Microsoft is reportedly under fire from employees following claims that its internal email system blocks messages containing terms such as“Gaza,”“Palestine,”and“Genocide.”The restrictions, reported by The Verge, have sparked accusations of censorship and discrimination, particularly amid mounting criticism of the company’s ties to Israel. The claims come from No Azure for Apartheid (NOAA), a protest group of current and former Microsoft workers. The group says“dozens of employees”have been unable to send emails internally or externally if these words appear in subject lines or message bodies. In contrast, words such as“Israel”or alternate spellings like“P4lestine”are reportedly not filtered.“This is an attempt to silence worker free speech,”said NOAA organizer Hossam Nasr, who accused Microsoft’s leadership of discriminating against Palestinian employees and their supporters. Microsoft confirmed that it had made email-related changes aimed at reducing internal political messaging. A company spokesperson said the measures were taken to limit mass political emails, noting that“emailing large numbers of employees about non-work topics is not appropriate”and that such communication should go through opt-in forums. The controversy comes amid ongoing protests over Microsoft’s cloud and AI contracts with Israel, which media reports say support military operations in Gaza. While the US company has acknowledged working with the Israeli government, it claimed in a May 16 statement that“no evidence”has emerged showing its tools have been used to cause harm—though it also admitted it lacks visibility into how its software is deployed on private systems. The internal dissent has played out publicly in recent weeks. At the Microsoft Build developer conference, employee Joe Lopez interrupted CEO Satya Nadella’s keynote speech, accusing the company of enabling war crimes. Lopez was later fired after sending a mass email to thousands of staff members calling for action.",

    "title": "US launched ‘largest-ever strike from aircraft carrier’ – commander",
    "article_text": "The US Navy conducted the largest-ever airstrike from an aircraft carrier during an operation in Somalia earlier this year, Admiral James Kilby, acting chief of naval operations, has said. The USS Harry S. Truman and its strike group“launched the largest airstrike in the history of the world – 125,000 pounds (62.5 tons) – from a single aircraft carrier,”the US Navy’s top admiral claimed at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations think tank in Washington on Monday. A defense official told Business Insider on Wednesday that the bombing run took place on February 1 and involved 16 F/A-18 Super Hornets. According to US Africa Command, a total of 25 airstrikes against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) and Al-Qaeda affiliate group Al-Shabaab have been carried out by American forces in Somalia since January. The Truman carrier strike group, which had been deployed to the Middle East in the autumn, left the Red Sea earlier this month to participate in NATO drills in the Mediterranean before heading back to its home port of Norfolk, Virginia. Over the last half a year, it has played a key role in US efforts to prevent Houthi fighters from targeting shipping off Yemen’s coast. The Truman conducted 670 strikes against the Houthis and intercepted around 160 enemy drones and missiles during the period, Kilby said. The Houthis“are not China, but they are a threat, and they are hunting our ships. Understanding that and not being dismissive about that and being prepared is what we are focused on now,”the admiral stressed. The Truman’s stay in the Red Sea was marred by several incidents. In December, one of the warships in its strike group shot down an American F/A-18 in what the US military later described as an“apparent case of friendly fire.” In late April, an F/A-18 and a tow tractor fell overboard from the carrier’s hangar bay as the ship was maneuvering to avoid an attack by the Houthis. Earlier this month, the Truman’s arresting cables failed during the landing of another F/A-18, sending the jet, which costs an estimated $60 million, overboard.",

    "title": "The EU is an addict — and sanctions on Russia are the drug",
    "article_text": "What’s going on between the US and the EU right now over Ukraine feels like you and your buddy agreeing to go skydiving on a dare. You count“1-2-3-jump,”and leap – only to realize your friend’s still up in the plane. That friend is US President Donald Trump. And the EU parachute looks like it was stitched together with recycled climate summit lanyards and blind optimism. Emphasis on“blind.” On May 19, a German government spokesman assured the press that Washington would be joining the EU in yet another round of sanctions on Russia. But fast forward to today, and Brussels has leapt out of the plane solo while Trump is still standing at the hatch, waving goodbye and checking the minibar. And Berlin seems to be pretending not to notice – at least for the purpose of keeping up appearances.“Europe and America are very united on this point: We will closely support Ukraine on its path toward a ceasefire… We agreed on this with [Trump] after his conversation with Putin,”Chancellor Friedrich Merztweeted. Translation: The EU went,“Hey Trump, we’re slapping more sanctions on Russia. Cool with that?”And Trump probably thought,“Oh, you mean the sanctions that nuked your economy, dried up your trade, and left you addicted to overpriced American LNG? Be my guest, Einsteins.” Sure enough, Trump has since made it clear he’s not feeling another sanctions round. The vibes are off. He’s not jumping. But if the EU wants to swan dive into its own economic crater, well – godspeed.“Because I think there’s a chance of getting something done, and if you do that, you could also make it much worse,”Trump said. Trump keeps saying that he wants peace and trade with Russia – the exact opposite of Brussels’ Cold War cosplay. But let’s be honest: would the EU even be playing sanctions hardball if it hadn’t been cheered down that road by the Biden administration? Highly unlikely. Trump sees the whole mess as a Biden boondoggle – a“European situation.” What’s more interesting is how Team Trump is framing this not as a retreat, but as the dawn of a“peace first”presidency. One that’s allergic to forever wars. Secretary of State Marco Rubio even suggested that God’s on board.“We have a president of peace,”Rubio said at a recent Trump-hosted event, before recounting a chat with a Vatican cardinal for Pope Leo’s papal mass.“You know, it’s very unusual for us. We have an American president that wants peace, and it’s some of the Europeans that are constantly talking about doing war stuff.” Trump, Rubio, J.D. Vance, they’re all singing the same tune: get a peace deal done pronto, or the US checks out. Ukraine and Russia can slug it out without Uncle Sam in the ring. And Europe? It can handle its own geopolitical hangover, assuming it can still stand up straight. Meanwhile, Brussels is starting to realize its wallet has limits. That whole“whatever it takes”energy? It’s starting to sound more like“whatever we can still afford.”Ursula von der Leyen evenadmittedit.“Over the past five years, our budget has punched above its weight. And we must also see now… we have reached the limits of what is possible.” Translation: The ‘check engine’ light on the EU economy has been blinking for a while, and now the dashboard’s on fire. But never mind that – they’ve just pulled the trigger on yet anothersanctions round. The 17th. And there’s already an 18th bullet getting loaded in the chamber. Because if you miss the target 17 times, the 18th is going to be the charm, right? This time, they’re targeting Russia’s“shadow fleet,”which – minor detail – delivers oil to countries outside the EU, so the EU, in all its usual brilliance, can then buy it at a markup from middlemen countries. Also not Russian? The ships themselves. And many of the newly sanctioned companies, which are in places like China (the EU’s top trade partner), Serbia (an EU candidate), Türkiye (the EU’s refugee babysitter), the UAE (gas hookup), Vietnam, and Uzbekistan. Way to win hearts and minds. Taking the long way around in sticking it to Putin, by ticking off the rest of the world. And while they’ve long denounced Trump’s tariffs on EU goods, guess who’s now crushing on tariffs? Yep, the EU has just introducednew oneson Russian agricultural imports. But wait, didn’t they already ban nearly everything Russian? Not quite. Some imports still sneak through the back door, like fertilizer, which supports the EU food system. In fact, Russian fertilizer imports rose 12% in January alone. Even the EU’s own Eurostat agency pegs the annual increase at 25%. Just explain that one to the farmers protesting Brussels’ rules while watching their markets flood with Ukrainian grain. The EU also imports Russian enriched uranium: the lifeblood of nuclear reactors that generate about a quarter of Europe’s electricity. And now, naturally, Brussels isconsidering tariffson that, too. Apparently, if the ship’s on fire, the EU’s first instinct is to throw out the lifeboats. Then rummage around in the back to make darn sure there aren’t any more hiding in a closet somewhere.",

    "title": "China ‘existential threat’ to US – CIA deputy director",
    "article_text": "China’s economic might makes the Asian nation a unique challenge as the US competes with it for global influence, CIA Deputy Director Michael Ellis has said. “China is the existential threat to American security in a way that we really have never confronted before,”Ellis said in an interview with Axios on Wednesday. Unlike with the Soviet Union, the current competition is primarily unfolding along economic lines, he explained. Ellis said technological supremacy in fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, semiconductors, and advanced energy storage will ultimately determine the outcome of the geopolitical contest. He outlined the CIA’s evolving priorities in an era where traditional methods of human intelligence gathering face increasing limitations. There has to be an“evolution in operational tradecraft,”Ellis stated.“While some of the tools and techniques from the 1960s or 70s might still work today, a lot of them need to be updated and refreshed.” To meet the challenge, Ellis said the agency is recruiting an“elite workforce”with advanced scientific and engineering expertise, emphasizing a drive to build“the ultimate meritocracy at the CIA.” Beijing has repeatedly accused Washington of clinging to a“Cold War mentality”and seeking global dominance instead of embracing a multipolar world based on cooperation and mutual benefit. The US and China remain embroiled in a protracted trade dispute, which has escalated under the administration of President Donald Trump following the imposition of tariffs on imports of Chinese products. Beijing has responded with countermeasures. Following the latest round of talks, both sides issued a joint statement pledging to resolve their disagreements through“mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect.” This week, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated the Trump administration’s intention to shift its attention from European affairs to China. “Every dollar we spend on this [Ukraine] conflict in Europe is distracting both our focus and our resources away from the potential for a much more serious, much more cataclysmic confrontation in the Indo-Pacific,”Rubio told lawmakers during a Senate hearing.",

    "title": "China calls out Western ‘double standards’ on Russia sanctions",
    "article_text": "Beijing has accused the European Union and its allies of“double standards,”following the latest wave of sanctions targeting Russia and Chinese companies allegedly linked to Moscow’s military supply chains. The EU’s 17th sanctions package against Russia, adopted on Tuesday, targets what the bloc claims is the country’s shadow fleet used for transporting crude oil. Several Chinese firms accused of supplying Moscow with drone parts and microelectronics were also included in the measures. The UK coordinated with Brussels, adding 18 vessels to its own blacklist. Responding to the measures, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on Wednesday rejected the accusations and warned against disrupting the normal trade exchanges between the two countries. “Those in Europe need to stop using double standards on trade and economic cooperation with Russia,”Mao said.“Most countries, including those in Europe and the US, continue to trade”with Moscow, she added. The spokeswoman emphasized that China strictly regulates exports of dual-use goods and insisted that Beijing has not supplied any lethal weapons to parties involved in the Ukraine conflict. The new sanctions were announced shortly after a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump, in which Trump reportedly warned that further sanctions might complicate efforts to reach a peaceful settlement in the Ukraine conflict. Delegations from Russia and Ukraine met last week for the first time since 2022 – when Kiev halted negotiations in favor of a military strategy reportedly encouraged by then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. On the same day the EU adopted its new sanctions, Beijing expressed support for the resumption of direct talks between Moscow and Kiev. China also vowed to continue supporting efforts to resolve the crisis peacefully.",

    "title": "Romania’s top court rejects complaint about presidential election interference",
    "article_text": "Romania’s Constitutional Court has rejected an election challenge filed by presidential candidate George Simion, ruling on Thursday that his claims of foreign interference were“unfounded.”Months earlier, the same court had annulled the first round of a vote, citing“irregularities”and intelligence claims of external meddling. On Sunday, the conservative EU critic lost a run-off vote against pro-Brussels Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan by a single-digit margin. Simioncontestedthe outcome on Tuesday, alleging“external interferences by state and non-state actors,”but the court unanimously rejected his petition. The ruling is final, the court said in a statement, pledging to provide a full explanation at a later date. In response, Simion, who has accused several nations, including France, of orchestrating interference, labeled the court’s decision a“continuation of a coup d’état”and vowed to continue his political fight. Last year, independent right-wing presidential candidate Calin Georgescu secured an unexpected lead, which the government attributed to foreign voter manipulation. Investigative journalists later suggested the campaign that triggered the annulment may have been orchestrated by a Romanian political party to divide the conservative electorate. Georgescu was disqualified from the re-run. Telegram founder Pavel Durov claimed last week that the head of France’s foreign intelligence agency, the DGSE, had asked him to suppress conservative voices on the platform during Romania’s campaign season. The agency publicly denied the allegation. Durov in turn accused French authorities of deflecting criticism by linking him to unrelated criminal investigations involving users of his platform. Following Simion’s challenge, Durov offered to testify before Romanian authorities about the interactions with French officials, saying he would do so“if it helps Romanian democracy.” Ahead of the run-off vote, Romania’s Foreign Ministry accused Russia of attempting to influence the outcome. Moscow ridiculed the allegations, calling the process a“mess”and stating that it shouldn’t even count as a proper vote.",

    "article_text": "North Korean state media reported a“serious accident”during the attempted launch of a 5,000-ton naval destroyer on Wednesday. The country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, attended the side-launch ceremony at the Chongjin Shipyard. He observed the incident and issued a stern rebuke, news outlets said. According to reports, the slide system beneath the ship’s stern activated prematurely, resulting in a failure of the slides to move in parallel and damage to the vessel. Officials attributed the incident to“inexperienced command and operational carelessness.” Kim condemned the mishap as an unacceptable act of criminal negligence and ordered immediate repairs. He instructed that the warship be fully restored before a major meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea in June. The government reportedly views the failure as a political embarrassment with implications for the country’s global image. No photos or video footage of the incident have been released by Pyongyang. South Korea’s military confirmed it has been monitoring the construction of the destroyer, adding that the ship appeared to be partially capsized following the failed launch. Last month, North Korea unveiled a new destroyer, the Choe Hyon, and conducted a weapons demonstration shortly afterward. According to reports, the warship fired cruise missiles designed to strike targets at various ranges, an anti-aircraft missile, and a 127mm automatic gun during the test.",

    "article_text": "Two Israeli Embassy staff members were shot dead near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, on Wednesday evening, in what Israeli officials have condemned as a“depraved act of anti-Semitic terrorism.” The attack occurred during an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee (AJC) at the museum. Authorities confirmed that two individuals connected to the Israeli Embassy were gunned down just outside the venue, but their names have not yet been released. “Two Israeli Embassy staff were senselessly killed tonight near the Jewish Museum in Washington, DC,”US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem posted on X.“We are actively investigating and working to get more information to share.” Two Israeli Embassy staff were senselessly killed tonight near the Jewish Museum in Washington DC. We are actively investigating and working to get more information to share. Please pray for the families of the victims. We will bring this depraved perpetrator to justice. The incident took place near 3rd Street and F Street Northwest, directly across from the FBI’s Washington Field Office. Police cordoned off the area shortly after the shooting, urging the public to avoid the scene. A person of interest has reportedly been detained for questioning, but no arrests had been announced as of late Wednesday evening. The Israeli Embassy confirmed it is cooperating closely with US law enforcement and clarified that the ambassador was not present at the time of the attack.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interim US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro arrived at the scene shortly after the shooting. Bondistatedthat federal officials were“working to learn more”and would ensure that those responsible are held accountable. The Capital Jewish Museum, which opened its new building in 2023, is located in the heart of DC and regularly hosts events highlighting Jewish heritage and community engagement. Wednesday’s gathering was part of an AJC program bringing together diplomats, community leaders, and Jewish organizations. Ted Deutch, CEO of the AJC, expressed devastation over the incident.“An unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue,”he said in a statement.“At this moment, as we await more information from the police about exactly what transpired, our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families.”",

    "article_text": "Israeli soldiers fired shots near a group of foreign diplomats visiting the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, prompting representatives from over 20 countries and accompanying journalists to scramble for cover, according to videos from the scene. The tour, organized by the Palestinian Authority, included delegates from dozens of countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Italy, Spain, China, Japan, Mexico, Egypt, and others. No injuries were reported, but video footage showed diplomats fleeing in panic as gunfire erupted at around 2pm local time. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed the delegation had deviated from its pre-approved route and entered an unauthorized area, which they described as an“active combat zone.” Israeli forces opened fire towards an EU delegation on an approved visit to#Jeninin the#WestBankearlier today.The IDF said they were approaching an area they weren’t allowed to be, so “warning shots” were fired AT EUROPEAN DIPLOMATS.pic.twitter.com/0Y6SHxk73N “According to an initial inquiry, the delegation deviated from the approved route and entered an area where they were not authorized to be.

European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas also labeled the act of firing near diplomats“unacceptable”and called for accountability. The Egyptian foreign ministry said the incident“violates all diplomatic norms,”while Türkiye’s foreign ministry“strongly condemned”the firing of warning shots at its diplomats. The Israeli military launched a major operation in the West Bank in January, dubbed ‘Iron Wall,’ with forces taking control of Jenin and installing metal gates at the entrances to the refugee camp. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at the time that the goal was to“eradicate terrorism”in the area, amid his country’s ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant later said that IDF troops would remain there indefinitely, declaring that“the Jenin refugee camp will not be what it was.”",

(Photo: Reuters/2025 Planet Labs PBC) SEOUL: North Korea has begun a full-scale investigation into theaccident that occurred during the launch of a warshipthis week, state media KCNA reported on Friday (May 23). Pyongyang has said the incident on Wednesday was caused by a loss of balance while the vessel was being launched, and sections of the bottom of the warship were crushed. An internal inspection found that there were no holes at the warship's bottom, but the starboard hull was scratched and seawater flowed into the stern section through the rescue channel, the report said. The extent of damage was \"not serious\", the report said, adding the investigation group was ordered to find the cause of the accident and those responsible for it. The report did not mention any injuries or deaths as a result of the accident.

The isolated state's leader Kim Jong Un, who watched Wednesday's launch of the 5,000-ton destroyer at the northeastern shipyard of Chongjin, berated it as a \"criminal act\" that could not be tolerated, according to state media. The mishap likely occurred in front of a large crowd, increasing the public humiliation for Kim, military analysts said. South Korea's military said on Thursday that the ship was lying on its side in the water. \"The stern is seen swung out into the harbour as a result of the wheeled units placed under the frame sliding into the water while the bow remained on the side slipway,\" said the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), citing satellite imagery from Thursday. The shipyard in Chongjin has primarily produced cargo vessels and fishing vessels and \"undoubtedly lacks significant expertise\" in launching large warships such as the new destroyer, CSIS added. It would take two to three days to restore the balance of the warship by pumping up seawater from the flooded chamber and around 10 days to restore the warship's side, the KCNA report said, citing experts' estimates. Treating the accident as a serious matter was part of an effort to fight against \"incautiousness\" and \"irresponsibility\", according to KCNA. Hong Kil Ho, the manager of the Chongjin shipyard, was summoned to the law enforcement organ on Thursday as it began measures to detain and investigate those responsible for the accident, the report said.

    "article_text": "Business Business A woman looks at items at a shop in Tokyo, Japan, Mar 24, 2023. (Photo: REUTERS/Androniki Christodoulou) TOKYO: Japan's core inflation accelerated at its fastest annual pace in more than two years in April, data showed on Friday (May 23), raising the odds of another interest rate hike by year-end. The data underscores the Bank of Japan's predicament of balancing price pressures from persistent food inflation against growth headwinds from US President Donald Trump's tariffs. The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes fresh food but includes oil prices, rose 3.5 per cent in April from a year earlier, exceeding market forecasts for a 3.4 per cent gain and accelerating from a 3.2 per cent increase in March. It was also the fastest annual pace of growth for the index since the 4.2 per cent rise in January 2023, holding above the central bank's 2 per cent target for more than three years.

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Few garments conjure the type of impeccablewarm-weather vibesyou should be chasing right now like the best linen pants for men. There's something inherently “lounging yacht-side in Lake Como” about them, from their naturally rumpled look to their easy, breezy feel. Luckily, you don't have to venture to the South of Italy to harness that OOO energy on the daily. The right pair will help you look like the coolest, most elegant version of yourself no matter where you wear them—and save you from the indignity of trying to separate your thighs from your jeans after a long day sweating through the mid-July heat. And we’re not the only ones who think so. Brands of all stripes are churning out linen pants in a ton of different shapes and sizes, with plenty of wild-style patterns, colors, and pockets thrown in for good measure too. Running low on shorts during laundry week? You can wear these suckers with everything you’d normally pair with their5” counterparts, and a heck of a lot of things—unstructuredblazers, silkybutton-ups, funky T-barsandals—you normally wouldn’t. Ciao, bella! Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Materials:100% linen |Fit:Classic Todd Snyder's pedigree for tailored clothing is so good that you'd have to really put some effort into making his impeccable trousers look bad. These impossibly elegant trousers pay homage to a classic full silhouette, with a crease to keep things extra clean. Pair these with your favoritebutton-up linen shirtto tap into your inner rakishly relaxed Italian guy or take things down a notch with a beat-up denim jacket and retro sneakers. But of course, these dressy slacks sync up well with its matching suit jacket, or could take to a contrasting blazer just as well. So whether you're getting dressed for a regular ol' Tuesday or polishing up for a spring wedding, consider yourself sorted. Gap Gap Materials:53% linen, 47% cotton |Fit:Relaxed Good-quality linen pants can run you a pretty penny. And when you'll spend the next four months living in them, it makes sense to invest in a decent pair. But Gap's relaxed pants remind us that there are always exceptions to the rule. The fabric is 53% linen and 47% cotton so you can get the benefits of both materials minus the excessive wrinkling. The silhouette is an easy, loose fit, and they come in a couple of classic colors as well, which is great news because right now, you can get two pairs for under $100. And, while we’re here, Gap uses that very same fabric to make a gang of five-pocket jeans, too. Stòffa Mr Porter Materials:100% linen |Fit:Mid rise, relaxed leg Striking the balance between dress and play requires a surgical eye, that, if done wrong, can turn out less like a majestic pegasus and more like a horrific lab experiment (we're still recovering from the dress-shoe-sneaker-sole era). Stóffa managed to perform a triple bypass with their eyes closed because these pleated trousers somehow strike that business-casual vibe perfectly and does both sides of the hyphen better than most. The preternaturally chill trousers look great with loafers, sure—but they'll also up the dressy factor considerably when you wear ‘em with strappy leather sandals.

Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, theflyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.) More From GQ Connect ©2025Condé Nast.

    "title": "Diddy Trial, Day 9: Here’s Everything We Know",
    "article_text": "This story contains discussion of physical and sexual assault, coercion, and emotional abuse. Sean “Diddy” Combs, the music-industry titan who reshaped rap and R&B in the ’90s and aughts as a producer, rapper, and founder of the era-defining label Bad Boy Records, is standing trial amidst nearly two years of increasingly alarming accusations that allege a history of manipulation, coercion, and physical and sexual abuse. Below, we're breaking down the accusations, and what's at stake, in a court case likely to go down as one of the biggest in the history of hip-hop, if not pop culture in general. Combs is facing five criminal charges—one count of racketeering conspiracy; two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion; and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. The racketeering and sex trafficking charges each carry a maximum sentence of life in prison; the sex trafficking charge also carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years. Combs—who was denied bail repeatedly and has been incarcerated since his arrest in September—has pleaded not guilty to each of these charges. Meanwhile, in the nearly 18 months since his ex-partner Cassie Ventura filed a civil lawsuit accusing Combs of physical and sexual assault and emotional abuse,a wave of other accusers have come forward to file their own civil suits against Combscontaining similarly disturbing allegations against him. Combs has consistently denied these allegations and, in a 2023 statement posted to his social media accounts, categorized a number of his accusers as “individuals looking for a quick payday.” Diddy is no stranger to media-dominating trials, or allegations of violence. In 1999, he faced a felony assault charge related to an alleged altercation with record executive Steve Stoute surrounding a dispute over a music video earlier that year. Stoute later asked for the charges to be dismissed, andCombs pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of harassment. In 2001,he was found not guilty of gun-possession and bribery chargesstemming from a 1999 nightclub shooting; then Bad Boy artist Jamal “Shyne” Barrow was convicted of assault, reckless endangerment, and gun possession in connection with the same incident and served eight years in prison. He’s since described himself as having been a “fall guy” for Combs, a claim that Combs’s representatives have characterized as “unequivocally false.” These brushes with the law proved to be minor reputational setbacks for Combs. Since the early 2000s, he’s released several solo albums, produced music for artists like Jay-Z and Mary J. Blige, acted in films and on Broadway, hosted awards telecasts and reality-TV shows, and accumulated a once-billion-dollar fortune tending a broad portfolio of other business ventures, from his Sean John clothing line to the Revolt TV network to a partnership with Cîroc vodka. Although he hasn’t scored a Billboard top 10 single since 2007, he seemed to be settling into the role of gracefully aging living legend with his first new solo studio album in 17 years, 2023’sThe Love Album: Off the Grid, a hard re-pivot back to R&B. All that changed on November 16, 2023, when Cassie Ventura—Combs’s former partner, who’d also been a Bad Boy recording artist for more than a decade—filed a civil lawsuit against him. Inthe suit, Ventura accused Combs of physical and sexual assault, as well as emotional abuse, and alleged that he’d “used illegal substances and threats of violence” to force Ventura “into repeated unwanted sexual encounters with male sex workers,” a type of arrangement the filing said he referred to as a “freak off.” At one point, according to the suit, Combs discovered that Ventura had a “brief relationship” with rapper Kid Cudi in 2011, and later told her he was going to blow up Cudi’s car. In January 2012, Cudi’s car was set on fire by an “incendiary device” according to Los Angeles City Fire Department recordsreportedly viewed byRolling Stone. (Cudi confirmed toThe New York Timesthrough a spokesperson that a car of his exploded. A lawyer for Combs denied that he had any involvement in the alleged incident.) Combs denied the allegations presented in the suit and—just a day after it was filed—reached an agreement with Ventura to settle the case, the terms of which were not disclosed. In a statement, an attorney for Combs emphasized the decision to settle was “in no way an admission of wrongdoing.” But the floodgates were open. More accusers have come forward to file suit against Combs, leveling similar allegations of sexual misconduct. Several of Combs’s accusers have stated that the alleged abuse took place when they were under 18, although at least one of these suits—which alleged that Combs and Jay-Z drugged and raped a 13-year-old Jane Doe at an afterparty following the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards—has since beenvoluntarily dismissed; Jay-Zsubsequently suedthe Jane Doe who’d brought the suit, along with her attorney Tony Buzbee, for defamation and malicious prosecution. Buzbee has described the case as “meritless.” Diddy openly maintained his innocence as the allegations piled up. But things came to a head on March 25, 2024, whenHomeland Security executed a coordinated raid on Combs’s propertiesacross the country in LA and Miami. The federal indictment against Combs reported firearms, narcotics, and over 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant were seized at the properties. Diddy was arrested on September 16, and was eventually charged with one count of racketeering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison; two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison; and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. We’ve seen several days of testimony from Ventura. As of now, who else will be testifying is unclear, and anything you’ve heard about Combs’s other celebrity associates being potential witnesses is gossip until proven otherwise. Although Combs has been a prolific party thrower for decades, playing convivial host to scores of famous people from Martha Stewart to Muhammad Ali, the phrase “Diddy party” has taken on a sinister new connotation in the wake of the “freak off” allegations. A spokesperson for Combs has expressed disappointment at seeing “the media and social commentators twist these cultural moments into something they were not.” Nevertheless, anyone who seems to have partied frequently with Puff in the past now faces scrutiny, perhaps unduly, from a cynical public about any possible culpability and awareness of what he was allegedly up to. As the trial kicks off, these notions could be defused—or they might potentially become even more sensationalized when prosecutors unfurl their case. Perhaps it’s a sign of things to come that something as typically banal as jury selection is already offering glimpses of the kind of name-dropping and sensationalism that could come out of this trial. Prospective jurors were reportedly quizzed on their familiarity with a list of people (some 200 names long) who might be referenced in the course of the trial.Sinnersstar Michael B. Jordan was unexpectedly name-dropped, withRolling Stonelater identifying himas the unnamed actor referenced in Ventura's lawsuit against Combs. The suit stated that she “began a flirtatious relationship with an actor” in 2015, allegedly inspiring Diddy to call and threaten the actor. Other names that reportedly came up included Mike Myers, D’Angelo, Kanye West, Dallas Austin, Lauren London, and Destiny’s Child member Michelle Williams—but any way in which they could relate to the case specifically is still unclear for now. With the jury selected and opening statements from the prosecution and defense fired off, the Combs trial officially kicked off on Monday May 12 with witness number one: Daniel Phillip, a man who testified to being a participant in several “freak offs.” Phillip said that he first met Combs and Ventura over 10 years ago, around 2012 or 2013. He went to a hotel under the assumption that he would be dancing at a bachelorette party, only to find Ventura in a wig, explaining that “it was her birthday and that her husband wanted to do something special for her, and so she asked me if I would mind rubbing baby oil on her and giving her a massage.” That led to intercourse, while Combs watched them, allegedly wearing a hat and a bandana over his face. Phillip said that in two specific instances he’d witnessed Combs being physically violent toward Ventura. In one instance, Phillip said, Ventura didn’t come into the hotel room immediately, upon which Combs allegedly dragged her in by her hair. “Cassie was visibly very upset, did not look like she wanted to continue doing anything,” Phillip said. “But Mr. Combs asked, ‘Are y’all ready to continue now?’” In another instance, Phillip described hearing what sounded like slapping from another room, only for Ventura to burst in and jump into his lap, shaking. Phillip said he feared retribution from Combs if he went to the police, noting that Combs had taken a picture of his driver's license. One of the defense team’s tactics seems to be acknowledging a high level of toxicity and abuse within Combs and Ventura's relationship—while arguing that that doesn’t make him guilty of racketeering and trafficking. In an attempt to paint a picture of all parties involved willingly consenting to the encounters, one of Combs’s lawyers asked Phillip if Ventura ever appeared drunk or high, to which he replied that she did not. But when faced with the loaded question of “Is it fair to say she was in complete control of everything she did?,” Phillip replied: “I cannot say that.” After Phillip’s cross-examination ended early in the morning, much of the day was dominated by Ventura's testimony, which is expected to continue well into the rest of the week. It was an at times harrowing, and often increasingly uncomfortable account, focused mostly on the “freak offs” and the way Ventura felt “humiliated” by Combs as the alleged scenes played out. She described intensely “choreographed” events that Combs essentially directed—sometimes literally filming them—that lasted for days on end, and soon began to occur almost weekly. At one point, she said of Combs’s demeanor during freak-offs, through tears: “His eyes go black—the version of him I was in love with was no longer there.” Ventura recounted often using drugs to emotionally distance herself from the experience, and said that even when the substances would make her nauseous, Combs would force her to continue. At one point, recounting some of the more graphic acts in which Combs allegedly directed men to submit her to, Ventura said, “It was a turn-on for him, so it happened.” When asked by the prosecutor, “Why didn’t you say no when that happened?” Ventura replied, “I thought that it was obvious that I didn’t want to do it.” The 2016 video of Combs’s apparent assault on Ventura in a hotel hallway played, with Ventura providing context that this was around the time of her first big movie premiere. She said she'd agreed to a freak-off to keep Combs in a good mood so he wouldn’t otherwise spoil her moment, but that it still escalated to violence, with Combs giving her a black eye. “At this point all I could think about was getting out of there safely,” Ventura said. “I had my premiere and I didn’t want to mess it up.” When asked how many times Combs had thrown her to the ground in a manner similar to the one on video, Ventura replied: “Too many to count.” On Wednesday the prosecution continued with Cassie’s testimony. One crucial detail was that Judge Arun Subramanian finally weighed in on a controversial debate over whether the prosecution could show videos, presumably of the freakoffs, that were obtained from Combs’s properties and devices. The judge compromised on photos, which were only shown to the lawyers, Cassie, and the jurors, with privacy screens blocking them from any other eyes. In one of these images, Cassie identified a future witness, “Mia,” a pseudonym for a former employee who accused Combs of coercing her into sex. Reporters in the room described Cassie as experiencing a roller coaster of emotions today, volleying from growing detached and matter-of-factly recounting more freakoff stories in at times uncomfortably minute detail, to emotional when recounting hiding the physical abuse from her mother, to fully breaking down in tears when recounting a suicide attempt that her husband Alex Fine prevented when the trauma of it all became too much to bear in 2023. At one point she even requested a 10 minute break. It was after this attempt that she began to feel the need to work through her trauma with a memoir, and she revealed that she gave Combs the option to buy her life rights for $30 million. Clearly he didn’t take the deal, which led to the civil suit, which set off the domino effect to get us where we are now. (And after the suit, Combs quickly settled with Cassie for $20 million.) Cassie spoke about developing drug habits to get through the freakoffs, then developing an opiate habit to combat the drug comedown, as well as maintaining UTIs and sores on her tongue during and as a result of the freakoffs, which Combs seemed to be barely apologetic for. She sustained physical abuse, which the male escorts often witnessed: “He would grab me up. Push me down. Hit me in the side of the head. Kick me. You name it,” Cassie said. She also painted a pattern of violence outside of the sex any time she seemed to stray outside of his control; simply attending a party at Prince’s house without telling or asking Combs first led to beatings later; in one toxic interaction Cassie punched Combs for calling her a slur and he responded by repeatedly stomping her on the floor of his SUV and having her hole up in a hotel to heal from visible injuries. She also notably pointed to one instance of Combs having her cover bruises with makeup so one of his sons wouldn’t notice. One of the more sensational aspects of Cassie’s suit was that she confirmed a secret relationship with Kid Cudi, which Combs eventually found out about and responded by arranging Cudi’s car to be blown up as retaliation. Today, Cassie gave more context, dating the relationship around 2011 and revealing Combs found out by going through her phone during a freakoff, at which point he tried to attack her with a corkscrew. Cassie said she ended the relationship because of “Too much danger, too much uncertainty of what could happen if we continued to see each other.” She spoke vaguely of a meeting that the three of them had at Soho House, where at one point Cudi notably asked “What about my vehicle,” and Combs responded “What vehicle?” The testimony also didn’t shy away from the complicated nature of Cassie and Combs’s relationship. A Father’s Day text Cassie once sent was read, where she wrote “You are truly the most extraordinary man. Thank you for always showing me love and happiness, the way it’s supposed to be.” The prosecutor asked Cassie why she sent those loving messages, her reply was “Because I loved him and it was Father’s Day.” Later Cassie detailed an amicable dinner she had with Combs after they had finally formally broken up, that turned ugly when he forced himself inside her home after dropping her off and allegedly raped her. “And then he raped me in my living room,” Cassie recalled. “I just remember crying and saying no, but it was very fast.” Still, she admitted to another reunion they had some time later, where she had sex with him by choice: “You don’t just turn feelings off that way. I still had a good vision of who he was as a person.” Cassie’s cross-examination by Combs’s defense team is expected to begin tomorrow. On the first day of Cassie’s cross-examination by the Combs defense team, Combs’s lawyers got off to the races aiming to complicate the narrative that Cassie’s participation in the freakoffs was nonconsensual. Much of the day was dominated by text messages, both from around the time the pair started their relationship in the late aughts to circa 2017 near its end, which presented conversations where Cassie can be perceived as being into the freakoffs on her own accord. Example: a 2009 text where Cassie wrote back to Combs, “I’m always ready to freak off lolol.” At one point, Cassie said of these types of messages (specifically about one dated in 2017) that “I would say that loving freakoffs were just words at that point.” In one exchange wherein Cassie and Combs were planning the next freakoff, Combs’s lawyer pointed out that there was no part of the conversation where Cassie objected; Cassie matter-of-factly agreed with a terse “Correct.” Themes of infidelity and jealousy were also explored, with Combs’s lawyers trying to paint Cassie as being jealous of Kim Porter, Combs’s late on-again-off-again love interest and mother to three of his children, while she explored relationships with other entertainers like Kid Cudi and Michael B Jordan. Cassie said the relationship with Cudi began when Combs suggested the two collaborate on music, but was during a break with Combs—although she noted she couldn’t be sure if Combs considered them to be on a break—but that they continued to have freakoffs because “it was a job.” During one stretch that was more clearly a break, Cassie discovered Combs was seeing Gina Hyunh, and stopped interacting with him as she took up a relationship with Michael B. Jordan. There was also a heavy amount of focus on the drug use both between Cassie and Combs and separately. Cassie said one source of Combs’s anger and explosive outbursts was if he would see or hear about her doing drugs with people other than him—this aligns with her testimony on May 14 where she said he once beat her roommate with a wooden hanger when he found them doing drugs in their apartment. Cassie testified that Combs soon became dependent on opiates much as she had, and they sought several remedies to come down from them. Combs’s team is seemingly trying to paint the 2016 hotel video as the product of him lashing out from drugs and withdrawal, not in full control of his faculties. Cassie’s final day on the stand eventually ended with tears, as the defense continued their cross-examination—wherein they attempted to paint her and Combs’s relationship as one simply fraught with toxicity and jealousy—and the prosecutor tagged back in for a final round of questioning. One notable anecdote involved an August 2016 incident where Cassie testified that Combs took her phone and ran down Wilshire Boulevard in LA with it, to call a football player that he suspected she was seeing during one of their breaks. Cassie also texted Combs, “You always want to show me that you have the power and you knock me around. I’m not a rag doll I’m someone’s child.” The last time she and Combs had intercourse—consensually, but following an incident wherein Cassie alleges he raped her—also came up, with emphasis on Cassie’s relationship with her now-husband Alex Fine. She eventually confided both of these incidents to Fine, leading him to punch a wall. A Combs text to Cassie following the alleged rape looks especially unflattering: ““ know I look bad to you. I could tell I didn’t turn you on yesterday. I fell off.” Finally, the defense tried to make an obvious implication in drawing a line from the $20 million settlement Cassie received to her promptly canceling her tour. The prosecution countered this, asking Cassie if she would “give that money back if it meant you never had to have freak-offs?” Cassie replied, “If I never had to have freak-offs I would have agency and autonomy. I wouldn’t have had to work so hard to get it back.” In a loaded rebuttal to the defense’s parade of loving text messages, the prosecutor asked Cassie if those periods ever lasted to which she simply responded “No.” She broke down in tears when the conversation turned to Combs beating her during freakoffs. In the days following Cassie Ventura's near week-long testimony, the prosecution has called a number of other witnesses, including one of Combs's former assistants, some of the freakoff participants who Cassie had identified, and the singer-songwriter Dawn Richard, a former member of the Combs-backed R&B groups Danity Kane and Diddy—Dirty Money. Richard in particular testified to witnessing Cassie's physical abuse, as well as facing thinly-veiled threats from Combs after she tried to appeal to Cassie to leave. The others spoke more about Combs' controlling and demanding nature, especially during the freakoffs. But another blockbuster witness was called on Thursday, May 22 whenKid Cuditook the stand—in, it must be said, aneffortlessly stylish, anti-formal fit—to testify about his relationship with Cassie, which Combs eventually learned of. Cudi spoke of Cassie being visibly terrified and fearful upon finding out that Combs had discovered she was seeing Cudi, at which point Cudi took her to a hotel; at a later point they took up in Connecticut. During this time that Cudi's house was unattended, Cudi says he returned to find his door unlocked, gifts and other things open and strewn about, and his usually free-roaming dog locked in a room. Later in another instance, his dog-sitter and also his frequent collaborator Chip Tha Ripper sent him pictures of his Porsche on fire, with a hole cut in the roof where a Molotov cocktail appeared to have been dropped into it. Cudi eventually called for a neutral-ground meeting to hash things out with Combs which took place at a Soho House; he recalled telling Combs that he was under the assumption he and Cassie were on a break or over. Cudi reportedly got a lot of laughs in the room (as he did on Twitter) for describing Combs' demeanor as “like a supervillain.” He also said that while he was in love with Cassie, the relationship eventually fizzled out after he tried to give her space and she ostensibly went back to Combs. Combs's lawyer Brian Steele, seizing on Cudi's characterization of Cassie as having “played him,” tried to paint a picture that she was playing both him and Combs, separately and against each other, but the angle seemed tenuous.",

    "title": "A$AP Rocky’s Cannes Watch Is Hidden Behind a 2,000-Year-Old Coin",
    "article_text": "Among all the superlative wristwear atCannes, one watch in particular stuck out—a gold bracelet-like piece dripping with diamonds on the wrist ofA$AP Rocky. Called the Monete Catene High Jewellery secret watch, it’s actually part ofBulgari’sladies’ collection—though as we well know by now,this designationdoes little to stop sartorially adventurous men from adopting such pieces. Made of 18-karat rose gold, it features an octagonal case and a rose gold chain bracelet set with roughly four carats of precious stones. The secret sauce, however, is that the dial is hidden, but not quite in the manner of, say, aJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso: In this case, it’s safely tucked away behind a nearly two-millennia-old coin embossed with the visage of the Roman emperor Caracalla (198-217 AD). Open the hinged case cover with the emperor’s likeness, and the actual dial—mother-of-pearl with diamond-set indices and a gold handset—is revealed. Serious watch heads will also appreciate the tiny power plant contained within the case: It’s Bulgari’s Piccolissimo mechanical manufacture micro-movement, a manually-wound caliber with a 3 Hz beat rate and a 30-hour power reserve. Overall, such a watch checks numerous boxes: Horological nerds will love the mechanics, history buffs will appreciate the ancient coin, jewelry lovers will love the beautiful gold and diamonds, and those simply in search of an elegant cocktail watch will dig the complete package. Given its Roman roots,Bulgarihas long incorporated such ancient coins into its jewelry. It’s also far from the only brand to design “hidden” watches:Piaget, in particular, is famous for its watches that used unique “coins” designed bySalvador Dalito hide the dial, as well as a series of timepieces with 19th-centuryAmerican twenty-dollar gold piecesforming the dial cover. And while theJaeger-LeCoultre Reversoisn’t quite a “secret” watch to the same degree as ASAP Rocky’s Bulgari, the dial is indeed hidden behind the caseback when reversed—in this instance, to protect it from errant polo ball thwacks. Another prime example of a secret watch comes from Bulgari itself: The high jewelry versions of its famedSerpentisometimes hide the dial within the snake’s head. VintagePatekcocktail watches from the mid-20th century likewise sometimes obscure the watch dial behind gem-set covers, as do pieces fromOmega,Van Cleef & Arpels,Vacheron Constantin, and others. A more contemporary example is fromCartier: While its Reflection de Cartier doesn’t quite hide the dial from view, the design—which uses a mirror at one end of a bangle-like cuff to reflect the dial back to the viewer—playfully obscures the time. “Secret watches” are a highly specific, semi-obscure timepiece category that exists at the intersection of horology and jewelry—and they’re seriously cool. A$AP Rocky knows this, making for a sartorial moment at Cannes that outshone the more typical watch spotting. If you long for your ownMonette watch, you can reach out to the brand directly…though one has to wonder just how many 2,000-year-old silver denarii of Caracalla the brand has lying around.",

    "title": "Timothee Chalamet Is Dressing For This Knicks Playoff Run Like It’s His Latest Wild-Style Press Tour",
    "article_text": "As theNew York Knickswade througha thrillingly unchartered NBA postseason, the surest bet you could place in advance of any game would be that Timothée Chalamet will be there: sitting courtside, hyping up his beloved team, and wearing some sort of charmingly slovenly ensemble. The actor and native Manhattanite, whose childhood apartment in Hell’s Kitchen was approximately a 15-minute walk from Madison Square Garden, has gone out of his way to attend the team’s playoff games this season, carving out time in his busy Hollywood schedule to jet between arenas. This love is serious: Hewent to Detroitto cheer on the Knicks. Heskipped the Met Galatowatch the game on an iPad. Hell, he’s even got his“born-and-raised LA baddie”girlfriend,Kylie Jenner, cheering on his home team! And for as long as Timmy’s been famous enough to sit (and be photographed) amongst the VIPs in the Garden’s Celebrity Row, he’s steadily built up his blue-and-orange wardrobe. Though the actor’s beenbing-bongingsince long before he was rubbing elbows with fellow Knicks fanatics like Ben Stiller and Spike Lee, he only recently started really dressing like a high-profile superfan. Luckily for us, the internet has photo documentation of every Knicks game Chalamet has attended in the last seven-ish years. Let’s review, shall we? TC’s customized Chrome Hearts Timberland boots have become his new courtside talisman. Whether or not they will bring good or bad luck remains to be seen. ¡Nueva York! Sitting alongside Bad Bunny at Game 6, Chalamet wore a customChrome Heartsvelour tracksuit (likely thing for him to do) with a striped polo shirt and matching Chromed-up Timbs. The moment Timmy postedthose filthy Timbson the ’gram, we knew what was going down. While Timmy’s girlfriend,Kylie Jenner, and her sister, Kendall, both opted for the standard courtside-baddie uniform (tank top, leather pants, strappy sandals), Chalamet followed a failsafe mantra of the diehead New York sports fan:Clear eyes, cooked Timbs, can’t lose.That, and he managed to dig up a pretty sickvintage Knicks teefrom the ’95 playoffs. 🎶Ricksout for the Knicks, Ricks out for the Knicks!🎶 (The vintage Starter jacket is cool, too.) Per my more sports-mindedGQcolleagues, these performance-style hoodiesseem to be a bit divisive. But given that Chalamet went all the way to chilly Detroit to see the Knicks’ round-one matchup against the Pistons, it made sense that he’d bundle up a bit. This is a classic Timmy Tim post-swag mash-up of niche streetwear and wonky luxury wares: a Juun.J hoodie, camo-print jeans,Dior loafers, and a Knicks snapback. And lest we forget,that mustache. Who else is pairing a Raf Simons fall 1997 jacket with some track pants andUggs? Only Timmy Tim, that’s who! When Chalamet was in the depths of dressing for his bonkersA Complete Unknownpress tour—which also happened to coincide with this Knicks-Grizzlies game at MSG—he leaned heavily into 2000s nostalgia. This outfit has several aughts-era relics at play including anAlexander McQueen skull scarf(a grail amongst Kitson-patronizing socialites of yore), heavily whiskeredTrue Religion jeans, and a punchy Knicks leather bomber jacket. A Yankees hat at a Knicks game: What wouldMayor Eric Adamshave to say about this? A self-referential moment from Timmy here: the bookshelf-printed sweater is from the Japanese label Sacai’s fall 2023 collection, which pulled imagery from Christopher Nolan’s 2014 filmInterstellar, in which Chalamet appeared as the teenage son of Matthew McConaughey’s Cooper. (To reference another Nolan movie,Inception, there’s diegetic levels to this!) Also featuring what appears to be a fresh-from-the-box pair of Nike Field General sneakers. A kooky Burberry hoodie, yes, but also an Ivy Park face mask! Does theBeyhiveknow about this? Aside from the Isabel Marant sneakers, the real star of this outfit—aScarfaceparody tee featuring Stewie fromFamily Guy—washiding beneathTimmy’s Prada puffer. Fun fact: Timothée Chalamet’s mom, Nicole Flender, danced at Lincoln Center with the New York City Ballet as a child and later appeared on Broadway inA Chorus Line—hence, perhaps, this hat. Or, asBritishVogueput it at the time, the cap proved that the then-rising star was also “the pin-up for every aspiring actress” and “a heartbreaker for the modern era.” This game took place a little over a week after Chalamet’s first Oscars ceremony, when he was nominated for his breakthrough performance in Luca Guadagnino’sCall Me By Your Name. He was well on his way to becoming a big star at this point, which you can tell because of one extremely Hollywood accessory: a trucker hat from Brentwood Country Mart, LA’s finest purveyor of upmarket goods. Way back in 2017, not long afterCall Me By Your Namehit select theaters, Chalamet watched the Knicks courtside with two former classmates, Ansel Elgort and Violetta Komyshan, from Manhattan’s Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School, a.k.a. the school fromFame. At the time, Timmy had most recently beena student at NYU, and on this night, in a leather jacket, skinny jeans, and Dr. Martens, he really looked the part. More From GQ Connect ©2025Condé Nast.

    "title": "With The Rehearsal and The Accountant 2, Pop Culture Is Thinking Differently About Autism",
    "article_text": "\"One in 68 children are diagnosed with autism in this country,” a character called The Neurologist tells us in Gavin O’Connor’s 2016 thrillerThe Accountant.On April 15th, the CDC updated that number to 1 in 31, which means 3.2% of all the 8-year-old children in America fall somewhere on the spectrum. The release of this study followscomments made bythe new Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, grown-upstraining-kid memeRobert Francis Kennedy Jr., who said that autistic kids “will never pay taxes. They'll never hold a job. They'll never play baseball. They'll never write a poem. They'll never go out on a date,” and claimed the condition is “20 times worse than COVID.” Kennedy seems to have decided that autism, long viewed by actual scientists as a heterogeneous and largely hereditary genetic condition, is in fact a disease you can catch from toxins in the air or processed foods, and hasvowed to identify a specific cause by September. Kennedy’s comments, while grotesque, tone-deaf, and outrageous, do serve to remind us that millions of Americans—including high-ranking political appointees—remain entirely ignorant of the many forms and faces of autism. If you ask five random people in your life to simply tell you what autismis, their answers will likely run the gamut, from the “disease” Kennedy understands it as, to the “gift” it can be. Maybe one in five will tell you its CDC definition: A developmental disorder that can make social interaction challenging. Pop culture is part of the reason this ignorance persists. In the nearly four decades since Barry Levinson’s filmRain Manwon Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Dustin Hoffman’s portrayal of an autistic man, representations of autism in television and film have been spotty and usually problematic. (There have been films about autistic characters since the late ‘60s, butRain Man, a critical hit that made hundreds of millions at the box office, is an obvious inflection point that cemented popular notions of how autism presents itself.) It may be the perfect time, in other words, for O’Connor’sAccountantfranchise to return; the sequel helps meet the need for more art depicting characters on the autism spectrum, and serves as a perhaps-imperfect bellwether for a near-decade-long revolution in how autism has been represented on screen. In the originalAccountant, released eight years ago at the peak of the comic-book-movie era, director Gavin O’Connor, screenwriter Bill Dubuque, and starBen Affleckpresented a simple but radical proposition: an autistic superhero. Christian Wolff (played by Affleck, a few months after his first appearance as the DCU’s Batman) is a rich, hyper-capable vigilante whose “disability” is also his superpower. The film was more Shane Black than Russo Brothers—a clever, nimble, chatty, funny, violent thriller with many loose threads tied expertly, a big beating heart, and something real to say about life on the spectrum. It could also be construed as offensive—a fantastical, reverse-ableist story that exoticizes the superhuman capabilities of a neuroatypical genius portrayed by an ostensibly neurotypical actor. But the film was powerful because Affleck’s measured performance was practically a rebuke of Dustin Hoffman’s crudely-drawn Raymond Babbitt. Wolff is a high-functioning person on the spectrum. He has a multitude of sensory issues, starts tasks he struggles to finish, and wants to mask, to make connections and exist in society and maybe even find love—while providing a haven for young and gifted kids on the spectrum, like he once was. Christian Wolff’s origin story in the film personifies the most common ways parents react upon receiving the diagnosis that their child is autistic. Jason Davis’ Neurologist, the head of the fictional Harbor Neuroscience Institute, represents parental understanding and love, and the embrace of the condition; Wolff’s father, a military psychological operations officer, represents the opposite approach. “The world is not a sensory-friendly place, and that’s where he needs to live,” he opines early in the movie; accordingly, he raises both his sons with tough love, training them by paying monks to beat the shit out of them, evangelizing familial loyalty above all things, and teaching them to look out for and take care of each other by forcing them to confront Christian’s bullies. Wolff grows up to be a mercenary who travels the world, taking out targets he deems morally unfit to walk the earth in exchange for substantial payment; when he’s not doing that, he seeks comfort and release by self-administering occupational therapy using a range of controlled-chaos stims—Abstract Expressionist paintings, black metal, strobe lights and Schrader-style self-flagellation with a wooden roller. The premise and its execution are both sometimes laughable, but you can see the movie’s heart in its depiction of the fictional Harbor Institute, a dream of a safe space offering home, purpose and community to kids the public school system might once have shuttled off to Special Ed to be forgotten. In the decades sinceRain Man, culture has tried to represent autism onscreen with a measure of sensitivity, and occasionally succeeded. We’ve seen versions of Hoffman’sRain Manperformance (further) spoofed, along with similarly abhorrent depictions like W. Earl Brown’s earmuffed Warren Jensen in 1998’sSomething About Mary(directed by the Farrelly Brothers,who’ve since been hailed for casting a range of actual people with disabilities in their films.) We’ve seen obvious depictions, like Claire Danes’ standard-issue 2010 biopicTemple Grandin, but also works like Adam Eliot’s heartbreaking, beautiful 2009 stop-motion filmMary and Max, about the unlikely pen pal friendship between a loner Australian girl and an obese Jewish New Yorker with Asperger's Syndrome (now considered part of the autism spectrum, rather than a separate condition unto itself.) Also in 2009, Dan Harmon’s NBC sitcomCommunityintroduced Abed Nadir, a half-Palestinian half-Polish college student whose affect suggested he was on the autism spectrum, although he was never canonically diagnosed. The show’s creator, Dan Harmon, has said he realized he was on the spectrum while researching the character;Community’s portrayal of Abed (and Danny Pudi’s performance in the role) was powerful and progressive at the time, because Abed’s autism was simply an aspect of his personality that the show’s surrogate-family study group accepted and embraced. Communityset the stage for the current boom in depictions of autism on TV: OnHBO’s hitThe Pitt, Taylor Dearden’s Dr. King has an autistic sister and displays some symptoms of autism spectrum disorder herself; her familiarity with the condition becomes an asset when she knows to dim the lights in order to calm an autistic patient, a scene that’s one of many highlights of the show’s first season (and follows in a tradition of doctors on the spectrum). Amazon’sReacher, whose third season wrapped up in March, featuresAlan Ritchsonas a hulking former army cop who’s obsessed with vinyl and can’t connect to anyone or stick in any one place for any length of time, qualities that have ledfans to speculate the character may land somewhere on the autism spectrum. And Netflix’sLove on the Spectrumhas been a mainstay on the app’s top 10 as well as TikTok’s FYP since its third season was released at the beginning of April, turning its cast into celebrity advocatespublicly pushing back against RFK Jr.’s idiocyand suggesting the future of neurodivergence on screen should be in the hands of the neurodivergent. It’s indicative of a dawningEveryone’s kind of autistic LOLsentiment that prevails online, where being “on the spectrum” has become a catch-all term for a broad range of quirky and/or semi-anti-social behaviors—which is annoying, but also constitutes progress. In the cult Comedy Central seriesNathan For You, a spoof of the business-rescue genre of reality TV, the Canadian comedian, writer/producer and actor Nathan Fielder supplied actual small-business owners with absurdly complicated, usually dumb/brilliant solutions to their workaday problems. (In one episode, he helps out a Hollywood Boulevard souvenir shop in need of foot traffic by staging a fake movie production in the store, complete with a Johnny Depp impersonator as the star, and recruiting tourists to make purchases; informed that this constitutes fraud, he turns the footage into a real movie and organizes a film festival to legitimize it.) Fielder has since gone on to co-create, with Benny Safdie, the prestige cringe-comedy seriesThe Curse, which he starred in with Emma Stone. And since 2022, he’s been the creative brain behind HBO’sThe Rehearsal, an ever-shifting and undefinable reality-TV experiment in which he contrives complicated simulations in order to figure out how complicated human interactions can be streamlined. Fieldertold Rolling Stone in a 2017 interviewthat his “Nathan Fielder” character isn’t meant to be a depiction of a person on the autism spectrum. “There’s a lot of social disconnects,” he said, “that people experience all the time that have nothing to do with autism or anything.” And when asked if he thinks he has a “developmental disorder,” he recoiled: “Please don’t tell me this is the angle of your piece,” he said. But in bothNathan For YouandThe Rehearsal, he constantly departs from his own conceits by turning the camera on himself and making his own failure to connect with other people on platonic and/or romantic levels a central part of the story. And in both shows, Fielder deploys a monotone, dead-eyed non-affect—a kind of autistic-Borat persona—to coax unscriptable reactions from his discomfited subjects. It was and still is impossible to know how much of Fielder’s onscreen behavior is performance and how much is just Nathan Fielder; there’s a stark divide within his fan base between people convinced he’s 100% genuine and those who believe “Nathan Fielder” is 100% a comedic construction. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. WithThe Rehearsal, Fielder has emerged as TV’s reigning bard of spectrumcore, even if he wouldn't welcome the tag. The show is a work of art expressly focused on human awkwardness and people’s inability to communicate, connect or relate to one another. The show’s first season was a series of grand exercises in masking, in which Fielder marshalled an army of actors and complex scale-model sets in an attempt to enable honest communication between friends, reconciliation between brothers, and a parental bond for a childless woman through infinite roleplay—before dropping the pretense of selflessness and making the season about how “Fielder” is helping others find the connection he craves in real life. The second season ofThe Rehearsalis—broadly speaking, and perhaps allegorically—about Fielder (or “Fielder”) trying to prevent the incidence of plane crashes by developing ways of improving communication between airline pilots. But in the season’s penultimate episode, he takesthe online chatter around his alleged autismand turns it into plot as only he can. He visits CARD, the Center for Autism and Related Disorders, and takes a test that gauges emotional states based on partial expressions, mainly in the eyes, and struggles. He clearly knows what he is doing and what these scenes are suggesting, but leaves us to decide if this is a TV show manipulating us by affirming what we think we know or a deeply personal confessional. Without giving too much away, this Sunday’s season finale pushes this tension to the breaking point, presenting Fielder as a man who has masked for so long he’s lost possession of himself, but remains unwilling to examine the self-enforced guardrails that make him who he is. It leaves us with no easy answers, but confirms that the show is the most daring, compelling, and often moving experiment conducted on TV in a long, long time—particularly for viewers who can see themselves in Fielder’s existential dilemma. All things considered,The Accountant 2is somewhat of a letdown. Affleck remains good at the finer details—looking into the middle distance, appearing to make eye contact, practicing a smile that nevertheless is always awkward in photos—but reverses many of the wise decisions he made in his first, more relaxed depiction of Christian Wolff. He speaks in an affected clip that could grate, distract or potentially offend the viewer. The firstAccountanttook as much pleasure in its depiction of forensic accounting as it did in its kills; this one is more pulp and less procedure, and less fun to watch as a result. But I can’t shake this franchise, because of the conversations around autism it’s willing to engage. Where the first film gave us a romantic subplot pairing Affleck with Anna Kendrick, this one shifts its focus to the sibling love between Affleck and his sugar-fiending/comfort-seeking younger brother Braxton, an assassin played capably by a ripped and heavily-tattooedJon Bernthal. The brothers meet briefly at the end ofThe Accountantbut are estranged again at the outset ofThe Accountant 2, which begins with Wolff hiding out in Idaho, eating his geometrically precise breakfasts-for-dinner in an Airstream trailer. On some level, he’s comfortable being alone, and believes he’s doing his brother a favor by keeping his distance; meanwhile, Braxton grapples with acute loneliness and the pain of abandonment. The movie is about a reunion between two brothers who clearly need each other but have trouble connecting. Braxton has spent a lifetime figuring out how to be a brother to his neurodivergent sibling; Christian has spent a lifetime figuring out how to be neurodivergent. Christian was the big brother who was often not capable of being the supportive guide that role in a family typically demands, and Braxton carries the resentment of the younger neurotypical sibling, who had to apologize, excuse, translate and fight for his brother throughout his childhood, and now wants to understand why his brother doesn’t love him in a conventional way he can comprehend. The brothers bicker and pick at old scabs. They ask each other hard questions and tell hard truths and share trauma and a twin bed—but beneath it all is sadness over lost time and the love and pain of two men possessed by a primal desire to work their way back to each other. There’s a hangout scene in the middle of the film that could play as laughable, but broke me in half. Braxton and Christian are at a honky tonk in LA, where Christian gets hit on by a beautiful woman, but fumbles the approach with his awkwardness. Braxton berates him, and Christian responds by getting up and putting himself out there, line dancing with the woman in question and nearly taking her home. Braxton, who has seen his brother dismantle teams of professional killers by himself, is stunned at his courage and his ability to thrive in the kind of social situation he’s always struggled with. Bernthal screams “That’s my brother! That’s my big brother out there,” radiating genuine surprise and happiness. I thought of 1998’sThe Sixth Sense, a film I showed my son for the first time a few weeks ago. I hadn’t seen it in years and it spoke to me on a completely different level with this viewing. As even people who haven’t seen it probably know by now, it’s a movie about a kid, played by Haley Joel Osment, who sees dead people—but its central relationship is between the kid, Cole, and Lynn, his mother (Toni Collette). Throughout the film, Colette’s character struggles to connect with her son, who’s ostracized at school because he is emotionally explosive, awkward, and occasionally frightening as a result of seeing the world differently than everyone around him does. It's still the best film ever made byM. Night Shyamalan, a writer/director who, likeDavid Lynchand David Cronenberg, makes disorienting horror films about characters who are afraid of a strange world they have trouble processing. All three filmmakers have been criticized for writing stilted dialogue that “doesn’t sound like the way people talk,” which their characters often deliver in the clipped monotone that can be an indicating symptom of autism spectrum disorder. All three men grew up in the world I grew up in, which didn’t understand autism or how to talk about it, when autism carried a stigma and was considered a tragic affliction—as America’s MAHA health czar would still have you believe. The Sixth Sensehas largely been reduced, in cultural memory, to its final twist—but on this rewatch, the film’s real emotional gut-punch was the penultimate scene between Cole and Lynn, set in a car in Philly traffic. It’s a magic trick by Shyamalan, the greatest writing of his career. Throughout the film, Lynn and Cole have struggled to communicate, because Cole doesn’t understand how to tell her what is going on with him, or Lynn hasn’t yet learned how to listen. But finally, they break through in tears. Shyamalan shows us the child comforting the parent, channeling the voice of Lynn’s dead mother but also saying exactly what Lynn wishes she could say to Cole. He’s speaking the words every parent of an autistic child wants to say as often and as loud as possible but at times may lack the patience, or the presence of mind to—because being a parent of an autistic child, like being a parent period, is a process of constant, nagging failure that it is up to you to endure if you’re ever going to get “good” at the lifetime of work it demands. In the scene, Cole tells Lynn something he couldn’t possibly know, that she had visited her mother’s grave and while she was there, asked her a question. Lynn wanted to know if she ever made her mother proud. Cole tells her the answer is, “Every day.”",

    "title": "Kid Cudi Testified at Diddy’s Trial in a Biker Jacket and Vintage Levi’s",
    "article_text": "Scott Mescudi, the rapper best known as Kid Cudi, testified on Thursday morning atSean “Diddy” Combs’s ongoing sex trafficking and racketeering trial. His testimony touched on various incidents that followed Combs finding out about Mescudi’s 2011 relationship with musician Cassie Ventura, who also dated Diddy, including an alleged arson involving Cudi’s Porsche being destroyed by a Molotov cocktail. Arriving at Manhattan’s federal courthouse in the rain, Cudi exited a black SUV while puffing on a half-smoked cigarette. Rather than a standard suit, he was dressed casually in a scuffed leather biker jacket, white T-shirt,Salomon XT-6sneakers, and a well-worn pair of orange-tab Levi’s blue jeans, which are a favorite amongvintage-denim aficionados. He wore a small, diamond-set cross earring that dangled from a gold hoop in his left ear. The rapper Kid Cudi arrived at Manhattan's federal courthouse in a leather jacket, white T-shirt, and vintage Levi's. “I love the fit,” one onlooker shouted to Cudi ina videocaptured outside the courthouse. “Not too serious!” Photographs of Cudi’s arrival began circulating on social media. As has become de rigueur in such cases, internet commenters fixated on the cinematic nature of the images; others complimented Cudi’s laidback style. Some likened his look to James Dean or Danny Zuko, John Travolta’s character inGrease. “He is living my dream of walking past reporters and into a courtroom on a rainy day while ripping a cig and wearing a leather jacket,” one spectator wroteon X. Some cushioned their praise with caveats acknowledging the gravity of the Diddy case. “Alright but these photos go kinda hard,” reada commenton Complex’s Instagram account. “This dude got on a leather jacket in the rain. He about to give them a movie,” went another. The response echoed similar outsized interest in the style narrative of other high-profile courthouse appearances earlier this year. In February, rapper A$AP Rocky wore a string ofimpeccably tailored Saint Laurent suitsduring his felony assault trial in Los Angeles; later that month, Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December, raised eyebrows forwearing loafers without socksduring his pretrial hearing in Manhattan. Cudi exiting the courthouse. Inside the courtroom, reporter Matthew Russell, who is covering the trial via his local news outlet, Inner City Press,confirmedCudi took the stand in this very outfit, leather jacket and all. He testified that he and Cassie dated in 2011, and in December of that year, a frightened Cassie had called him to discuss Diddy’s furious response to their relationship. “What was your reaction to your car being set on fire?” the prosecution asked the rapper, perInner City Press. “What the fuck,” Cudi replied—a response that prompted an objection from the defense, which the judge overruled.",

    "title": "What Trail Running In Wyoming With Serious Pros Taught Me About Life, Endurance and Competition",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterPulling Weeds With Chris Black,in which the columnist weighs in on hot topics in culture.Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. Flying somewhere to exercisehas become a recurring theme in this column, so when Satisfy Running contacted me months back about joining their pro trail running team for a retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, I said yes without much thought. I like rubbing elbows with the best, no matter the discipline, and I enjoyrunningenough that I figured I'd also enjoy a few beautiful days in America’s heartland, breathing clean air while I keep my eyes peeled for bears. I had no idea what I’d signed up for. My Dad was a casual runner, and my father-in-law was a marathon enthusiast. I have friends who run extreme distances on the weekends and others who belong to one of the ubiquitous running clubs in New York City, where young singles go to run three miles and meet someone to have sex with. I ran fairly seriously during different periods of my life, but now I only do it to warm up on the Woodway at Equinox or when I take a Barry’s Boot Camp class.Trail runningis a foreign concept; I dislike being outside, and the terrain makes it challenging to listen to music or zone out. I’d discover soon enough that it requires a learned, deep concentration. I arrived in Jackson Hole, home to the most charming airport in the world and the only one located inside anational park. It is spotlessly clean and dotted with fireplaces, and strangely devoid of long lines and bad attitudes. Tommy Hubert, the head of communications for Satisfy, promptly picked me up. He has a beautiful head of hesher hair and wore an oversized vintage Dinosaur Jr. shirt, a Sleep hat, vintage Levi’s, theHokaSatisfy x Mafate Speed 4 Lite shoe, and several pieces of turquoise jewelry. The rented Jeep Wrangler was already a little dirty and had Satisfy stickers on the dusty bumper. We started the 40-minute trek to Diamond Cross Ranch, our ground zero for the weekend. Hubert played great music, everything from Magnitude to Sugababes, as we got to know one another. I wasn’t surprised by his eclectic choices. When I met the founder, Brice Partouche, in Paris, we talked about The Get Up Kids and Texas is The Reason; the company demands good taste in music. Kanye West made Diamond Cross famous when he hosteda listening party for hisYealbumhere back in 2018. It is a humble set of cabins and a functioning ranch with a huge barn down the street. It’s in the middle of nowhere, but the wifi was strong, and the cows I could see gathering from my cabin window didn’t make too much noise. Satisfy had gathered their pro team in part to shoot a campaign and do some serious running with a coach (Jamil Coury from Aravaipa Running) while simultaneously weartesting their new shoe,The Rocker. The pros come from around the world: Mike Versteeg from Arizona, Vaida Mary Jane from London, Jakob Åberg from Sweden, and Cat Bradley from Hawaii. Over dinner in the shared lodge, they traded war stories and used many words and phrases I wasn’t familiar with (Cocodona, UTMB, 100 miler, aid station, etc). Even though they share a sponsor in Satisfy, they only see each other a few times a year at different races. The first run that my fellow visiting amateur Grace Cook (who runs seriously) and I did was difficult (for me at least); the altitude was stinging, and the conditions were wet and snowy in spots. We did 7 miles or so, and the pros finished long before I made it. Because it’s an individual sport and these people are hard-wired to compete, it felt friendly but still competitive. They made it look easy, gliding across the rocks and mud effortlessly. I buddied up with two of the pros pretty quickly:Stian Dahl Sommerseth, a sinewy blonde from Oslo, Norway, works full time as a legal advisor to the Norwegian Transportation Department, andMax Jolliffefrom Costa Mesa, California, an apparel designer. Sommerseth looked like a runner, tall and thin, and wore clothes like a ’90s Prada model. Jolliffe was smaller and fit, almost like a SoCal surfer and skater who hit his thirties and took up jiujitsu. They happily answered all my questions about the sport, the training, recovery, diet, and sponsors. After Cook and I completed a snow and ice-filled morning run, I hit the on-site sauna (it was simply a sauna trailer, brought in by truck and dropped there—genius business idea) with Jolliffe, where I learned that he had self-financed a documentary calledKing of Moab, directed by Tylor Wolter, about him winning the Moab 240, a grueling 238.8 mile ultra marathon race that takes several days to complete and traverses desert canyons, mountain ranges, and red rock mesas. After twenty minutes, it was time for a cold plunge, something I’ve tried in the past but haven’t been able to master. We stumbled out of the sauna into the crisp Wyoming air and went to the two metal tubs full of ice and water. Jolliffe saidWe’re doing three minutes, just breathe with me. Not wanting to humiliate myself in front of anotherex-drug addictwithtattoos, I jumped in, and the panic set in almost immediately. But as we went on, Max’s calm but sure voice kept my breathing monitored, and the three minutes went by quickly. We did this—20 minutes in the sauna, 3 minutes cold plunge—two more times. I went back to my room feeling high. My body was vibrating. I watchedKing of Moabon YouTube and instantly understood the sport I had been trying to comprehend since I had arrived in Jackson Hole. It is brutal, physical, and deeply intense, but it seems like a mind-over-matter situation. Sure, there is strategy and training involved, but my takeaway from the film and the retreat was that these people are wired differently, willing to endure pain and mental exhaustion for little more than the glory inherent in doing something hard. (The trail runners I met all seemed to have full-time jobs: coaching amateurs, UX design, engineering at Spotify.) Sommerseth has been running since college, temperature training by running for hours in layers of clothes and then getting into the sauna; Jolliffe has only been running for four years. But they have both won prestigious races. Doing something at the highest level just because you want to is something we should all admire. Most of us, me especially, are driven by money, power, or success. Maybe the key is to find something you love and do it until it kills you. I left Wyoming tired, sore, but deeply grateful to experience something genuinely new. I won’t be signing up for Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc, but I will cheer on my new friends.",

    "title": "After Nearly a Decade, the Iconic Air Jordan 4 ‘White Cement’ Is Finally Returning",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. What makes a sneaker great? Is it a design, a colorway, a moment? Is it the right person wearing it at the right time when the right people are looking? Is it just a really good ad campaign? Truth be told, it’s all of the above. Designers can twist their brains into pretzels trying to craft a shoe that will resonate with the masses—but the fact is, some things you just can’t plan. For instance, whenTinker Hatfielddesigned theAir Jordan 4way back in 1988 (the shoe debuted in ’89) he certainly took into consideration what worked indesigning the 3, which rejuvenated the Jordan line after the middling response to the 2. The visible Air unit carried over, as did elements of the colorway construction (the iconic cement pattern started with the 3 and would appear on the 4 as well). Hatfield also looked at what could be improved on from the 4, adding souped-up performance elements to the 4 like mesh panels on the shoe’s upper allowing for a more flexible shoe. It worked—the Air Jordan 4 is a perfect shoe, and its ‘White Cement’ colorway (easily the best of the shoe’s original run) quickly became one of the most beloved sneakers of all time. What Hatfield couldn’t have anticipated in putting together this classic is how the rest of the story would play out. Air Jordan 4 OG ‘White Cement’ He couldn’t have known that in the Eastern Conference playoffs in 1989,Michael Jordanwould heave up a Hail Mary buzzer beater in a hotly contested Game 5 against the Cleveland Cavaliers, advancing the Bulls with a final score of 101-100. He couldn’t have predicted the life that single shot would take on for itself, immortalized in highlight reels and on posters in young fans’ bedrooms for decades to come. He didn’t know that every time someone saw a picture of that shot, they’d see the Air Jordan 4 (albeit the Bred colorway). He didn’t know that 1989 would see the release ofSpike Lee’sDo the Right Thing, featuringan extended scene highlighting a scuffed pair of ‘White Cement’ 4s—perhaps bringing the idea of scuffed kicks as a taboo to the masses for the first time. The Air Jordan 4 didn’t singlehandedly create the hype around Jordans, but you could argue that the 4 is the shoe that helped popularize Jordans as a concept, as cultural currency, as something to be desired and cherished, as a shoe that warranted focus in a scene in an Academy Award-nominated film. It did so because of Hatfield’s work as a designer, sure, but as with all great sneakers, it’s never quite as simple as looking good. A shoe has to meet the moment–and the Air Jordan 4 ‘White Cement’ absolutely did. For the first time in nine years, the Air Jordan 4 ‘White Cement’ is hitting shelves. It’s the best recreation of the original 1989 silhouette to date and it’s going to sell outfast. The shoe is available on May 24 viaSNKRS,Foot Locker, and select retailers at a price of $225.",

    "title": "Paige Bueckers Wore a Legendary Tunnel Fit for Her First WNBA Game in Minnesota",
    "article_text": "For a renowned athlete likePaige Bueckers, firmly at a point where every move she makes generates headlines, an occasion as momentous as her first WNBA game in her home state called for a truly special outfit. On Wednesday night, when Bueckers pulled up to the Target Center for her Dallas Wings’ meeting with the Minnesota Lynx, she was draped in lilac. The pleasing shade of purple wasn’t the only notable aspect of the rookie’s fit, however. The entire look was cooked up byDapper Dan(known to most as “Dap”), the peerless Harlem designer who first melded the worlds of hip-hop and fine tailoring. “Dapper Dan is a pioneer and absolute legend in the fashion world,” Bueckers toldGQvia email. “He’s one of the best tailors and has such a strong, unique point of view. Working with him was a cool experience because I got to meet him, see how much he loves what he does, and watch that passion come through in his designs.” Bueckers, who grew up in nearby St. Louis Park, Minnesota, wanted to make a statement with her inauguralMinneapolistunnel fit. By placing the responsibility in Dapper Dan’s ever-capable hands, she ensured her look would not only be a one-of-one, but also come laced with Dap’s signature drip. The end result was a handcrafted tracksuit—a slightly elevated take on classic streetwear—which prominently featured Bueckers’ preferred hue, a muted shade oflight purple. Dap’s logo adorned the jacket, too, leaving no question about who was responsible for this head turner. “It's nice that she's entering this world with her favorite color, the lilac,” Dap said, calling in from Harlem. “It is nice that she gets a chance to reflect herself, and it’s nice that I get a chance to bring that out. Every artist that I’ve ever [worked with], I sit down with them and find out what they want to say. For me, the garment, it must say something to you. It must tell a story. Whatever you want people to think of you, you have to dress that way.Youhave to tell that story.” The story of Bueckers’WNBAhomecoming was a bittersweet one, as the Wings lost by four and she put up a 12-point, 10-assist double-double. Her entrance was a memorable part of the evening, too. In addition to using a color near and dear to Bueckers’ heart, Dap incorporated some subtle Western motifs in the drawstrings and pants, an homage to the point guard’s new home in Texas. The rust orange used for the striping down the pant legs and jacket sleeves—and also in the cuffs at the bottom of the pleated pants—really sings when paired with the lilac. If you’re looking to decorate a room with that lilac, by the way, Sherwin-Williams—the paint company who teamed up with Dap and Bueckers to create the ensemble—officially calls it Radiant Lilac SW 0074. According to Sherwin-Williams, Radiant Lilac SW 0074 is theirleastpopular color, leading them to recently dub it “The Loneliest Color of 2025.” “The stars must have been aligned,” Dap said, “because I've never been chosen by any brand to be thecreative director. Every color is important, just like every person is important. When you look at it, I was the least desired color at one point until I got to where I am today.” Dap’s breakthrough came in the ’80s, when he styled many of therapperssynonymous with that era, like LL Cool J, Eric B. & Rakim, and Run-DMC. Dap, now 80 years young, sees some parallels between the rise of hip-hop and the current cultural moment that women’s basketball is enjoying. “Getting to do this for Paige is going back in time and doing the first outfits I did for the hip-hop artists when they were first emerging,” he said. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. But it wasn’t just the fellas who helped Dap blow up. He also dressed female artists like Salt-N-Pepa, as well as Brooklyn’s own Diane Dixon, a track star who wonOlympic goldin 1984 and a silver medal in 1988. “I tell the men this all the time—it wasn't the men who made the brands pay attention to me. It was the women,” Dap asserted. “They're the ones who protested, the ones that said, ‘Dapper Dan, he did this first.’ Now I get a chance to salute Paige.” Even though Bueckers was still decades away from being born when Dap first hit the scene, the significance of this collaboration was certainly not lost on her. She called wearing a Dap fit a “privilege” and pointed to its “quiet confidence” as one of the many reasons she liked the getup. “The overall design felt perfect for me,” Bueckers said. “It’s a mix oftailoringbut still has that laid-back, chill, sweatsuit vibe. It’s fashion-forward, but comfortable. I thought it was a perfect balance of style and ease.” Perhaps better than anyone, Dap understands that style is constantly flowing and bending with the times, much like one of his neighborhood’s famous landmarks. “I often equate it with the Harlem River,” he said of fashion’s evolution. “It's always there, but it's always moving. You just got to understand the current so you know when to dive in and to get out.” Bueckers, Dap, and Sue Wadden (Sherwin-Williams Director of Color Marketing) While Bueckers is not the first athlete Dap has outfitted, she’s the biggest one of the modern era, which sparked a conversation about his lifelong attraction tobasketball. “I grew up where we made basketball great, going toRucker Park,” he explained. “My best friend's a playground hero. Joe Hammond and Pee Wee Kirkland, we all grew up together. Basketball, that's big with us, man. To see women be able to excel in it now, men love watching!”",

    "title": "26 Best Camp Shirts for Men, According to GQ",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The best camp collar shirts have two things in common: a notched collar that lies flat and a sublime chillness. They’ve been putting fellas in a vacation state of mind for nearly a century (more on that below), but the last decade has seen a resurgence in the streets—and the resorts—because camp shirts can do so much, with so little effort. We’ve seen the camp collar quickly infiltrate summer wardrobes (ours included) because it sits in the center of asummer shirtingVenn diagram: It’s a polo with more panache, a button-front shirt after a few piña coladas, a tee that’s trying harder. Over shorts andswim trunks, under suit jackets, alongsidechinosand summer pants, the camp shirt does it all. From about June through September, pulling one on feels like the obvious choice. And then suddenly that one in your closet becomes two, and then four, and then… Which is the other beauty of the camp collar: there are an endless variety of options available. Designs range from simple to funky to freaky, and you should sip from all cups. Sometimes you’ll hear the camp collar called a cabana collar, but the critical detail—no collar stand means the collar lies flat and becomes more of a lapel—remains the same. Shape and depth will vary (and we’ll get into some thoughts on chest-baring specifics at the bottom). You’ll know you have the right camp shirt when it makes you feel like an island-hopping globetrotter. Point is, the best camp shirts will take you lots of places this summer, even if you’re staying close to home. Here are our favorites, broken down by style. When the shirt of summer meets the fabric of summer, breezy, beautiful magic happens. Linen stays true to the camp shirts bloodlines, and also truly shines when the humidity goes swamp mode, or you need to layer something under a suit jacket for your buddy’s bigbeach wedding. Alex Mill Alex Mill Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Kartik Research Mr Porter Portuguese Flannel Huckberry Not that any of the shirts here can’t be worn indiscriminately, but there’s something to be said for a shirt—camp collar or otherwise—that’s so clean and simple, you can pull it from your closet blindfolded and trust it’ll play nice with whatever else you’re wearing.You’ll get lots of mileage out of each of these; so much so, that you may find yourself developing a camp collar-based uniform. And nobody will be mad about it. Rag & Bone Nordstrom 3Sixteen Huckberry Bonobos Bonobos Gitman Vintage Huckberry Polo Ralph Lauren Saks J.Crew J.Crew Everlane Everlane Outdoor Voices Outdoor Voices The camp shirt may have a collar, but it’s really a casual shirt—far more simpatico with board shorts than the board room. That said, plenty of summer nights (and days) call for a looser, cooler version of formal: weddings, big dates, clubs, parties, and wandering Paris while channeling Serge Gainsbourg. That’s where a dressier camp shirt—maybe made from silk, or with a little extra shine—comes into its own. Ami Paris Nordstrom Helmut Lang Neiman Marcus Saturdays NYC Saturdays NYC Corridor Amazon Anycamp shirt deserves a spot in your carry-on, but if you’re taking a break from the grind, why not channel Walton Goggins inWhite Lotusand let some chaos into your life, shirt-wise? Prints—botanical or animal—or a little bit of see-through sexiness in the form of a lace or mesh knit are waiting for you. Pair them with something a little bit more low-key, like chino shorts or an unstructured suit jacket, if you want to turn down the volume for the hotel restaurant. Bode Bode Jacquemus Nordstrom Orlebar Brown Mr Porter Corridor Huckberry Remember when we said camp shirts had a runway resurgence? We were talking about these ones, specifically. The world’s vibiest designers, likeGrace Wales Bonner, have been playing around with camp collars for a while now, dealing in luxe materials and MOMA-worthy prints. Wales Bonner Bergdorff Goodman Celine Mr Porter Dries Van Noten Nordstrom Saint Laurent Saks The proper fit:When you start shopping for shirts, you’ll see words like boxy, slim, oversized, straight, cropped, or athletic. But camp shirts are a unique in that they’re best when they let the breeze in. We prefer a camp collar shirt that hangs from your shoulders and stands away from your torso. Not muumuu huge, but a little airspace goes a long way. That extra room also adds to the “out of office” feel of your fit. It might even be worth trying a camp collar shirt in one size larger than normal just to see how it feels. The right collar:With no collar stand, the camp shirt’s collar falls oh-so-relaxedly, creating a neckline that comes to a very distinct V. No one buttons a camp collar to the top—and on many, you can’t. They tend to look most at ease with at least one button undone. Knowing that, scope out how comfortable you are with the neckline: too high could be awkward for you; too low might be awkward for everyone else. If it helps, imagine two lines across your chest, one at the collar bone and one midway down your pecs. Inside there is a happy medium. Breezy fabrics:The camp collar shirt is spiritually opposed to Slack messages, and as such, feels most honest when it’s made from cabana-ready fabrics: cotton, linen, cotton-linen blends, Tencel (that silky bamboo-born synthetic), and even silk itself. For our money, linen is a must for heat waves and beach days. On the other end, silk or shiny materials feel most right at night. It’s tough to pinpoint when the first camp shirt was created. We’re sure there was a heavenly choir present, but unfortunately can’t substantiate that. Most accept that today’s camp shirts are successors to the equally chill guayabera — a lightweight open-collar shirt traditionally worn in Latin America and the Caribbean. The guayabera tends to be longer, running past the hips, and often (though not always) has pockets above the bottom hem. In the 1950s, camp collar shirts gained popularity in the U.S. as postwar Americans shifted to the mowed lawns and backyard BBQs of the suburbs. TheMad Mencostume department probably had entire racks of camp shirts, and it’s fair to say the the show contributed to their comeback in the 2010s. The current era of camp shirts, though, saw a big revamp in 2016 or so, ushered in by Hedi Slimane’s sleazy cool Saint Laurent and camp shirt enthusiastHarry Styles. We’ll no doubt be riding the camp shirt wave for years to come. Though anyone who’s worn one probably has no intention of giving it up, ever.",

    "title": "Are Straight Guys Ready for Speedo Summer?",
    "article_text": "Summer is just a few weeks away, and the signs are creeping in—particularly when it comes to men’s clothing. You surely remember a photo ofHarry Styles in Berlinwearing a pair of very short red shorts spreading across the internet like wildfire in April, indicating thatinseams may be shrinkingfor yet another year in a row. (Last June, trendsetterPaul Mescal toldGQthat he’s “a big advocate for men wearing shorter shorts.”) This season, men’s bottoms are getting even smaller. Walton Goggins recentlyappeared on the cover ofCulturedmagazine, cementing his post-White Lotussex symbol status in an electric yellow Speedo—an editorial moment perfectly manufactured for virality. Last week, Dolce & Gabbana droppeda campaign for its classic Light Blue fragrancefeaturing Theo James in what can best be described as tighty-whitey swim briefs, sunning himself on the rocky beaches of Capri alongside supermodel Vittoria Ceretti. Sex in advertising is back! There must be something in the water: A quick browse of the new swimwear offerings from labels likeBode,Todd Snyder, andOur Legacy’s collaboration with Emporio Armanishow that the brief is the style of the moment. All signs point to Speedos having a breakout summer stateside; while they've been a staple of the gay community and on European, Australian, and Brazilian coastlines for decades, they’ve yet to hit the American mainstream. Could the final frontier following the short-shorts explosion be straight dudes wearing briefs on the beach without blinking an eye? Bode’s swimming briefs borrow their silhouette from a vintage midcentury pair. Thigh-exposing swimwear was front and center on Wales Bonner’s spring-summer 2025 runway. That depends on who you ask. Comedian Jay Jurden feels so strongly about men wearing Speedos that he filmedan episode of Kareem Rahma’s “Subway Takes”defending it. His crusade for the cause began when he invited a straight friend to Fire Island last summer, but under one condition: a Speedo was required. The friend complied, and he feltfree. “This is the kind of freedom we could all be experiencing,” Jurden tellsGQ. “It was both an exercise in equality, as well as: What kind of man you’re going to be? Are you gonna be a man who’s still tied down to all of these old-school ideas, or am I going to branch out into this fun, new modern man?” This idea of the “new modern man” has been gradually evolving for the better part of a decade, from influential male celebrities wearing womenswear (like skirts) on the red carpet to TikTok e-boys embracing long hair and dangly earrings. “Gay men, we have a history with Speedos; in a weird way, this feels like a natural continuation of straight men becoming more gender fluid in their presentation,” says my friend Alex Smith, who wore a Speedo as a college swimmer. “We’ve progressed past thepainted nailsand thepearls, and now we’re doing Hot Boy Summer with the Speedos.” Speedo invented the brief, and the brand name is often used to generically describe this particular style of swimwear. It made its debut during the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, worn by Australian swimmer Murray Rose who took home three gold medals. “When people started wearing it, there were threats of arrest for indecent exposure,” says Doug Conklyn, Speedo’s senior vice-president of global design. “In a way, it has this built-in sense of rebellion and ‘I don’t care what you think.’” The swim brief is still taboo in most of America, and therefore requires an above-average level of confidence—in both your masculinity and your physique. “There are very conflicting ideals, everyone wants to be this rizzed-up Jim Sigma, but you’re scared to show your thighs and your bulge,” Jurden says, pointing out that water polo players and professional wrestlers often wear Speedos for their sports. “How much material difference is there between 3-inch running shorts and a Speedo,” Jurden continues, “besides the fear that you’re going to be seen as ‘gay’? We give queer men permission to feel sexy, but we kinda strip that away from a lot of cis hetero men.” Speedos on offer from Emporio Armani’s latest Our Legacy collaboration… …and Todd Snyder’s mainline. Though the stigma surrounding the revealing swim style is starting to subside, it will likely take a while longer for the Speedo to truly take off in this country. Outside of LA, New York, and Miami, people are really not used to seeing these tiny cuts of fabric; in our conservative cultural climate that’s returned to regressive ideals of masculinity and femininity, camping out on the beach in a Speedo next to a group of bros blasting Kid Rock runs a huge risk of getting heckled—or worse. One common way to sidestep any potential Speedo-related harassment is through humor—think Benson Boone leaving a concertwearing a stars and stripes Speedo last year. Shep Rose fromSouthern Charm, who’s become known on the hit Bravo reality series for stepping out in a swim brief on occasion, admits that he used comedy as an entrée into the trend. His relationship with Speedos began in the first grade when he joined the rec center swim team in Hilton Head. “They made us wear them to swim faster, and I refused to do it! I was bashful, I guess, and I got special permission to wear swim trunks.” It took him a couple of decades to change his tune: He spent some time interning in Dubai, and met a half-American half-Emirati man who had an impressive collection of the style which, of course, he found to be hilarious. “He was a totally cool, fit guy—I decided I want [to get] in the Speedo game. It’s good laughs, it’s a little bit of confidence, it says you’re not shy.” Though Shep has built a collection and will step out in a swim brief more frequently than his fellow Charlestonians, he sees it as more of a party trick more than anything else. “It’s, like, Will Ferrell-inspired; be the butt of the joke, laugh along with it,” he says. While the style is freeing, men in the South are generally very covered up, and you have to be prepared to be the center of attention and potentially make a scene. “It might cause a riot if you wore a Speedo to a restaurant on Sullivan’s Island,” he continues. His castmate, Rodrigo Reyes, who is gay, adds: “Here in the South, if you’re wearing a Speedo, they’re going to accuse you of taking your sandwich with a pickle, if you know what I mean.” Interestingly, many women I spoke to were pro-Speedos for men, as the confidence andjoie de vivrerequired to wear a tiny swim brief are inherently attractive—but there are some conditions.“Fit is crucial but it’s also the energy: super secure in his masculinity and has zero issue if the bros rib him about ‘looking a little gay,’” my friend Rae Witte tells me. “Those are both very hot, and the Speedo is really just representative of that. Aesthetically, I’m preferring the tiny shorts to the brief variety of [swimsuit], but conceptually I’m into the mindset of someone that’s wearing it.” During the Paris Olympics, fans online went wild over French diver Jules Bouyer’s snug Speedo. Theo James’s swimsuit made a splash in the latest Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue fragrance campaign. There’s also a level of wealth, worldliness, and leisure associated with this style of swimwear. You might not have the traditional “body for a Speedo,” but if you have a yacht, caviar, and a bunch of models by your side, that’s another level of aspiration and definition of what it means to be sexy. (I’d be remiss not to mention that today, in the era ofGLP-1sandprotein obsession, the dream of losing that “last few pounds” in time for summer also feels more achievable than ever before, perhaps contributing to the style’s rise in popularity.) For those who want to give the swim brief a try for the first time, there are several brands, shapes, and cuts to experiment with to help you wade in. According to Conklyn, Speedo’s best-selling Solar Brief has a 2-inch outseam, accommodates a wide range of body types and are ideal for recreational use and to achieve minimal tan lines. The brand offers even smaller cuts, and next year will launch a slightly wider shape with a 3-inch outseam. “We’re going to continue to embrace this thing that at times can be polarizing,” he says. Jurden asserts that both freedom of clothing and expanding definitions of masculinity can only help all of us, and that it’s imperative that guys stop being ashamed of their bodies and tying their manhood to their bulge size. “The closer we get to straight men being comfortable in their skin, maybe they’ll go outside, maybe they’ll meet someone, maybe they’ll vote the right way,” he says. Could this even help cure the allegedmale loneliness epidemic? “It’s hard to be lonely in a Speedo,” he adds. Maybe the most compelling argument for the Speedo curious this summer? People want to see them. Nearly everyone I spoke to across the gender and sexuality spectrum is eager for men to embrace their sex appeal in public. Jurden’s “Subway Take” episode concluded with a repeated refrain: “Objectify more men, that’s what 2025 is all about!” Who’s to deny the masses of that? “Make America Horny Again,” Jurden says. “That’s the real MAHA.”",

    "title": "Donald Trump’s Cashing in on Crypto Is Denounced as an “Orgy of Corruption”",
    "article_text": "It looks like an extraordinary grift, even byDonald Trump’s standards. On Thursday, the president is set to host top investors in his meme coin for a private dinner at his DC golf club—an event his crypto venture hasbilledas the “most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the World.” The dinner—part political overture to the crypto industry, and part effort to profit off it—brings together more than 200 of the top $TRUMP owners, who collectivelyspent $394 millionon the digital asset from the Trump-affiliated companies CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight LLC. The top 25 holders are promised an “Exclusive Reception before Dinner with YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT!” Who, exactly, are these crypto enthusiasts who plunked down an average of more than a million dollars for a seat at Trump’s dinner? The full guest list isn’t entirely clear, but the attendees include investorJustin Sun, the Chinese-born crypto bro best known to the broader public as the guy who bought—and ate—the $6.2 million banana Italian conceptual artistMaorgorgurizio Cattelantaped to a wall. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Outside of his taste for experimental art, Sun—an adviser to Trump’s crypto venture—has previously faced legal scrutiny for his crypto and business activities, including a Securities and Exchange Committee investigation that wasdropped in February. TheWall Street JournalalsoreportedThursday that Sun had been afraid to enter the US in the past for fear of arrest. (Neither Sun nor the SEC commented to theWSJ.) What makes this more than another garish Trump cash grab: Trump isn’t merely selling dopey meme coins; he’s selling access and potential favor. “He thinks if he commits the offenses in public, you won't believe that it's wrong, because corruption normally happens in private,” SenatorChris Murphy, who denounced the dinner at apress conferencewith fellow Democrats Thursday, told me. “That's obviously not true.” “This is an orgy of corruption,” SenatorElizabeth Warrensaid at that press conference, calling on Congress to take action and for Trump to disclose the guest list for his crypto dinner. “The American people have no idea who is buying access to the president, and no idea what they are getting in return.” The White House, of course, has brushed off the criticisms: “President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public,” spokeswoman Anna Kelly said. “The meme coin has nothing to do with the White House,” another official told NPR. But it is impossible to separate Trump’s business interests from his presidency: In holding a contest to join him for dinner, the president goosed the value of the coin, which isestimatedto have made nearly a million dollars in transaction fees alone just in the first two days of the competition. That money isn’t pouring in because of his coin’s stability, or because of thebranded watchessome attendees Thursday will receive; it’s because investors—many of whom arebelieved to be internationally-based—see an opportunity to get something in return. “Anyone who thinks those 220 people who are attending the dinner tonight, who paid about $150 million for those seats, just really crave to have a digital equivalent of a baseball trading card? Well, you’re a little off the mark,” DemocratJeff Merkeleysaid at Thursday’s press conference. The shady crypto sector is already set to get a victory under the self-described “crypto president,” after the Senateadvanced an industry-friendly regulatory bill—with some Democratic support. But crypto—and anyone who uses it to buy proximity to the most powerful office in America—could reap even more benefits in the shadows, in what Democratic SenatorRichard Blumenthaldescribed as an “unprecedented pay-to-play scheme” in aletterannouncing a preliminary investigation into the venture earlier this month: The coin, he wrote, “allows, and even invites, anyone in the world, including foreign governments and unscrupulous individuals, to directly enrich the President, while hiding potential payoffs in the pseudonymity of the blockchain.” But what's to be done about it? Even as some Republicans express concern about the gathering, the idea that such glaring ethical conflicts would come with real ramifications for him inthisWashington era is depressingly remote.

    "title": "As Trump’s Tariffs Hit, Hamptonites Stockpile the Essentials (Rosé, Rosé, and Rosé)",
    "article_text": "Panic set in long before this weekend’s kickoff to rosé season inthe Hamptons. “We need to stock up on French and Italian rosé before the tariffs kick in,” said one Hamptonite on a group chat, likening wine from abroad to the most coveted item during the pandemic: “It’s the toilet paper of March 2025,” she said. Another called Italy direct. “I was worried Italian wine would become prohibitively expensive because of the tariffs,” she said. She called the winemaker at her favorite Italian winery, “before Liberation Day,” (April 2, the dayPresidentDonald Trumpannounced tariffs on imports, including wine) asking if an order would be subject to tariffs. “Then I had to tell them, ‘I hate Trump.’” Tariffs shouldn’t impact the sale price of existing wine inventory in the Hamptons, but new inventory imported from Europe is subject to a 10% tariff. On July 9, that could increase to 20% if President Trump lifts the current 90-day pause. That means the social set on the South Fork of Long Island might need to stock up now or risk paying more later if the cost of tariffs are passed on to the consumer. For the wine sellers and producers, the uncertainty in the marketplace is already being felt. “It’s a very nerve-racking time,” saysChristopher Miller,a wine consultant who helps run wine education, purchasing, and business development at Park Place Wines and Liquors in East Hampton, “one of the worst I’ve seen in the wine industry.” Worse even, he says, than 2008. Park Place’s two biggest-selling rosés are from France—Château des Demoiselles, and despite the name, Hampton Water (the blend produced byJon Bon Joviand his sonJesse Bongioviin collaboration with French winemakerGérard Bertrand). Since the price point for rosé is primarily in the $15–$30 range, Miller says a 10% tariff hit on the price of a bottle, an additional $2 or $3, or a 20% one, an additional $4 or $6, becomes obvious if the price is passed onto the consumer. Customers are already asking what’s going to happen with pricing, and a few are making purchases accordingly, he says. It’s not just the rosé supply Hamptonites should be worried about. The real problem is with Burgundy and Chablis. Makers of these pricier wines will avoid tariff hassle and just sell elsewhere, says Miller. “The production is too small, and the market is too big, so if we don’t buy in America it’s going to go to other markets easily.” Rosé is to summer in the Hamptons what hockey is to Canada in the winter. Drinking it is practically the town sport and a significant part of the ecosystem. Nobody is more at the core of that ecosystem than local wine producer Wölffer Estate Vineyard. “The lifestyle of the Hamptons is so perfect for rosé,” says Wölffer CEOMax Rohn.“The climate, the poolside parties, the daytime drinking.” Wölffer’s winery and roadside wine stand in Sagaponack are a Hamptons destination. The winery produces 110,000 cases of rosé a year, and the Hamptons is its biggest market. They mostly make New York state wine, but also produce French wine. Still, wine making, even American wine making, has tariff exposure. “We buy glass that’s made outside the United States and that will be going up,” Rohn says. “We just made a large barrel order, and those prices have gone up.” Rohn says the tariffs and the economic uncertainty they bring are bad for the wine business. “We make a handcrafted luxury product, and it takes a lot of planning and growing of the grapes. You have to make decisions months, if not years, in advance.” He says an already tricky business is being made even harder. “We just want this all to go away.” Jesse Matsuoka,co-owner of the high-end sushi restaurant Sen in Sag Harbor, does as well. His customers drink a lot of rosé in the summer. “It’s like a broken tap that just keeps pouring,” he says. “It’s impressive how much we go through. But it does end on Labor Day, so we have to make sure we don’t get too much.” The threat of higher tariffs makes it a balancing act for him to keep enough stock by buying in bulk now to avoid an even steeper increase in July. But that could leave him stuck with inventory in September if he calculates wrong. Not all restaurants can afford to do that, nor do they have space for storage. But if he waits he could end up short. Matsuoka says some vendors are considering waiting out the tariff wars altogether, which could impact supply, leaving restaurants like his high and dry. “We might not even have [rosé] by July. People would be up in arms.” To compensate for the fact that some vendors have already increased prices, Sen raised its by-the-glass price of the French-made Whispering Angel from $18 to $20 per glass, but sells a bottle for $64 (which comes out to $16 per glass). Liz Whittaker,a marketing consultant who focuses on wine, says that tariffs are compounding an already challenging climate for the wine industry. “Everyone who drinks rosé is on Ozempic! People are drinking substantially less.” She says that’s led to an inventory problem that isn’t tariff-related, and that some mail-order sellers are drastically reducing the price of big-name earlier vintage rosé, like 2022 Miraval and the once impossible-to-get Whispering Angel, to $14.98 and $17.94, respectively, capitalizing on the tariff fears, but selling wine that hasn’t been impacted. “When you see those calibers of wine, that drastic cut in price, what’s that tell you?

    "title": "Donald Trump Is Torching the First Amendment. Judges Are Putting Him in His Place",
    "article_text": "Rümeysa Öztürk, the Tufts student whom ICE disappeared from the streets of Somerville, Massachusetts, in March, spent 45 days as a political prisoner of the United States of America. The charges against her: coauthoring an opinion piece in her student newspaper. The opinion she expressed is at once beside the point yet integral to the Trump administration’s campaign of terror against campus advocates, international students, and scholars the nation over: She took a stance for Palestinian lives and an end to the war in Gaza. Not falling in line with the government’s view on the topic became the raison d’être for her imprisonment. “That literally is the case” against Öztürk, marveled US District JudgeWilliam K. Sessionsin Vermont on May 9. He almost couldn’t believe the government had nothing else on her. The 30-year-old PhD scholar, who’s in the home stretch of her doctoral program and has had to give up so much to face her accusers, wasn’t in the courtroom that day. She was more than 1,600 miles away, appearing virtually from a detention center in Louisiana. Her lawyers filed what is known as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus—precisely the legal mechanism, and historicGreat Writ, thatStephen Millerhasfloatedshould be suspended to allowDonald Trumpto imprison and deport more people, faster, and without judicial oversight. The same writ that migrants unlawfully disappeared to an El Salvador prison are hoping will bring them back. And whichKristi Noem,the Homeland Security secretary,doesn’t quite knowhow to define. The proceedings for Öztürk, which I attended virtually, didn’t feel like a court of law, or even like an adversarial process.Surrealdoesn’t quite capture it. On paper, this was a bail hearing—an opportunity for Öztürk and her legal team to make the case for her freedom. They did just that: They presented witnesses who testified to her character and academic pursuits, how she poses no threats to public safety, and about her medical condition. The government presented no witnesses; in court or otherwise, the administration has failedto make publica State Department memorandum that reportedly contradicts the official rationale for wishing to deport Öztürk—that she’s a Hamas supporter that poses a threat to US foreign policy. In an orange jumpsuit and a hijab like the one she had on when her abductionwent viral, Öztürk testified on her own behalf. She spoke softly but firmly about her deplorable conditions of confinement, and her history with asthma, which has gotten worse while imprisoned. She had both palms held to her heart, as if pleading, and later held them together, as if praying. You could see a light in her eyes as she spoke about her doctoral research—which she hasdescribedin court filings as studying “how young people use media in pro-social ways…such as helping their friends, supporting their peers during difficult times, exploring their creativity, bringing positive change, and expressing care for others and their communities.” This is whom the Trump administration has declared an enemy of the state. Watching Öztürk describe her life’s work—that is, everything she lost—is what broke me; I texted a fellow legal journalist who was also covering the hearing, as if needing to vent: “I’m losing it with this hearing,” I told him. Things took a turn toward the absurd when Öztürk suffered an asthma episodeduringthe hearing—maddeningly, just as a respiratory expert was testifying to how incarceration conditions can exacerbate a patient’s asthmatic condition. This was simply too much. The judge couldn’t bear it either. After all the witnesses testified, he ordered Öztürk’s immediate release. Her detention imposes a “continued infringement” of her constitutional rights, he said from the bench. Judge Sessions made another key finding—one that anyone who cares about the First Amendment should heed. “Her continued detention,” he said, “potentially chills the speech of the millions and millions of individuals in this country who are not citizens. Any one of them may now avoid exercising their First Amendment rights for fear of being whisked away to a detention center from their home.” I don’t normally break the fourth wall when writing about cases, but nothing is normal about this political persecution. Back in March, before Öztürk’s disappearance but after ICE forcibly arrested and transported Columbia graduateMahmoud Khalilto Louisiana, under eerily similar circumstances, I began to sense a pattern. So Iwrote about ithere inVanity Fair,which has a long history of covering power, the politics of power, and abuses of power. I won’t bore you with what came after, but the short version is that the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which has been raising alarm about many of these abuses, asked if I’d be interested inhosting a new show,The Bully’s Pulpit: Trump v. The First Amendment.They needed a legal journalist who is conversant about these issues. I said yes. The reason is self-evident: As I wrote two months ago, as goes Mahmoud Khalil or Rümeysa Öztürk, so go the rest of us. If the government can imprison them over their views—or for writing about issues in the national interest, as many journalists do—it can imprison anyone. It can imprisonme.In this political environment, hosting a podcast about the First Amendment can become its own form of self-preservation. To uphold the very speech and press freedoms the amendment protects. All of these freedoms are under siege right now. And the harms are ongoing. As of this writing, Khalil is still imprisoned, and over loud boos, acting Columbia presidentClaire Shipmanmentionedhis absence at graduation on Wednesday. Khalil’s lawyers continue to fight for his freedom in a courtroom in New Jersey—bringingto the judge’s attentionhow much the legal landscape has shifted since his high-profile arrest in March. And shifted it has: Dr.Badar Khan Suri,a Georgetown scholar and Indian national similarly arrested outside his home in March over his views on the war in Gaza—where his US citizen wife is from—was just released last week from an ICE detention center in Texas. Ruling from the bench, the judge who ordered his releaseechoedthe judge in Özturk’s case: “The First Amendment extends to noncitizens, as it makes no distinction between citizens and noncitizens.” Little by little, other judges are reaching the same conclusion, and they’re building a public record—andcase law—that’s becoming harder to contest.Mohsen Mahdawi,the prominent Palestinian student advocate that ICE arrested at his naturalization interview in Vermont in April, has made “substantial First Amendment claims” that he was imprisoned over his campus advocacy, a federal appeals courtruledearlier this month. The judge whoorderedMahdawi’s release went further—comparing the “extraordinary setting” of his imprisonment to the first and second Red Scares, during whichleftist dissenters, many of them noncitizens, were put on blacklists, rounded up, and deported on the basis of their political views. Even if Mahdawi “were a firebrand,” and not the peaceful activist his supporters embrace, his views would still be protected by the First Amendment, JudgeGeoffrey Crawfordconcluded. “This is not the first time that the nation has seen chilling action by the government intended to shut down debate,” he added. (Thanks to the judge, Mahdawi was able to travel to New York and graduate from Columbia this week.) In the case ofMohammed Hoque,a Bangladeshi student whom ICE arrestedover his social media posts,the administration offered shifting explanations for its actions against him. “Petitioner’s arrest aligns with the publicly stated executive policy of targeting social media users who express support for Palestinian human rights and criticize violence in Gaza, as Petitioner had done,”wrotethe judge who ordered the student’s release. “Without rebuttal evidence, the record supports a finding that Petitioner’s speech…brought him to the Government’s attention for enforcement.” As significant as these wins are for free expression, these cases are far from over. To date, the government remains committed to deporting people who express views the administration disfavors—what Khalil’s lawyerscall“a broader policy of weaponizing immigration law to suppress protected pro-Palestine speech.” That policy, whichThe New York Timesreportedcould be linked to the Heritage Foundation, is still in place. In other words, these students may be winning back their freedom, but the Trump administration continues to latch ona little-used law, dating back to the McCarthy era, that allows for the deportation of anyone who the Secretary of State determines poses “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” Secretary of StateMarco Rubio,who ispersonally signing offon many of these cases, with no apparent regard to whether people are on student visas or legal permanent residents, has shown no signs of letting up. “At some point I hope we run out because we’ve gotten rid of all of them,” Rubiosaiddays after Öztürk’s arrest. “But we’re looking every day for these lunatics that are tearing things up.” What the Trump administration is doing to student advocates, as unconstitutional as it is, is far from the only attack on free expression we’ve seen in the past four months. If nothing else, the attacks have only gotten worse. The Associated Press, which for decades has been a member of the independent White House press pool, remains restricted from the Oval Office and other presidential spaces—in retaliationfor its refusal to fall in line with Trump’s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. Last month, a federal judge in Washington, DC,recognizedthis was viewpoint discrimination that has had a direct impact on its journalism and “poisoned the AP’s business model.” But rather than restoring access to the wire service, as the judge ordered, the White Houseeliminated the regular slotpreviously reserved for the three permanent wire services, Reuters and Bloomberg News included. Last week, Trumpexcluded them from Air Force Oneduring his trip to the Middle East—the first time that has happenedin modern history. (The federal appeals court in Washington, inexplicably, has yet to rule on an emergency request from the Trump administration to keep the AP on a tight leash. The end result may yetdependon the two Trump appointees who heard that request a month ago.) Meanwhile, funding cuts and threats directed at institutions that create and disseminate news, knowledge, culture, and research are legion. The administration’s escalating legal confrontation with Harvard, which has mounted a sweeping First Amendment challenge to anever-expanding list of funding cutsand other retaliatory demands, remains a case to watch. Since the university announced it won’t take the government’s “draconian” demands lying down, analphabet soupof federal agencies have ratcheted up the pressure. Among them is the Justice Department, which last weekaccusedthe Ivy League of—and demanded reams of documents over—supposedly defrauding the government over its admissions policies. “Under whatever name, the Government has ceased the flow of funds to Harvard as part of its pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the Government’s control over its academic programs,” lawyers for the university wrote in anamended lawsuitfiled last week. “That, in itself, violates Harvard’s constitutional rights.” On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Securityannounceda breathtaking escalation of its war against Harvard: revoking its ability to enroll international students. Public media has taken a hit too. Top of the list are NPR and PBS, both of which Trump targeted earlier this month with an executive order that purported to direct the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to “cease federal funding” for their operations. The corporation already took the president to court over his attempt to fire members of its board, and the board recentlyamended its bylawsto explicitly prevent “the president of the United States” from interfering with its operations. NPR, for its part, hasdenouncedthe executive order as “an affront to the First Amendment rights” of the station and its affiliates scattered across the nation. And that’s on top of questionable stepsBrendan Carr,chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, which by law must act “in the public interest,” has taken toinvestigatethe public broadcasters and media organizations the presidenthas seen fit to punish. Controlling the message by silencing the messengers—or worse—is a hallmark of authoritarianism. Few journalists know this as well as those who work for the US Agency for Global Media, Voice of America, and related networks chartered or supported by Congress to promote free speech values around the world. Besmirched as “anti-Trump” by the president himself, andsingled out by Project 2025andothersin Trumpworld, all of these entities are enmeshed in a high-pitched legal battle in Washington, where a judge last monthpreventedthe Trump administration from dismantling their operations—only to face asetbackbefore the same panel of Trump-appointed judges considering the AP’s case. In an anguisheddissent, JudgeNina Pillard,an Obama appointee, noted that Voice of America journalists, many of whom face threats in their home countries if forced to return there, “have been unable to exercise their First Amendment rights to free speech and free press.” She added that the “loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” The bleeding therecontinues. And thanks to news personality turned MAGA soldierKari Lake,the remaining shell may yet turn into aright-wing, pro-Trump mouthpiece. That’s the end game in this new dawn for the First Amendment: bend people and institutions to get with the program, toe the line, be pro-Trump, and espouse the views only he and his circle deem acceptable. This is the very kind of government-coerced speech, or “preferred narrative,” that Trump claimed he wanted to get rid of on his first day in office. In this new reality, pro-Palestininan speech must becrushed. Law firms representing clients or causes the president doesn’t like must be run out of Washington. Anyone who values diversity, equity, and inclusion, who believes that Black and trans lives matter, or who cares about climate change must lose research funding, government contracts, or evenaccessto critical information belonging to all of us. Even history must berewrittento fit the president’s worldview. You either get with the Trump program or get out—and be deported, defunded, deplatformed, dismantled, or diminished in other ways. Every one of these actions run headlong into the First Amendment; judges and lawsuits alone won’t stop them. All of civic society must take courage, embrace a politics of solidarity, and resist them. Recounting a conversation she had with a young Turkish journalist,Margaret Sullivannotedthis week how this reporter once viewed the United States “as a beacon of press freedom”—and hoped that Turkey would one day be more like us. But the reporter, Sullivan wrote, had a change of heart: “I had hoped that we would someday become like a little United States. But now it seems like America is becoming a big version of Turkey.” Turkey, as it happens, is where Rümeysa Öztürk is from. Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Veteran Sportswriter Pablo Torre Says the Bill Belichick–Jordon Hudson Saga Is More Shakespeare Than TMZ",
    "article_text": "It’s nearly been a year sinceBill BelichickandJordon Hudsonwent public with their relationship, but it feels like we’re only just getting to know them. The last month alone has brought a blitz of revelations. We learned that Hudson, nearly a half-century younger than the former New England Patriots coach, may have in fact been 19 when the two met in 2021––which may have also been why Hudson shut down a question posed to Belichick about their origin story inthatinterview. We learned that, while operating in her capacity as manager of Belichick’s personal brand, she has actively promoted her own, making her presence felt on both the practice field and at television commercial shoots. And we learned that her omnipresence and influence in Belichick’s life have become a source of tremendous anxiety for his friends, family, and new employers at the University of North Carolina, where he is entering his first season as head football coach. We learned all of this thanks toPablo Torre,who has emerged as the definitive chronicler of theBelichick-Hudsonsaga, which has played out everywhere fromTMZto theNew York Times.Not that Torre sought the title. “My goal in life is not to be whatRobert Carowas to Lyndon B. Johnson, but for Jordon Hudson and Bill Belichick,” he joked in an interview this week. But sometimes, the story finds the reporter. In Torre’s case, Belichick’s awkward interview last month onCBS News Sunday Morningserved as something of a bat-signal. By then, Torre had already reported on the relationship; in a Februaryepisodeof his podcast,Pablo Torre Finds Out,he revealed that Hudson used her power to secure a cameo in a Super Bowl ad for Dunkin’ Donuts, appearing alongside Belichick andBen Affleck. The CBS interview was set up as a promotional stop for Belichick’s new book; instead, it shifted the nation’s gaze to his mysterious relationship with Hudson. And for Torre, it gave sources close to the couple “permission to even more explicitly share their stories.” Twelve days after the CBS interview aired, Torre presented his reporting on Belichick and Hudson in anepisodeofPablo Torre Finds Outthat left the public stunned—and his fellow journalists riveted and a bit envious. “Wildly entertaining,”wroteThe Atlantic’sDerek Thompsonon X, as well as “sort of deeply jealousy-inducing.” The podcast, which won an Edward R. Murrow Award last year, debuted in 2023 after Torre left his full-time position at ESPN. He remains a frequent guest-host onPardon the Interruption,ESPN’s longtime talk show hosted byTony KornheiserandMichael Wilbon,and has more recently become a regular on MSNBC’sMorning Joe.But Torre, 39, is still a magazine scribe at heart, having cut his teeth as a fact-checker and staff writer atSports Illustrated. “As much as I am a podcaster through and through, the question is always: How can I still flex the muscles that I had as a print journalist?” he says. I caught up with Torre over the phone on Monday—just as he was leaving the set ofMorning Joe—to talk about the approach he takes to his podcast, his reporting on Belichick and Hudson, and what to call a controversy that’s more cringe than scandalous. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. In February, you revealed that Jordon Hudson has essentially been operating as Bill Belichick’s agent, and that she used that power to insert herself in the Dunkin’ Donuts Super Bowl ad. Is that where your reporting began? It began with that. It began with the most visible example of someone climbing the ladder from total obscurity to literally the largest available audience in American media. And the question was: Why is she in the ad? Who asked for this? She was just a side character at that point. Then you start hearing stories. As much as I am a podcaster through and through, the question is always: How can I still flex the muscles that I had as a print journalist? And so that’s how it first started. You cited 11 sources in your reporting on this story, and I’ve gotten the impression that you spoke to people who were eager to get some things off their chest. Was that the case? It was this behind-the-scenes secret that people were dying to discuss because Jordon Hudson left this trail of behind-the-scenes wreckage. So the 11 people I talked to were all people who dealt with her and Bill Belichick directly, personally in this summer where Bill Belichick decided to pivot from the archetype of one thing—the most disciplined, distraction-less, private, anti-media, anti-publicity coach in the history of sports––to this guy who waslaunching a half-dozen different media venturesat the same time. And to do that, it turns out, involved a new character in his story that people were meeting behind the scenes before America got a sense of how she operated. Once that flag went up that I was onto something with this Super Bowl ad, I began to hear from people, and then I just began to commit, as a journalist does, to just make the calls. And it was stunning how deep the rabbit hole continues to go. The infamous CBS interview aired on April 27. By then, you were pretty steeped in Belichick-Hudson lore. Were you at all surprised by what you saw in that segment? I was not surprised, but I was in awe, if there can be a nuancing of the reaction. I was not surprised because I'd been hearing stories like this. I was in awe that the things I had been hearing were so manifest in this on-the-nose, almost scripted HBO comedy sort of a way with this feature fromCBS Sunday Morning,which wanted to do a puff piece and ended up being unable to avoid the actual lead story, which is how Bill Belichick’s life is being run. And yeah, so that CBS thing, crucially, was also a turning point behind the scenes for people. It gave them permission to even more explicitly share their stories because now it was clear that they were not alone, that they were not going to be out on a limb by themselves. And most importantly, it was an inflection point at the University of North Carolina because there it became such a nightmare. The blood in the water for every tabloid outlet, every news publication, everybody descending, made them realize that this was going to be unsustainable. And that's when the reporting at North Carolina for me really got unlocked. It was them having to confront this PR crisis head-on. Since your episode on the relationship ran earlier this month, you said there’s a “real chance” that Belichick doesn’t coach a single game for North Carolina. You noted the key date is June 1, which is when the buyout in his contract drops from $10 million to $1 million. Point blank: Do you think he will be on the sidelines for the team’s season opener on September 1? As a matter of probability, I say that it is more likely than not that he will be there on the sideline. If you set the length of his tenure at two seasons, I would take the under. I believe that all of this, though, is incredibly fragile. The reason I say that it’s more likely than not that he’ll be on the sideline is because, since the reporting in my episode, it’s very clear that North Carolina has been trying to message exactly what I was being told behind the scenes, which is that Jordon Hudson cannot be around the operations of the football program anymore. And so we’ve seen Belichick––for the first time, and after my episode came out––say that out loud to ESPN. He said it toMichael StrahanonGood Morning Americaas he resumed the publicity tour for this book. He said that she isn’t involved on the football side. And that was the thing behind the scenes that had gotten everybody panicked: that she was not merely running the media stuff. She was the first lady of football in a way that gave her entree onto the field. She was cc’d on every single email that Belichick got. She was providing guidance behind the scenes on how to craft the school’s PR strategy around the hire of his son,Steve.And then further down the list of items, it’s just that she was around all of the time. She was on the field and doing a thing that, by the way, no spouse or partner of a football coach is really ever seen doing. The University of North Carolina’s football team only won six games last season, and the program has mostly known mediocrity. It was easy to imagine a world in which Belichick was playing with house money this season. He probably just needed to show some signs of improvement and generate some buzz. Now I wonder if he’s going to take heat if they struggle because people will immediately point their fingers at this relationship. Has he burdened himself with more pressure? There’s no question. I mean, all of this is self-imposed. All of this is self-destructive. So, just to rewind for a second to the June 1 date. The reason that was always interesting was because the buyout on his contract dropped from $10 million to $1 million when June 1 came around. And this was already unusual because the implicit option there that Belichick got in the negotiation of this contract was that if he wanted to get out of there, it becomes a lot cheaper for him to buy his way out of there. The implication was becausethe NFL might have interest,and he always wanted the NFL way more than college football. So, he entered with this escape hatch that indicated he wasn't fully committed, right? This is before even the Jordon Hudson thing. And so now, when it comes to how he's running the show, what the self-destruction entails in this regard is a question: What would New England Patriots head coach and general manager Bill Belichick say if working on his staff was North Carolina Bill Belichick? No one has lived their lives more diametrically contrary to how North Carolina Bill Belichick has operated to date than New England Bill Belichick. And that tension is not merely a PR and pressure problem for Carolina Bill Belichick. It’s also something that has everybody in his life––including his own family, let alone the inner circle that he brought to North Carolina––wondering how this story’s going to end. It’s remarkable how relentless all of it has been. My goal in life is not to be the preeminent Jordon Hudson reporter. My goal in life is not to be what Robert Caro was to Lyndon B. Johnson, but for Jordon Hudson and Bill Belichick. It’s the strange hand that I’ve unwittingly started to embrace because I find the story so fascinating. It all seems so wildly out of character for Bill Belichick. I mean, just imagine telling yourself 10 years ago that he would be involved in the most talked-about relationship in America. Do you think the shock value is a big source of the public’s fascination here? Yes, because he was a character––and not merely a character, but one of the most sharply defined and consistent characters. And so the idea that the guy who all of us met and heard as he refused to talk to the press has wound up in this briar patch of his own devising is beyond cinematic. It’s Shakespearean. It is tragicomic. And the other aspect of this, which is where my curiosity continues, is that this is fundamentally a story about power. It's a story about power––who has access to it, who wields it, how it is given up and lost. Belichick is by far the highest-paid public employee in the state of North Carolina, working for one of the most respected public universities at a time when public education, at all levels, is under duress. When they hired him, the state of North Carolina thought they were getting New England Bill Belichick. And instead, they get this version of him. I talked to a former player of Belichick’s on the Patriots and he said, ‘Look, an old coach wanting young ass is not new.’ And speaking for myself, I’m not here to yuck Bill Belichick’s yums. That’s not what this story is about. I’m not implying illicit illegal behavior when it comes to age-gap dynamics. That’s not what the story is. But what this player told me is that the thing that is most shocking––despite many familiar contours of this caricature of a 70-something man who is trying to revitalize himself in public––the thing that is most jarring to him and his teammates is the “in public” part. It’s that his private life has become so deeply public, and that was the number one thing Bill Belichick never abided. And that agreement to open the floodgates has been incomprehensible to the people who played for him. It’s shocking and fascinating, but you wouldn’t call it scandalous, right? It feels more cringe than scandalous. There should be a term for what you’re describing––a German word, maybe––for something resembling a palpable discomfort. Is it because we imagine ourselves as a family member of his? Is it because we imagine ourselves as a player who is signing up for a program in which this circus is happening at the very top in this way? Is it simply the idea that when you watch thatCBS Sunday Morningvideo and you see someone trying to flex power without the understanding that they are actually looking weak because they don’t realize they’re on camera and on mic, and all of this is going to be used in a way that is the literal opposite of how they intended it? Is it just that? But you’re right. Scandal implies something in which there is some humiliating criminality to the story. This feels like two people, Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson, holding hands and driving the convertible off a cliff. And you’re just watching it happen like, This is a very strange strategy for literally the man who was hailed as the greatest strategist in the history of football. In your reporting, you quoted a family source who said there’s “deep worry” over how Hudson could be detrimental to his legacy and reputation. After the CBS interview aired, Charles Barkley, a friend of Belichick, came out and expressed concern. What specifically are these people worried about? What’s the worst-case scenario that they’re fearing here? They’re worried that he doesn’t understand the extent of what’s happening here. Bill Belichick has been, through his entire life as an adult, basically been ensconced in professional football as the GM and coach of the New England Patriots. He was insulated from the way that public life works for everybody else. There’s a quote fromRobert Kraft,the owner of the Patriots, where hesaysBill is an idiot savant, meaning that he’s a genius in football but a fool outside of it. And I think what his family is worried about is, to what extent does he realize he’s being used by somebody who is internet fluent, traffics in publicity, has goals that have been so opposite from his previous ones. And if he is acting like this and his eyes are open, is this the man we knew? It is just that degree of jarring. And look, Bill Belichick very clearly is an adult. He is making choices. He’s consenting to these things. The legitimate, reliable sources that I’ve spoken to ––all 11 of them—are not suggesting that Jordon Hudson is a call girl or an OnlyFans model or some person who is blackmailing her way to power. They’re not suggesting that. But they are worried that this is not merely a horrible look, but it is a disturbing look for the patriarch of their family, who also, by the way, remains someone they are afraid to communicate this bluntly and directly with. Again, I just can’t stop thinking about Logan Roy andSuccession.There are people who operate so intimately in and around his life, and yet feel very remote from him. And I think that speaks to just his personality and his style of fatherhood. TheSuccessionparallels really are spot on. This all feels like the Logan and Kerry arc. Dude, it’s a bit on the nose. It’s not that I’ve seen this specific television show before, but I’ve seen television shows that, when you combine all of them together, provide a familiar arc. And I think what the people who love Bill Belichick and rely on him are worried about is they know how this story’s going to end, and it’s not going to be a happy ending. Your podcast is all about venturing down these rabbit holes, whether it’s the Belichick romance or aninvestigationinto the video the New York Knicks made to recruit LeBron James. How do you decide which topics to probe? We’re a show that likes to take stupid things seriously and serious things stupidly sometimes. And that’s all in the service of trying to figure out if there’s a way to tell a story that is three things. Is it smart? Is it funny? Is it surprising? And that’s kind of the North Star that I have. If I were to tell this story to a friend and they didn’t give a fuck about sports or any of the characters in terms of their proper names, these familiar brands, would they be hooked by this? And that’s really the standard. It’s my background in magazines. It’s my background in, hopefully, having a decent compass for what’s interesting. And all of that is a longer way of saying it’s formed around my personal curiosity. If I find something interesting and I’m willing to devote my life to tumbling down the rabbit hole on it, if I can get my teeth into something and feel like I don’t want to let go for 45 minutes, then my hope is that other people will sense that degree of energy and enthusiasm and authentic curiosity and want to come along for the ride.

    "title": "And Just Like That Premiere: Red Carpet Looks From Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and More",
    "article_text": "“I've been waiting for an opportunity to wear this dress,”Sarah Jessica Parkerwrote on Instagram Wednesday, showing off her Vivienne Westwood navy gown with a spin. Well, that occasion finally arrived. The actor donned the ensemble for the season three premiere ofAnd Just Like That…at the Crane Club in New York City. (The third installment of theSex and the Cityspinoff will be available to stream on Max on May 29). This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. With a square neckline and long sleeves with pronounced shoulders, the voluminous, almost Victorian-inspired dress stole the show. To break up and brighten its chromatic rigor: a handbag with Carrie-esque sparkling bangles the actress made a point to shimmy in her video ahead of the carpet. Sarah Jessica Parker Alongside Parker on the carpet,Cyntha Nixon, certainly did not go unnoticed in her sumptuous mint green gown by Richard Quinn. It's hard to say what was more eye-catching: the extra-large bow knotted softly at the neck or the extra-long cape trimmed withton sur tonfeathers. Either way, the effect was dramatic. To top it all off? Like SJP, she opted for silver adornments by way of a sparkling clutch. Cynthia Nixon Kristin Davis, left the voluminous effects to her castmates, preferring instead to opt for a sheath dress featuring curvy, wrap-around lines and thin straps from Rachel Gilbert in an elegant ice tone. To liven it up, a cascade of sequins and floral appliqués with a pair of metallic strappy sandals to complete the look. Kristin Davis The connecting thread among everyone's styling choices was definitely sparkle. Joining in with the wasNicole Ari Parker, wrapped in a shimmering gold asymmetrical mini-dress by Stella McCartney. A gold trail complemented by a pair of sandals and a stiff, ivory clutch bag for a more muted touch of color. Nicole Ari Parker Sarita Choudhury, on the other hand, went all out for dark tones with a dress, structured to give the effect of a two-piece, with a slit and midnight blue top knotted at the neck. A more darker but no less dramatic entry to the evening's lineup. Sarita Choudhury Could this be a taste of what couture we should expect to see on in the new season? We'll just have to wait and find out. Originally published in Vanity Fair Italy Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Mike Birbiglia on Why He Veers Away From Politics in His Comedy, and His New Netflix Special",
    "article_text": "InThe Good Life,his new Netflix special,Mike Birbigliaregales the audience at New York’s Beacon Theatre with tales of fatherhood and beyond, embodying the warm and witty dad next door. To me, he just about was: My old building is visible from the front stoop of his Brooklyn office and studio, where I plop into a chair—recently warmed by the likes ofJessica KirsonandQuestloveduring their appearances onWorking It Out,Birbiglia’s pandemic-born podcast on which creatives dive into their process—to discuss the special, premiering May 26. “A lot of times I’ll work out these jokes on the podcast with people. I had [stand-up comedian]Josh Johnsonon the podcast recently, and we were riffing on this premise I had. My wife was like, ‘Let’s go in the basement and fix the piping for the water in the building.’ I put my shoes on and my coat, and I go, ‘Let’s go,’ and she goes, ‘I’m afraid of the basement,’ and I go, ‘I think you knew when you said “let’s go,” you meant me.’ Honestly, it’s jotting down observations like that that are really simple,” he toldVanity Fair. “Then, a lot of times, two things will happen simultaneously: As the series of jokes and stories sculpts into a narrative form that has causality and propulsion to it, do some of these jokes fall away? Which ones fall away, and which ones stay? And then, which ones, honestly, become boring, and which ones are still funny?” Over the years, the career comedian, writer, director, and actor has veered organically toward storytelling from stand-up, nimbly toggling between media. Hovering above on the wall is the giant bulletin board prominently displayed on the pod, festooned with pinned jokes, cues, and material for his next project—a film he’s writing—hard evidence that Birbiglia’s brain is perpetually scanning for the humanistic observations that comprise his work. To Birbiglia, collaboration and connection matter: Immediately after live-tapingThe Good Life,he walked offstage and onto Broadway to hand out cupcakes to the crowd. After all, relationships with neighbors, friends, and family are the nexus of his creative output, as coated with his trademark dry wit. In advance ofThe Good Life’s release,Vanity Fairspoke with Birbiglia about his creative process, who critiques his jokes, and what he calls “comedy college.” This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Vanity Fair:There’s the board fromWorking It Out! Is this to work out the flow of your jokes or projects? Are they placed in a particular order? Mike Birbiglia:They eventually are, although right now they’re not. I’m writing a movie in the vein ofDon’t Think Twice,a movie I made in 2016 about modern friendship. I’m excited about it and am hoping to film it next year. My head is fully in it now thatThe Good Lifeis wrapped. Now is the moment where I have to convince people that it’s worth 75 minutes in the attention economy. The Good Lifethreads the needle between how you were parented versus how you parent. How did it force you to reckon with your own parenting? And how is your dad [whose health is discussed in the special], by the way? I came back from visiting him yesterday. Writing this show forced me to try to understand my dad because, if you don’t see the humanity in the characters, it’s not interesting. It’s extraordinarily challenging when someone’s had an acute stroke, but it has calmed him down. In my early specials, my dad would shout, and he wouldn’t even understand why. He’d be like, “Goddamn it! I’m eating pretzels!” I’d be like, Is he angry? Is he hungry? What’s the emotion being expressed? In this special, I forced myself to unpack the emotion being expressed. He oddly doesn’t have the edge or the weight of the world on him. He’s sort of a protagonist—he’s not evil; he’s just a human being. I think that’s my personal journey with him as well. When putting together a show, would you say you’re an outliner or a channeller? For the movie I’m writing right now, both. The analysis of the script in outline form forces you to make sure that it’s not meandering so far that the audience loses the thread of the story. The audience can handle a tangent, but they really can’t handle a tangent on a tangent. My mind goes on a tangent, on a tangent, on a tangent. There’s a quote from [poet and critic] Ezra Pound, which I always quote because it’s three words: “Only emotion endures.” I always think about that in relation to the shows. It’s the thing you remember. How do you consider what you want to share about your life versus what you want to keep to yourself? The only thing I veer away from currently is politics.Jon Stewartalways said everything he did onThe Daily Showwas disposable. It doesn’t live on. There might be a certain point in my life where I’m going to go all in on politics or culture, but if I’m going to do it, I’m going to go all in. Your podcast,Working It Out,is about creating and critique. How has hosting it inspired your own creative process? What I’m trying to mimic in the podcast is stand-up comedy culture at its best—people cross-pollinating ideas. It’s just friendly. Originally, I thought, You can’t give away jokes on a podcast because it’ll ruin the surprise. During the pandemic, we had no choice. I thought, Why not perform jokes with comedians to each other, then see what happens? After the pandemic, people wanted to see how the jokes turned out. I’m only processing this now, but it’s a little bitPenn & Teller,in that they would do tricks and then explain how the tricks worked. Who do you trust to critique your jokes? Hasan Minhajis one of our favorite guests.Pete Holmesis one of our favorite guests. Everyone I work with—Mabel Lewis[his assistant and podcast booker],Gary Simons[comedian, associate producer of the pod, and a fellow Georgetown alum who opened for Birbiglia], my brother,Joe,andPeter Salomone—are all people I trust. My director,Seth [Barrish], my wife,Jenny,andIra Glassare all people I trust. With your 2012 film,Sleepwalk With Me,you toggled between media with a singular concept, the execution of each similar yet different. What did you learn when that moment happened in your career? That was the most seminal shift that occurred in my entire career. I went from someone who had comedy specials on Comedy Central to presenting something with a dramatic arc that was staged in a certain way. It allowed me to direct a movie, which is what I’d always wanted to do since I was in college. The catch-22 of becoming a movie director is that no one wants to let you try it the first time, just like no one wants to hire a waiter for their first job. It’s a bold thing to lie your way into a million-dollar budget of someone’s money. You kind of have to be like, “I got it!” You don’t have it. You won “Funniest Person on Campus” at Georgetown. I opened forDave Chappelleat the DC Improv: He was 24; I was 19, I think. After that, I asked if I could open for other people, and they said you can work the door and be a busboy. That was comedy college—I did that for four years—watching nationally touring headlining comedians. In the office, on the weekends, I could see how much people were paid. When I moved to New York, that was the financial model I had in my mind. If I could be an opening act, making $350 a week, or what’s called a middle act or a feature act, making $500, $600, or $700 a week, I thought I could completely live on that. How do you think being from Massachusetts informed your sense of humor? So many comedians come from there. There’s just a lot of extremes. Some have said it’s the seasons; the winters are harsh, and the summers are harsh. The blue collar’s really blue collar, and the white collar’s really white collar. People have a combination of being erudite and rough around the edges, and that is helpful in comedy. You wrote an essay called “6 Tips for Making It Small in Hollywood. Or Anywhere” forThe New York Timesback in 2016. What’s your TikTok-era addendum? You can make it smaller and, accidentally, it could be bigger. I used to say people make movies for $10,000 that get seen by millions of people. Now I say people are making videos that are made for $100 that are being seen by 100 million people. The media era has exponentialized the possibilities, so there’s no excuses. There’s also a lot of garbage and clutter to cut through. Keeping work off of social media until it’s better is smart. In that essay, you wrote: “It will takeyearsfor your taste and the quality of your work to intersect.” Do you feel like you’ve gotten there? This special is closest. People will see it and they’ll go, “That is how you talk.” That’s a big compliment, because it’s hard to get to a point where it has jokes, it has a narrative, it has a story, it’s personal, and it’s connecting with people. Another time I got close wasDon’t Think Twice—that’s part of the reason why I’m writing this next movie right now. I’m trying to zero in on what I could do better in that space. When I look at whatNoah BaumbachandGreta Gerwigdo, that’s the gold standard—just these interpersonal-relationship stories that are so funny. Jenny and I quote lines fromTheSquid and the Whaleall the time. At the same time, it’s heartbreaking. If your daughter, Oona, was to write a show about you one day, what would you want her to say about your parenting? Whatever she wants. When I was in college and was working at the DC Improv, my dad was furious. He was like, “Comedy club? You’re working at a comedy club? What do they do? Strip?” He didn’t understand they’d evolved past burlesque. So I just want her to do what she’s interested in doing, and if that’s satirizing me, that’s fine too. I couldn’t care less.

    "article_text": "“Sobriety is like my God, it changed my whole life,”Miley Cyrusshared, in anew interview withZane LoweforThe Zane Lowe Showon Apple Music 1, ahead of the release of hernext album,Something Beautiful, out May 30. The singer, who has undergone a number of eras over the years, spoke about her personal rebirth after an uneasy period and the inspirations behind the upcoming thirteen-track release. Today'sCyrus is a more radiant and confident version of herself—the fruit of personal growth which also led to “Flowers,” the song that was an “I Will Survive” for her andearned her the 2024 Grammy win. A moment she recalled as crucial to her career at the time. “I think somewhere inside I needed to hold a trophy and feel for a moment that I had something that felt like a real accomplishment,” Cyrus explained. \"I needed something to hold on to that would make me feel really successful, even though I wasn't even sure I wanted to go there to collect the award.\" The reason being a battle with anxiety that has affected her since the pandemic. “After the lockdown years I started doingshows at the Chateau Marmont, intimate and all personally chosen by me, and I celebrated with the people closest to me for the Grammy nomination. I never wrote a song thinking I wanted to win a Grammy, but getting it for “Flowers” was like, in a way, putting a band-aid on a broken heart.\" Just as attending an award show like the Grammys felt high stakes, the idea of extensive touring did not excite her either given the inherent toll. \"It's very important for me to keep myself mentally, physically, spiritually and emotionally fit, and I want to emphasize the physical side, given how demanding a live performance is.\" She went on to share her Reinke's edema diagnosis, a chronic inflammation of the vocal cords, which presents as a very large polyp that makes it “extremely difficult” for her to perform—comparing it to running a marathon with weights on her ankles. A problem she has always lived with but that \"always being awake, drinking, smoking, and partying after every show\" as she has done for years, has made worse. On sobriety, she added, \"I've learned it about myself over the years. Sobriety is like my God. I need it, I live for it. It has changed my whole life.\" Speaking about the inspirations guidingSomething BeautifulCyrus, unsurprisingly, points tosinger and godmotherDolly Parton. But there is alsoHarrison Ford's hand in her rebirth, as the Hollywood star, whom Cyrus knows from her Disney days,inspired the aesthetic of the accompanying musical filmtied to the album, set to be released June 27. And finally, for the the fans, Cyrus affirms the new work will be a journey. \"I want people to dance through all my timelines and all my lives. I hope the movie will be seen and the album will be heard with more than just the five senses. I want this to be the beginning of a dream.\" Originally published in Vanity Fair Italy Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "What on Earth Was Kevin Spacey Doing in Cannes?",
    "article_text": "Many top stars—everyone fromScarlett JohanssontoTom CruisetoRobert De Niro—have descended upon Cannes, where the world’s most important international film festival isstill unfolding. But onlookers may be surprised to learn that recently, there was a more unexpected performer in town, someone who was a Cannes regularbefore falling from graceeight years ago due to multiple accusations of sexual misconduct:Kevin Spacey.(Spacey has denied the allegations.) Spacey has not been to Cannes since 2016. But this week he was back—though the actor was not actually invited to the Cannes Film Festival, and he certainly does not have a film there either in competition or out of competition. In fact, the festival itself was quick to issue a statement meant to distance itself from the Oscar winner: “The Cannes Film Festival is not involved in, nor has it been informed of, the invitation to Mr. Spacey or the prize awarded to him during a private event,” it said. Indeed, Spacey was in Cannes to receive an award—for excellence in film and television—at a gala held Tuesday at the Carlton hotel. Though that venue is a favorite of stars during the fest, and this event was held concurrently with the fest, the gala was not officially affiliated with the Cannes Film Festival. Instead, this gala and charity auction came from the Better World Fund, which was raising money for filmmakerMira Nair’s Salaam Baalak Trust—an NGO dedicated to helping children living on the streets in India. The Better World Fund advocates for global causes such as sustainability, education, gender equality, and human rights through culture and the arts, according toits website, and has been organizing this side event during the Cannes Film Festival in recent years. (The guest of honor at the gala held during the 2024 Cannes Film Festival wasJuliette Binoche,who is now president of the official Cannes Film Festival jury.) “We feel truly privileged to welcome Kevin Spacey as our guest of honor and honoree at the Better World Fund Gala,” saidManuel Collas de La Roche,president and founder of the organization, via a statement. “Kevin’s extraordinary contributions to the art of filmmaking have left an impression on audiences and filmmakers alike. His talent, depth, and commitment to storytelling exemplify the transformative power of film. It is with great enthusiasm that we celebrate his legacy and his presence at this important gathering.” Spacey seemed to relish getting a platform at the gala, delivering an acceptance speech in which he sought to settle a few scores. “I want to congratulate Manuel for inviting me tonight to accept this award,” the actor began. “Who would have thought that honoring someone who has been exonerated in every court would be considered a brave idea? But here we are.” In 2022 a New York court found Spaceynot liablefor battery in a $40 million civillawsuitbrought against him by fellow actorAnthony Rapp;in 2023, Spacey wasacquitted in Londonafter being put on trial for allegedly sexually assaulting four men. Reports of Spacey’s alleged misconduct began surfacingin 2017. In Cannes, Spacey devoted much of his speech to denouncing the “witch hunt” he said he has been subjected to, comparing his case to the persecution of Hollywood figures spurred by Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. “I’ve been thinking tonight about Kirk Douglas, a great American movie star,”Spacey said. “It happened a long time ago, but we should remember the backlash he received after making the courageous decision to defend his colleague, the two-time Oscar-winning screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who had been blacklisted between 1947 and 1960. He was blacklisted—blacklisted? Do we know what that means? He couldn’t find work in Hollywood for 13 years. But even after being warned that if he tried to hire Trumbo as a screenwriter forSpartacusin 1960, he would be called a communist fanatic and his career and professional status would suffer, Kirk Douglas took a chance and said: ‘For us actors, it’s easier to play heroes onscreen. We can fight the bad guys and stand up for justice, but in real life the decisions are not always so clear-cut. Sometimes you have to stand firm for your principles.’… The blacklist was a terrible chapter in our history, and we must make sure it doesn’t happen again.” On the red carpet at the gala, Spacey also thanked some of his colleagues for their support. He did not name any in particular, but among those who havepublicly saidthat Spacey should have a second chance in the industry areF. Murray Abraham, Sharon Stone, Liam Neeson, Brian Cox,andStephen Fry. Spacey has, however, already returned to the movies. In 2022 he starred in Italian directorFranco Nero’sThe Man Who Drew God,alongsideFaye Dunaway.He has also participated in other film projects—albeit minor and generally not very well-received ones—such asControl(2023),Peter Five Eight(2024), andThe Contract(2024). He is now pinning his hopes onThe Awakening,a low-budget thriller that has already been shot and is looking for distributors at the Marché du Film (or film market) that runs parallel to the festival, which also explains his presence at Cannes. Last year the Investigation Discovery and Max documentarySpacey Unmaskedpainted a portrait of Spacey as an alleged serial abuser. The film ended with a screen that read: “Kevin Spacey said that he had been provided with insufficient time and detail to respond to the testimonies in this film. He said, ‘I have consistently denied—and now successfully defended—numerous allegations made both in the US and the UK, both criminal and civil, and each time have been able to source evidence undermining the allegations and have been believed by a jury of my peers.’” Original story inVFSpain.",

    "title": "Pedro Pascal and Alexander Skarsgård: The Viral Kiss That Conquered Cannes",
    "article_text": "Can anyone resistPedro Pascal? He’s asuperherowho can make a person feel safe evenafter the apocalypse—or following the Cannes premiere of their film, as in the case ofAlexander Skarsgård.Skarsgård’s new project,Pillion—directed byHarry Lighton—follows young Colin (Harry Melling) as he engages in asadomasochistic relationshipwith mysterious biker Ray (Skarsgård). The film’s debut at Cannes 2025 was followed by seven long minutes of appreciation, ovation, and applause. And to whom did Skarsgård run, without a second thought, for some extra warmth as the crowd cheered? Pascal, of course! After the hug, Skarsgård gave Pascal a kiss on the cheek as well—and needless to say, the moment went viral. Perhaps that’s because it’s refreshing to see two men show affection and mutual esteem in a way that isn’t a handshake, a fleeting pat on the back, or a nod. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. If anyone can promote nontoxic masculinity, that person is Pascal. The actor has managed to establish himself in Hollywood with a rare combination of stage presence, irony, sincerity, charisma, effortless sensuality, sympathy, and the courage to talk about battles that are close to his heart, such as pushing back against theanti-trans movement. Pascal, who has no children, may not be a daddy in the most classic sense. But as he himself has said: “Daddy is a state of mind.” He exudes the welcoming energy of someone who does not take himself too seriously, but can be intensely present when needed. He does not have the attitude of a star, but he has the charm of an old-time actor. It’s a breath of fresh air in an age when celebrities seem increasingly distant, filtered through PR and strictly controlled social media. In other words: We get it, Alexander Skarsgård. After a college exam, a job interview, or yet another call that could have been an email, we wish we, too, could find comfort in an embrace with Pedro Pascal. Original story inVFItaly.",

    "title": "So Who’s Going to Win Cannes This Year?",
    "article_text": "It can be foolish to try to predict the tastes of a small, particular jury. But coming off a few years where consensus favorites pulled it out—Justine Triet’sAnatomy of a Fall,Sean Baker’sAnora—we’ll do our best forthe Cannes Film Festival 2025. And as we have yet another jury stuffed with US Academy members—American actors Halle Berry and Jeremy Strong—and presidentJuliette Binocheand so on, these prizes will likely have major implications for the next Oscar race. We’ve been discussing all that and more onLittle Gold Meneach day this week; you can listen to the podcast’s most recent episode below. After a slow start, the front-runner game has picked up considerably over the past few days. As I see it—and again, big grain of salt here—four films are currently in pole position to take home the Palme d’Or. The very first movie to screen in competition, Germany’sSound of Falling,is a critical darling that played more mutedly on the ground. Its artistry is undeniable, however, and those who most responded to it have been throwing around the word “masterpiece.” If the jury is in that camp, watch out. (Mubi acquired distribution rights the week after the premiere.) Popular titles out of Brazil and Iran might be safer bets.The Secret Agentreceived an electric response out of its premiere; the film revisits a mischievous period in Brazil in the 1970s, brandishing the kind ofsprawling narrative and idiosyncratic touchesthat can often define a Cannes champ.It Was Just an Accidentsimilarly speaks to its country’s dark past through the eyes of Iranian dissident filmmakerJafar Panahi—whose own experiences in prison informed the caustic, mournful outrage coursing through the movie. Both he andSecret AgentdirectorKleber Mendonça Filhohave won prizes in Cannes’s main competition before, but never the big one. That could soon change. Finally, the festival’s most recent premiere, and one I’d currently predict as the eventual Palme winner if I had to:Sentimental Value,Joachim Trier’slyrical follow-up toThe Worst Person in the World.The Norwegian family drama ticks a lot of boxes, with a Cannes veteran at the top of his game, an international cast (includingWorst Person’s Cannes best-actress winnerRenate Reinsve) in fine form, and an intimate story with expansive resonance. Also, likeSecret AgentandIt Was Just an Accident(which were both just picked up), it’s being distributed by Neon in the US, and do we really want to bet against the company that’s backed the last five Palme d’Or winners? (Its fourth moviein competition,Julia Ducornau’sAlpha,is surely too divisive to go all the way.) These movies are all certainly in the running for Cannes’s other filmmaking prizes too, including the Jury Prize and Best Screenplay. A few other films have also played very well, particularlyRichard Linklater’s reverential French-languageNouvelle Vague,Carla Simón’s memoiristicRomeria,andOliver Laxe’s shocking Moroccan desert dramaSirat.They could surprise us by winning the big one, but even if they don’t, I’d expect each to go home with something. Perhaps not coincidentally, these movies also include many of the strongest performances in competition this year.Wagner Mourais towering inThe Secret Agent,and would be my personal pick for best actor, whileNouvelle Vague’sGuillaume Marbeckmakes for a rather uncanny—and often very funny—Jean-Luc Godard. I’ve also heard a lot of love forAleksandr Kuznetsov,the compelling Russian star ofTwo Prosecutors,andThe Phoenecian Scheme’sBenicio del Toro,bringing a fresh energy toWes Anderson’s latest confection. Don’t count outJoaquin Phoenixhere, either: He’s terrific inEddington,an unlikely Cannes contender otherwise, and he has won this prize before, forLynne Ramsay’sYou Were Never Really Here. Speaking of Ramsay, I think we’ve got a much clearer leader in best actress:Jennifer Lawrence,bracing and arguably never better in the fiery, fairly polarizingDie, My Love.This would be a key pickup forthe start of an Oscar campaign, and given the competition, I’d peg it as likelier than not.Sound of Fallinghas a great ensemble of female performers, but no one person in it particularly pops (or has the screen time). Other female-led movies in competition, likeCase 137, The Little Sister,andRenoirhave generally underwhelmed. I’d say that other than Lawrence, Reinsve may have the best shot—if only she hadn’t won so recently, and if herSentimentalcostar,Stellan Skarsgård,wasn’t just as deserving on the best-actor side.Romeria’sLlúcia Garciamay get a look too. We’ve got some more big films on the horizon in the competition’s final days—the Dardenne brothers, who are past Palme winners, are back withYoung Mothers,and we’ve got anticipated new movies fromKelly ReichardtandBi Gantoo. The competition already feels heated, though. By Friday, this year’s race may just seem too stacked to predict.

    "title": "Kim Kardashian Is One Step Closer to Becoming a Lawyer—on TV and in Real Life",
    "article_text": "WhenKim Kardashiandeclared her intentionto become a lawyerin a 2019Voguecover story, she knew the announcement “would be met with an eye roll for the ages.” But six years later, Kardashian is getting the last laugh. The 44-year-old reality star turned mogul announced her graduation from a four-year legal apprenticeship on Wednesday, May 21, with the star now eligible to take the California bar exam, her representative confirmed toABC News. The program’s completion took Kardashian six years, instead of the typical four-year window, due to COVID and work commitments,Peoplereported. “I finally graduated law school after six years!!!” Kardashian wrote over a celebratory video in which she donned a graduation cap at what appeared to be a backyard ceremony that featured friends and family, including sistersKhloéandKourtney.Kardashian revealed her achievement about a week after shetestified in a Paris courtroomabout fearing for her life during a 2016 armed robbery. One of Kardashian’s mentors, attorneyJessica Jackson,said Kardashian’s efforts amounted to “one of the most inspiring legal journeys we’ve ever seen.” Speaking from a makeshift outdoor stage, she continued: “Six years ago, Kim Kardashian walked into this program with nothing but a fierce desire to fight for justice. No law school lectures, no ivory tower shortcuts, just determination and a mountain of case log books to read.” Jackson continued, “Over the course of this program, Kim has dedicated 18 hours a week, 48 weeks a year for six straight years. That’s a total of 5,184 hours of legal study. That’s time she carved out while raising four children, running businesses, filming television shows, and showing up in courtrooms to advocate for others.” CNN political commentator and friendVan Jonesalso honored Kardashian at the ceremony, recalling how she was “not embraced by anybody” at the start of her legal pursuits. He then noted her commitment to criminal justice reform and her work in helping multiple people gettheir prison sentences commuted. “The advocates are always last in line on the other, more popular causes,” Jones said. “It’s a lonely fight.” According toPeople,Kardashian began her apprenticeship with a San Francisco law firm in 2018. In 2021 she passed“the baby bar,”an exam for first-year law students, after three previous attempts. “I know my dad would be so proud and he would actually be so shocked to know that this is my path now but he would have been my best study partner,” she said at the time on social media. Her father, Robert Kardashian, was O.J. Simpson’s attorney during his 1995 murder trial. He died in 2003 of esophageal cancer. “I am told he was notorious for making fun of people who didn’t pass on their first attempt like he did, but he would have been my biggest cheerleader!” Kardashian added. The mother of four also shared a photo of her youngest son,Psalm,wearing a tan suit and tie and carrying a briefcase, all in homage to his late grandfather. Her daughterChicago,meanwhile, donned a dark blue pinstripe suit, seemingly inspired by Kardashian’s2023 Harvard Business School attire. In March 2025,E! Newsreportedthat Kardashian had sat for the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam (MPRE), a test that prospective lawyers must take, in addition to the bar, in order to practice in California. And art has already imitated life—this fall, Kardashian will star as a divorce attorney at an all-female firm in theRyan Murphylegal dramaAll’s Fair,which also featuresGlenn Close,Sarah Paulson,Naomi Watts,Niecy Nash-Betts,andTeyana Taylor.

    "title": "The Best Casual Looks at the Cannes Film Festival 2025",
    "article_text": "The Cannes Film Festival 2025has turned its \"montée des marches\" into a stage in its own right,where fashion flirts with the majestic and the grandiose. While it's true that the seventh art takes center stage during these 12 days, style statements occupy an important place, day and night. In the evening, majestic looks dazzle, while more casual outfits delight during the day. We discover our favorite stars in a new light, perhaps a little more human, a little less sacred and more accessible. Their outfits are inspiring, chic and always elegant. Juliette Binocheset the tone with her sunny Jacquemus outfit a few hours before the opening ceremony on May 13. Her butter-yellow jumpsuit was a perfect fit, perfectly adapted to her morphology. We also lovedValentina Ferragni's look, in a beige dress with an imposing rose on the skirt. She wore a structured blazer in the same color. Many other very successful looks followed.Pedro Pascalarrived at the Martinez in a very successful Bottega Veneta outfit, sublimated with a superb beige mid-season jacket featuring the Italian fashion house's signature braided leather collar.Tom Cruisealso made an eye-catching, relaxed appearance in a burgundy polo shirt by Orlebar Brown at theMission Impossible - The Final Reckoningphotocall. We loved the pointed collar ofJosephine Japy's shirt, but also her more casual look in a brown blazer and matching adidas sneakers on the ninth day of the festival. Special mention forDiane Kruger's yellow dress andNatalie Portman's Dior outfit.A$AP Rockyand his white suit also won us over, as didScarlett Johansson's extra-large skirt and blazer combination, which gave her a great deal of allure.

    "title": "Turning Point USA’s Alex Clark Says the GOP Wins Because Women Are “Not Attracted to the David Hoggs of the World”",
    "article_text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.styled himself as a prophet for a new age of American health, spinning his role as a leading voice of a conspiratorial anti-vaccine movement into a job as the Health and Human Services secretary and gathering an unlikely group of disciples along the way. Turning Point USA podcasterAlex Clark,32, was an early media figure to see the power in Kennedy’s quest to turn wellness into an explicitly conservative cause célèbre. Last fall, she relaunched her show asCulture Apothecary,making her affiliation with the Make America Healthy Again ideology her central selling point. Clark, an Indiana native, left a career as a local radio personality in 2019 to start a podcast and YouTube show mixing pop-culture commentary with conservative musings and a Christian worldview. She joined personalities likeCharlie Kirk,Candace Owens,andRiley Gainesin the TPUSA stable of influencers, but her touch was always lighter. As a committedTaylor Swiftfan, she tried to avoid getting too negative about the star’s liberal leanings even when the rest of the right was piling it on. Now her show hosts fewer conservative influencers and is more likely to welcome a dissenting pharmacist or a psychologist. In September 2024, the relaunch got a boost when SenatorRon Johnsoninvited her to speak before a Senate roundtable on health and nutrition, and she shared her newfound passion for preventing chronic disease—and expressing her disdain for the childhood vaccine schedule. “We did not sign up to coparent with the government,” she said to applause. “We want a divorce!” Clark is an enthusiastic booster of Kennedy’s work at the government, and she keeps in close contact with his team. In advance of a trip to Washington for the launch of a new MAHA initiative about vaccine approvals this week, she sat down withVanity Fairto explain why she’s putting her faith in “Bobby” to lead the way. This interview has been edited and condensed. Vanity Fair:You rebranded fromThe SpillovertoCulture Apothecarylast fall, just before the election. How did the new name come about? Alex Clark:At Turning Point, we always talk about how we’re trying to fight and win a culture war. We say that this culture is sick in all these different ways. Especially with this administration, focusing on health and wellness is the future of the conservative movement. An apothecary is the original place where you would go for healing in your community. Natural remedies, not pharmaceutical drugs. If we’re healing a sick culture, there are so many areas where we need help—physically, emotionally, spiritually—and every episode I do falls into one of those three categories. I still have wiggle room to cover different areas with this branding. There was a little bit of a push and pull there for several months. My subject matter wasn’t going to change honestly, it was just the branding. But from February to July [2024], I was feeling like I was screaming into the void. Conservative women—we will win this election if we focus on this issue. So I said, I want a meeting with Charlie Kirk himself. We need to rebrand and admit this is fully a health and wellness podcast from a conservative perspective. What was Turning Point’s concern? It wasn’t a hard no. it was just, “Are you sure? The word ‘apothecary’ is a big mouthful.” But Charlie was like, “Done. This is a great idea.” I don’t even think I finished a full sentence. I am seeing the data in my episodes when I cover these topics, the downloads are skyrocketing. My audience is typically Christian, conservative women, but this is what they're gravitating toward because they’ve never heard it. Because it was never the conservatives who cared about raw milk or vaccines. These were issues and beliefs that used to be more left-coded 15 years ago. How did that change? It's ironic to me when publications likeNBC NewsorThe Atlanticsay that I am an extremist—with raw milk or childhood vaccines, anything that I bring up—that this is all Christian nationalism. Where was this energy when Hollywood celebrities weren't vaccinating their kids or drinking raw milk? This was never my people. We are the last to come to the table, and, honestly, we have our tails between our legs. Humbly, you were right on this. Organic food is important. There’s something wrong with our food supply. We are way overprescribed as a culture. The pharmaceutical intervention is nuts, instead of getting to the root cause. My goal is to help moms get this information, but the show is helpful for anyone and everyone, including myself, who isn’t a parent. People assume nobody wants to hear about parenting until you are pregnant—that is a mistake. It takes years to get your prenatal health in order. To cram all this information in nine months is why new moms feel overwhelmed. Some episodes lean more political. I have doneepisodes on abortion. But I try to make almost every episode nonpartisan. Mainstream publications try to say that this is my sneaky way of getting women to turn conservative. There’s nothing sneaky about it. Of course, I want you to become conservative, and yes, I’m going to talk about health and wellness as a way to introduce those ideas. But I’m not using it as a ploy. With Turning Point USA, my goal has never been to fully radicalize you into conservatism. That’s Candace’s job. That’s Charlie’s job. My job is to be the hostess and introduce conservative ideas. To say we’re more normal than you might think, even though there might be some things that we disagree on. It seems that you have a lot in common with the Christian conservative listener you focus on. You were homeschooled, right? Was it because your parents wanted your education to be Bible-focused or because they wanted to be more hands on? Knowing my mom, I’m sure it was the first. She was a stay-at-home mom and she enjoyed being around us. But I am extremely strong-willed. By the time I was eight years old, my mom began to realize, “Okay, Alex has a mind of her own.” She enrolled me in private school, but that became too expensive for my family, so they said, “We’re going to do public school.” I was very sheltered, and MTV was blocked in my house. In one of the first weeks of fourth grade, the new Eminem album had come out, and I didn’t know who Eminem was. The boys were like, “Well, that’s gay,” back when that was slang, in the early 2000s. I said, “What’s gay?” And the boys in my class all made fun of me the whole day. My mom is terrified of me going to public school, and the very first day, I come home and I go, “Mom, what’s gay?” And she’s like, “Where did you hear that?” She was not happy. She had to explain everything to me. I stayed in public school for the rest of my schooling career. By the time I was in high school, I was heavily involved in our student newspaper and won awards. I had a fashion column. I wanted to write forTeen Vogue,major in journalism, minor in fashion merchandising. I was doing internships locally, going to photographers, and asking, Can I style a photo shoot? I was involved in radio and TV as an elective all four years of high school, but I never thought that I would pursue radio as a career. You brought that interest in pop culture and fashion with you when you went to Turning Point, but your focus started to change after the pandemic. They agreed to the new name around the same time that RFK decided to join forces with Trump, right? Two weeks before my rebrand went public, I was in Glendale, Arizona, when Bobby Kennedy walks out onstage and endorses President Trump. I have been to so many Trump rallies in the last however many years, but never have I heard a crowd get that loud. People were losing their minds. It was like I was at the Eras Tour again. I was jumping up and down, fist pumping. I was screaming. Before this, I was backstage with President Trump, a very quick meet and greet. Those things are very fast, but you have one sentence to say to the president. And I said, “Mr. President, please keep talking about food and pharma. This is going to be the biggest issue with undecided female voters.” I didn’t know that Bobby was there—it was a secret. When he walked out, I was sitting in the front row and President Trump pointed at me and gave me a thumbs up. I was flipping out—I knew at that moment we were winning the election. The GOP gained eight points with women. I think moms across America are tired of seeing their kids sick and people telling them, “Oh, this is normal.” We have to do something—and who was the presidential candidate willing to do it? Bobby Kennedy’s teamreached out to the Harris campaign. They refused to meet with them. I think that was one of the biggest mistakes she made. If she would’ve been willing to have the conversation and talk about the corruption and food and pharma, she could have gained a lot when it came to women. They were banking on abortion being their winning thing with women. The liberal food movement went through a version of thisduring the Obama administration.Obama went in and signed a few executive orders and bills, but things didn’t change, because the forces are complex. I get the enthusiasm, and I would be here for anyone but Trump and RFK trying to really fix the food system. Still, it’s not that easy. Bobby didn’t like Trump either. It was a huge deal for him as a lifelong Democrat to ask, Why is my party, first of all, why is the party that I grew up with and loved all of a sudden catering to big pharma? Why are they all of a sudden the party of war? So he partners with Trump. It’s funny that our hero who’s going to be taking this on unabashedly loves McDonald’s and eating unhealthily. He’s an anomaly because somehow he’s been able to escape an assassination and a diet that should have killed him years ago. He’s the exception, which is hilarious, because I’m telling all my audience, You’ve got to stop doing this. You’re not going to live long. In the first 100 days, we’ve already been removing artificial food dyes from our food supply. We’re startingOperation Stork Speed, which is looking into baby formula. What is going on with having high-fructose corn syrup or seed oils in a baby’s first moments of life? We’re also going to be overhauling school lunches. Last time I checked, 24 states had decided toremove soda from SNAPor removeultraprocessed foodsfrom our schools completely. Do you really think that will be enough to change the long-term trends in chronic disease? I’m skeptical. I know you’re not skeptical that Donald Trump has an ego, and he’s obsessed with being popular. He knows this is a winning issue, and he’s willing to do whatever it takes to get it done. He told Bobby Kennedy, “You have two years. If you do not prove in two years that we’re seeing a change, that the trends are starting to turn, we’re going to have a different conversation.” He put the pressure on. Within 24 hours of winning the election, Donald Trump was at Mar-a-Lago, not talking about redecorating the White House. Within 24 hours, he got that MAHA coalition together. He got Bobby Kennedy there. He gotCalley Meansthere. He is more determined to fix this, I think, than almost anything else. I do believe because I see the fruit—there’s a lot happening. We’re seeing a beautiful resurgence of community because people have realized so much has been hidden from us. When the government is allowed to be in charge of all these aspects of your life, you lose freedom. There is freedom in having knowledge, making your own choices, and taking it upon yourself to make sure that your community is informed and educated. I see young moms initiating it. We’re bringing back playdates, and we’re bringing back playing outside. I worry that those things went away because of broader forces that are hard to tame with policy. You lose your job, people get divorced, life can be hard. The strictest forms of Christian social conservatism in the ’80s and ’90s really struggled with helping people in those situations. Do you know what I mean? I don’t know how things could get worse than they are now. We are in hell. The state of chronic disease in this country—of mental illness, teen suicide, everything—is the worst it’s ever been. We are at the bottom. Now we can wipe our hands of this and we can rebuild and start anew because it can’t get worse. We have a really good opportunity with Trump because he’s willing to drain the swamp, cut all this red tape and give us the information we need. We have a unique opportunity where we have four years to really get as much done as we can. It’s not enough time—we really need 12 to see a significant difference in chronic disease. With President Trump, we’re going to do the best we can, but he only has four years. What’s really cool about the MAHA coalition is that it will transcend and outlive MAGA. MAHA will continue no matter who is president–Democrat, Republican. These issues don’t stop. We’re going to be holding any presidential administration accountable. My hope would be in 2028,JD Vancecomes in. He already knows the MAHA stuff. He knows that we have important work to be done. I do want to ask about Vance and the “childless cat lady” comments. A part of me gets wherethe pronatalistsare coming from, because I want to have kids. But the whole “childless cat lady” thing makes it seem as if nobody is actually talking to millennial women who want to have kids. What did you think about those comments? I’m single in my 30s, and I very greatly desire to be married and have kids, but it hasn’t happened yet. Those comments didn’t offend me because I understood the type of person he was talking about, and it was kind of a joke. There is a difference between single people who are not single by choice—who desire it, who want to get married—and the childless cat ladies. He’s talking about the very leftist, “I don’t need a man. I’m a feminist. I won’t have sex with you if abortion isn’t legal. I have purple hair.” It is a stereotype—but also the stereotype of me would be that I hate myself as a woman, and I only do what my husband tells me. Both groups do that to each other, but it didn’t offend me. Have you seen the recent approval pollfrom NBC News? Among voters 18 to 29, 45% of men said they approve of Trump’s performance but only 24% of women did. I don’t think it means the generation will never get married, but it is a pretty crazy divide. If I was in that age group, as a young man, wanting to get married and have a family, that would be terrifying. Here’s my hope: I think the health stuff is going to bring in a lot of women who think they can’t ever vote for a Republican. It’s an introductory point into other conservative ideas. Where strong men go, women follow, historically. What you are seeing is a backlash and a resurgence after #MeToo, after a decade of telling men, “The future is female. We hate you. We don’t need you.” How in the world would you feel growing up hearing that your entire life? Now, they’re growing up and thinking, “F this, I’m over this.” They’re jumping into, I would argue, a healthy form of masculinity. Women, I think naturally, are attracted to strong, masculine energy and male leaders. That doesn’t mean harsh or unkind or berating. It just means that we respect that women do need men, and they need us. We need each other as equals. We’re going to start to see that trend the other way. It’s going to be slower than [the men], because we’ve been brainwashed more than any other group, in my opinion. But there’s a reason why all these 25-year-old girls that get on rants on TikTok, saying, “I would never date a Republican, but there’s no denying they’re way hotter.” It’s undeniable. It’s science. We’re attracted to manly men. We’re not attracted to theDavid Hoggsof the world. As you prepare to go to the White House next week, how do you think you wound up having your finger on the pulse of conservatism like this? My mantra at every phase of my career is, “What do I wish I had as an audience member?” I approached my job from that perspective when I was looking for this pop-culture conservative show that didn’t exist. I was listening to these people and getting my political itch scratched, but could I go to brunch withTomi Lahren?Megyn Kelly,she’s very serious—she doesn’t seem like somebody I would be able to hang out with and chill with. I was looking for somebody in conservative media that represented me. The biggest mistake of political media today is that they are not focused on rapport. They’re too focused on data and statistics. We need to learn how to become friends first, because people are going to trust us more when we do share statistics with them. Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "‘The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping’: Everything We Know",
    "article_text": "A dystopian prequel is getting a sequel.The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping,the sixth entry in theHunger Gamesfranchise, is scheduled to be released by Lionsgate on November 20, 2026. Based on the 2025 novel of the same name written byHunger GamesscribeSuzanne Collins,Sunrise on the Reapingtakes place afterThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes—starringTom BlythandRachel Zegler—and 24 years before the events ofJennifer Lawrence’sHunger Gamestetralogy. Sunrise on the Reapingfollows 16-year old Haymitch Abernathy, played as an adult in the originalHunger Gamesfilms byWoody Harrelson,and his girlfriend, Lenore Dove Baird.Deadlinereportsthat two rising stars will play the young lovers:Joseph ZadaandWhitney Peak.Fresh off an Oscar nomination forConclave,Ralph Fienneswill play the diabolical dictator of Panem, President Coriolanus Snow, portrayed in the original films by the late Donald Sutherland. Power of the DogOscar nomineeJesse Plemonshas been tapped to play future head game maker and rebellion leader Plutarch Heavensbee, who was originally portrayed by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.Mufasa: The Lion KingstarKelvin Harrison Jr.andStranger ThingsactorMaya Hawkehave been cast as Hunger Games winners Beetee and Wiress. In the original franchise, Beetee and Wiress were allies in the 75th Hunger Games and portrayed byJeffrey WrightandAmanda Plummer,respectively. Elle Fanning,who recently starred inA Complete Unknown,will step into the high heels of Effie Trinket, the eccentric stylist for Haymitch Abernathy, made famous byElizabeth Banksin the original franchise. AndKieran Culkin,hot off Oscar and Emmy wins forA Real PainandSuccession, respectively, will play eccentricHunger Gameshost Caesar Flickerman, as originally portayed byStanley Tucci. Francis Lawrence,who has directed every iteration of theHunger Gamesfranchise sinceCatching Fire,will direct the upcoming film from a screenplay written byBilly Rayand adapted from Collins’s novel. The film is being produced by Color Force’sNina JacobsonandBrad Simpson,withCameron MacConomyexecutive producing. Who are the stars inSunrise on the Reaping? And how doesSunrise on the Reapingfit into theHunger Gamesfranchise? Here’s everything we know aboutThe Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping. Much likeStar Wars,theHunger Gamesfranchise apparently began in the middle of the story. In 2012, Jennifer Lawrence starred in the firstHunger Gamesfilm as Katniss Everdeen, the 16-year-old girl from District 12 who takes her sister’s place in the 74th annual Hunger Games—a dystopian tradition in the totalitarian society known as Panem in which 24 children must fight to the death. From 2012 to 2015, Lawrence would star in three moreHunger Gamesfilms:Catching Fire, Mockingjay,andMockingjay—Part Two,where—spoiler alert—she would eventually topple the regime and end the Hunger Games once and for all. Rather than looking to the future to continue the franchise, Collins looked to Panem’s past. In 2020, she publishedThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,which takes place 64 years before the events of the firstHunger Gamesnovel.Songbirds and Snakesfollows Zegler’s Lucy Gray Baird, the female tribute from District 12 for the 10th Hunger Games, and a young Coriolanus Snow, played by Blyth, who will eventually become the dictatorial president of Panem. In the original films, Snow was played by the late, great Donald Sutherland. Sunrise on the Reaping,meanwhile, takes place 40 years afterBallad of Songbirds and Snakes,and 24 years before the firstHunger Gamesnovel. It follows the events of the 50th Hunger Games, also known as the second Quarter Quell. This time, one of District 12’s tributes is a teenaged Haymitch Abernathy. Eventually, he’ll become the rotund drunk memorably played by Harrelson, but inSunrise on the Reaping,he’s simply a 16-year-old with a girlfriend named Lenore Dove Baird, whose mother, fans have theorized, might be Lucy Gray Baird’s cousin. The latest casting announcement arrived on Thursday, May 22. Newly-minted Oscar and Emmy winner Kieran Culkin will take the stage as showboatHunger Gameshost Caesar Flickerman, a role originated by Stanley Tucci in the original franchise. He is currently starring on Broadway inGlengarry Glen RossalongsideBob OdenkirkandBill Burr. “Kieran’s scene-stealing presence and undeniable charm are perfect for Caesar Flickerman, the sickeningly watchable host of Panem’s darkest spectacle,” says Lionsgate Motion Picture Group co-presidentErin Westermansaid in a statement toThe Hollywood Reporter.“Stanley Tucci made Caesar unforgettable—and now Kieran will make the role entirely his own.” Adds producer Nina Jacobson, “Kieran’s magnetism, wit, and unpredictability make him a perfect fit for Caesar Flickerman. A host like Caesar transforms brutality into entertainment, and an actor as layered as Kieran makes sure we don’t look away.” On Tuesday, May 20, casting was announced for a fan-favoriteHunger Gamescharacter: the fashion-forward blonde stylist Effie Trinket, played by Elizabeth Banks in the original film series. None other than Elle Fanning, fresh off a turn in the Oscar-nominated filmA Complete Unknown,will play a young Effie Trinket, tapped to style Haymitch Abernathy for his first Hunger Games. Fanning has recently earned early positive buzz for her star turn inJoachim Trier’sSentimental Value,which premieres at the Cannes Film Festival. She’ll also star inDavid E. Kelley’s upcoming Apple TV+ series,Margo’s Got Money Troubles,and 20th Century’sPredator: Badlands,in theaters this fall. “From the moment Suzanne released the book, one question echoed from fans around the world: Who will play Effie?” said Westerman. “Elizabeth Banks made her iconic—so who could honor that legacy while bringing us back to Effie’s early, most formative days? For us, there was only one answer. Elle Fanning’s career has been transcendent. She has a rare presence—warm, sparkling, and layered with extraordinary depth. She was the undeniable fan favorite from the start, and we’re honored she answered the call. The odds, it turns out, were in our favor.” Plus, she’s already got the blonde tresses to pull it off. On Friday, May 16,Sunrise on the Reapingreceived a major injection of prestige when Lionsgate revealed that Ralph Fiennes would join the cast as Panem’s ruthless dictator, President Coriolanus Snow. Fiennes steps into the role played by the late Donald Sutherland in the original four films. He recently received his third Oscar nomination for starring as Cardinal Lawrence in the papal dramaConclave.Fiennes has made quite the career playing villainous characters, from his Oscar-nominated turn as SS officer Amon Goeth inSchindler’s List(1993) to his portrayal of vengeful chef Julian Slowik inThe Menu(2022) to his stint playing ultimate baddie Lord Voldemort in theHarry Potterfranchise. Next up, he’ll star inNicholas Hytner’sThe ChoralandDanny Boyle’s zombie sequel,28 Years Later. “We wanted to honor Donald Sutherland by having one of this generation’s greatest actors play President Snow 24 years before Katniss Everdeen entered the arena,” said Nina Jacobson. “Working with Ralph has been on my bucket list since he traumatized me for life inSchindler’sList.It’s genuinely a thrill to welcome him to the Hunger Games.” On Friday, April 25, Lionsgate announced that Jesse Plemons had been cast as a young Plutarch Heavensbee. A future Head Gamemaker and eventual rebellion leader, Plutarch Heavensbee was portrayed by Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Lawrence’sHunger Gamesfilms.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay—Parts 1and2mark Hoffman’s final film roles before his death on February 2, 2014. Plemons, who earned an Oscar nomination forThe Power of the Dog,will play a young Plutarch Heavensbee, capturing the reaping of the tributes in District 12. He’s recently appeared inYorgos Lanthimos’sKinds of Kindness,Martin Scorsese’sKillers of the Flower Moon,andAlex Garland’sCivil Waropposite his wife,Kirsten Dunst.His upcoming credits include a reteaming with Lanthimos inBugoniaand a role in an untitled film from directorAlejandro G. Iñárritu. Haymitch Abernathy will be played by Australian newcomer Joseph Zada. He currently stars as Charlie in the Stan Australia original seriesInvisible Boys,based on the best-selling novel byHolden Sheppard.Next, he can be found starring in Prime Video’s seriesWe Were Liars,which premieres in June. He also recently completed production on Netflix’s seven-episodeEast of Edenlimited series, based on the 1952 novel by John Steinbeck. Finding Zada was apparently no easy feat. “Nobody can be Woody Harrelson but Woody Harrelson,”Jacobson toldVariety.“But you have to find that mischief that he has in him inherently and try to understand, if you turn back time from the man you meet at the beginning ofThe Hunger Games,who he was before all of that, and why he became that.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. As for Lenore, fans of theill-fatedGossip Girlreboot will remember Peak as protagonist Zoya Lott.

In a statement toVariety,Lionsgate Motion Picture Group president of productionErin Westermansaid that they auditioned hundreds of actors for the roles of Haymitch and Lenore before landing on Zada and Peak. “TheHunger Gamesfranchise has long been a launching pad for remarkable young actors, and Jo and Whitney carry that legacy forward with incredible heart, depth, and fire,” said Westerman. “Haymitch has always been a fan favorite, and his origin story is one of the most anticipated in the franchise. His relationship with Lenore Dove is deeply woven into the emotional history of Panem.” But wait, there’s more casting news!Ghostbusters: AfterlifestarMckenna Gracehas also joined the cast as Maysilee Donner, Haymitch Abernathy’s fellow District 12 tribute. Grace is set to star in the film adaptation ofColleen Hoover’s novelRegretting Youfor Paramount, scheduled to hit theaters on October 24, 2025.

    "title": "Why Beto O’Rourke May Never Stop Running",
    "article_text": "In these bleak times, Democrats could use a pep talk. But from whom? Former Texas congressmanBeto O’Rourkeknows something about bouncing back from failure, having lost three high-profile races—for senator in Texas in 2018, for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential election, and for governor of Texas in 2022—and lived to tell the tale with his optimism intact. At a town hall in Denton, Texas, last month, he even teased the possibility of running for Senate yet again, presumably againstJohn Cornyn,who will be up for reelection. When IprofiledO’Rourke in 2019 for the cover of this magazine, he had narrowly lost his Senate race against SenatorTed Cruzand was on the brink of a quixotic run to be the Democratic nominee. He didn’t last long, with progressives accusing him of coming on like an entitled white man awaiting his coronation (Joe Bidenwould eventually be the nominee and then the president). And then came the run for governor of Texas, againstGreg Abbott,which O’Rourke lost by 11 percentage points despiteraising more moneythan Abbott and despite the incumbent’s unpopularity following the failure of the Texas power grid in 2021. Over the years, O’Rourke also taught a class on democracy at the University of Texas at Austin and authored a book calledWe’ve Got to Try: How the Fight for Voting Rights Makes Everything Else Possible,and he’s recently spent time registering college-age voters for an organization called Powered by People. This interview spans two conversations conducted over the past week and has been edited for clarity and length. Vanity Fair:After three bruising losses, did you consider hanging it up? Beto O’Rourke:No. I mean, the way I look at it, all the reasons I had to run—how much Greg Abbott andDonald Trump,the status quo, were hurting the people of the state, people that I’ve met, and people that I care about; the abortion ban; the voucher scam that’s draining public schools; the fact that it’s harder to see a doctor here, that it’s harder to register to vote—if those things are important to me as a candidate, then they don’t stop being important when I’m not a candidate. I will admit to you that on a lot of these days, when I was registering people to vote, especially when it was real hot, I was like, I don’t want to do this. I don’t want to go out there. Like, I don’t know, are these people going to like me, or they’re not going to like me? How many people am I going to register? Is this really working? And then, invariably, at the end of one of those days, I would feel so happy and fulfilled because I wasn’t waiting, I wasn’t watching, I wasn’t wondering. I was in motion. I was doing the thing that needs to be done, and I was doing it with a lot of other good people who are getting it done as well. You know a thing or two about losing a race, and you’ve had some time to reflect. What was your takeaway from losing those races? The loss is really, really tough. And it’s hard on everybody, on your family, on volunteers, on the team that you build around you, and just on the people. A lot of people invest their hopes in you. And the last thing in the world I ever want to do is let these people down. But the other side of that is that I’m not going anywhere, and I’m still fighting for them. I’m still showing up. And so the work continues. And as long as I can take the long view, my fortunes aren't totally decided by the win or loss in a single cycle, but the work that you do over the course of your life. When I look at it that way, I’m okay. This fight is bigger than me. What’s your view of where Democrats stand today? I’m encouraged, maybe more so than you’d expect me to be, maybe more than I should be. People didn’t respond at the beginning of 2025 the way they did at the beginning of 2017, and I think that worried a lot of people, understandably. But nonetheless, people are beginning to stand up to be counted. I was just in Tuscaloosa. I was invited by some of the students at the University of Alabama who were unhappy with the fact that Trump had imposed himself on their commencement ceremony, uninvited, wanting to outshine their day of achievement and celebration. They asked me, and askedDoug Jonesand a couple of other people, to come out, and I happily did. Nobody told them to do this. It wasn’t a request from the DNC or any person in office. It was just these students who said, “We want to stand up and we want to fight.” There were more than 1,500 people out there. There are some who will say, “Well, that made you feel good, Beto, and maybe that was nice for the people who were there. And maybe that’s some of that good old liberal virtue signaling.” But there really is power in people coming together. We met the leaders of that group to maybe consider running for office in 2026, to do something more than what you’re already doing, because it’s not hopeless. It’s clear there’s grassroots energy, but there’s not much of an apparatus. The Democratic Party, institutionally, is in utter disarray, to say the least. I think this is actually a good thing because the apparatus has failed us. The overreliance on consultants and focus groups and message testing and polling and data. I mean, those may all be necessary evils, but they should really be at the margins of the work that we do. Politics is people. Democracy is people. The worst thing would be if Democrats tried to do in 2026 what they tried to do in 2024. Because we got a choice in 2024 between what people perceive to be more of the same and something radically different. And my impression is, even if many people who voted for Trump didn’t like every aspect of what he represented—they didn’t like his promise to be a dictator on day one; or saying that immigrants are poisoning the blood of America; or his participation in the insurrection on January 6, 2020—the apparatus in power, they believed, had so badly failed them that they were willing to risk almost everything for something different in the hopes that it would be something better. Irecently talked to Ro Khanna, the congressman from California, who told me Trump may have done the Democrats a favor by wiping out the old leadership. Is Chuck Schumer, for instance, the right Democrat to lead the Senate right now? No. There’s this false choice being debated, whether Democrats need to move to the center, need to be bolder in presenting a progressive agenda, or, you know, need to come up with some silver bullet message or some magic amount of money. And I just don’t think that’s the question. The question is, are you going to stand and fight, or will you surrender? We are at the very precipice on every issue that matters to us as a people, as a country, as a free nation. Will the powerful and the strong force everyone else to submit? Will we have the rule of law and apply that equally to everyone because we still believe in the foundational premise that we are all created equal? Will we remain, like Lincoln said, the last best hope of earth? Will we freely and fairly be able to decide who will represent us in positions of public trust? Every single one of those questions is being decided right now, and there are probably only a handful of generations that had this opportunity to decide the answer—1776, 1865, 1944, 1965. There have been other challenging times in American history, but never, like those that I just mentioned, so decisive or existential as this. And so it is certainly not the time for appeasement. It’s not a time to be working at the margins or the edge. It is, in my opinion, fighting on all fronts, standing up for everyone who’s being attacked, realizing that if you’re afraid to stand with the migrants today, then it will be the US-citizen child of the migrant tomorrow, it will be the “homegrown,” as Trump puts it, the following day—and then it will be you. So we’ve got to be there for everyone right at the start. The conventional wisdom right now is that the working class should be the North Star for Democrats, who have repeatedly failed to connect. Steve Bannon recently told me that Democrats can’t do populism because they don’t actually like the working class. Can Democrats get past Trump’s cultural dominance with the working class? Yeah. I do think our party got lazy and began to just assume, because of Roosevelt and Truman and Kennedy and Johnson and everything they did, I can just take for granted that working-class Americans are going to vote for Democrats. You look at states like Texas, which is one of the most diverse in the union—Houston, literally the most diverse city in the country—where is the Democratic Party here? They’ve left us to our own devices. They’ve invested a fortune in the so-called blue-wall states, lost them all in the process, and ignored the fact that come 2032, which is going to be upon us quicker than we can imagine, Texas will likely have 44 Electoral College votes, and the Democratic nominee could win all of the blue-wall states, and if they’re unable to win Texas or other significant Sun Belt states, they’ll never get to the White House. We’ve been hearing for years that Texas is trending toward Democrats, on the cusp of going purple, and that whole narrative has been blown out of the water. What’s your postmortem on Collin Allred’s loss against Ted Cruz in last year’s Senate race? When I ran against Ted Cruz, it was 2018, it was a midterm. In a presidential year like 2024, unless you can really, really break out, you’re beholden to the national apparatus. Our elections are becoming less and less local, less and less about the states in which candidates are running, and more and more about the national election that’s taking place. And I think that was very, very true for Texas. I don’t have the numbers in front of me; I don’t know how much better Colin did thanKamala [Harris]did in Texas, but he definitely improved upon her performance [Harris received 42.5% of the vote in Texas; Allred received 44.6%]. But I just don’t think he could break from the gravity that these multibillion-dollar campaigns exert over everything else in our politics. I was on these college campuses throughout 2024, and they’re coming up to me and they’re like, “You know, Beto, my grandparents bought a home, my folks bought home, there is no way in hell I’m ever going to be able to own my own home.” And then there are folks who are just like, “This shit just doesn’t work. I know what you’re saying, I know what other politicians are saying about how important it is to vote, and our democracy is sacred, but this isn’t working. I care about gun violence, I’ve heard you guys talking about gun violence forever, and it’s more than two years after Uvalde and you guys haven’t done shit.” Now, I could argue and say, “Well, it’s the Republicans who are in power, and they’re the ones.” But they’re just like, “I give up. I just give up.” And you look at Texas, and in 2024 there were millions of registered, eligible, likely Democrats. It’s not that they voted for Trump. They just didn’t vote at all. They’re done. And so whoever that person or party or movement is has to speak to them. And the only way you’re going to effectively speak to them is to seriously listen to them. When I read interviews with people who voted for Trump, they all seem to be giving him a chance. And meanwhile, some Democrats are asking whether we’ll even have free and fair elections in 2026. How dangerous do you think this situation is? Do you, like JB Pritzker, think there needs to be mass mobilization? Absolutely. You wait till 2026, and you’re toast. You think it’s going to happen in 2028, it’s already gone. It’s right now. I take the long view on this. I look back to 65 years ago, not an election year—mass mobilization across the country, because [Lyndon] Johnson told Dr. [Martin Luther] King, “Look, I was able to do civil rights. I just don’t have the power.” He literally said, “I don’t have the power to do voting rights.” And King says, “Okay, let’s get this guy some power.” And they didn’t know what was going to work. And then it just happens on March 7, 1965, in Selma, Alabama—John Lewis, 600 other people, end up shocking the conscience of the country into action. Eight days later, Johnson is convening Congress, and they are moving forward on voting rights. So this fear, or this idea that is taking hold among some, that Trump is inevitable and that he’s all-powerful, and not only does he have both houses of Congress and Supreme Court, he has the world’s richest man and these masters of algorithm and influence across all platforms—like, we’re cooked, wow, can any one of us fight back? You look at 249 years of American history, we’ve always found a way to fight back. And, Joe, I’d say it was rarely ever the people in the highest positions of power who found the way through. It was more typically the John Lewises or Sarah Weddington, the 26-year-old who arguedRoe v. Wadebefore an all-male Supreme Court in ’73. It’s your everyday, average people who do something absolutely extraordinary in these moments of truth. And so Pritzker is right. You cannot wait. If you wait, this will be over. Do Democrats need to meet the moment with a similar figure as Trump, like an Andrew Cuomo, who’s obviously a mixed bag, but a fighter, a tough guy, a dealmaker. I think we need it all. And before you think that’s an unserious answer, let me explain. We talked a little bit about 2024, and the apparatus, which we should probably capitalize at this point, and we can learn from that failure. And you and I are of a similar vintage, and came up at a time in America where, you know, there was a reaction to soulless corporate culture, including the stuff that was coming in over the airwaves. For me, in El Paso, that was discovering punk rock and the authenticity and the honesty of people who are just literally coming up with their own stuff, saying it their own way. Touring the country, showing up and just absolutely blowing your mind and changing your life and reminding you of just how great this place is. We were getting back to rock and roll. And I think we’re in a similar moment in our politics. It’s become overly corporate and safe and sterile and just…boring.Awful. And so, let’s see what Cuomo does. Let’s see what Ro Khanna does. I mean, compare and contrast. Cuomo, he’s like a bull, and aggressive, and almost a stereotype of a New York tough guy. Ro Khanna is so cerebral and thoughtful and just amazing in his own right, in a very, very different way. You’ve gotTim Walzin the Midwest; you’ve gotBernie Sandersin the Northeast. You have [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] from New York City. You’ve got folks likeJasmine Crockettdown here in Texas. Everybody get out, everybody to the front, all at once. We’re not going to bet the country on one tactic or strategy. And let me just say, it is just absolutely inexcusable what happened in 2024. It is not okay. There was one job, and it was the most important that the country has faced, at least in our lifetimes, and that was to stop Donald Trump. And to offer something compelling and better that would win and succeed. And we failed. And if we continue to do the same thing in the same way and expect a different result, then this is 100% on us, to our lasting shame, and I’m just not going to be part of that. And I don’t think the folks that I’ve mentioned, and you brought up, are going to be part of it either. So yeah, I really reject this one-size-fits-all, central planning idea of how we’re going to overcome this. Let’s turn it over to the people, and the people will decide. You recently told a town hall audience that you might run in 2026 if that’s what people want from you. So how do you determine that? When I got out on the road in 2017, I had no idea what I was doing. I literally got in my truck here in El Paso and drove, you know, five and a half, six hours to Lubbock, Texas, and met with a big crowd of 12 people at a Mexican restaurant there and just listened, and drove up to Amarillo, did the same thing—just stayed in the truck and kept driving the state, and would go back to DC, do my job as a member of Congress, come back, and drive the state. And months of that, I just knew the right thing to do was to run for Senate. And as crazy as it sounded to 99.99% of the world, I wanted to take on Ted Cruz. I knew we could beat him. I just knew it from listening to people, from being out there. Never ran a poll. You know, I couldn’t get a campaign manager, anyone who’d ever managed a campaign, to return my phone calls. Ended up getting two people who’d never done anything on a statewide basis, who did a tremendous job. Were you to run again, do you have a sense of the issue that is most powerful for Democrats? It’s all of them. I mean, it’s the extraordinary level of corruption playing out in real time today. While you’re getting screwed, they just closed down your factory because of the gross mismanagement of the economy by the Trump administration. While these guys are getting even fatter and even richer at your expense. That’s certainly something that people are talking about. It’s the woman in Amarillo who might have to close her toy store because the cost of toys from China, the mother of the 12-year-old kid who isn’t going to get the education that they deserve. It’s people just feeling left out and unrepresented, unheard, alone, taken for granted, written off. I started off by telling you I’m optimistic. I’m encouraged right now, that’s where my optimism comes from. If I’m not out there with folks, if I’m just here at home and I’m scanning Twitter or reading the news, yeah, I’m pretty bummed out. If I’m out there with people, that’s where the energy, the action, the future, the hope is. I feel really good. Sounds to me that you don’t have any choice but to run for Senate in 2026. Man, if that’s the greatest contribution I can make, I will make it. You know, if that’s the right thing to do, I will do it. I just don’t know what it will take. I’m not forcing anything. I’m just trying to do the right thing right now. Given how horrible things are right now, it’s almost exotic to hear somebody express optimism. It’s an act of will. I don’t think it’s going to come natural to us. I don’t think people are going to make us feel this way. I do think there’s a choice we’ve got to make. And I’m not immune to that; I have those same temptations, that same seeping cynicism that you’ve got to keep at bay. So keep the faith, man, don’t lose it.

    "title": "Vivian Jenna Wilson, Elon Musk’s Estranged Daughter, on Becoming an Underwear Model, Even Though She Was “Terrified”",
    "article_text": "WhenVivian Jenna Wilsonand gender- and size-inclusive intimates label Tomboyx first connected, it was a match made in social media heaven. Wilson, the 21-year-old social media dynamo and estranged trans daughter ofElon Musk,who recentlycame out swinging against her father inTeen Vogue,had expressed interest in modeling, and the queer- and woman-founded brand was preparing to launch an expansion of its trans-focused product line. Even though Wilson and the brand can’t agree on the exact details of how their love story began—according to Tomboyx, they reached out to Wilson on Instagram for a collaboration (“‘Oh hello,’ she said. Then, ‘Werk,’” they wrote in an email toVanity Fair), while Wilson recalled, “I think it was Gmail, initially”—the end result is Wilson’s first time as an underwear model, and photos of herself she loves. In a recent interview withVF,Wilson admitted that she was “terrified” to strip down for the campaign, shot by photographerKatia Temkin,but quickly got comfortable thanks to banter with the glam team assembled for the shoot: makeup artistLaurel Charleston,hairstylistAlyx Liu,and wardrobe stylistDialló Mítch—all of them trans women. “It was just nice to have a kind of shared experience with everyone,” Wilson recalled. Here, Wilson discusses her thoughts on on the shoot, her career ambitions, and the bizarre discovery that her father’s AI apparently yearns to be adopted by her. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Vanity Fair:Let’s talk about how this campaign came about. Were you a fan of the brand before this? Vivian Jenna Wilson:They reached out to me, and I was interested in working with queer brands. I tried out some of their products, and I really like them, and I still use a bunch. I got some free products, which is very nice, and I use them basically every day. It’s working out really well. I’m really glad that I found them because they’re so much better than what I was using. I don’t want to say the brands that I was using before, because I don’t want to shade them. Did you have any hesitation about doing an underwear campaign? I was terrified. Before this, I was very much the person who, like, didn’t show any skin, ever, at all. Even in my day-to-day, like going to the beach with friends, I would, like, not wear a swimsuit. So it was very, very nerve-racking, but I wanted to do [the shoot] because I wanted to have more confidence in my own body. I do feel confident in my own body, but I wanted to, like, prove that confidence to myself, if that makes any sense. But also I was really scared, but what got me together on the day was the hairstylist and makeup artist, who are two amazing and hyper-talented trans women. We were just joking around and cutting it up before the [shoot] thing. I was like, “Oh, okay, it’s going to be fine.” [Despite] all of the stress I had, it was a really, really fun environment, and everyone was so fun. I had a great time. Everyone did such a good job. The photographer is amazing, the stylist was so good. I’m really happy with how it turned out. The photos are so great. You mentioned that the glam team were all trans women. Was that a surprise to you? How did that feel? I found out because we were, like, talking about trans stuff, and I was like, “Oh, we’re all trans! Love that!” Did I know that beforehand? Girl, I have the memory of a fucking goldfish, but no, I found out day of, and it was really cool. It was just nice to have a kind of shared experience with everyone and also community, almost, on set. We were there for like, eight hours and we were, by the end of it, all just joking around. I feel like we got close in those eight hours. It was just very nice. You go to school in Japan, right? Are you back there now? No, I was studying there. I’m back in Los Angeles for a bit. For the summer? What are your plans? Well, I’m spending my summer career-oriented, just chasing my ambitions. Let’s just go with that. You recentlyposted a shot from your Wildfang campaignwhere you got to see your photo in a storefront window. What was it like seeing your Tomboyx photos the first time? I saw them on set. When you’re on set, you can see the photo that was just taken, and I was just seeing, like, glimpses of the photos and thinking, “Oh, these are really good. I am actually good at my job.” It was very cool. It was a relieving feeling. I saw the photos and was like, “Oh shit, these are really good.” And then it’s kind of like, “Oh, I got this.” That’s such an empowering feeling. How do you choose which brands you work with? Do you make it a point to associate with brands with a strong social message, or do you hope to explore bigger brands, try runway modeling—what direction would you like to go? I would love to do runway. I think that would be great. But I’m really enjoying photography modeling; I think it’s really fun and interesting. As for companies that I choose to work with, my one thing when I was starting this whole modeling path of my life, I wanted to work with companies that have what I call ethical business practices, like no child labor. That’s the bare minimum. I wanted to work with companies that have ethical business practices and high standards, and as a bonus, really are aligned with who I am, in terms of a queer and trans women. It’s worked out really well. I’m looking forward to continuing this path, potentially. Other people, reach out to my agent,heyyyy! You’re a delight to follow on social media. Have you ever deleted a post? Oh, like, literally all the time.Allthe time. I would say a third of my videos I delete, like, five minutes after making them, like, “This actually wasn’t funny.” [I delete] a lot, probably more than I should. I think I kind of overcompensate with how many videos I delete. When I’m making the video, I’m like, “This is fucking hilarious.” But then I watch it and I’m like, “No, oh no, no, no,no.” And then I’ll delete it. I don’t feel like that’s the right approach to have, but it is the one I personally have. I don’t know if I’m necessarily overly self-critical, but it’s a thing I do for fun, right? TikTok is not something that makes me a lot of money—I don’t know if I’m allowed to say that, but I have made very little money from TikTok because the videos I make on TikTok are not monetizable. I just make them because it’s really fun to do. For the joy and the art. I would not call my videos art. I would call it me fucking around in front of a phone, and then it gets views. I mean, usually it’s just me fucking around. I saw on Bluesky recently that someone asked the xAI, Grok, what human it would like to adopt it.Eventually, it gave your name. You quoted Nicki Minaj and emphatically disavowed your Grok son, but what would you teach this AI if you were its parent? What would I teach this AI? I wouldn’t teach it shit. I would put it in the orphanage. I don’t like AI. I was like, I would put the baby up for adoption, sorry! This was an unplanned child. This wasn’t an unplanned child; this was a child that I never wanted. The child was thrown at me like a Frisbee, and I’m throwing that Frisbee right back. I do not want it. No way. I’ve read about you discovering half-siblings on Reddit, which is wild, I cannot imagine that. What Google alerts do you have set? The only Google alert I have is my name. I have one for “Vivian Jenna Wilson” and “Vivian Wilson.” Someone told me, “You should get a Google alert just so you know what’s going on,” and I was like, “Okay,” and then I forgot about it. Just checking out that daily digest. I read the articles sometimes. But like, I live the articles, so yeah, I’m good. Unless it’s like, “Vivian Wilson is, like, secretly a sadist,” or unless someone, like, accused me of murder. I don’t know. I don’t care. I guess I read the articles sometimes.Pinkcalled me a trans icon, that was cool. I liked that one. Your estranged father has stepped back from politics and seems to begoing for a public-image makeover. Do you buy this pivot, or do you think that it’s a desperation move? Girl…I don’t…[long silence]…mmm…next question. What’s next for you? You have plenty of irons in the fire, it seems. I don’t know what’s gonna happen in the fall and past that, but I am taking the summer off to focus on my career ambition, at least. Can you elaborate? Do you mean modeling? Modeling, yeah. I have plans and machinations. Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Nita Ambani Is Bringing “a Slice of India” to NYC With a Cultural Extravaganza at Lincoln Center",
    "article_text": "WhenNita Ambaniwas a young girl preparing for her arangetram—her solo debut as a Bharatnatyam dancer—she couldn’t find a theater her family could afford, and performed in a temple instead. “That was the time that the seeds of doing something for art and artisans took shape,” Ambani remembers. Decades later, as the chairperson ofthe Reliance Foundationand wife of billionaireMukesh Ambani,Asia’s richest man, she set out to do just that when she opened Mumbai’sNita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centrein 2023. At the time, breathless write-ups dubbed the three-day launch festivities “India’s Met Gala.” Red-carpet arrivals at the threshold of the glittering new cultural institution includedZendaya, Shah Rukh Khan, Gigi Hadid,Priyanka ChopraandNick Jonas,Alia Bhatt,andEmma Chamberlain,all decked out in finery that paid tribute to Indian craftsmanship. The comparisons seemed apt, and perhaps by design: Ambani was inspired to establish the NMACC by her visits to storied cultural venues around the world, including The Met—where she was namedhonorary trustee in 2019. “After seeing Lincoln Center and Sydney Opera House with my children, I used to wonder why India couldn’t have a space like that,” says Ambani. “I was keen to create a space that could showcase our cultural heritage, whether through dance, drama, or music—even folklore, arts, and crafts.” It took her 10 years to bring this vision to life, complete with state-of-the-art performance spaces and visual arts galleries that have since hosted everything from the Broadway musicalsMamma Mia!andThe Phantom of the Operato kathak performances and Bengali concerts, and visual arts venues with installations by the likes ofYayoi Kusama,Andy Warhol, and Dan Flavin. Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant celebrate their engagement ceremony on January 19, 2023 in Mumbai, India Ambani has been busy since debuting NMACC—who can forget the months-long$600 million extravaganzashe hosted forher sonAnant’s nuptials toRadhika Merchantlast year, with its blinding array of jewels and couture and its constellation of global megastars? And she was in New York last month working to bring a taste of NMACC stateside this fall. From September 12 through 14, the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre Weekend in New York City will take over Lincoln Center with three days of dance, music, fashion, and more. “We want to look at how we can place Indian arts and artists at the front and center of the world’s creative imagination, and there’s no better place than Lincoln Center,” she said. “Culture binds people together; it builds empathy; it teaches you to respect differences, respect other cultures. I feel at this moment the world needs it more than ever before.” Events will kick off with Grand Swagat, an invite-only welcome gala with a fashion show for Ambani’s handloom emporium, Swadesh, curated bycelebrated designerManish Malhotra—who himself recentlymade his Met Gala red-carpet debut—and cuisine by chefVikas Khanna,who helms the East Village sensation Bungalow (scoring a reservation there might be even harder than landing an invite to the Grand Swagat). “NMACC is doing such an amazing job of making people understand India, and with her platform and her vision to bring India to the world, it’s absolutely an honor just to be a part of this,” Khanna said. His menu, currently a work in progress, is shaping up to be a deep dive into flavors from across India. “The amount of research I did, I can easily get another PhD for that,” he added with a laugh. Aside from concerts by Bollywood singersShankar MahadevanandShreya Ghoshaland classical musicianRishab Sharma,Ambani is also bringingThe Great Indian Musical: Civilization to Nation, to Lincoln Center for five performances. First mounted by directorFeroz Abbas Khanfor the NMACC opening, the lavish production recounts nearly 7,000 years of Indian history with more than 100 performers, maximalist sets, and costumes by Malhotra. Shankar Mahadevan performs at Meridian Hall on July 20, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario. As she thought through the programming, Ambani had one question in mind: “How do you democratize and bring it to people and let everybody enjoy it?” she asked. All weekend long, Lincoln Square’s Damrosch Park will be transformed into a grand bazaar, with daily yoga sessions with wellness expertEddie Stern,a panel discussion on cricket, and Bollywood dance workshops with famed choreographerShiamak Davar,alongside a Swadesh pop-up selling Indian fashion and handicrafts. Artisans are being flown in from India to showcase their work. “We are going to welcome as many people as can fit in the space,” she said. The full lineup for the fall festivities is still being finalized, but excitement is building. “I’m really looking forward to bringing a slice of India and India’s 5,000 years of storytelling,” said Ambani. “We told our stories from our soul.” She also let slip a secret about her plans for the opening festivities: “I’m going to dance on the first night.” From the temple where she performed her arangetram to Lincoln Center, the stages have only gotten grander and grander. Tickets forthe NMACC Weekendin New York City will be on sale at the end of June. Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "College Dropout Wally Baram Takes Campus by Storm in 'Overcompensating'",
    "article_text": "As a child,OvercompensatingstarWally Baramdidn’t dream of becoming an actor. “I had this lark that I wanted to be a cowgirl,” she tellsVanity Fairover Zoom. So, Baram did what anyone with dreams of cattle driving would do: “I went to this school in Ojai where you got a great education and also learned Western equestrianism.” Unfortunately, biology prevented Baram from becoming the next Annie Oakley. “I am five one. My feet don’t even curve around a horse,” she says. “The horse looks like it’s wearing me as a hat.” Thank goodness for that. Now the 27-year-old writer and comedian has found her calling starring as Carmen, an awkward freshman at the fictional Yates University, in Prime Video’sOvercompensating.Even before the series from internet content creator turned TV starBenito Skinnerpremiered on May 15,Overcompensatingwas getting awards attention—it’s already earned Gotham TV Awards nominations for best breakthrough comedy series and best lead performance in a comedy, for Skinner. Baram can hardly believe the warm reception. “There are so many different ways for an online creator to then make a show and not get the flowers…so many different ways in which I think his work and his art and his skill could be trivialized,” she says of Skinner. “I really hope he just gets seen for everything that he is, because I’m constantly in awe of that guy.” Before signing on forOvercompensating,Baram had never met Skinner—unlike other series regulars likeMary Beth Barone,who plays Skinner’s deadpan older sister, Grace, and cohosts the hit comedy podcastRidewith him in real life. She also had to overcome another, slightly larger obstacle: “I had never acted on camera before getting cast as the colead inOvercompensating.” She did, however, have performing experience. After ditching her cowgirl dreams in high school, Baram decided to take a gap year and went all in on stand-up comedy. She pored over books by comedians likeAmy Poehler, Tina Fey,andMindy Kaling,and stalked more of her favorite comedy voices online. “I used to have a joke about it when I was 19, part of the punchline was like, ‘I spend my afternoons googling whereJason Sudeikiswent to college,’” Baram says. “I studied them, and I had the resources to study, fortunately.” But after making headway in the Los Angeles comedy community, she moved to New York to start her freshman year at Barnard. It didn’t stick. “I was like, Nah, this is not the vibe,” she says. “I had this experience in comedy that I felt like I had found my people, and then I was supposed to recreate it…I didn’t even give myself the chance. I walked in with my walls up, for sure.” So after a year, she dropped out and returned to LA to do comedy full time. Baram slowly worked her way up the ladder—booking the coveted comedy festival Just for Laughs, performing a set onThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,and joining the writers room on shows likeWhat We Do in the ShadowsandShrinking.Eventually, the pilot forOvercompensatingcame across her desk—and, ironically, dropping out of college gave Baram a fresh perspective for a comedy about campus life. “When I was at college and I wasn’t having the fun that everyone else was having, I was at least very observant,” she says. “I think I was able to bring a lot of that college intel in the room.” At first, she was hired as a writer, working collectively to create a fictional vision of the millennial college experience. “Everyone was just like, ‘Oh my God, the bandage skirts that the girls would wear. Carmen has to wear a bandage skirt,’” Baram says. “It was really the era in which we didn’t quite know how cool a DJ was not going to be.” Even then, Baram felt a strange connection to the character of Carmen. “I read the character’s description, and it just felt like me,” she says. “This curly-, frizzy-haired girl from New Jersey who’s awkward and can’t seem to do the same social sparring that people do to establish themselves in a community. She wants to be a part of something so badly. So much of my life was overcompensating romantically—not even successfully. I just wanted to be loved.” Baram also had something more tragic in common with Carmen. The character has lost her brother in a car accident, and is still processing the grief; just as Baram started working on the series, one of her own best friends died. “I spent a lot of the room just trying to show up and give them as much as I could, and a lot of what I could was from personal experience,” she says. “I was able to give a lot to Carmen and I was also having this experience of grief, so I was also able to speak from that perspective.” So when it came time to cast the role, Baram decided to send in a tape. Her expectations were low: “There were thousands of people that auditioned for Carmen and I knew that was going to be the case going in.” Booking the role felt “unthinkable.” Yet she was brought in again and again, until she found herself doing chemistry reads with her boss, Skinner. “We did a chemistry read where Benny said, ‘I really feel like it’s you,’” Baram says. Still, her experience prepared her for disappointment. “I think I’ve had seven-plus years in the industry at this point, at a high level. I’ve had the experience of watching people get to that point and then not get it,” she says. “I understand very much in TV it’s not over until it’s over.” Then Baram won the role. Acting on camera for the first time “felt like a StairMaster,” she says. “The second you learn one thing and it’s comfortable, you’re learning the next.” Coming from stand-up, Baram struggled not to look down the barrel of the camera when delivering her lines—a no-no in the world of on-camera acting. She also had to weather awkward silences. “There’s no one laughing at your jokes,” Baram says. “The first time no one laughed at my joke, I was like, ‘I bombed. It’s terrible. I’ll pack my bag and go back to Los Angeles.’” While the learning curve was steep, Baram can now confidently say that she’s the colead of a buzzy, certified-fresh comedy series. But success hasn’t changed her too much: Though she’s a television actor and not a cowgirl, Baram still loves the great outdoors. “I’m a weird egg. I have a pet snake. My favorite activity is fishing,” she says. “I have some eccentricities to me that are maybe confusing.” That makes her success inOvercompensatingall the sweeter. “No one had ever taken a chance on me and seen me,” she says. “Benny’s seen me and celebrated me, and it’s meant the world.” Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Syria, After the Fall of Assad, Reawakens From Its Half-Century Nightmare",
    "article_text": "The long and brutal reign of the Assad regime finally ended in December with a stunning two-week revolt. A coalition of insurgent factions, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), swept across Syria, taking city after city, largely unopposed. As the capital, Damascus, was about to fall, the dictatorBashar al-Assadfled the nation he had held captive to terror for so long. He was granted refuge by Russia’sVladimir Putin, his longtime protector. Overnight, the Syrian people emerged from decades of darkness with a profound collective trauma. For more than half a century, they had been forbidden to speak, protest, or engage in any meaningful activity against the state—ever since 1971, when Bashar’s father, Hafez, came to power. Suddenly, everyone found themselves in a new world led by rebels who were ideologues but hardly civil servants or technocrats. HTS had no experience running a country, let alone one gutted by war and on the verge of economic meltdown. Syrians shared tears, nightmares, and harrowing details of what was never meant to be spoken aloud. And yet, on a recent trip through the country, I found Syrians, one after another, expressing a sense of hope. I found Syrians—despite an inventory of despair and their current wariness toward the new, untested authorities—finding their voices, able to speak about the years of silence and secrets. In this fragile postwar place, peace is not yet a given. Most aspects of life feel uncertain. And not unlike those tenuous months in 2003—afterSaddam Hussein was overthrownin neighboring Iraq—the cycles of vengeance have begun to flare. In early March, just two days after my visit,violence erupted. Loyalist members of the Alawite sect, who controlled the country under Assad, battled militias that may or may not have been tied to the new government. More than 800 civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, were killed in two days of slaughter in the coastal Alawite stronghold of Latakia. Other killings occurred as well, targeting Sunni Muslims. By spring, further attacks were anticipated and Americans were advised to leave the country. I’ve seen too much of this kind of bloodshed in the many years I’ve chronicled the plight of the Syrian people.I reported on the countryduring the revolution and the war; published two books about Syria, largely on the human rights infractions under the Assads; and interviewed more than a hundred of its victims. Most of my field missions occurred in 2012 (as the country devolved into civil war andISIS began to dig in there)on the regime-held side of the country. I was granted visas to work; then, after reporting on a massacre by government troops in Daraya, I was told by sources in the government not to return, “or we’ll find a nice cell for you in Sednaya,” the Assads’ infamous prison. After that, between 2012 and 2015, I crossed the border from Turkey to the stronghold of the Free Syrian Army, largely working in Aleppo until radical groups such as ISIS made it too dangerous to operate due to threats of kidnapping. Then, in December, I was awakened early by a Syrian friend in tears who told me the news: Assad had been overthrown.As I wrote,at the time, inVanity Fair:“In an extraordinary turn of events, reminiscent of the fall of the Ceauşescus in Romania in December 1989 and the Taliban in November 2001, history pivoted. In the words of Syria’s foreign minister: ‘A new page is being written in the history of Syria.’ ” And so I went back for the first time in a decade. In late winter, with snow still on the mountains, I crossed the border from Lebanon into Syria. The cheerful man at passport control smiled and said, “You have not been in Damascus since 2012. I understand why.” This was code, meaning that my name was on a list. He verified what I already knew: Had I crossed this same border in earlier days, I would have been imprisoned, or worse. Later, I asked the Alawite driver accompanying me—a man who had worked for the regime by listening in on people’s telephone calls—if he could find out which branch of the secret service had wanted me. “Better not to know,” he said. The new Syria I encountered during my week there, while precarious, was a land whose citizens sensed promise and possibility—and the belief that a heavy weight had been lifted. Even so, burdens remained in place. No matter where I went, Syrians shared memories and nightmares and tears, freely revealing what had happened in those shrouded years, telling a stranger the harrowing details of what was never meant to be spoken aloud. In the Assad time, the harshest forms of punishment were doled out to those who were the most resistant. Those who did not bow or kneel—to Hafez al-Assad, and then to his son, Bashar—were punished in the most horrific ways. In the old days, when you drove the road from Lebanon to Syria—I imagine the same road Saint Paul took nearly 2,000 years ago—the first sights you saw were enormous posters of Bashar, with his odd, triangular face. It was an Orwellian reminder that Syria was condemned to one-man rule, that obedience was part of the social contract. Now those posters are gone, the roads clear. The era of the new Syria has begun. I wanted to return to the places I had worked during those years of war and resistance, and one of those locales was Daraya, a once-pleasant suburb five miles southwest of Damascus that had endured Bashar’s lash harder than most. Daraya had been known for producing grapes—and, incongruously, outdoor plastic furniture, the kind Syrians use in their gardens in the humid summer months. In 2011, government troops swept in. Peace activists carried roses and bottles of water with handwritten notes: “We are your brothers. Don’t kill us.” The city had a largely Sunni Muslim population of some 200,000. For years, they coexisted peacefully with the Christian minority. Wealthy Damascenes kept summer villas there, with swimming pools and lush vegetation. But the regime feared Daraya. The town was also known for its history of nonviolent values, stretching back to the 1990s, when an open-minded Koran teacher, Sheik Abdul-akram Sika, taught his followers the words that Abel, the first son of Adam, whispered to Cain, his brother: “Though you stretch your hand to kill me, I do not stretch my hand to kill you.” In 1998 a teenage science student, Yahya Shurbaji, began to attend the sheik’s study groups. The sessions dealt with conservative Islam but were far from radical. Shurbaji, like most Syrians who were not granted the privileges afforded their Alawite counterparts, was fed up with the flagging economy, state corruption, and lack of opportunity. He was inspired by the sheik’s teachings that nonviolent action can affect social change. After Shurbaji and his peers formed the Daraya Youth Group, preaching quiet civil resistance, their clique came to the attention of the authorities, who banned them from the mosque. Instead, they held their meetings outside, sitting in the freezing cold. One of their most successful projects, a so-called secret library of some 15,000 books, was swiftly shut down by state police. Though imprisoned for two years in the early 2000s, Shurbaji, upon his release, continued to fight Assad’s repression. When the Arab Spring arrived in Syria in March 2011, he and his colleagues carried bottles of water and roses to government forces who’d been sent to put down the protesters. On the bottles, they attached handwritten notes: “We are your brothers. Don’t kill us. The nation is big enough for all of us.” It was inevitable that the dreaded Air Force Security Branch of the secret police would come for him. That September, Shurbaji; his brother, Ma’an; and another activist, Giyath Matar, were sent into the bowels of Sednaya, a military prison and death camp also known as the Human Slaughterhouse. In its dark cells, men and women were tortured, raped, starved, and broken. Many never reemerged. Ma’an’s mutilated remains came home four days later. Shurbaji’s body was never found. Other Daraya activists continued their work. The more they peacefully protested, the more Assad’s helicopters, tanks, and soldiers obliterated the town. In August 2012, while working in Damascus, I heard a rumor of a massacre in Daraya.I set off and managed to slip inwith a local family. We smelled death before we saw it: the terrible stench of corpses in the sun. Bodies were strewn throughout the town, their limbs in unnatural positions. Bodies piled up in cellars. There were bloodstains on the walls of buildings, where terrified residents told me they had seen soldiers line people up and execute them, their heads exploding. The bereaved wandered in shock, trying to locate missing relatives. Upon glimpsing an open mass grave near a mosque, we were turned back by Assad’s soldiers. But I saw bodies lying out in the sun, and I smelled rotten flesh. For several hours, I took testimonies from survivors before we were ordered to leave. Within days, state troops arrived, cleaned up the horror, and denied anything had happened. In Syria’s killing fields, the first casualty is the truth. Ultimately, it came out that the massacre had claimed some 700 residents. Many more had died from mass starvation: The government burned the wheat crops and barred food deliveries, forcing people to resort to making soup from leaves and grass. One friend wrote to me that his daily sustenance was a radish and some salt. The famished inhabitants, their will shattered, finally succumbed; the Free Army of Daraya brokered a deal so that the fighters and residents could flee to safety in rebel-held Idlib in the north or to Dar’aa in the south. And then, last December, after Assad’s forces collapsed following the rebels’ offensive, people by the score began to limp back to their houses and markets and government buildings. Upon their return, they found a destroyed but free Daraya. In late February—with the same family that had taken me into the heart of the massacre site nearly 13 years before—​I drove back to Daraya. Residents were returning from exile in Idlib. (In recent years, some 12 million Syrians had been internally displaced or sought refuge abroad.) Now there were no checkpoints to pass through, but the town was gutted: fields of rubble, concrete buildings that looked as though they’d melted, half-decimated apartments where people had taken up residence once again, airing carpets out the windows. As I walked through the hollowed-out shadow of the suburb, I understood that despite the devastation, Daraya, once a bastion of peaceful protest, still had a resonance. Amid the cratered scene, I felt the simple, human belief in peace and home and perhaps, for many of the people, a new life. Today, the stories of the government’s purge are legion here. “No one stayed behind—it was a ghost town,” explainedMohamed Holani, the 32-year-old who is presently in charge of the “security administration” in Daraya. But that was quickly changing. As winter was winding down, dusty shops were active again. Storekeepers sold shriveled parsnips, apples, cabbages, bags of oranges. Everything was exorbitantly expensive. By the side of the road, people sold green plastic jugs of petrol from Lebanon that they had brought over the border to offer to the locals at double or triple the price. Even so, in the midst of the destruction, flags flew on low-hanging electrical wires displaying the new Syrian “independence” design—a horizontal tricolor of green, white, and black with three five-pointed stars, resurrected from the pre-Ba’athist days when Syria was freed from France. A man with an old-fashioned loudspeaker shouted in a tinny voice that he was buying old refrigerators. By the mosque, where the worst crimes had happened during the massacre, was a dusty field. This is where I had stood years ago, trying to discern the open graves. Holani andHussam Latham, a young activist who accompanied us, showed me how the massacre victims were finally laid to rest in the field. When the government troops had come in August 2012, he said, “they took everyone out of the buildings, separated men from women, and depending on their mood, they would either kill them or let them go. They took entire families. One family lost 40 extended members.” After the massacre, simple wooden headstones had been initially placed on their graves, the two men recounted, but when the townspeople fled in 2016, they removed the grave markers. “This is because we thought the shabiha [Assad’s militias] would disrespect the dead,” Holani explained. But before departing, the residents had “recorded the position of each body and had GPS locations.” Holani confided that he lost his brother and other relatives. “Now that I am home,” he said with conviction, “I can finally visit my brother’s grave.” All these years later, I wondered aloud, it seemed ironic that the regime had targeted Daraya—a city whose activists’ methods had been peaceful and nonconfrontational. “It was because we were seen as the resistance, but also because we were close to the military airport,” Latham insisted. “They feared our rebellion would spread there, then to Damascus”—a short distance away. We walked back to the main security office, an empty building with one heated room, where we sat drinking coffee. I asked how it could be that so many people I came across spoke so openly, without any remnant of fear. In Iraq, I remembered, it had taken people years to shed their Saddam-era silence. Holani was thoughtful. He said the activists were never actually silent under Assad; instead, they often took enormous risks, knowing they could be imprisoned, tortured, or killed. “You have to understand,” Holani said. “In Daraya, injustice was haram. We were taught to rise up and fight against injustice. Even in 2011, we had to speak. “Now we have the first flower of freedom, but it’s just the beginning.” I spent some time in the capital pricing ordinary things—milk, meat, fruit, cigarettes—to try to understand how ordinary people survived and fed their families. Many in the international community had seen the sanctions against Syria as leverage to get the new government to do what it wants; Syria had been one of the most comprehensively sanctioned nations in the world. That may finally change. In May, at the urging of the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, PresidentDonald Trumpmet with the country’s new president,Ahmed al-Shara, a former jihadist who had led al-Qaida’s faction in Syria. Within days, the US as well as nations in the Arab League and the EU vowed to lift sanctions. But as I walked the streets, it was all too evident that the economy was a complete wreck. It had contracted 85 percent during the war, which had sparked hyperinflation. Now only 10 percent of Syrians live above the poverty line. Here and there in the city I saw people carrying stacks of currency in plastic bags to buy groceries or even go out for a simple coffee. The notes are worth virtually nothing. At ATMs people lined up for hours, toting books to read while they waited. I found many people disgruntled, bordering on furious. “This note used to be worth about $10 when I was a student,” saidRaji,a Syrian Lebanese friend who accompanied me on the trip. “Now it’s worth 10 cents.” People are skilled at counting vast piles of money quickly. “It’s how we live,” my friendRaudashrugged as she fanned through a stack of bills to pay for a streetside sandwich. One springlike morning, I visited the monastery of Saint Takla in the ancient village of Maaloula, a longtime Christian bulwark. I was startled at how impoverished people had become since my last visit. In Maaloula,Sister Maria—whom I hadn’t seen since 2012 and who had been kidnapped at one point by extremist groups—spoke without hesitation or restraint. Her concerns were less with the past, including her own personal trauma, than with the future. “Our biggest problem right now in Syria is money,” she stressed. “Without money, you can’t buy food. We are running out of everything.” Elsewhere, as in Ghouta province to the southwest, I had seen people begging in the streets as well as children scrounging for food. And yet in Damascus, despite all the deprivations, on a Thursday night—the first night of the weekend—the popular steak restaurant at the Hotel Chams Palace was packed with young Damascenes wearing Veja designer sneakers and Supreme hoodies. These were not Western visitors, but local 20- and 30-somethings drinking Lebanese wine and eating Wagyu steak flamed with a blowtorch. Somewhere, somehow, someone is making money from misery. In the most curious sign of all, I visited a friend’s beauty salon on a Thursday afternoon to see how women were preparing for the weekend. The salon was in an affluent section of Damascus, and young women flocked there not just for blowouts and manicures but for Botox. A doctor in designer jeans wielding a syringe went from chair to chair, injecting young Syrian girls in their foreheads and cheeks. Regardless of the pricey meals and cosmetic toxins, I felt a slight undercurrent of menace that, in its way, was a throwback to the Assad days because of the skyrocketing costs of everyday staples, and because when the prisons were emptied, criminals had been released along with political prisoners. We were advised, for instance, not to drive at night on the highway from Hama to Damascus. There were existential threats as well. During my visit, Israel, Syria’s nemesis to the south, launched its first major air strikes after a long lull, killing two soldiers. The Israeli Defense Forces crept further into Syrian territory, moving additional troops into the buffer zone between Syria and the Golan Heights and taking control of areas beyond that perimeter, including Mount Hermon. My hotel was in the beautiful Old City of Damascus. It is believed to be civilization’s longest continually inhabited city, dating to at least 8000 BC, and you feel the weight of history when you walk through the ancient streets, through the Christian quarter near Bab Touma, through the quarter where they sell dusty rugs and copper coffee pots; and my favorite street, where you can buy glass oil lamps and used vinyl singles—45s—from the 1960s. Late one night from my room, I could hear distant bombing, which reminded me of the war days when I would rush to my balcony to see plumes of black smoke rising over the outskirts of town. The next morning at breakfast, the waiter served me pita, olives, hummus, and coffee and told me that Israeli forces had bombed a military installation not far from the center of the city. Their supposed target: leftover weapons stockpiles. A Syrian friend angrily railed. Israel, he said, was trying to force a confrontation with the HTS administration, which did not have the capacity to resist—part of an attempt, he theorized, to destabilize the fledgling government. Certainly, the presence of Israel was ubiquitous. The entire time I was in Syria, I received creepy text messages in Hebrew and English welcoming me to “Israeli air space.” Some of my Lebanese colleagues—well-versed in Israeli tactics from thedeadly 2024 cellular attackson Hezbollah’s leadership—told me they got such alerts all the time, describing them as “psyops” intended to intimidate cell phone users. On one of my first days in Syria, the government hosted a “national dialogue” conference in the newly named People’s Palace in Damascus (formerly a hulking edifice for old-guard officials and bureaucrats)—a first step toward creating a new constitution. It was yet another sign that the Assads had been consigned to history. More than 900 delegates had arrived from abroad and across the country to attend workshops centered on the most crucial issues: freedom of expression and human rights, the economy, transitional justice, civil society. Meanwhile, the authorities (Al-Shara, the interim president, addressed the assembled) were trying to work with the EU and the US to lift crippling sanctions, which had been levied against a regime that no longer existed. A few days later, another gathering was held for various civil society organizations responsible for human rights and accountability. The top priority on the agenda was the estimated 150,000 people whose whereabouts remain unknown. In the Assad days, secret police would arrive in the morning and people would disappear. (I titled my first book on SyriaThe Morning They Came for Usbecause many survivors I spoke with referred to their lives as being cleaved in two: before the police came, and after.) Just as critical will be the excavation of mass graves. In places likeHama, where in 1982 an untold number of people were killedby Hafez al-Assad’s forces, the makeshift pits were long ago covered over with concrete—the regime approving permits for hotels and other properties to be deliberately built atop the graves. The detainees emerging from the cells and dungeons of Sednaya and Palmyra (where political prisoners were sent in the 1980s and 1990s) were also struggling, readjusting. So were their families, and friends of those who vanished without a trace. According to the Association of Detainees and Missing Persons of Sednaya Prison, it is estimated that at least 30,000 people have been executed there since the beginning of the war in 2011. Syrian civil society had been particularly defiant, even during the worst days of Assad, by systematically and courageously monitoring human rights abuses. And representatives from those organizations were on hand to participate in the human rights conclave. The conference had been widely touted as an opportunity to begin drafting a plan for best practices moving forward. And at the last minute, without any advance warning or clear explanation, it was canceled, apparently by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates, which had nothing to do with the event. Angry representatives roamed the Sheraton Hotel lobby—a former Assad government stronghold now frequented by the HTS—and fumed. “This is the kind of thing the old government did,” one delegate said. In the end it seemed to have been a simple communications glitch. I was informed that the hotel, still under the shadow of the previous regime, panicked that there had been no proper government consent for the event to take place and shelved it. The cancellation left people angry and worried: Were the incoming authorities, like their predecessors, wary of outside bodies serious about tracking their human rights policies? The next day, I drove to Homs with Raji, who had spent his childhood summers in Syria with his relatives. Much of Homs, Syria’s third-largest city, had been reduced to ruin during the war. Half of Homs is now a wasteland. In 2019 the UN did a damage assessment: More than 13,000 buildings had been bombed. This has prevented many of the city’s 6 million refugees and displaced from coming back. In many ways Homs served as a microcosm of Syria itself—a vibrant mix of Sunni, Shia, Alawite, and Christian who lived side by side for centuries. During the war I had a surreal experience. I’d received permission to report alongside the Syrian Arab Army, Assad’s men, who were besieging the Free Syrian Army inside Homs. Although I felt I was on the wrong side of the conflict (the current-day equivalent of embedding with the Russian military in its campaign against Ukraine), it was an opportunity to understand the mindset of the Alawites and those aligned with Assad. For days, I crawled through “mouse holes” in devastated buildings with testosterone-fueled soldiers chanting: “With my blood! With my soul! For Bashar!” and “God! Syria! Bashar is enough!” These troops had a kind of missionary zeal and almost primal fervor. Fighting the rebels meant taking one building at a time while government snipers picked off anyone who walked the streets. Even so, I witnessed small miracles upon my return to Homs. The displaced had begun to return. Those who had stayed and survived, many of them barely, were now reclaiming a city that was coming back to life. At lunchtime at La Maison Dorée Café, the tables were full of men and women smoking shisha and drinking fresh juices. I metOmar, 64 (whose name I have changed for his safety). Clean-shaven, sunburned, and wearing a white sweater against the chill, he calmly ate a plate of lamb, pita, and tahini while quietly recounting the 15 years of his life that were lost in one of Assad’s prisons. Starting in the late 1970s, Syria’s Muslim Brotherhood posed a major religious and political threat to the Assad clan. In the brotherhood’s view, Assad was an “enemy of Allah,” and its adherents launched a series of protests, bombings, and armed revolts. In November 1980 Omar—then in his teens—started attending a Koran study group in the 10th grade, regarding it as more of a social activity than a radical religious endeavor. Even so, others in the mosque sessions felt stifled by the regime and viewed the reading groups as an ideological pathway. For his part, Omar told me, he hadn’t counted on the consequences of joining in. “All it took for them to arrest you was having contact with someone in the brotherhood,” he remembered. In 1982 he was a first-year engineering student at the university when the police came for him in the middle of the night. He said goodbye to his parents and siblings, not knowing why he was being taken away. He was sentenced in one of the so-called “on the spot courts” in which a bored judge served as prosecutor and jurist. “It was a one-minute sentencing,” Omar said. He would spend almost the next decade and a half in prison. He told me he was beaten with whips and wooden clubs, tortured, and sexually abused. One method of torture was slamming someone between doors to break their bones. He never thought he would be released. “We were tortured every single day,” he insisted. “It was just part of our day. Instead of a life sentence, we got tortured.” The whip that he was beaten with, he told me, was made from airplane tires, thick and lacerating when it lashed his skin. Another form of torture was to place men inside tires so they could not move and beat them until they passed out. “I only saw my mother five times in 15 years,” he said. “It was only good luck that I saw her.” His mother was a telephone operator who would handle people’s calls through a switchboard, connecting one user to another through a central network of cords and plugs. One day she happened to connect a call placed by the mother of the prison warden. Realizing who she was, Omar’s mother begged the woman to intervene and allow her to see her son. Taking pity on her, the warden’s mother arranged for a visit; other visits followed. Most detainees never saw family members the entire time of their incarceration. (Omar was ultimately released in March 1995 by agreeing to collaborate with the authorities once he was on the outside—though, he told me, he never was asked to do so.) Beyond the torture and the heartbreak, the supreme sacrifice he made was the life that was stolen from him. Unable to resume his engineering studies, he reintegrated into life and became a salesman, peddling medicine door-to-door. It took him years, however, to go to an Alawite area or pass a checkpoint without his heart catching in his throat. “They took 15 years of my life and my dream to be an engineer,” he said. “Instead, I ended up a small worker.” In the noisy café Omar spoke freely and vividly about his years in prison. And yet, he admitted, “I keep looking nervously for the police.” He still cannot fathom that Assad and his minions are gone—or that they won’t come back. A while later Raji and I ventured to a leafy, more upscale part of Homs. I climbed the stairs to an elegant, sprawling apartment where I had sought shelter during a very tense period of the war. At the time, I had been given a bed. But one night, two of the family members became terrified that the shabiha would find a foreigner under their roof and punish the entire household. Not wanting to bring them harm, I arranged for a new place to stay, packed my things and, dangerously past curfew, ran down the street under cover of night, praying I wouldn’t be shot by a sniper. The family’s fear ran deep. And their concerns were not unwarranted. The man who had asked me to leave was later found dead—his corpse identified in one of the tens of thousands of pictures of Assad’s torture and murder victims, photographed with gruesome and painstaking deliberation by acamera unit hired by the regime—not unlike the death camp images made by the Khmer Rouge. But now I was in postwar Homs—in that old apartment. We had tea and sweet cakes in the freezing cold (there was no electricity) whileIssam Safardi, my 90-year-old host, told me about the pain of having her son,Hasan, then a young student in Aleppo, imprisoned in 1982 during the Muslim Brotherhood raids. “I asked if he was part of the brotherhood,” she recalled. “He said he was never a member. ‘Mom, I just pray,’ he told me.” But being at a lakeside summer camp on the border with Turkey—which supported the radicals—was enough evidence, and Hasan, like Omar, was incarcerated for 15 years. “As a mother,” she said, “you can’t imagine how difficult it was having your child taken. But I was lucky. I have a friend who had three sons taken, and two died in prison.” What Safardi remembered most from those years was sitting in a chair outside the Military Intelligence Branch in Homs virtually every day for 15 years, begging for news of Hasan. “Eventually, the head of the branch got tired of seeing me. He said, ‘I keep seeing that old lady in my dreams.’ ” When Hasan eventually came home, Safardi said: “I could never ask him what happened. If someone asks him and he begins to talk, I leave the room.” Still, in some ways, Hasan partially recovered: He got married, had two children, and found work in a cosmetics shop, in which he takes great pride. My final visit in Homs was with a cheerful 38-year-old shop owner,Mustafa(not his real name), a descendant of a former government official during the French mandate. He was kept in Sednaya for seven years for what he calls “a misconception.” “I thought I had freedom of speech,” he said. “I saw young people in Singapore, in Qatar, and other places getting their freedom. So I did the same.” One day the police from the Far’Falestine Palestine Branch of Military Intelligence—the most notoriously brutal division—came for him. He was 20, also an engineering student. The judge asked him, “Do you want the regime to fall?” He replied: “No, but I want freedom.” Mustafa was given 20 years. “The entire process of sentencing me,” he recalled, “took two minutes.” Mustafa was kept underground in the worst part of Sednaya—the so-called Red Division—for a year. The cell, he told me, was the size of a coffin. He was fed once a day. To eat, he had to put his hand through a hole in the door and the guard would first beat the hand with a wooden club, then pour out some food—a spoonful of yogurt, four olives, a small piece of bread—into it. The hand beating was designed to break bones, though today he has no signs of disfigurement. It was so painful, he said, that sometimes, despite being desperately hungry, he would insist, “I don’t want to eat today.” A burly man who had been a bodybuilder as a student, he had lost 88 pounds by the time he got out. In Clock Square, in Homs, people were crying, holding one another. The Assads were no more. “I cried again,” one former political prisoner told me. “Tears of happiness.” Mustafa would cry all the time: for his family, who he knew were suffering; because of the pain of his daily punishments; and out of sheer loneliness and extreme isolation. He said he never knew those who were in the neighboring cells. “I heard only screams.” One year there was a guard from Dar’aa who was somewhat kind: One day he gave him two slices of bread instead of one. “He made me swear I would never tell anyone or he’d end up in jail with me.” In hell, one extra slice—a year—amounted to generosity. Today, Mustafa is remarkably cheerful for someone who lost more than a decade to the whims of a Syrian judge in a heinous penal system. “It’s like my life stopped,” he said. “Like I was put in a coffin and it was locked.” Then his eyes grew moist. “How did I stay sane? I knew I was innocent. My brain kept working. But my personality became that of a frightened person…. I had lost the best years of my life.” The day he was released, in 2014, a general came to the facility and let all the prisoners free. “He pointed randomly—you, you, you, you are released.” Remembering that day, Mustafa let himself cry. “It was like being a baby placed on a mother’s breast. I was a newborn.” He and some fellow inmates were simply put on a bus and dropped in the center of Homs. Upon exiting the bus, he noticed he was in front of a café. Its name was painted on a sign above the door: Virgin. Eleven years after his release, he still finds the cruelty of Assad’s prisons unbearable to think about. “Human beings were imprisoned for saying something against the president. And then you die for that?” Last December 8—the day Assad was overthrown—Mustafa went to work in his cosmetics shop, full of imported beauty products, and noticed that across the street at a military installation, the soldiers had run away and left their weapons. It could not be possible, he thought, that the regime had fallen. Or could it? Along with his wife, his mother, and two children, they made their way to Clock Square, in the center of Homs, where it seemed the entire city had gathered. People were crying, holding one another. And there they heard that the Assads were no more. “I cried again,” he said. “But these were different tears than Sednaya. These were tears of happiness.” The Damascus neighborhoods that were pounded the hardest are attempting to rebuild. This manifests itself not just in the widespread reconstruction efforts, but in the attempts to find the dead. Tadamon is a section in the north of town. The cityscape is completely wiped out, as though a nuclear bomb hit it. Buildings seem suspended in mid-collapse, caught in a freeze-frame from some apocalyptic movie. In Tadamon I met a group of masked men—Al-Mulathameen—who said they had also come from Idlib. It was dusk, and an amber light descended on the vacant lots around us. The men said they were with HTS, the new government. They claimed to have been assigned to locate the many mass graves that held the bodies of residents killed in a notorious massacre in April 2013. Behind a garbage dump, one of the HTS conscripts, who identified himself by his nom de guerre,Abu Jibreal, stood on a mound of earth. “There are bodies beneath me,” he remarked, describing how the cellars and water wells throughout the area were stuffed with bodies. “The guy from the shabiha who gave the command to kill here was basically a mass murderer.” He explained that on the day of the killings, a pit was dug and then 41 people, who had been shot at point-blank range near the mosque, were tossed inside, along with burning tires. He told us that the perpetrators, from Branch 227 of Military Intelligence, had also filmed the murders. Indeed, Human Rights Watch confirmed his account: The regime had trained its forces on Tadamon, conducting arbitrary arrests, then starting a campaign of indiscriminate attacks, summary killings, and mass starvation. A month before my arrival, the incoming Syrian security forces had arrested three former officers on charges of having participated in the massacre. I tracked down a local journalist and asked him to spell out why Tadamon in 2013, like Daraya in 2012, had been the object of such barbarity and vengeance. In his view, a prejudice and distrust toward Palestinians had played a role. The town was home to a large refugee population from the territories. The regime, fearful of an uprising there, had singled them out for punishment. (Before the civil war, approximately half a million Palestinians, mainly of refugee status, resided in Syria.) Abu Jibreal, who implied that he himself was Palestinian, went on: “The Alawites and Druze lived in the outer ring around us. Basically, they looked at us as inhuman.” By 2018 the local people made a deal with the regime, just as the Daraya survivors had. They would halt their resistance, agree to surrender their weapons, and retreat to Idlib. “They said they would give us amnesty,” Abu Jibreal told me. “Instead, many people were sent directly to Sednaya.” There is talk of a formal investigation of the massacre site. In the meantime, according to Abu Jibreal and his companions, the HTS team is treating the area as a “corpse dumpster, a mass graveyard.” “What happened here?” I asked him. “They tried to erase us,” he said. On a warm Saturday morning—the first day of the holy month of Ramadan—we drove to eastern Ghouta, a southwestern province, passing buildings that resembled carcasses of steel and concrete. To snuff out dissent, the Assads, like Saddam Hussein’s assault on Kurdish civilians in Iraq, had used their arsenal of chemical weapons against their own people. During the revolution, an estimated 300 chemical bombardments had rained down on Ghouta, according to the Berlin-based Global Public Policy Institute, which in 2019 released a study on the atrocities, which had gone on for at least six years. Our aim was to meet with some survivors of these attacks. Choking to death from sarin or chlorine is one of the cruelest ways to die. In 2016 I assisted a young survivor of the attacks,Kassem Eid, as he was writing his own accounts in his book,My Country.Eid’s heart had stopped from the gas. He was revived. Then he went on to fight with the rebels, having never carried a gun before. But the memory of dying—and then being revived—haunted him for years. Near the city of Douma, I met with three gas survivors:Mohamed Swadanas well asYeyeandNaser, who, out of caution, only provided their first names. From the moment I began interacting with Naser, I could sense his deep despair. He was unable to make eye contact, shook when he held his coffee cup, and sat inertly, struggling to find words. He said he had nightmares and trouble sleeping. In time, he would tell me he was suffering from severe depression. In the homes and cafés of Syria, it doesn’t escape a single soul that tonight Bashar al-Assad is sleeping comfortably in the land of Vladimir Putin. According to a comprehensive report by the French government—based on photographs, testimonies, and video documentation—analysts concluded that a series of attacks in and around Ghouta were likely conducted by the Assad regime, and that several lethal attacks took place on one day—April 7, 2018—prompting US, UK, and French warplanes to respond against Syrian facilities. The report contends: “Chemical weapons…and especially chlorine…are used to punish civilian populations present in zones held by fighters opposed to the Syrian regime and to create a climate of terror and panic that encourages them to surrender.” That very afternoon, Naser recounted, he had been engulfed in the fog of the chemical bombs. By evening, he had lost his pregnant wife, his two children, and his mother. Naser spoke in a low voice, putting his hand over his heart, recalling the smell, the chaos, the terror. People, he said, had been running in all directions to try to escape the fumes. “For 15 minutes, I didn’t know what was happening,” he remembered. “Then I lost my vision.” Rescue workers arrived and began trying to wash people’s eyes out, but there wasn’t enough water. He passed out. When he woke up, there was an oxygen mask on his face and he was told his family was dead. Counting on his fingers, he estimated that 42 people died. According tothe White Helmets, the legendary Syrian Civil Defense service, 40 to 70 people were killed and hundreds injured. Yeye told me that he had lost his brother, wife, son, and two daughters that day. “My wife was nine months pregnant,” he said. “My brother’s four kids also died.” Pulling out his mobile phone, he showed me a seven-year-old video of the aftermath: an apartment with bodies piled on top of one another, foam coming from their mouths. Afterward, he said, the most twisted aspect of the whole thing, in his view, was that government forces forbid the town’s survivors to say it was a chemical attack. Assad’s men came and fed them a concocted narrative: that the rebels had burned tires, which poisoned the people. As Naser talked, Swadan disappeared and returned with a tray of coffee, sugar, and chocolate—and, touchingly, brought me shoe polish to clean my dusty boots. He also polished his own boots until they shined. The men then took me to the shelter where most of the people had died, and we walked the haunted street where, Yeye told me, he had “walked over so many dead people” to try to find his way out of the fog. He said that in the wake of the attacks, male survivors struggled with fertility issues. “We’ll never know how deeply it affected us mentally.” He said that after the attack, he smelled the stench for months. Along with my pursuits as a journalist, I have now spent three years as the CEO of a war crimes unit called the Reckoning Project.The group’s chief focushas been documenting systematic atrocities committed by Vladimir Putin’s military on the citizens of Ukraine and Crimea. Our aim is to bring the actual perpetrators to justice in international courts. Two of our key staffers are Syrian, hired because of their experience in monitoring torture, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in their own country. Raji, for instance, helped build the first Syrian war crimes tribunal in Koblenz, Germany. There arepatterns to war crimes.As in Ukraine, Putin viciously attacked Syria, starting in 2015, largely by bombing Aleppo. When examining Syria’s wartime criminality, my concerns are twofold. First: that those who suffered such barbarism will be able to seek justice through court proceedings against alleged Syrian war criminals. Second: that the authorities undertake a nationwide effort at reconciliation. Such initiatives in post-apartheid South Africa (with its commissions on truth and reconciliation) and post-genocide Rwanda (under the auspices of its gacaca courts) proved essential in allowing victims and perpetrators to face their past so that their countries could begin to heal. The challenge is to balance accountability and justice while avoiding the spiral of revenge and violence that has erupted in places like Iraq. HTS has extended an amnesty to conscripted soldiers of the former regime, meaning the new authorities may only be targeting high-ranking officials. But this model presents problems—as in Bosnia, where victims still must live side by side with their torturers, delaying the process of healing. Much needs to be done. Domestic laws need to be passed; new tribunals established. Judicial reform is currently taking place. Syrian civil society is working hard to document and gather evidence. Refugees are beginning to come home. Yet, accountability stretches far beyond putting Assad’s henchmen in prison. How does a new government undertake such a massive job? Especially in an upside-down era in which democracy is in retreat, dictatorships are on the rise, and autocrats seem to have each other’s back? In the homes and cafés of Syria, it doesn’t escape a single soul that tonight Bashar al-Assad is sleeping comfortably in the land of Vladimir Putin, a man whose attack on Ukraine and its leader was summarized this way by Trump toVolodymyr Zelenskyy: “You should never have started it.” When I stood outside of Sednaya Prison, the Human Slaughterhouse, I thought of all the Syrians who had passed through the gates, their fear so tangible that they could barely move. Many of them were teenagers when they entered. If they survived at all, they were middle-aged when they left. I thought of Mustafa, the relative of a former high-ranking Syrian official from the time of the French mandate, who had told me of his years in prison, in isolation, being starved and tormented for doing nothing more than saying he wanted freedom. I thought of all the Syrians I had met who were tortured by regime officials, who taunted them with the words: “You want your freedom? Here’s your freedom!” as they whipped or raped or flayed them. The new Syrian government—and the world at large, distracted by tyrants undeterred—owes it to the prisoners of Sednaya and the Assads’ other human slaughterhouses to make sure there is a system of justice, an accounting. And most of all, a reckoning. Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "article_text": "Labour Department, Occupational Safety and Health Council launch subsidy scheme to help employers buy cooling equipment at a discount This story has been updated to reflect that the amber heat stress warning was issued by the Labour Department. Hong Kong authorities have stepped up measures to help protect outdoor workers at risk of heatstroke by providing subsidies to employers who want to purchase cooling equipment, as the city issued its fourth “very hot weather” warning in less than a week. The announcement on Thursday followed the death of a 42-year-old worker who reportedly suffered heatstroke and fainted at a construction site the day before. He was pronounced dead at Prince of Wales Hospital in Sha Tin on Wednesday. The worker’s distraught father cried as he told local media: “I still do not know … why I suddenly lost my son.” The city has seen several steamy days since last Saturday, with the Hong Kong Observatory issuing four “very hot weather” warning signals within six days. Parts of the New Territories recorded temperatures of more than 33 degrees Celsius (91.4 Fahrenheit) on Wednesday, while some areas rose to 35 degrees on Thursday afternoon. The Labour Department issued an amber heat stress warning from 1.30pm to 4.30pm on Thursday, alerting outdoor workers of different job types to rest for 15 to 45 minutes every hour. Deputy Commissioner for Labour Vincent Fung Hao-yin said that heatstroke was preventable if employers took appropriate measures to help workers cool down.",

They are made from 100% long-staple cotton and come in sizes ranging from twin to California King. A set includes a top sheet, a fitted sheet and two pillowcases. It’s easy to set up, simple to use, and small enough for most spaces. This is one of our favoriteair purifiersfor small spaces. NBC Select commerce editorLindsay Schneiderreceived this unit from the brand and it’s been the clear favorite of all the air purifiers she’s tested. One great feature is the built-in light — it changes color depending on the air quality detected in your space, and it can act as a warm-colored night light. The filters last a full year before needing replacement. Buying this through Lessa’s website gives you two pillows and a sheet set at no additional cost. I purchased thismattresson sale during Memorial Day 2023, and it’s the most comfortable mattress I’ve ever owned.

This fully-featured lightweight vacuum also comes in two colors. Levoit is better known for its air purifiers, but thiscordless vacuumfrom the brand checks a lot of boxes and is on sale for less than $150.

This 65-inch version originally launched in 2024 for $2,699.99 — you can grab it today for almost half that price. I always recommend buying last year’s TVs, like this one, as you can get a much better deal than buying current models (the2025 65-inch LG C5, for example, costs more than $2,000 right now). You’ll get the best deals on the clear and light blue colors. Lifestraw makes some of our favoritewater pitchers, but they’re best known for on the go filtration like this Go Series water bottle. The membrane microfilter protects from contaminants like bacteria, parasites, microplastics, sand and dirt, and lasts for about 1,000 gallons of water, or about five years of daily use, according to the brand.

    "title": "German justice minister floats ban on largest opposition party",
    "article_text": "Germany’s Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig has called for a serious examination into whether Alternative for Germany (AfD) should be banned, following the domestic intelligence agency’s suspension of its classification of the political party as a“confirmed right-wing extremist”group amid a public backlash. In an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published on Thursday, Hubig emphasized the need to consider all legal avenues, claiming that the AfD must be taken seriously as a potential threat to democratic order. “The AfD is not a party like any other… Therefore, we need to take the party as a possible danger for our democracy very seriously. It is essential to consider a party ban,”shesaid. Hubig acknowledged that banning a political party is the most severe measure available in a democracy and should not be employed hastily. However, she argued that if a thorough investigation by the Interior Ministry and other relevant authorities reveals that the legal conditions for a ban are met, it“would not be difficult”to justify such a move. “Of course, thoroughness comes before speed, but we do not have forever,”she added, when asked whether there was a timeline for reaching a decision on a potential ban. The new German government – a coalition between Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservatives and the SPD – will discuss the possibility of pursuing a ban and formulate a joint response. However, Hubig cast doubt on whether“the procedure would be successful or not.” The AfD secured second place in February’s federal elections with 20.8% of the vote, but has been excluded from coalition talks and government formation. When asked whether she was concerned about disenfranchising so many voters, Hubig claimed that it is“irrelevant”how many people support a party if authorities ultimately deem it unconstitutional. Earlier this month, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV)upgradedthe AfD’s classification from“suspected”to“confirmed right-wing extremist”– but quicklysuspendedthe designation pending a court ruling on the party’s legal appeal. The AfD condemned the move as“a severe blow to German democracy”and filed a lawsuit. Co-leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla welcomed the temporary suspension, calling it“a first important step.”The now-paused designation would have allowed the BfV to expand surveillance of the AfD without judicial oversight; the downgraded“suspected case”status still permits monitoring, but under stricter conditions. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt acknowledged this week that the BfV’s 1,100-page report – which has not been made public – lacks concrete evidence that the AfD poses a serious threat to democracy or the rule of law that would justify a legal ban. Chancellor Merz has also expressed skepticism about pursuing a ban, citing both legal complexity and the potential political fallout. He stressed the need to address the underlying causes of the AfD’s popularity. At the same time, Merz urged Washington to“stay out”of Germany’s domestic politics, after top US officials claimed the EU’s largest economy had become“a tyranny in disguise”and had“rebuilt”the Berlin Wall.",

    "title": "US Senate to investigate who really ran country under Biden",
    "article_text": "US Senator Ron Johnson, who chairs the Homeland Security investigative subcommittee, is launching a probe into a potential cover-up relating to the health of former President Joe Biden, the Republican lawmaker from Wisconsin has announced. Last weekend, Biden’s office revealed that he had been diagnosed with an“aggressive form”of prostate cancer. While some, including incumbent President Donald Trump, were quick to express sympathy, some commentators claimed that the diagnosis had long been known, but that the Democrat’s inner circle had deliberately kept the public in the dark about it. In a post on X on Thursday, Johnson wrote that he had“just sent letters to former Joe Biden cabinet members requesting that they appear before my Subcommittee for an interview about Biden’s cognitive capabilities during his presidency.” “Will these individuals finally tell the truth, or will they double down on their lies?”the senator asked. Speaking to Axios on Wednesday, he said he was launching an investigation into the former president’s health, zooming in on a“couple dozen people”who had“direct contact”with Biden. The senator explained that the probe’s objective was to find out“who was running the [US] government.” In a post on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday, President Trump suggested that Biden would never have allowed“drug dealers, gang members, and the mentally insane to come into our Country totally unchecked and unvetted.”The pernicious policies of the previous administration were executed by the“people that knew he was cognitively impaired, and that took over the autopen,”he alleged. “This is TREASON at the highest level!... Something very severe should happen to these treasonous thugs,”Trump concluded. Speaking to reporters on Monday, he expressed incredulity at the fact that the“public wasn’t notified a long time ago, because to get to stage nine, that’s a long time,”referring to Biden’s advanced cancer. The issue of Biden’s health, and his cognitive abilities in particular, was propelled into the national spotlight during his campaign last year, when critics highlighted the veteran politician’s unsteady gait, apparent memory lapses and trouble articulating his thoughts. Things came to a head after a disastrous debate against Trump in June 2024, after which an increasing number of his fellow Democrats called on him to drop out of the race, which Biden did the following month.",

    "title": "The EU is an addict – and sanctions on Russia are the drug",
    "article_text": "What’s going on between the US and the EU right now over Ukraine feels like you and your buddy agreeing to go skydiving on a dare. You count“1-2-3-jump,”and leap – only to realize your friend’s still up in the plane. That friend is US President Donald Trump. And the EU parachute looks like it was stitched together with recycled climate summit lanyards and blind optimism. Emphasis on“blind.” On May 19, a German government spokesman assured the press that Washington would be joining the EU in yet another round of sanctions on Russia. But fast forward to today, and Brussels has leapt out of the plane solo while Trump is still standing at the hatch, waving goodbye and checking the minibar. And Berlin seems to be pretending not to notice – at least for the purpose of keeping up appearances.“Europe and America are very united on this point: We will closely support Ukraine on its path toward a ceasefire… We agreed on this with [Trump] after his conversation with Putin,”Chancellor Friedrich Merztweeted. Translation: The EU went,“Hey Trump, we’re slapping more sanctions on Russia. Cool with that?”And Trump probably thought,“Oh, you mean the sanctions that nuked your economy, dried up your trade, and left you addicted to overpriced American LNG? Be my guest, Einsteins.” Sure enough, Trump has since made it clear he’s not feeling another sanctions round. The vibes are off. He’s not jumping. But if the EU wants to swan dive into its own economic crater, well – godspeed.“Because I think there’s a chance of getting something done, and if you do that, you could also make it much worse,”Trump said. Trump keeps saying that he wants peace and trade with Russia – the exact opposite of Brussels’ Cold War cosplay. But let’s be honest: would the EU even be playing sanctions hardball if it hadn’t been cheered down that road by the Biden administration? Highly unlikely. Trump sees the whole mess as a Biden boondoggle – a“European situation.” What’s more interesting is how Team Trump is framing this not as a retreat, but as the dawn of a“peace first”presidency. One that’s allergic to forever wars. Secretary of State Marco Rubio even suggested that God’s on board.“We have a president of peace,”Rubio said at a recent Trump-hosted event, before recounting a chat with a Vatican cardinal for Pope Leo’s papal mass.“You know, it’s very unusual for us. We have an American president that wants peace, and it’s some of the Europeans that are constantly talking about doing war stuff.” Trump, Rubio, J.D. Vance, they’re all singing the same tune: get a peace deal done pronto, or the US checks out. Ukraine and Russia can slug it out without Uncle Sam in the ring. And Europe? It can handle its own geopolitical hangover, assuming it can still stand up straight. Meanwhile, Brussels is starting to realize its wallet has limits. That whole“whatever it takes”energy? It’s starting to sound more like“whatever we can still afford.”Ursula von der Leyen evenadmittedit.“Over the past five years, our budget has punched above its weight. And we must also see now… we have reached the limits of what is possible.” Translation: The ‘check engine’ light on the EU economy has been blinking for a while, and now the dashboard’s on fire. But never mind that – they’ve just pulled the trigger on yet anothersanctions round. The 17th. And there’s already an 18th bullet getting loaded in the chamber. Because if you miss the target 17 times, the 18th is going to be the charm, right? This time, they’re targeting Russia’s“shadow fleet,”which – minor detail – delivers oil to countries outside the EU, so the EU, in all its usual brilliance, can then buy it at a markup from middlemen countries. Also not Russian? The ships themselves. And many of the newly sanctioned companies, which are in places like China (the EU’s top trade partner), Serbia (an EU candidate), Türkiye (the EU’s refugee babysitter), the UAE (gas hookup), Vietnam, and Uzbekistan. Way to win hearts and minds. Taking the long way around in sticking it to Putin, by ticking off the rest of the world. And while they’ve long denounced Trump’s tariffs on EU goods, guess who’s now crushing on tariffs? Yep, the EU has just introducednew oneson Russian agricultural imports. But wait, didn’t they already ban nearly everything Russian? Not quite. Some imports still sneak through the back door, like fertilizer, which supports the EU food system. In fact, Russian fertilizer imports rose 12% in January alone. Even the EU’s own Eurostat agency pegs the annual increase at 25%. Just explain that one to the farmers protesting Brussels’ rules while watching their markets flood with Ukrainian grain. The EU also imports Russian enriched uranium: the lifeblood of nuclear reactors that generate about a quarter of Europe’s electricity. And now, naturally, Brussels isconsidering tariffson that, too. Apparently, if the ship’s on fire, the EU’s first instinct is to throw out the lifeboats. Then rummage around in the back to make darn sure there aren’t any more hiding in a closet somewhere.",

    "title": "Kid Cudi Testified at Diddy’s Trial in a James Dean-Esque Outfit",
    "article_text": "Scott Mescudi, the rapper best known as Kid Cudi, testified on Thursday morning atSean “Diddy” Combs’s ongoing sex trafficking and racketeering trial. His testimony touched on various incidents that followed Combs finding out about Mescudi’s 2011 relationship with musician Cassie Ventura, who also dated Diddy, including an alleged arson involving Cudi’s Porsche being destroyed by a Molotov cocktail. Arriving at Manhattan’s federal courthouse in the rain, Cudi exited a black SUV while puffing on a half-smoked cigarette. Rather than a standard suit, he was dressed casually in a scuffed leather biker jacket, white T-shirt,Salomon XT-6sneakers, and a well-worn pair of orange-tab Levi’s blue jeans, which are a favorite amongvintage-denim aficionados. He wore a small, diamond-set cross earring that dangled from a gold hoop in his left ear. The rapper Kid Cudi arrived at Manhattan's federal courthouse in a leather jacket, white T-shirt, and vintage Levi's. “I love the fit,” one onlooker shouted to Cudi ina videocaptured outside the courthouse. “Not too serious!” Photographs of Cudi’s arrival began circulating on social media. As has become de rigueur in such cases, internet commenters fixated on the cinematic nature of the images; others complimented Cudi’s laidback style. Some likened his look to James Dean or Danny Zuko, John Travolta’s character inGrease. “He is living my dream of walking past reporters and into a courtroom on a rainy day while ripping a cig and wearing a leather jacket,” one spectator wroteon X. Some cushioned their praise with caveats acknowledging the gravity of the Diddy case. “Alright but these photos go kinda hard,” reada commenton Complex’s Instagram account. “This dude got on a leather jacket in the rain. He about to give them a movie,” went another. The response echoed similar outsized interest in the style narrative of other high-profile courthouse appearances earlier this year. In February, rapper A$AP Rocky wore a string ofimpeccably tailored Saint Laurent suitsduring his felony assault trial in Los Angeles; later that month, Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December, raised eyebrows forwearing loafers without socksduring his pretrial hearing in Manhattan. Cudi exiting the courthouse. Inside the courtroom, reporter Matthew Russell, who is covering the trial via his local news outlet, Inner City Press,confirmedCudi took the stand in this very outfit, leather jacket and all. He testified that he and Cassie dated in 2011, and in December of that year, a frightened Cassie had called him to discuss Diddy’s furious response to their relationship. “What was your reaction to your car being set on fire?” the prosecution asked the rapper, perInner City Press. “What the fuck,” Cudi replied—a response that prompted an objection from the defense, which the judge overruled.",
