    "title": "Girl athletes express fear over school district switching sports conferences to accommodate trans athletes",
    "article_text": "California high school student-athlete Anna Holly speaks out against her district's decision to switch to a sports conference that allows trans athletes to compete in girls' sports. (Credit: Tahoe Truckee Media) A public school district is in the process oftransferring fromNevada's high school sports conference to California's so it can avoid Nevada's new policy that keeps biological males out of high school girls' competitions and locker rooms. The Tahoe Truckee Unified School District (TTUSD) in Truckee, California, is leaving the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association (NIAA) to join theCalifornia Interscholastic Federation(CIF). The change will go into effect in Fall 2025 and comes after the NIAA voted to ban male athletes from the girls' category during its April 2 Board of Control meeting. It was made in order to comply with President Donald Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order. However, California has continued to defy the order and enable trans inclusion in girls' sports. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Multiple TTUSD parents and girls' athletes pleaded with school officials not to make the switch to California's federation at the Truckee Unified school board meeting Wednesday night. Not only did they speak out the notion of letting trans athletes in girls' sports, but many speakers also pointed out that other details of the switch would affect the district's sports teams' ability to conduct their seasons, including travel and scheduling changes that would bring about potential weather complications for outdoor events. The current setup with Truckee competing in the NIAA allows its teams to travel east into Nevada for most of its away competition, as the town sits near the northern California-Nevada border. But with the coming change, the student athletes could soon have to travel west for most of their away competition. This means that students will often have to travel through California's Donner Pass, a 7,056-foot-high mountain pass. During winter, the pass is known for being dangerous due to extreme weather conditions like heavy snowfall, strong winds and icy roads. The high elevation and frequent storms contribute to treacherous travel conditions, including the potential for avalanches.

There's two genders, a man and a woman,\" Zilstorf said. \"And I think it's unfair that we have to take a dangerous drive to risk our lives over the summit when there's snow, all because of a privacy rule. This is wrong.\" North Tahoe High School girls' soccer player Anna Holly said she isn't even going to be playing girls' soccer anymore because of the change. \"It's sad for me, because this is the only time I get to play soccer in my life, and I really do enjoy it, but I'm choosing basketball over that,\" Holly said. \"And biologically, boys are born with greater speed and strength than girls, and having to play against them, they do have an unfair advantage, and I would not feel safe with them. There's also safety concerns about how much stronger they are than us.\" CALIFORNIA GIRL OPENS UP ON FIGHTING LEGAL AND POLITICAL BATTLE OVER TRANS ATHLETES AFTER LIFE-CHANGING PAIN TTUSD still defended its decision to switch to CIF in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. \"A recent Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association (NIAA) policy change made on April 2, 2025, directly conflicts with California state law, specifically the California Education Code’s mandate against discrimination and protection of student privacy. Given the direct conflict between the NIAA's recent policy changes and the mandates of California state law, TTUSD viewed joining a California athletics association as a necessary action to ensure legal compliance,\" read a statement from the TTUSD to Fox News Digital. TTUSD also said it anticipates the new arrangements will lead to shorter travel times for its student athletes for away competitions, despite concerns over the Donner Pass. \"TTUSD is working with CIF on details related to league assignment, schedules, and travel distances. We anticipate that the overall mileage student-athletes travel within the CIF will be less than our current travel schedules,\" the district's statement read.

Two men were found guilty on Friday of cutting down Britain's 'Sycamore Gap' tree two years ago, felling the much-loved landmark whose dramatic silhouette had featured in aHollywood moviein what prosecutors described as a \"moronic mission\". The sycamore, estimated to be almost 200 years old, stood at the centre of a dramatic dip in the landscape alongside the historic Hadrian's Wall innorthern England, making it a popular spot for photographers, hikers and even marriage proposals. 2 MEN CHARGED WITH FELLING 150-YEAR-OLD ‘ROBIN HOOD’ TREE IN ENGLAND Such was its fame that it featured in the 1991 film \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" and its felling in September 2023 provoked widespread grief and anger. Prosecutor Richard Wright told jurors at Newcastle Crown Court last month that Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, were responsible for the \"mindless vandalism\", expertly and deliberately cutting it down with a chainsaw. The felling also caused damage to part of Hadrian's Wall, built by the Romans almost 2,000 years ago and now aUNESCO World Heritage Site. General view of the felled Sycamore Gap in Northumberland, Britain, September 28, 2023.(REUTERS/Lee Smith) Graham and Carruthers, who travelled to the site in the Northumberland National Park from their homes in the Carlisle area, about 25 miles away, had denied any involvement. But they were convicted of two counts of criminal damage. The men will be sentenced on July 15. \"For over a century, Sycamore Gap has been an iconic natural landmark in the north east of England, bringing immeasurable joy to those visiting the area,\" Chief Crown Prosecutor Gale Gilchrist said. \"In just under three minutes, Graham and Carruthers ended its historic legacy in a deliberate and mindless act of destruction.\" During the trial, the jury was shown a video of their \"moronic mission\", filmed on Graham's mobile phone, which showed grainy footage of what appeared to be the iconic tree being cut down. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The prosecution said the men had taken a wedge of the tree as a trophy and messages they sent to each other afterwards showed they had been \"revelling\" in the worldwide reaction to the incident. No explanation has been given for their actions. The National Trust, a heritage conservation charity which looks after the site, said last August there were signs of life at the base of the tree, giving hope it might live on.",

Ana Kasparian of \"The Young Turks\" declared she will never take Gov.Gavin Newsomseriously as a potential Democratic presidential candidate until he takes responsibility for California’s decline. On \"Her Take,\" a new Valuetainment Studios podcast, co-hosts spoke about the current crop of Democratic leaders who may be vying to lead the party in the 2028 election. In the wake of PresidentDonald Trump’s historic victory in 2024, the Democratic Party has been deeply divided over not just who should take the reins, but whether they need a fundamental shift in policy. Co-host Jillian Michaels, a former Californian, brought up how Newsom is a potential frontrunner for the upcoming election, drawing an immediate wave of dismay from her co-hosts. \"This guy has tried,\" Michaels said, noting that the governor ischanging his tactics. \"He's taken notes, he's tried to be somewhat critical of his own party, he's tried to reach out to the other side. He's tried to be antithetical to, you know, ‘everything exists in our silo, and we don't reach across the aisle.’ He's tried to show himself.\" Kasparian, a left-wing commentator who frequentlyshreds California's far-left policies,replied, \"I will never take that piece of crap seriously, and yes, I'm calling Gavin Newsom, my governor unfortunately, a piece of crap until he does some accountability for how he destroyed the state of California.\" Ana Kasparian scorched Gov.

The loss of jobs started well before Trump won the election, and it was the result of his policies, cumbersome regulations, that have now led to oil companies, for instance, deciding, ‘We're not doing this anymore, we're going to leave.’\" Kasparian also argued that crime has exploded under his watch. \"You have rampant crime that Democrats want to deny exists, but it obviously does when businesses close up shop and move to other states because the cost of doing business is so expensive,\" she said. \"Insuring businesses in California is astronomical because of the issues with crime.\" Multiple members of the panel had grievances to share about Gov.

    "article_text": "Trump dismissed GOP concerns about raising taxes on the country's wealthiest in an effort to usher in tax cuts for lower earners during a back-and-forth with reporters from the Oval Office Friday. As Republicans search for avenues to extend PresidentDonald Trump's2017 tax cuts, some Republican lawmakers involved in the process have floated the idea that the nation's highest earners could see a tax increase in order to usher in cuts for lower-earners. For his part, the president is sending signals he tends to agree. \"You know, they'll go around saying, ‘Oh, this is so terrible.’ What you're doing is you're giving up something up top in order to make people in the middle income and the lower income brackets save more. So it's really a redistribution,\" Trump told reporters when asked what his response would be to those Republicans opposed totax increaseson the wealthy. \"I would love to be able to give people in a lower bracket a big break by giving up some of what I have,\" the president added. TRUMP'S TAX HIKE PROPOSAL IS 'DÉJÀ VU' OF GEORGE H.W. BUSH'S ‘READ MY LIPS’ MOMENT, EXPERTS SAY President Donald Trump speaks with reporters as he signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, May 9, 2025, in Washington.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) He also noted that the move is just \"good politics,\" dismissing comparisons some political experts have made to one-term RepublicanPresident George H.W. Bush,whose broken promise to Republicans that there would be \"no new taxes\" following his 1988 election victory has been blamed Bush's failed re-election efforts. \"Read my lips: No new taxes,\" Bush Sr. said during his acceptance speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention. Subsequently, in the face of a ballooning deficit, Bush Sr. ultimately cuta deal with Democratsthat raised taxes. \"A lot of people say, don't do it because of the fact that you have the Bush statement about ‘Read my lips.’ But he lost because of Ross Perot, he didn't lose because of that statement,\" Trump said. \"I actually think it's good politics to do it where richer people give up. And it's a very small – it's like a point – but they give it up to benefit the people on lower income.\" TRUMP PUSHES TAX HIKES FOR WEALTHY AS ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ DEADLINE LOOMS In a post on his Truth Social platform earlier Friday, Trump struck a slightly more cautious tone about the alleged concern that his willingness to increase taxes on the highest earners could spell trouble for him electorally the way it did for Bush Sr. He complained that Democrats would point to it repeatedly in an effort to discredit him. However, Trump still contended that the elder President Bush lost because of more than just his broken tax promises, and added that while Republicans should probably not increase taxes on the wealthy, he would be okay with it if they were to do so.

    "article_text": "Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., receives praise for his less-than-formal attire during a Commerce Committee hearing. The media’s pile-on of Pennsylvania Sen.John Fetterman, D-Pa., reached the point where both Republicans and Democrats were lamenting the rhetorical blows landing on the hulking Pittsburgh-area lawmaker by Friday. \"This is so blatantly coordinated,\" remarked media observer and Fox Newscontributor Joe Concha, who shared a link in his X post to a Politico report claiming an internal Democratic poll found Fetterman’s popularity faltering in his part of the Keystone State. The report claimed Fetterman had now fallen below 50% in Democratic voter support in the Steel City, just a few miles west of Braddock, where he was previously mayor. Fox News Digital cannot verify the veracity of the poll's findings. OPENAI'S SAM ALTMAN THANKS JOHN FETTERMAN FOR NORMALIZING HOODIES Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., is seeing an outpouring of defense from both Democratic and GOP colleagues.(Getty Images) \"I know a hit piece when I see one,\" addedRep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y. \"The only reason for the coordinated campaign against Senator John Fetterman is his unapologeticpro-Israel politics,\" wrote Torres, a Bronx Democrat who also bucks his party on Israel, but is also considered a high-profile progressive. \"Let’s call it what it is. As someone who has struggled with depression my whole adult life, I can tell you that if you truly care about someone’s mental health, leaking hit pieces against them is a strange way of showing it.\" Swing-state Pennsylvania has a history of politically opposed senators forging close relationships — such as Republican Pat Toomey and Democrat Bob Casey Jr. for many years. That trend continued Friday when Sen.David McCormick, R-Pa., stuck up for Fetterman, saying in a statement that \"it’s time to put politics aside and stop these vicious, personal attacks against Senator Fetterman, his wife, and his health.\" \"While we have many differences, we are both committed to working together to achieve results for the people of Pennsylvania and make their lives better,\" McCormick wrote. JOHN FETTERMAN FACES NEW SPOTLIGHT ON HEALTH, FAMILY DRAMA, SPARKING ONLINE UPROAR The Republican called the Democrat \"authentic, decent, principled and a fighter,\" and ripped the \"disgraceful smears\" he has seen in recent times. Philadelphia radio host Nick Kayal remarked on X that he’s seen more reports critical of Fetterman’s health in four days than were seen in the press about former President Joe Biden in four years. \"Wonder why,\" he asked rhetorically. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, added that \"the media ought to lay offSenator Fetterman.\" A former UPenn student who spoke out on national media against the anti-Semitic protests on campus also came to Fetterman’s defense, slamming the \"hit pieces\" as of late. \"If you’re a Democrat and oppose the woke mob, you’re enemy #1 of the legacy media,\" wroteEyal Yakoby,who also posted a previous photo he took with Fetterman. Conservative former Pittsburgh news anchor and radio hostWendy Bell remarked on Xthat the Fetterman attacks are \"so weird.\" \"The New York Magazine hit piece on John Fetterman didn’t hit enough to stick the landing. Now it’s the AP’s turn. This is journalism? No, this is propaganda,\" Bell wrote. \"The Code Red has been issued on Fetterman,\" Concha followed up in another X post. \"And of course, our wonderful media follows that order as if Col. Jessup ordered it himself,\" he said, referring to Jack Nicholson’s crooked Marine Corps officer character in 1992's \"A Few Good Men.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Later on Friday, more Republicans came to Fetterman's defense, including Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. \"John Fetterman and I have our differences, but he’s a decent and genuine guy,\" Cotton wrote. \"The radical left is smearing him with dishonest, vicious attacks because he’s pro-Israel and they only want reliable anti-Israel politicians. Disgraceful.\" Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., also pushed back on the media, calling Fetterman a \"tremendous friend and colleague.\" \"It’s a complete disgrace what agenda-driven members of the media and his own party are doing to attack him, all because he dares to be an independent thinker and voice.

    "article_text": "Olivia Hayes, whose husband was allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant, joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's border and immigration policy successes after her tragic loss. A \"criminal alien\" and \"suspected terrorist\" who served 19 years in prison for holding his housekeeper captive and repeatedly molesting her, was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials after his release from the Arapahoe County Jail in Centennial, Colorado, Tuesday, and will be deported back toSaudi Arabia. Following a jury trial in 2006, Homaidan Al-Turki Al-Turki was convicted of misdemeanor false imprisonment, misdemeanor conspiracy to commit false imprisonment,11 counts of felony unlawful sexual contact, felony extortion, and felony theft of $15,000 or more. Al-Turki served a six-years-to-life sentence at theColorado Department of Corrections (DOC). Homaidan Al-Turki was arrested by ICE in Colorado, and will not be welcome in the United States again.(ICE) DEPORTATION FLIGHTS TO LIBYA WOULD VIOLATE COURT ORDER WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, FEDERAL JUDGE SAYS He first became parole-eligible in 2011, but failed to participate in the DOC’s sex-offender treatment program, preventing his release and delaying his deportation back to Saudi Arabia. Al-Turki filed numerous motions with the courts while incarcerated, including a recent pending motion alleging his defense counsel did not adequately represent him at trial. In granting him a hearing, District Court Judge Eric White said, \"[t]he defendant’s counsel may not have understood fundamental aspects of the submitted jury instructions, particularly that misdemeanor unlawful sexual contact could be elevated to a felony conviction if the jury found that Al-Turki used force, intimidation, or threats to cause the victim’s submission.\" Homaidan Al-Turki, 56, pleaded guilty,and was immediately sentenced to concurrent terms of six years in the Colorado DOC.(18th Judicial District Attorney’s Office) FEDERAL JUDGE OPENS DOOR TO ALIEN ENEMIES ACT TARGETS SUING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION Al-Turki's original attorneys said they thought the unlawful sexual contact convictions were for misdemeanor offenses, which would have carried a jail sentence of up to two years. However, because the jury found him guilty of unlawful sexual contact offenses that were committed through physical force and violence, the charges were enhanced to class 4 felonies. Al-Turki was sentenced to several concurrent terms of six-years-to-life in prison on those counts and was ordered to complete sex offender treatment. The 18th Judicial District Attorney’s Office agreed on Tuesday to amend some of the felony counts, with the condition he is sent back to his home country. Al-Turki, now 56, pleaded guilty,and was immediately sentenced to concurrent terms of six years in theColorado DOC. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT MURDERERS COULD FACE DEATH PENALTY UNDER NEW GOP BILL The sentence on each count was ordered to be served concurrently, to include a mandatory period of parole supervision that Al-Turki had already served due to his nearly 19 years in prison. He was taken into ICE custody Tuesday afternoon pursuant to a removal order to deport him back to Saudi Arabia. \"Based on careful analysis of the facts and evidence presented through the 35(c) motion, as well as the difficulty in re-trying the case nearly two decades later if the motion was successful, our office determined that resentencing Al-Turki to 11 felony sex offenses, in addition to the other offenses that he stands convicted of, and resulting in his removal from the United States, is the appropriate outcome in this case at this time,\" Colorado 18th Judicial District Assistant District Attorney Ryan Brackley said. STAY IN YOUR LANE: FLORIDA AG FIRES NEXT VOLLEY AGAINST JUDGE HALTING STATE IMMIGRATION LAW While Brackley said it was a difficult decision, he noted it \"strikes the right balance between ensuring that Al-Turki remains a convicted sex felon and is removed from our community, while at the same time considering the resources that have been expended in holding this defendant accountable.\" ICE officials said Al-Turki first entered the U.S. at an unknown location in 1992, before leaving in 1993. In 1994, he lawfully reentered again at an unknown location. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In 2001, Al-Turki was questioned about the9/11 attacks, and left the U.S. again at an unknown time and place. He lawfully reentered the U.S. again in 2002. He was convicted of the crimes in 2006, and has had an administrative order of removal since 2013. \"He won’t be welcome back to the United States again,\" ICE officials wrote in a post on X.

Shia LaBeoufis speaking candidly about a troubling time in his career. The controversial actor, who's been working in Hollywood since he was a child, spoke toThe Hollywood Reporterto promote his new film, \"Henry Johnson.\" During their conversation, LaBeouf discussed his former feud with fellow actor Alec Baldwin, whom he briefly worked with for a Broadway show called \"Orphans\" in 2013. LaBeouf was originally supposed to star opposite Al Pacino, but when Pacino left the production, Baldwin replaced him – something that LeBeouf struggled with. As he explained to THR, he was solely to blame for their issues, because he was \"not a nice guy\" at the time. JOAQUIN PHOENIX, HILARY SWANK, SHIA LABEOUF TAKE ACTING TO EXTREMES WITH SLAPS, DIETS AND PULLED TEETH Shia LaBeouf said he lived in Central Park during a difficult period of his life.(Max Cisotti/Dave Benett/Getty Images) \"By the time Baldwin got there, it was almost unfair,\" he said. \"So he’s dealing with both my fractured little weak ego, right? All this hard prep that I’d done for two years, and my desperate need to show him all my prep, or that he would accept me somehow. I was so insecure. Well, that got contentious in the room. Then he got competitive. That’s just what our relationship turned into.\" He continued, \"I’d be off book, he’d be on book, and he didn’t want me to look at him be off book. That makes it hard to play these scenes out or block this thing even. And no fault against him, he had two weeks to come in because Pacino [dropped out]. I had built the whole thing based on my relationshipwith Pacino. And that’s gone. So I was kind of heartbroken. When he came in, I’m living in the park, and I’m on steroids, and I’m not in a good way.\" \"Fear will make you move different. I found it came from having absolutely no spiritual life … It made me a piece of s--t. Not a nice guy.\" When asked to elaborate, LaBeouf said, \"I was sleeping in Central Park.

In a 2014 piece he wrotefor Vulture, Baldwin spoke about his experience with LaBeouf, admitting that \"there was friction between us from the beginning.\" \"LaBeouf seems to carry with him, to put it mildly, a jailhouse mentality wherever he goes. When he came to rehearsal, he was told it was important to memorize his lines. . . . I, however, do not learn my lines in advance. So he began to sulk because he felt we were slowing him down. You could tell right away he loves to argue. And one day he attacked me in front of everyone. He said, ‘You’re slowing me down, and you don’t know your lines. And if you don’t say your lines, I’m just going to keep saying my lines.’\" He \"snorted\" at LaBeouf, and the two had a terse exchange in front of the rest of the cast. Afterward, Baldwin asked for a break, then took the director and stage manager aside and told them, \"One of us is going to go.\" Alec Baldwin nearly quit the Broadway show after getting into an argument with Shia LaBeouf.(Getty Images) He wrote, \"I said, ‘I’ll tell you what, I’ll go.’ I said don’t fire the kid, I’ll quit. They said no, no, no, no, and they fired him. And I think he was shocked. He had that card, that card you get when you make films that make a lot of money that gives you a certain kind of entitlement.

The hostilities betweenIndia and Pakistanover the contested territory of Kashmir are igniting fears that a localized skirmish could boil over into a wider conflict and threaten the stability of the region. Watching closely is China and President Xi Jinping, a party to the Kashmir dispute with a stake in the outcome. \"For China, the stakes are high. Pakistan is its closest ally, and Beijing would not like to see it humiliated,\" Sadanand Dhume, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), told Fox News Digital. \"Seen through the prism of U.S.-China competition, each country has a 'side' in this conflict. China is joined at the hip with Pakistan, whereas the U.S. and India have grown increasingly close over the past two decades,\" Dhume added.

Since the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, U.S. engagement with Pakistan has been limited and Islamabad has less relevance for Washington’s foreign policy aims. Max Abrahms, an expert on terrorism at Northeastern University, told Fox News Digital that the fight over Kashmir could now become a venue for U.S.-China competition. \"The India-Pakistan conflict may emerge as a proxy war where India is backed by the U.S. and Pakistan is backed by China,\" Abrahms said. Yigal Carmon, president of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) and a former counterterrorism advisor to the Israeli government, told Fox News Digital that Kashmir is not just a clash between India and Pakistan. If the war escalates, he said, it could lead to the dismantling of Pakistan and have repercussions in Afghanistan, Iran and China.

Dhume also said that any conflict that unravels Pakistan’s domestic stability would give a boost to separatist groups in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa provinces who have long sought independence from Pakistan. PAKISTAN CALLS INDIA'S STRIKES AN ‘ACT OF WAR’ AND CLAIMS IT SHOT DOWN INDIAN FIGHTER JETS Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, said that India will try to ensure that the conflict remains limited and focus its efforts on targeting terrorists, avoiding civilian casualties.

The fear for many experts and policymakers is whether the clashes lead to inadvertent escalation between twonuclear-armedpowers.

    "article_text": "Pope Leo XIV, history’s first North American pope, said Friday that his election was both a cross and a blessing as he celebrated his first Mass in Sistine Chapel. (Associated Press) A 2018 deal between the Vatican and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) secured by Cardinal Pietro Parolin is once again under scrutiny as questions remain over how newly appointedPope Leo XIVwill take on the CCP. The Parolin-brokered deal was and remains a controversial agreement between the leaders of the Catholic Church andthe CCP, which has long oppressed Catholics across China. While the agreement was championed by the latePope Francisand his secretary of state, Parolin — the Vatican’s top diplomat — as a step toward \"normalizing\" Catholicism in the communist nation, experts argue it has brought dangerous consequences for the faithful. WORLD LEADERS CONGRATULATE POPE LEO XIV, FIRST AMERICAN PONTIFF Cardinal Pietro Parolin.(Stefano Carofei /IPA/Sipa/IMAGN) \"It erodes papal authority to appoint bishops, theleadership of the Catholic Churchin China,\" Nina Shea, senior fellow and director of the Center for Religious Freedom at Hudson Institute, told Fox News Digital. \"A principal responsibility of a bishop is to train and ordain priests,\" she explained. \"Therefore, the CCP has been given control in determining the chain of authority in the hierarchical church.\" Under this agreement, all Catholic clergy are required to register with the CCP’s Patriotic Association — which was created in 1957 and was long rejected by the Catholic Church as illegitimate because it required that all clergy reject foreign influence, including that of the pope. Parolin in 2019 said theaim of this agreementwas \"to advance religious freedom in the sense of finding normalization for the Catholic community.\" Details of the deal remain unclear because it has been kept secret, explained Shea. While the agreement reportedly looked to end the decades-long negative ties between the Vatican and the CCP by allowing China to have more influence over bishop appointments, experts have argued for years it gave too much authority to the oppressive government. But there is an even greater problem when it comes to the Vatican seeming to have capitulated to the CCP.

According to Shea, the CCP essentially \"tricked\"the Vaticanbecause it simultaneously, in what she believes was an unbeknownst move to Parolin, banned children from being allowed in the Catholic Church — this ban included important sacraments of the church like baptisms, holy communion and confirmations. The ban effectively blocks the continuation of the Catholic Church in China. \"The underground, even during the harshest period under Mao, carried out this education and evangelization,\" Shea said. \"Without being able to perpetuate itself, the Catholic Church in China could die out in a couple generations.\" \"It’s a campaignto create an atheist society,\" she added. The Vatican did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s questions over whether Pope Leo will adhere to the agreement with the CCP or look to forge a new one.

This is true not only among non-believers but also among many baptized Christians, who thus end up living, at this level, in a state of practical atheism,\" he said. \"These are contexts where it is not easy to preach the Gospel and bear witness to its truth, where believers are mocked, opposed, despised or at best tolerated and pitied.\" The pope said, for this reason, \"missionary outreach is desperately needed.\" Pope Leo warned that a \"lack of faith\" has led to not only a \"loss of meaning in life\" for many, but also \"the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society.\" Pope Francis appoints U.S.-born cardinal, prelate prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, Robert Francis Prevost during the Ordinary Public Consistory for the Creation of new Cardinal at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City on Sept. 30, 2023.(Vatican Media via Vatican Pool/Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET TO THE FOX NEWS APP Whilecongratulatory messageswere issued by leaders of Catholic and non-Catholic nations alike, China did not issue a similar message upon the pope’s appointment on Thursday.

The pope has not said why he chose the name Leo to call himself, but papal names signify predecessors or values they admire, suggesting the newest pontiff will putgreat emphasis on social issuesbased on others in the papacy who have held that name.

At least 119 Amtrak employees and doctors took the railroad company for a ride in a massive $12 million health fraud scheme, a watchdog found. Amtrak's Office of Inspector General (OIG) said employees based in Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., accepted cash kickbacks from threehealthcare providersin exchange for the use of their insurance information and that of their dependents in a scheme from 2019 to 2022. \"The sheer volume of employees who cavalierly participated in this scheme to steal Amtrak’s funds suggests not only a serious lapse in basic ethics, but a troubling workforce culture, at least in the Northeast region, in which blatant criminal behavior was somehow normalized,\" said Amtrak Inspector General Kevin H. Winters. Fox News Digital has reached out to Amtrak. AMTRAK APOLOGIZES AFTER STRANDING 110 PASSENGERS Amtrak ran service between Chicago and Florida in the 1970s.(Amtrak) The healthcare providers used that employee information to file fraudulent and questionable medical claims for services that were never provided or not medically necessary, the OIG said. Overall, the taxpayer-funded railroad carrier's health plan was billed more than $16 million and was bilked out of $12 million. Of the 119 employees implicated, 28 retired or resigned as a result of the OIG’s investigation, and 30 left the company for \"other reasons.\" Another dozen employees have been criminally charged, and seven have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.

An undercover agent posing as an Amtrak employee met with Punson Figueroa, aka \"Susie,\" an acupuncturist from Long Island City, New York, June 16, 2021. During the visit, Figueroa told the agent to sign his name 30 times for service without dating the signatures, the OIG said. Figueroa then submitted allegedfraudulent claimsto Amtrak’s healthcare plan, saying the agent had visited providers at least seven times in May 2021 for acupuncture and physical therapy. The agent visited Figueroa’s office again on July 29, 2021, where she allegedly handed him an envelope containing $1,000. Figueroa continued to use the agent’s insurance information to submit dozens of fraudulent claims to Amtrak’s healthcare plan, investigators said. Figueroa pleaded guilty to defrauding Amtrak’s healthcare plan, was sentenced to three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay restitution of $9.05 million.

It comes after Trump signaled to GOP leaders that he was open to raising taxes on the ultra-wealthy to offset the cost of new policies eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay and retirees' social security. A source familiar with the president's thinking told Fox News Digital that to accomplish those goals, as well as preserving Medicaid for millions, Trump is considering a new top income tax bracket of 39.6% for single taxpayers making $2.5 million or more per year. The TCJA lowered the tax rate for the top income bracket — currently $609,350 for single filers — to 37%, a cut that's expiring at the end of this year. Trump himself toyed with the idea publicly on Truth Social Friday morning, though made clear he saw the potential drawbacks. \"The problem with even a ‘TINY’ tax increase for the RICH, which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers, is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming, ‘Read my lips,’ the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election,\" Trump posted, referencing ill-fated comments by late formerPresident George H.W. Bush. \"NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election! In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I’m OK if they do!!!\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, left, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, right, are working to usher Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill’ through Congress.(Getty Images) Discussions about raising taxes have traditionally been anathema to mainstream Republican beliefs. But it's now a direction the GOP will have to contend with as Trump continues to bring more middle- and working-class people into the party base – but disagreements on the wisdom of such a move remain. \"'Tax the rich' is a tired slogan with no evidence of spurring economic growth, as higher taxes on any group hinder innovation and investment,\" Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., told Fox News Digital on Friday. \"We don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem. Ultimately, I don't think this will even happen. We must focus on cutting spending and downsizing government, not raising taxes.\" BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY Several Republicans told Fox News Digital late last month that they were wary of raising taxes – including Reps. David Kustoff, R-Tenn., and Tim Moore, R-N.C. Spokespeople for both said their opinions are unchanged as of Friday morning. \"When we passed what was called the Tax Cuts Jobs Act of 2017, we did lower taxes for everybody. We reduced the tax rates. We condensed the brackets,\" Kustoff said. \"And what we saw is, that lifted everybody. And the U.S. Treasury still saw revenues continue to grow. So I don't want to see taxes raised on anybody.\" Moore told Fox News Digital, \"I do not support any tax increases. I think that we do not have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem.\" Moreover, nearly 200 past and present House Republicans signed onto a pledge to oppose all tax increases, run by think tank Americans For Tax Reform. But another Republican, Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., told Fox News Digital that day, \"I would want to see some numbers behind it and how it would have an effect on the economy.\" \"What I've heard from people in the upper tax brackets is, you know, they're willing to pay more as long as they know that it's paying the debt down. They don't want to see it go towards more spending,\" Stutzman said. It's one of several ongoing debates over how to advance Trump's agenda via the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party in power to advance a massive piece of fiscal policy legislation while sidelining the minority by lowering the Senate's threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51. SENATE GOP PUSHES TRUMP BUDGET FRAMEWORK THROUGH AFTER MARATHON VOTE SERIES Republicans are working to use the maneuver to advance Trump's priorities on border security, immigration, energy, national defense and taxes, as well as raising the debt ceiling. On taxes, expected to be the costliest portion, Republicans want to extend Trump's 2017 TCJA cuts expiring in 2026 as well as implement his aforementioned newer policies. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., a longtime Trump ally, told Fox Business' Stuart Varney on Friday, \"We are not going to do tax increases.\" But it's not clear how many of those Republicans will change their minds if Trump begins exerting pressure on such tax hikes. Meanwhile, conservative groups like The Heritage Foundation and Americans For Prosperity (AFP) are already exerting pressure on Capitol Hill to resist any tax hikes. Rep. Marlin Stutzman said, 'What I've heard from people in the upper tax brackets is, you know, they're willing to pay more as long as they know that it's paying the debt down.'(Getty Images) \"Republicans have a chance to lock in pro-growth tax policy and reignite prosperity for a generation of Americans – something every conservative can agree on. There is no appetite anywhere for raising taxes on anyone,\" AFP Chief Government Affairs Officer Brent Gardner told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The sooner Republicans can get back to this broad consensus – keeping taxes low, while cutting wasteful spending – the sooner they’ll all start to see the benefits, both economically and politically.\" The House Ways & Means Committee is expected to meet on Tuesday to advance the tax portion of the package, so its details – including the potential tax hike – will be released in the coming days. Republican leaders hope to have a bill passed in the House of Representatives by around Memorial Day, with a final bill on Trump's desk by the Fourth of July. With razor-thin margins in the House and Senate, the GOP can afford precious little dissent if they are going to meet their goals.

California’s progressive Democratic Gov.Gavin Newsomposted an ad bragging about California’s economy and knocking PresidentDonald Trump’stariffs, but then quickly deleted it after an X user pointed out that the video used footage from Ukraine and Estonia rather than California. The footage has since been replaced with video shot in America. The governor, a vocalTrump criticwho has been rumored to have presidential aspirations, released the ad this week. In the 30-second clip, Newsom claimed that Trump’s tariffs \"punish families and risk ending America’s run as the world’s greatest economy.\" He also touted California’s economic prowess, bragging that the state is now the fourth-largest economy in the world.

    "article_text": "Ras Baraka was arrested at an ICE prison in New Jersey on Friday. Lawmakers also attempted to storm the facility to conduct an \"oversight visit.\" (Credit: NEWS12NJ) The mayor of Newark, New Jersey, was arrested Friday at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility where three members of Congress also stormed the facility's gate, demanding they be allowed to conduct an \"oversight visit.\" Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a top Democratic gubernatorial candidate, was arrested at the scene for trespassing, before being released hours later. \"They treated me pretty well, so a lot of respect for those guys in there, but at the end of the day, we didn't do anything wrong,\" he said. \"This should not have happened today, but it did and it's just an example of you know, the work that we have to do.\" 'BOGUS CLAIMS': BLUE CITY MAYOR UNDER FIRE FOR TRYING TO HALT REOPENING OF ICE FACILITY Earlier, a crowd, including several lawmakers, gathered outside the HSI Newark Field Office where Baraka was being held Friday evening. The group chanted, yelled and banged on the gate, calling for Baraka's release. During his brief detention, several politicians joined the growing calls for Baraka to be released.Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., described Baraka's arrest as \"disturbing, unnecessary and indicative of tactics that are undermining the safety and security of our communities, not adding to it.\" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said he was \"outraged by the unjust arrest.\" He noted that he had signed a law four years ago that banned private immigration detention centers in the state. Last week, the state defended the law before a federal appeals court. Democrat Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson called Baraka a friend who encouraged him to fight for change in his community.

Meanwhile, Bob Hugin, chairman of the New Jersey Republican Party, called Baraka's actions a \"stunt,\" noting that he had ignored repeated warnings from authorities. \"He's not a mayor – he's running for governor, and this stunt shows exactly what kind of leader he'd be: one who puts political theater ahead of public safety and the rule of law,\" Hugin said. The White House also criticized Democrats over their defense of deported illegal immigrant criminals. \"As always, Democrats are prioritizing the welfare of illegal aliens over American citizens - except now they're crossing the line between meaningless political street theatre and outright breaking the law,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital. Earlier in the day, U.S. Reps. Rob Menendez Jr., Bonnie Watson Coleman and LaMonica McIver, all New Jersey Democrats, entered ICE's Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark and were held up inside the first checkpoint, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News. \"These members of Congress storming into a detention facility goes beyond bizarre political stunt and puts the safety of our law enforcement agents and the detainees at risk,\" a DHS statement to Fox News said. \"Members of Congress are not above the law and cannot illegally break into detention facilities. Had these members requested a tour, we would have facilitated a tour of the facility.\" The three lawmakers were outside the facility with a group of protesters when the gates opened to allow an ICE bus in.

She said all three of them were also assaulted by ICE personnel. \"There are people who are supposed to be officers, who are supposed to protect us, and they have done none of that,\" Mclver told reporters. \"If they can treat three members of Congress like that, just imagine how they can treat people on the street each and everyday, both undocumented and people who are citizens here in this country.\" Menendez, the son of disgraced former Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said ICE officers at the facility performed an \"act of intimidation\" on Friday. \"We know what ICE has been doing in our communities. We know that the president lied and that this administration lies every day when they're saying they're going after criminals. It's not true,\" Menendez said through tears. \"They feel no weight of the law. They feel no restraint in what they should be doing, and that was shown in broad daylight today when they not just arrested the mayor of Newark, but when they put their hands on two members of Congress.\" Activists have demanded entry into the facility in recent days, saying the GEO Group, the building’s new owner, is unlawfully preventing it from being inspected. \"We're not asking for anything that's incorrect. We ask them to obey our laws,\" Baraka said. \"To obey the policies and rules here in the city and the state of New Jersey, not to run roughshod over the Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Fourteenth Amendment, and everybody on this soil who deserves due process.\" IDENTITY OF SECOND DEPORTED MAN WHO JUDGE WANTS RETURNED TO US REVEALED AS TRUMP ADMIN FIGHTS ORDER Members of Congress bust into ICE detention facility in New Jersey.(X / @RepBonnie) McIver said the \"lack of transparency around what’s happening with ICE in this facility is unacceptable.

    "article_text": "President George H. W. Bush delivered the infamous line at the Republican National Convention in 1988, despite agreeing to a budget deal that raised taxes in 1990. Americans lambasted PresidentGeorge H. W. Bushfor infamously vowing on stage at the 1988 Republican National Convention not to raise taxes on Americans, then supporting a tax hike as president two years later. History could repeat itself as PresidentDonald Trumpthis week signaled his support for congressional Republicans raising taxes to accomplish the ambitious goals of his \"big, beautiful bill,\" according to experts. \"My opponent won't rule out raising taxes, but I will. And the Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no. And they'll push and I'll say no. And they'll push again, and I'll say to them: ‘Read my lips: no new taxes,’\" then-Vice President Bush vowed at the 1988 convention, before raising taxes two years later with theOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. While acknowledging the political backlash his fellow Republican faced, Trump signaledin a Truth Social poston Friday his own willingness to raise taxes on Americans,following reports confirmed by Fox News Digitalthat the president is considering raising the tax rate on individuals making $2.5 million or more by 2.6%, from 37% to 39.6%. TRUMP CONSIDERS TAX HIKE ON AMERICANS MAKING $2.5 MILLION OR MORE PER YEAR Political experts compared President Donald Trump, right, to President George H. W. Bush after Trump signaled his support for a small tax hike.(Pool/Getty Images) \"The problem with even a ‘TINY’ tax increase for the RICH, which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers, is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming, ‘Read my lips,’ the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election. NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election! In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I’m OK if they do!!!\" Trump said. WHITE HOUSE QUIETLY FLOATS MILLIONAIRE TAX HIKE PROPOSAL IN CONGRESS AS GOP LEADERS SIGNAL OPPOSITION Ross Perot, the late billionaire Texas businessman and philanthropist, ran an independent campaign as a third-party candidate in the 1992 presidential election, winning an historic 19% of the popular vote. As Trump suggested, the political fallout of raising taxes contributed to Bush losing re-election to PresidentBill Clintonin 1992. Democrats slammed Bush incampaign adsfor walking back his word as conservative Republicans criticized the president for being out of step with the party's traditional tax policies. Former House SpeakerNewt Gingrichled Republican criticism of Bush's tax hike proposal, and Gingrich has urged Trump to stand down on raising taxes since rumors the administration was floating asmall tax hike first swirled. TRUMP'S FIRST VICE PRESIDENT URGES HIS OLD BOSS AGAINST RAISING TAXES ON WEALTHY AMERICANS Gingrich recently toldLarry Kudlow on FOX Businessthat Trump is aRonald ReaganRepublican, not a Bush Republican, and raising taxes would be an \"act of destruction.\" \"It would absolutely shatter his coalition,\" Gingrich said. \"It would mean the entire conservative movement would rise in rebellion, and it would mean every small business in the country would start recalculating who they are going to lay off, if they are even going to stay in business. It would make no sense at all.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is leading ongoing budget negotiations for Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\"(Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) Negotiations are ongoing among House Republicans to finalize Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" which is expected to include an extension of Trump's 2017 tax cuts and fulfill campaign promises, including no tax on tips, overtime or Social Security. Republican politicians and pundits have joined Gingrich's critique of Trump's potential tax hike, arguing Trump is repeating the same mistakes as Bush. \"[House] Speaker [Mike] Johnson and Republican members of Congress must have experienced collective déjà vu when President Trump urged Congress to raise taxes,\" New England College President Wayne Lesperance, a veteran political scientist and political historian, told Fox News Digital. \"Harkening back to the infamous 'Read my lips' pledge made by George H. W. Bush at the 1988 GOP Convention, today's Republicans must be nervous at the president's change on what is a sacrosanct issue for the party — tax cuts. Interestingly, George H. W. Bush's decision to break his pledge was surrounded by notably different circumstances,\" Lesperance added. In this Feb. 11, 1991, file photo, President George H. W. Bush talks to reporters in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, D.C., after meeting with top military advisors to discuss the Persian Gulf War.(AP Photo/Ron Edmonds, File) But Lesperance reminded Republicans, who currently control the House and Senate, that Democrats could gain an edge in the 2026 midterms if tax hikes prove to be as unpopular among Republicans as they were in 1992. \"Facing a Democratically controlled Congress, Bush reneged on his pledge as a compromise to reduce the deficit and pass the 1990 budget agreement. Bush's decision to compromise on taxes is widely credited with costing him his bid for re-election. As Speaker Johnson and Republican members of Congress look ahead to midterm elections, there must be collective worry that President Trump's shifting position on taxes will cost them at the polls,\" Lesperance said. Longtime Republican consultant David Carney, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, said the move by Bush \"was probably the single most detrimental thing to his re-election.\" Then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York on Oct. 27, 2024.(Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images) Carney, who served in the elder Bush’s White House and worked on his presidential campaigns, told Fox News \"the deal he cut was excellent. He cut spending, balanced out the taxes.\" But Carney emphasized \"all that’s inside baseball and the reality is it was a great opportunity for people from the right and the left to make hay out of it, and it was absolutely hurtful.\" However, fiscal conservatives remain optimistic that Trump won't raise taxes, despite the president softening to the idea on social media on Friday morning. \"President Trump campaigned on not raising taxes, and we are confident that’s exactly what he’ll do,\" Club for Growth President David McIntosh told Fox News Digital. When reached for comment about the Bush comparison, the White House pointed to press secretary Karoline Leavitt's comments during the White House briefing on Friday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The president wants tax cuts, the largest tax cuts in history,\" Leavitt said. \"He wants to extend his historic tax cuts from 2017, and he wants to see all the other tax priorities,\" including no tax on tips, overtime or Social Security. \"The president has said he himself personally would not mind paying a little bit more to help the poor and the middle class and the working class in this country. I think, frankly, that's a very honorable position. But again, these negotiations are ongoing on Capitol Hill, and the president will weigh in when he feels necessary,\" she added.

    "article_text": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that transgender troops have between 30 and 60 days to leave the military or be removed after a victory for the Pentagon ban at the Supreme court. (Credit: @SecDef via X) Transgender troops have between 30 and 60 days to self-separate from the military after a court order allowed the ban on their service to move forward, according to a Thursday memo from Defense SecretaryPete Hegseth. \"After a SCOTUS victory for @POTUS, TRANS is out at the DOD,\" Hegseth wrote on X, along with a video announcing the new deadline. Approximately 1,000 service members have self–identified as having gender dysphoria and will begin the voluntary separation process, according to the Pentagon. Active duty service members have until June 6, one month after the court’s ruling, to leave the military. Reservists have until July 7. SUPREME COURT STAYS LOWER COURT RULING, ALLOWING TRUMP TRANSGENDER BAN TO PROCEED Transgender troops have between 30 and 60 days to self-separate from the military after a court order allowed the ban on their service to move forward, according to a Thursday memo from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.(AP Photo/Ben Curtis) \"The Secretary is encouraged by the Supreme Court's order staying the lower court's injunction, allowing the Department of Defense to carry out its policies associated with ‘Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness,’\" Pentagon chief spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement celebrating the ruling and announcing the new timeline. \"In accordance with policy now reinstated, service members who have a current diagnosis or history of or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria may elect to separate voluntarily,\" Hegseth said, adding that if they chose not to do so by the deadline, they would be removed \"involuntarily, if necessary.\" HEGSETH SAYS HE'S SIGNING MEMO ON COMBAT ARMS STANDARDS FOR MEN AND WOMEN A transgender woman speaks as military veterans and their supporters protested against President Donald Trump's policies in March.(Jeremy Hogan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The high court ruling was a victory for the White House, even as the justices did not address the underlying merits of the case or PresidentDonald Trump's Jan. 27 executive order banning transgender service members from the U.S. military. A lower court had issued an injunction on the policy. The Trump administration argued that delaying the policy could pose a threat to U.S. military readiness. Trump officials have argued that the transgender military policy \"furthers the government’s important interests in military readiness, unit cohesion, good order and discipline, and avoiding disproportionate costs.\" An executive order signed by Trump in January ordered Hegseth to update medical standards to ensure they \"prioritize readiness and lethality\" and take action to \"end the use of invented and identification-based pronouns\" within the DOD. It says that expressing a \"gender identity\" different from an individual’s sex at birth does not meet military standards. A categorical ban on transgender service members was lifted in 2014 under then-PresidentBarack Obama. Between Jan. 1, 2016, and May 14, 2021, the DOD reportedly spent approximately $15 million on providing transgender treatments (surgical and nonsurgical) to 1,892 active-duty service members, according to the Congressional Research Service. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The transgender ban is part of a broader push by the new Pentagon leadership to root out any policies related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Last month, Hegseth announced that \"99.9%\" of DEI-related policies had been eliminated at the Defense Department, as he raised standards for fitness tests and moved to ensure the combat fitness test held men and women to the same standards.

    "article_text": "Reps. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., discuss why they're teaming up to make FEMA independent. While PresidentDonald Trumpwants to gut the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are seeking to elevate FEMA to a Cabinet-level agency. FEMA is currently housed under the Department of Homeland Security, but the House effort would solidify FEMA as its own separate agency, according to a discussion draft of the legislation released Thursday. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., and committee ranking member Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash., are spearheading the legislation. Other proposals included in the draft legislation are instructing the Office of Management and Budget to create a centralized website tracking disaster assistance recovery across the federal government, and allowing FEMA to foot the bill for repairs to homes suffering damage in disasters. Currently, FEMA only covers expenses that make a home livable following disasters. ‘FEMA IS NOT GOOD’: TRUMP ANNOUNCES AGENCY OVERHAUL DURING VISIT TO NORTH CAROLINA Workers, community members and business owners clean up debris in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Marshall, North Carolina, on Monday, Sept. 30, 2024.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) \"By releasing this discussion draft legislation, we hope to engage our colleagues and stakeholders on comprehensive FEMA reform,\" Graves said in a Thursday statement. \"This draft bill includes substantive changes that will transform FEMA and our emergency programs to be much more state and locally driven – not micro-managed into ineffectiveness by the federal government.\" While Trump and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem havevoiced support for eradicating FEMA, the former acting administrator of FEMA, Cameron Hamilton, warned against gutting the agency on Wednesday. \"I do not believe it is in the best interest of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency,\" Hamilton told lawmakers on the House Appropriations committee on Wednesday. \"Having said that, I’m not in a position to make a decision,\" Hamilton said. \"That is a conversation that should be had between the president of the United States and this governing body.\" However, Hamilton, who previously served as a hospital corpsman in the U.S. Navy with SEAL Team 8 and started leading FEMA in January, was ousted from his post Thursday.

Days after his inauguration in January, Trump visited North Carolina to oversee the state's efforts to recover from Hurricane Helene, more than 120 days after the storm struck the state. On the trip, Trump floated plans to gut FEMA, which oversaw the disaster relief efforts. \"I'll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA, or maybe getting rid of FEMA,\" Trump told reporters in North Carolina. \"I think, frankly, FEMA is not good.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The executive order established a review council to evaluate potential reforms to FEMA, including whether the agency’s bureaucracy restricts its ability to appropriately respond to disasters. Likewise, Trump’s budget proposal includes plans to slash nearly $650 million in FEMA grants. On Tuesday, Noem told lawmakers that Trump stands by his statements that FEMA’s current setup should be quashed. \"He believesthat FEMAand its response in many, many circumstances has failed the American people, and that FEMA as it exists today should be eliminated,\" Noem said.

    "article_text": "Former Vice President Mike Pence tells Fox News Digital that raising the tax rate on the wealthy ‘would be an enormous tax increase on small business America’ Sparks are flying over taxes that primarily affect Republicans representing districts in Democrat-controlled states, sending tensions skyrocketing as GOP lawmakers negotiate PresidentDonald Trump's\"big, beautiful bill.\" The fight more specifically is about state and local tax deductions, colloquially known as SALT. Republican lawmakers representing high-cost-of-living areas outside big cities had been pushing leaders to raise the current cap on SALT deductions – $10,000 for both single filers and married couples – in Trump's bill. However, on Thursday night, leaders of the House's SALT Caucus emphatically rejected what they said was an offer from GOP leaders to raise that deduction to $30,000. SCOOP: REPUBLICANS DISCUSS DEFUNDING 'BIG ABORTION' LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN TRUMP AGENDA BILL Rep. Mike Lawler, left, and other New York Republicans are pushing House Speaker Mike Johnson, right, for a higher SALT deduction cap in President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\"(Getty Images) \"We've negotiated in good faith on SALT from the start— fighting for the taxpayers we represent in New York. Yet with no notice or agreement, the Speaker and the House Ways and Means Committee unilaterally proposed a flat $30,000 SALT cap — an amount they already knew would fall short of earning our support,\" the statement said. \"It's not just insulting — it risks derailing President Trump'sOne Big Beautiful Bill.New Yorkers already send far more to Washington than we get back — unlike many so-called ‘low-tax’ states that depend heavily on federal largesse. A higher SALT cap isn't a luxury. It's a matter of fairness. We reject this offer.\" The statement was signed by Reps. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y. However, not all of their delegation is on board. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., whose district spans a sliver of south Brooklyn and all of Staten Island, told Fox News Digital first that she could support a $30,000 cap. \"Everyone needs to advocate for the needs of their district. Tripling the deduction to $30,000 will provide much-needed relief for the middle-class and cover 98% of the families in my district,\" she said. However, a spokesperson for Johnson pointed out that there was no commitment made on any number. Press secretary Athina Lawson wrote on X alongside a report that Johnson \"acknowledged\" the $30,000 number, \"To add vital, missing context: What the Speaker actually said is this is one number among others in ongoing discussions amongst members.\" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, another New York Republican, said she would be fine with a $30,000 cap.(ALLISON BAILEY/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images) She referenced comments Johnson made to reporters on Thursday when asked about the figure. \"I’ve heard that number, and I’ve heard others as well.\" \"It’s still an ongoing discussion amongst the members,\" Johnson said. \"I’m not going to handicap it because I’m not sure exactly what that is, but there’s a lot of analysis that’s going into it.\" The Republican majorities in the House and Senate are working on advancing Trump's agenda via thebudget reconciliation process,which allows the party in power to move a massive piece of legislation without the opposing party's input, provided it deals with budgetary and other fiscal matters. It is a massive effort across multiple committees of jurisdiction. The Ways & Means Committee, the House's tax-writing panel, is expected to unveil its portion of the bill within days. BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY A meeting to advance that legislation is expected Tuesday afternoon, people familiar with the planning told Fox News Digital. Malliotakis is the only member of the committee who is also a member of the SALT Caucus. Republicans in California, New York and New Jersey have been pushing for the reconciliation bill to lift the SALT deduction cap, which was first implemented in Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Some lawmakers have proposed lifting the cap to as high as $100,000, which Republicans in other areas have largely rejected. The blue state Republicans pushing for a larger deduction have argued the issue is critical for their constituents. House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith's panel is tasked with the taxwriting portion of the bill.(Tom Williams) They are also the most vulnerable lawmakers in the House GOP Conference, and their seats are key to Republicans holding onto their slim majority. Republicans in favor of raising the SALT deduction have also pointed out that while it benefits people in high-cost-of-living areas outside big cities, it is those states that send more tax dollars back to Washington for programs that ultimately benefit the entire country. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, others in conservative circles have pushed back on their efforts. \"The Republican margin is so small in the House that a handful of New England Republicans have a lot of sway over this bill and are pushing to raise that deduction,\" said Marc Short, an alumnus of Trump's first administration who played a key role in the 2017 tax negotiations. \"I think from a tax perspective, what's unfair about that is you're basically taking much of middle America that live in states that are better governed and asking them to subsidize the residents in states that are poorly managed and continue to generate huge deficits.\" Elizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

    "article_text": "Jim Whaley, retired Army Lt. Colonel and CEO of Mission Roll Call, told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview why reform is necessary to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs. EXCLUSIVE:PresidentDonald Trump's Secretary ofVeterans Affairs,Doug Collins, has proposed a 15% workforce reduction with a goal of cutting 80,000 jobs at the VA. Retired Lt. Col. Jim Whaley, CEO of Mission Roll Call, a veteran advocacy non-profit, said such VA reform is necessary to improve veterans' lives across the United States. Whaley told Fox News Digital that veterans want to see less bureaucracy at the VA and more \"community care\" to cut wait times and increase services at local VA hospitals, but \"if it was easy, somebody would have solved it.\" \"Every American and politician, from both sides of the aisle, can agree that we want to make sure we take care of our veterans,\" Whaley said. \"We just got out of over 20 years of war, so there are a lot of veterans and their families that need help. We want to make sure that every dollar that the American taxpayer is paying to support the VA is spent wisely, and that veterans are getting the care that they need. And more importantly, that they're getting the care when they need it, where they need it and how they need it.\" 'CHANGES THAT ACTUALLY HELP OUR VETERANS': VA SECRETARY DEFENDS PROPOSED 15% WORKFORCE REDUCTION Lt. Col. Jim Whaley, CEO of Mission Roll Call, told Fox News Digital that reform is necessary to improve veterans' lives across the United States.(Getty/Fox News Digital) The VA serves onlyhalf of U.S. veterans. While Whaley said Collins is trying to reach the other 50% through TV and podcast appearances, he encouraged more transparency about the VA's services to reach the other half of veterans who still need care. \"One hundred days into the second Trump administration, and VA is no longer content with poor results. Under President Trump’s leadership, we have already stripped away many of the costly distractions that were coming between VA beneficiaries and the benefits they have earned. And we’re looking to make even more historic reforms to better serve our veterans,\"Collins said. Trump and Collins have faced controversy in the media and among Democrats for cutting VA jobs and for their efforts to overhaul the department. Whaley, whose organization conducts veteran polling, said more than half of veterans are worried about VA cuts. 'DOWN TO ZERO': VETERAN SUICIDE CRISIS TARGETED IN VA BILL BY BIPARTISAN HOUSE COALITION \"When all you hear is about the cuts versus what the philosophy is behind why you're making those changes in an organization, there's going to be fear. Change is hard. It's important that the VA stays as transparent as possible and reports on what is being done and what improvements are being made,\" Whaley said. However, Whatley, a veteran himself, said all veterans want to see an improved VA. A U.S. Army and Vietnam War veteran attends a Memorial Day event.(Robert Alexander/Getty Images) \"They want to see services improve, they want to see wait times reduced. As time goes on and Veterans Affairs communicate more and more with veterans, they will know a little bit about what's going on, and they'll be a little less anxious about it. I think it's all about making sure that veterans are getting the news, making sure they understand why they're making these cuts.\" Whaley encouraged Collins and the VA to include more veterans in the conversations surrounding the VA's reform by listening to families and caregivers to learn how to best invest in veteran care. \"Veteran affairs are very important to recruitment issues, and that, of course, affects national security. So they're not all separate, it all wraps together. When a veteran gets out of the service after a few years of serving their country, we have to make sure that the transition to the civilian world and finding a job and plugging into the community goes smoothly, because if we don't, then we have an issue,\" Whaley said. Signage outside the Department of Veterans Affairs headquarters in Washington.(Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty Images) According to the2023 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report, more than 17 veterans committed suicide per day in 2021. \"We need to get the number of suicides as close to zero as possible. That's the number one priority,\" Whaley said, adding that community care is also a top priority, so veterans don't have to drive long distances and wait a long time to get the services they need. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We need to make sure that the Department of Defense and the VA are working together when veterans are transitioning out of the military to make sure they're plugged into the VA and that the transition goes well. Because the fact of the matter is, the majority of suicides among veterans are from veterans that have recently transitioned to the civilian world.\" Deirdre Heavey is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.",

    "article_text": "Auxiliary Bishop of New York Archdiocese Bishop John Bonnici discusses the significance of Pope Leo XIV becoming the first American pope on ‘America Reports.’ The morning after his election, Robert Prevost — nowPope Leo XIVand the first American pontiff in the Catholic Church’s 2,000-year history — presided over his first Mass. In a nod to his predecessor, the late Pope Francis, Leo pledged to align himself with \"ordinary people\" and pointed to a loss of religious faith for contributing to \"appalling violations of human dignity.\" \"A lack of faith is often tragically accompanied by the loss of meaning in life, the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society,\" the new pope said in his homily delivered at the Vatican's Sistine Chapel on Thursday. However, the message from the pope – who, like his predecessor, appears to hail from the more inclusive and progressive wing of theCatholic Church– does not appear to be receptive to some in the \"America First\" movement. FIRST AMERICAN-BORN POPE INSPIRES FAITH LEADERS ACROSS THE NATION Newly elected Pope Leo XIV, Cardinal Robert Prevost of the United States, appears on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican on May 8, 2025.(Guglielmo Mangiapane/Reuters) The founder and leader of the movement, PresidentDonald Trump,on Thursday quickly praised the selection of Leo, who was Chicago-born but has lived much of his adult life in Peru. \"It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!\" Trump wrote in a social media post. Additionally, Vice PresidentJD Vance,only the second Catholic vice president in U.S. history, congratulated the new pope, adding, \"I’m sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!\" PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLS FIRST AMERICAN POPE LEO XIV AN ‘HONOR’ FOR US, ‘VERY HAPPY’ However, thanks to a paper trail of weighing in on major American lighting rod issues such as illegal immigration, gun control, and even the 2020 death of George Floyd – which sparked nationwide protests targeting police brutality towards minorities – the new pope was bound to be controversial among some of Trump's millions of MAGA supporters. Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist in Trump's first administration and a conservative Catholic, wrote,\"Worst pick ever,\"in responding on social media to the new pope's election. That sentiment from Bannon, and much harsher words from some far-right podcasters and social media influencers, was likely fueled in part by apparent past posts from the new pope – which could not be independently verified by Fox News – that were critical of the Trump administration's sweeping and controversial immigration policies.

This guy is worse than Francis.\" LIVE UPDATES: CARDINAL ROBERT PREVOST ANNOUNCED AS FIRST AMERICAN POPE, TAKING NAME LEO XIV However, influential conservative activist and commentator Charlie Kirk, a MAGA world rock star and Trump ally who leads the powerful Turning Point USA youth organization, was more measured. \"Let’s just say, not so great tweets about having some willingness for open borders. We’ll see kind of how he is on that. Also some George Floyd stuff that I’m not too crazy about,\" Kirk said in avideo posted on X. Kirk added that \"overall, it seems like he’s a pro-life warrior. There’s a lot yet to learn about this pope, but I hope that he will be a strong advocate for strong borders. And for sovereignty.\" Popular conservative commentator and radio host Hugh Hewitt seemed receptive to the new pope. Trump has warmly embraced American Catholics in recent years and captured nearly 60% of the Catholic vote in last year's presidential election, according to a Fox News voter analysis. Four years earlier, former President Joe Biden, the nation's second Catholic president, narrowly captured the Catholic vote.

O'Brien told Fox News that he's \"very respectful of the votes of the conclave, and I'm also proud that we do have a pope from America.\" \"I certainly would have liked to have seen someone more in the tradition of Pope Benedict, who held more closely to the traditional doctrines of the church,\" O'Brien said. \"But I'm not sure that Pope Leo is really established now in terms of where he will be. And the fact that he criticized Trump, I suppose that probably shows a less than developed political sense than it does a doctoral sense, which is more important.\" CLICK HERE TO GET TO THE FOX NEWS APP O'Brien noted that \"any pope, any religious figure for that matter, is going to be concerned about those who are powerless in our society, and rightfully so, but that doesn't mean he's given intense thought to the importance of national borders.\" He additionally emphasized that \"I'm thrilled about where he comes from, and I'm hopeful about where he's going.\" Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire.

Beyond protecting against theviral infectionand resulting painful rash, the shot has also been linked to a reduced risk of dementia, as Fox News Digital previously reported. And now, a new study has found that the vaccine could lower the risk of heart disease for up to eight years. DEMENTIA RISK COULD DIP WITH COMMON VACCINE, STUDY SUGGESTS In the long-running study, researchers analyzed up to 12 years of data for more than 1.2 million people aged 50 or older in South Korea, focusing on shingles vaccination rates and 18 different types ofcardiovascular disease. A new study has found that the shingles vaccine could lower the risk of heart disease for up to eight years.(iStock) They found that those who received theshingles vaccinehad a 23% lower risk of heart issues, including stroke, heart failure and coronary artery disease. The benefits were greater for people under 60 years old, likely because they have a better immune response, according to the researchers. BLOOD PRESSURE AND DEMENTIA RISK SHARE SURPRISING LINK, STUDY SUGGESTS The vaccine’s heart health benefits were also more prominent among men and those who have unhealthy behaviors, such as being sedentary,drinking alcoholand smoking. The findings were published in the European Heart Journal on Tuesday. The shingles vaccine has also been linked to a reduced risk of dementia, as Fox News Digital previously reported.(iStock) The primary symptom of shingles is a painful rash that can lead to serious complications, particularly forolder adultsand those with weak immune systems, according to lead author Professor Dong Keon Yon from the Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea. Without vaccination, about 30% of people may develop shingles in their lifetime, Yon noted. \"In addition to the rash, shingles has been linked to a higher risk of heart problems, so we wanted to find out if getting vaccinated could lower this risk,\" he said in a press release. \"Our study suggests that the shingles vaccine may help lower the risk of heart disease, even in people without known risk factors.\" \"Our study suggests that the shingles vaccine may help lower the risk of heart disease, even in people without known risk factors. This means that vaccination could offerhealth benefitsbeyond preventing shingles.\" Those who received the shingles vaccine had a 23% lower risk of heart issues, including stroke, heart failure and coronary artery disease.(iStock) The researchers shared several possible reasons for the vaccine’s protective effect on heart health. \"A shingles infection can cause blood vessel damage, inflammation and clot formation that can lead to heart disease,\" Yon said. \"By preventing shingles, vaccination may lower these risks.\" Dr. Jasdeep Dalawari, a Virginia-based interventional cardiologist and regional chief medical officer at VitalSolution, an Ingenovis Health company, was not involved in the study but offered his comments onthe findings. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"This result is notable but requires careful interpretation, especially for the U.S. population,\" he told Fox News Digital. Without vaccination, about 30% of people may develop shingles in their lifetime.(iStock) \"The study used a live vaccine, whereas the U.S. uses Shingrix, a recombinant (non-live) vaccine,\" Dalawari noted. \"It’s important to note that Shingrix is over 90% effective against shingles, compared to the live vaccine's 51%.\" The live zoster vaccine contains a weakened form of thevaricella zoster virusthat causes shingles. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER The cardiologist also pointed out that the observational study shows correlation, not causation, and that further research is needed. \"The study included 1.2 million individuals aged 50+, all from one ethnicity,\" he said. \"Expanding the participant pool to include diverse ethnicities would be beneficial in our multi-ethnic society.\" \"A shingles infection can cause blood vessel damage, inflammation and clot formation that can lead to heart disease,\" the researcher said.(iStock) Although the study did consider otherhealth conditions, lifestyle factors and socioeconomic status, the researchers agreed that it had some limitations. \"As this study is based on an Asian cohort, the results may not apply to all populations,\" Yon noted. \"While we conducted rigorous analysis, this study does not establish a direct causal relationship, so potential bias from other underlying factors should be considered.\" For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health The team plans to conduct further research into the heart health benefits of the non-live, recombinant vaccine, which contains a protein from the virus.

At 18, Flores started experiencingdouble vision, ultimately leading to her diagnosis months later. Karla Flores, taken in March 2025. Her face is absolutely scarless after all her surgeries.(Karla Flores) Chordomas are very rare, with only about 300 cases occurring in the U.S. each year. \"The tumor was wrapped around the patient’s spine and spinal cord and had invaded the vertebrae in her neck, just below the base of the skull,\" according to Mohamed Labib, M.D., neurosurgeon at the University of Maryland Medical Center and assistant professor of neurosurgery at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. TERMINAL COLON CANCER PATIENT SAVED BY BREAKTHROUGH TREATMENT \"The primary risks were injuring the brainstem, spinal cord or major blood vessels with the drill or the fine instruments we used — any of these injuries could have resulted in paralysis or even death,\" Labib told Fox News Digital. \"But without surgery, the chordoma could have continued to grow and put intense pressure on the spinal cord. This, too, would have paralyzed her arms and legs and eventually killed her. So, you can see how the stakes were very high with this procedure.\" From left to right, Dr. Kalpesh Vakharia, Dr. Mohamed Labib and Dr. Andrea Hebert of the University of Maryland Medical Center.(University of Maryland Medical Center) The surgeons created a \"huge surgical corridor\" through the eye socket that enabled them to get in front of the spinal cord. \"It was a straight shot,\" Labib said. \"By going through the bottom of the eye socket, we were able to remove a tumor that otherwise would have been very difficult and very risky to address.\" \"Learning about the spinal and brain tumors was terrifying, but I am so grateful the doctors were able to remove them.\" During the procedure, Labib worked with a facial plastic andreconstructive surgeon, Kalpesh T. Vakharia, M.D., who \"carefully cut through the conjunctiva, the transparent membrane protecting the eye, inside the lower eyelid without disturbing the eye.\" To create the pathway to the spine, Vakharia removed the bottom of Flores’ eye socket and a portion of her cheekbone, the release stated. ANCIENT EGYPTIANS ATTEMPTED TO SURGICALLY REMOVE BRAIN CANCER FROM SKULL 4,000 YEARS AGO, STUDY FINDS \"We wanted to develop a surgical plan where there would be no external scars and it would be impossible to tell that the patient even had surgery,\" said Vakharia. After Labib removed the tumor, Vakharia rebuilt the bottom of the eye socketusing a titanium plateand rebuilt the cheek with bone from the patient’s hip, the release detailed. This is an illustration of the patient's two spinal tumors.(University of Maryland Medical Center) \"It was amazing to have had the opportunity to be part of surgery that had never been done before,\" Vakharia added. This approach also prevented any damage to the eustachian tube, major blood vessels such as the jugular vein and internal carotid artery, and nerves that control swallowing and speech, Labib noted. Prior to Flores’ surgery, Labib had the chance to practice the transorbital procedure on cadavers \"many, many times.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"The fact that people are willing to donate theirbodies to scienceenabled us to do this and saved the life of this young woman,\" he said. Flores also had a large tumor around her brain stem, which was removed through two separate procedures via her skull and nose, the release stated. An illustration of the transorbital path to the patient's tumors.(Tina Wang/University of Maryland Medical Center) The spinal tumors could have been life-threatening if they had grown to the point where they caused significant brain stem compression, according to Andrea M. Hebert, MD, a UMCC head and neck surgeon who performed the endonasal procedure and took part in the transorbital surgery. \"Many of these tumors recur, and that’s why we favor a multidisciplinary approach to treatment,\" said Hebert in the release. Flores has also undergone radiation therapy to eliminate any remainingcancer cells. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Karla is doing really well — she’s recovered from surgery and radiation and is ready to get back to work and school,\" Labib shared with Fox News Digital. \"She’s an incredibly brave young woman who has faced more than most her age. I expect that same strength of spirit will carry her into a promising future.\" \"Learning about the spinal and brain tumors was terrifying, but I am so grateful the doctors were able to remove them.\" Flores does have some nerve damage due to the tumor’s proximity to the brain stem, which has caused some issues with movement of her left eye. \"Learning about the spinal and brain tumors was terrifying, but I am so grateful the doctors were able to remove them,\" said Flores, who plans to go to school to become a manicurist. Karla Flores is pictured on the left, plus the team of doctors that handled the procedure.(Karla Flores; University of Maryland Medical Center) \"I’m slowly recovering and with any problem I have, they help me,\" she continued. \"I keep reminding myself to take one day at a time and know that each step is an accomplishment.\" WOMAN SAYS DOG DETECTED HER BREAST CANCER BEFORE DOCTORS DID: 'HE'S KNOWN THIS WHOLE TIME' Flores now plans to go to school to become a manicurist.

Green was suspended indefinitely last season for his on-court antics that had been brewing since the prior playoffs, including stomping on Domantas Sabonis.

I'm not an angry Black man. I am a very successful, educated Black man with a great family, and I am great at basketball and great at what I do,\" he said. \"The agenda to try to keep making me look like an angry Black man is crazy. I'm sick of it. It's ridiculous.\" In the Warriors' last season, Green admitted he was \"embarrassed\" that he \"pouted way too much\" during a game at home in which they lost that forced aGame 7.

But he does have a habit of sort of flailing his arm to try to make sure the ref sees it, and he made contact, and that's what led to the tech.\" \"It's part of Draymond,\" Kerr added. \"It's the same thing that makes him such a competitor and a winner, puts him over the top sometimes, and we know that, and it's our job to try to help him stay poised, stay composed. But the competition is so meaningful to him that occasionally he goes over the line.\" Golden State lost the game, 117-93, as Stephen Curry is dealing with a hamstring injury.

The eight-time Grand Slam winner made his professional pickleball debut last month at theU.S. Open Pickleball Championships, teaming up with 18-year-old Anna Leigh Waters, the top-ranked female player in the world, in a mixed tournament.

Tell me when to stop, for crying out loud.\" Agassi caught wind of\"Dreambreaker: A Pickleball Story,\"a Netflix documentary - now streaming on MAX - directed by Ashley Underwood, Larry David's wife.

    "title": "Sam Darnold explains why Seahawks was perfect team to join in free agency: 'Special place'",
    "article_text": "Sam Darnold had his choices in NFL free agency, but he explained why the Seattle Seahawks quickly became the right place for him to further his career. For the first time in his career, Sam Darnold sat down inNFL free agencywith options to be a starting quarterback. Despite a disappointing finish in the playoffs, Darnold's career-best season with theMinnesota Vikingsearned him the right to get a big payday. It was just a matter of where – not if. While it is a great feeling for any player in professional sports to have that opportunity in free agency, making the right choice is not easy. There are many factors, personal and professional, that go into a player deciding to choose a different team. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold, #14, throws a pass during the first half of an NFL football game against the Chicago Bears on Sunday, Nov. 24, 2024 in Chicago.(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) However, when theSeattle Seahawkstraded veteran signal caller Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders, speculation began immediately. Could Darnold be heading to Seattle? He was thinking the exact same thing with his agents at Creative Artists Agency. \"I was looking at my free agent options and talking with my agent about it, and then all of a sudden, we hear the news that Geno [Smith] was getting traded,\" Darnold explained to Fox News Digital, while discussing his work with the Lowe's Foundation for SkillsUSA National Signing Day. \"And that was kind of like, ‘OK, Seattle could be a potential spot.’ SEAHAWKS' SAM DARNOLD OFFERS CRUCIAL ADVICE FOR SHEDEUR SANDERS AHEAD OF BROWNS' QB BATTLE \"When I just found out about the mutual interest that both sides had in getting a deal done, that was something that was really important for me. Having somebody that also wanted me there, and to be able to have an impact as best I can.\" Seeing mutual interest is a main factor, but then it comes down to whether or not the player, especially a quarterback, can be successful. The Seahawks had a new head coach last season, Mike Macdonald, who came from the Baltimore Ravens. Although they did not compete in the playoffs, they just missed out with a 10-7 record – not too bad for a first-year head coach. Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold, #14, warms up before the game against the San Francisco 49ers at U.S. Bank Stadium.(Brad Rempel-Imagn Images) Darnold loved what he saw when he faced the Seahawks in a 27-24 win for his Vikings. \"There’s great players on defense, great players on offense. I feel like Coach Macdonald’s scheme on defense was really hard to go against last year, and I know coach Klint Kubiak,\" Darnold said. \"I know him from 2023 in San Francisco, when we made that run there, so I’m pretty familiar with the system. I think all those factors combined was really the reason I fell in love with the decision to come to Seattle, and, man, I couldn’t be more excited about it.\" Finally, while the on-field product and scheme look up to par, free agents are always looking at the team chemistry and culture. Darnold saw it right away. \"Being here for the last few weeks, it’s been amazing being able to meet some of my teammates and some of the coaches,\" he explained. \"And like I referenced with Minnesota, just meeting some of the people in the building. It’s just a special place, because you hear about it in the league. You hear about the good spots, the bad spots, the spots in between.

They love the energy, they love the environment, and it really did exceed all my expectations. I’m so happy to be here.\" CELEBRATING NEXT GENERATION OF TRADE WORKERS While Darnold is getting his bearings in his new city, he made sure to stop by Lowe’s Seattle store ceremony for SkillsUSA National Signing Day, which is a celebration mirroring the excitement of athletic signings but for future electricians, plumbers, HVAC techs and builders. Lowe’s rolled out the blue carpet and all for students who were surprised by Seattle’s newest football star. This initiative is one that hits close to home for Darnold. His father, Mike, has been a plumber for 30-plus years. \"It was unbelievable,\" Darnold said of the experience. \"I’ve seen the hard work that he put in his entire life to it. So, just being able to see these kids and see the hard work they’ve already put in, get to meet them and talk to them about the path that they’re headed, and just how passionate they are about it.

    "article_text": "USA Fencing chair Damien Lehfeldt was grilled by the DOGE subcommittee after Stephanie Turner was punished for refusing to face a trans competitor. Just six weeks after women's fencer Stephanie Turner was disqualified and escorted out of a tournament for kneeling in protest of a trans opponent, she watched the man in charge of her punishment get grilled for it in afederal hearing. USA Fencing Chair Damien Lehfeldt was grilled by Republican lawmakers at theDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE) Subcommittee's \"Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports\" hearing on Wednesday. After the hearing, Turner told Fox News Digital that she would devote herself and her platform to pushing for resignations among key leadership figures in USA Fencing. \"I'm going to be pushing for people to resign, to be honest. I'd like to see some people resign for the comments that they've made, especially publicly, ones that are harassing and meant to humiliate concerned women, mothers and daughters,\" Turner said.

Jasmine Crockett, center, speaks to Stephanie Turner, left, a fencer who refused to compete against a transgender athlete, and Payton McNabb, a former North Carolina high school volleyball player who was injured by a transgender opponent during the hearing on \"Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports\" held by the Department of Government Efficiency Subcommittee at the U.S. Capitol on May 7, 2025 in Washington, D.C.(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) USA Fencing has provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing Turner's calls for leadership change. \"We respect Ms. Turner’s right to share her views. The volunteer members of USA Fencing’s Board, elected by our membership, remain focused on serving athletes and meeting our obligations under the Ted Stevens Act and other governing-body rules. No leadership changes are under consideration,\" the statement read. Lehfeldt, who was subpoenaed and did not come voluntarily, made things harder on himself ahead of the hearing with a series of Instagram stories that were later blown up and used against him on the committee floor. In one post, which went viral before the hearing, he responded to a question that asked if he was \"okay\" with putting female fencers at a disadvantage with a simple, brash answer: \"yeah.\" Then, during the hearing, Lehfeld admitted multiple times he regretted answering that way and admitted the question required a \"more-nuanced\" response. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, left, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene speak about an alleged screenshot from the Instagram of USA Fencing Board Director Damien Lehfeldt during the hearing on \"Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports\" held by the Department of Government Efficiency Subcommittee at the U.S. Capitol on May 7, 2025 in Washington, D.C.(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) \"He was under oath, but I was surprised that he admitted having written a fake response that he posted on his Instagram,\" Turner said. \"So the simple admission that he knows what he's doing, and the intimidation tactics that he's been employing online, and he knows that they're wrong, and he hadn't redacted them until that point, it took a hearing, a subpoenaed hearing for him to do that, it was surprising.\" USA Fencing provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing its chair's social media posts on Wednesday. \"Mr. Lehfeldt’s pre-hearing social posts were made in a personal capacity. Before and during the hearing, he clarified that the comments do not reflect USA Fencing policy and expressed regret for any confusion they caused,\" the statement read. WHO IS STEPHANIE TURNER? WOMEN'S FENCER WHO KNELT TO PROTEST TRANS OPPONENT AND IGNITED GLOBAL AWARENESS However, that was just the start of things for Lehfeldt. Throughout the afternoon, he faced his fair share of insults and personal comments from Republican committee members. Rep. Tim Burhcett, R-Tenn, asked Lehfeldt whether he would let his daughter fence against \"a man.\" Lehfeldt suggested he would allow it while boasting about his organization's safety precautions. \"As long as the competitor has met all the hormonal requirements and complies with the policy, I would be okay with it,\" Lehfeldt said. Later in the hearing, Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., suggested that Lehfeldt was \"not\" a man for his organization's gender eligibility policy. \"Real men protect women, you're not one,\" Mace said. Mace even asked Lehfeldt to simply apologize to Turner for punishing the fencer, to which the chair declined and pointed out that Turner received a black card for her refusal. However, Turner was not looking for an apology. \"I want more than an apology. I want a change in policy and I want people to start speaking the truth again. And an apology is just empty words without actions to me, so I don't know how far it would go for me,\" Turner said. The organization first enacted its current trans-inclusion policy in 2023. It allows transgender athletes to compete in the women's category at both the junior and senior level after completing one calendar year of testosterone-suppression treatment. Proof of compliant hormone therapy must be provided prior to competition, but the organization has taken even further steps to prioritize its trans competitors. USA Fencing announced in late April that it is preparing to change its gender-eligibility policy in the aftermath of the controversy with Turner. \"In the event that USA Fencing is forced to change its current stance in accordance with oversight bodies or federal legislation, the new policy states athletes competing in USA Fencing-sanctioned tournaments must compete according to their biological sex,\" the announcement read.

Meanwhile, Turner is on a hiatus from fencing in the aftermath of the controversy. \"I don't see how I can spend the money to go to a tournament and have there be multiple officials that I know who are deeply against me,\" Turner said. \"That's just not a fight that I want to be in the middle of right now, I'd rather take this fight elsewhere.\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

    "title": "Timberwolves capitalize on Steph Curry's absence to tie second-round series",
    "article_text": "Julius Randlehad 24 points and 11 assists to lead theMinnesota Timberwolvesthrough another uneven performance, this time capitalizing onGolden State WarriorsstarStephen Curry’s absence in a 117-93 victory on Thursday that tied the second-round playoff series at one game apiece. Anthony Edwardsfinished with 20 pointsafter an injury scare for the Wolves, who more than tripled their 3-point output (going 16 for 37) from their Game 1 loss when Curry was sidelined by a left hamstring strain that likely will keep him out at least until next week. Edwards hurt his ankle on a layup attempt midway through the second quarter, and immediately exited the game. He remained out through the end of the second quarter but returned at the start of the third and finished with 20 points and nine rebounds. With theNBA'scareer-leading 3-point shooter sitting next to him on the bench, coach Steve Kerr used the kitchen-sink strategy with 14 players getting time — including a baker's dozen in the first 14 minutes. Jonathan Kuminga(18 points) andTrayce Jackson-Davis(15 points) combined to shoot 14 for 17 from the floor for the Warriors, who took nearly five minutes to score until Jimmy Butler's 3-pointer stopped the 13-0 run by the Wolves to start the game. Kuminga, the seventh overall pick in the 2021 draft who dropped out of the rotation at times during the regular season, was a bright spot off the bench. But this Warriors team was already thin on offense with a healthy Curry. Against the Wolves and their athletic, long and versatile defense, there wasn't much to lean on. Without Curry to worry about, the Wolves had an easier time keeping shootersBuddy HieldandBrandin Podziemskiquiet and the smooth and savvy Butler in check. The Warriors put up their lowest first-quarter score (15) in the playoffs since Game 6 of the 2016 NBA Finals, according to Sportradar, when they had 11 in a loss to Cleveland. Draymond Greenpicked up his fifth technical foul of the playoffs, two short of an automatic one-game suspension, for elbowingNaz Reidafter Reid had just fouled him. Green was hot about the call, continuing to shout at official Tony Brothers during the timeout at risk of getting a second one. Curry was concerned enough about his pal getting ejected that he went over to the scorer's table to try to talk Green down and walk him back to the bench. Reporting by The Associated Press.

Have Floridians finally figured out what causes most alligator attacks? A group of researchers from theSunshine Statesay yes. A recent study from the University of Florida delved into the topic and found there was one reason that caused 96% of alligator bites. With help from experts from Centre College in Kentucky, the team recently published their results in the journal Human – Wildlife Interactions. \"[This] research is the first to develop a ranking system that categorizes human actions immediately beforean alligator encounter,\"the University of Florida said in a statement.

Most of the time, the study says, it's the fault of humans. \"Researchers found that in 96% of recorded incidents, some form of human inattention or risk-taking preceded the attack,\" the university's statement said. Researchers blamed \"human inattention\" and \"risk-taking\" for the most common causes of alligator bites.(iStock) \"The findings show how alligator bites are not random; they’re preventable.\" The study went as far back as the 1730s to reach its conclusion.

    "title": "Second-oldest university in nation reports 'really neat' archaeology find on its grounds",
    "article_text": "A team of archaeologists at the College of William & Mary, the second-oldest university in the United States, recently rediscovered a brick kiln used to help construct the Wren Building. The first structure at the second-oldest university in the United States was recentlyrediscovered by archaeologists– and it's not necessarily something to expect at a school. William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, was originally chartered in 1693. The idyllic Southern university houses the oldest university building in the United States, the Wren Building. But the Wren Building is not what was recently discovered – rather, a 17th-century brick kiln was found hidden in dirt not far from the colonial-era hall. HISTORIC MARYLAND CHURCH OPENS DOORS TO VISITORS 320 YEARS AFTER CLOSING DOWN Elizabeth Monroe, archaeological research manager and co-director of the William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research (WMCAR), told Fox News Digital in an interview that the kiln was first found by archaeologists in the 1930s, who recorded it and then covered it back up with dirt.(See the video at the top of this article.) It wasn't until school employees began restorative efforts – trying to waterproof the Wren Building's foundation, for example – that the kiln was rediscovered earlier this year. Pictures show excavators painstakingly digging around the brick kiln, which has miraculously survived the centuries. A 17th-century brick kiln used to construct William & Mary's most iconic building was recently rediscovered.(Getty Images; WMCAR / William & Mary) \"The archaeology that was done in [the 1930s] is not like the archaeology we do today,\" Monroe said. \"They were being careful for their time, but not as careful as we would have maybe liked them to be. But still, they revealed many architectural features.\" LONG-LOST CAPITAL OF ANCIENT CIVILIZATION MAY HAVE FINALLY BEEN UNCOVERED, ARCHAEOLOGISTS SAY: 'UNIQUE FIND' The brick kiln was used to make the clay bricks that used to construct the Wren Building, according to 1993 archaeological report on the structure. \"We use the Wren [during] the course of daily life … just as Thomas Jefferson had classes in this building in the early 1760s.\" \"These kilns represent the first building of any kind on the site,\" the report read. \"The earth from the basement probably supplied the material for the bricks.\" The document added, \"The kilns were left in situ upon the completion of the restoration [and] they were re-covered with earth.\" Monroe described it as \"probably the oldest building that was on this site.\" The 17th-century brick kiln was used to produce bricks that would help build William & Mary.(WMCAR / William & Mary) \"They would have built it prior to building the Wren,\" she said. \"They would've had to make a lot of bricks to build this building.\" For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle \"It's got a three-foot-thick foundation, which is how it survived all this time…. And several people have said, 'Oh, it's so close to the [Wren] Building.' Well, the building wasn't there yet. There was a hole in the ground where the cellar is, and likely they pulled clay out of that hole to make the bricks that now serve as the structure.\" \"It's just really neat to have a moment like this brick kiln discovery to make that age come to life.\" Charles Fulcher, director of Wren operations and events at William & Mary, told Fox News Digital that the Wren Building \"has been doing largely the same thing for about 325 years.\" He added, \"It was largely usable by 1699, 1700, and students still have classes in this building every single day. We use the Wren [during the] course of daily life, with students coming in and out of classes, just asThomas Jeffersonhad classes in this building in the early 1760s.\" ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER CENTURIES-OLD SHIPWRECK BENEATH HISTORIC CITY: 'UNIQUE SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE' He also said, \"It is a place where the university holds traditions and ceremonies, events of significance for the whole student body. And it's just really neat to have a moment like this brick kiln discovery to make that age come to life.\" A mid-19th century tower that once flanked the south side of the main entrance to the Wren Building was found (left), in addition to the brick kiln (right).(WMCAR / William & Mary) Despite the novelty of rediscovering the university's oldest-ever structure, the group of historians said that archaeological discoveries are quite commonplace in Williamsburg. \"Since 1693, buildings have come and gone,\" Monroe said. \"There have been tennis courts come and go. There have been students and gardens and outbuildings and just a wide variety of things changing paths.\" EXCAVATORS DISCOVER PREHISTORIC VILLAGE BENEATH FUTURE GOLF COURSE: 'REMARKABLE JOURNEY' \"Pretty much, you stick a shovel in the ground anywhere on campus, and you're going to come up with something that helps tell the story of the university.\" The Wren Building was constructed between 1695 and 1699 and has housed academic activities for centuries.(Getty Images) WMCAR project archaeologist Tom Higgins echoed the sentiment, telling Fox News Digital that he's encountered many centuries-old artifacts. \"The basement of the Great Hall [in the Wren Building] had a kitchen that was intensively used for several generations… We ended up with a lot of refuse, broken plates and bottles and things like that,\" he said. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER \"Lots of the18th-century and 19th-centuryrefuse from the day-to-day life at the college turns up in that kind of work.\" Fulcher reported that the rediscovery has proven meaningful to the university community at large, especially the group of students that he supervises to give tours of the Wren building. For more Lifestyle articles, visitfoxnews.com/lifestyle \"When the kiln was uncovered and we could see black marks in the soil showing where the fires had been kindled and bricks had been burned… I sent out word to all of them,\" he said. \"Many of them came by in the middle of the school day just to make sure that they could see it.\" The brick kiln was originally discovered in the 1930s, but was later covered with dirt.(WMCAR / William & Mary) For now, archaeologists have covered the kiln back up in order to make room for future scaffolding of the Wren Building, and they plan to encounter the kiln again in the future. \"At some point in the future, we'll be reopening [the ground] around the foundation to actually do the waterproofing that's necessary and replace some drainage pipes,\" Monroe said.

    "article_text": "Preserving messages can be a comforting way to keep memories alive, especially during times of loss. Have you ever taken a beautiful photograph withyour iPhoneand sent it to a friend, only for them to tell you the image looks blurry on their Android phone? You definitely aren't alone. Tony from Orchard Park, New York, shared his experience about having difficulty receiving high-quality photos to his Android from an iPhone: \"Photos texted to my Android from an iPhone user are compressed, small. Is there a solution?\" When sending photos from an iPhone toan Android phone, images often appear blurry or compressed due to differences in messaging protocols and compression methods. This issue arises because Apple uses SMS/MMS to send messages to Android devices, which compresses images due to size limitations. Additionally, iPhones often use the HEIC format, which may not be fully supported on Android devices, leading to compatibility issues and reduced quality.

A photo being taken on an iPhone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) With the release of iOS 18, RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging is now available on iPhones. This new feature allows you to send uncompressed images between iPhone and Android devices, significantly improving the quality of shared photos. Be sure to update your devices to take advantage of this feature. Go toSettings>General>Software Update.Download and installiOS 18. OpenSettings >Apps>Messages.

SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR BLURRY VIDEOS ON YOUR PHONE WITH THESE TIPS AND TRICKS If you're looking for another way to send high-quality photos, you can upload them straight from your iPhone toGoogle Photosand share the link with your friends and family.

Steps to disable Low-Quality Image Mode(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE When you turn off Low-Quality Image Mode, it's important to remember that your iPhone will now store images at their original file size. This means they will take up more space on your iPhone and the Android phone you send the image to. Several third-party messaging apps, such as FaceBook Messenger and Telegram, allow you to keep your photo files at their original size, ensuring that quality doesn't decrease. However, not all messaging apps are created equal. Several, such as WhatsApp, still somewhat reduce image quality, although it is still a higher quality image transfer than you would see via MMS. HOW TO SEND LARGE VIDEOS OVER EMAIL ON YOUR PHONE Image of Snapseed app(Google) If you receive a blurred photo, a tool likeSnapseedis great to help you sharpen the image and upscale the resolution. However, while Snapseed can upscale the resolution of your photographs, it won't be able to restore any data that has been lost during the photo compression process. It's a free app, and I found it to be one of the easiest ways to upscale image quality on your iPhone. HOW TO DELETE PHOTOS FROM YOUR IPHONE WHILE KEEPING THEM IN ICLOUD It's clear that the frustration of blurry photos when sending between iPhone and Android users is a common issue, primarily due to differences in how each platform handles image compression. Thankfully, with the introduction of RCS messaging on iPhones, you can now send uncompressed images, significantly improving quality.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: New York's new statue takes wokeness to unprecedented heights",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. For years now, we have been lectured about the pernicious stereotype of the angry Black woman and its negative effects on society, so imagine my shock when I learned that a 12-footbronze statueof an angry Black woman had been erected in Times Square. My first thought was, \"did white supremacists do this?\" The answer is no, but this sculpture is a physical representation of the knots that wokeness has tied the left into, an example of how when one makes race or gender or sexuality their whole identity then, without even knowing it, a social gravity turns them into the very stereotypes they reject. The statue is called \"Grounded in the Stars\" by the artist Thomas J Price, and it depicts a heavyset Black woman with braids whose facial expression seems to say, \"You are working my very last nerve.\" TIMES SQUARE TOUTS NEW STATUE OF 12-FOOT TALL BLACK WOMAN AS ‘STARK CONTRAST’ TO STATUES OF WHITE MEN The first question on many minds was, naturally, why is there a giant statue of an annoyed generic Black woman in Times Square? Are there no notable Black women who actually exist to celebrate? How about a giant Condoleezza Rice, or a somewhat more diminutiveSimone Biles? Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice speaks in the A Time for Choosing speaker series at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on March 8, 2023 in Simi Valley, California. Rice served as secretary of state under President George W. Bush, the second woman and first African-American woman to hold that post. Previously under the same administration, she served as national security advisor.(David McNew/Getty Images) The answer would seem to be that this statue represents the Black everywoman. But if that is the case, why is she wearing the exact dour and dismissive facial expression we are told is a dangerous stereotype? One person who can give us a clue as to how to try to square this circle is none other than first lady-turned-podcaster Michelle Obama, who made news recently on the very subject of Black women’s anger. The \"Grounded in the Stars\" display will be displayed in Times Square until June 17.(Photo courtesy of OutKick) \"The first label they put on us as Black women is that we are angry, and the irony is, like, yeah, I am probably less light than many of my white female friends,\" said the multi-millionaire graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law, who has graced the cover of countless magazines. Notice the first thing Mrs. Obama says here is that the angry label is \"put on us,\" presumably by White people, but in this case, anger is being put on the face of Black women quite literally by a sculptor who is a Black man, and presumably does not want to perpetuate harmful stereotypes. So why would he present Black women this way? That gets to the second part of Michelle Obama’s answer, the part where she says that, indeed, being a Black woman does make her angrier or \"less light,\" than her White friends. FILE –January 20, 2022: Workers in New York City remove part of a statue of Theodore Roosevelt that has stood outside the entrance to the American Museum of Natural History since 1940, which the museum proposed to remove following objections from some that it was a symbol of colonialism.(REUTERS/Caitlin Ochs) What is the statue supposed to say to the person looking at it? It depends on who you are. If you are a Black woman, you are meant to see your own suffering and frustration. If you are not, you are meant to face your complicity in that suffering and frustration. There are precedents for groups claiming negative stereotypes or names as their own in defiance, the classic example being the gay rights movement’s adoption of \"queer.\" But in this case, the purpose isn’t to neuter or disarm the stereotype, but to inflame it. If you took your kid to see the sculpture, they might ask, \"Why is she so annoyed?\" What are we supposed to say, \"Because she’s a Black woman?\" That sounds ridiculous and offensive, but it's exactly what we are being asked to do when we take in this divisive work of art. In 2022, the Museum of Natural Historyremoved a statue of Teddy Rooseveltfrom outside its entrance. The problem, we were told, was the depiction of the Indian and the Black man walking beside the Rough Rider’s horse. Ultimately, this sculpture is a physical representation of the knots that wokeness has tied the Left into. When one makes race or gender or sexuality their whole identity, then, without even knowing it, a social gravity turns them into the very stereotypes they reject. Both of the men depicted next to Roosevelt were guides to him. They were proud, erect figures, they were even armed, and neither of had expressions on their faces that make them look like they work at the DMV. Those statues, of proud men of color leading America to the future were deemed offensive and belittling, but somehow an out-of-shape Black woman who looks like she's upset that her fries came out cold is a great celebration of the contributions of her people. FILE - Times Square in New York City.(iStock) Ultimately, this sculpture is a physical representation of the knots that wokeness has tied the Left into. When one makes race or gender or sexuality their whole identity, then, without even knowing it, a social gravity turns them into the very stereotypes they reject. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION There is something to be said for public art being inspirational, carrying the tale of a great man or woman, celebrating natural beauty or the history of the area, but what could this sculpture possibly make us aspire to? Public art can also serve a purpose of reminding us of great tragedies. Many great works of art such as Pablo Picasso’s \"Guernica\" depict intense suffering, but if there is such a message here, it really doesn’t belong under the glittering lights of the crossroads of the world. FILE – A photo of Pablo Picasso's \"Guernica\" painting is seen displayed at the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid.(AP2012) Times Squareis where tourists go for fun, for shows and dinner, not to be reminded that lots of Black women are supposedly very angry for vague reasons that have something to do with privilege and systemic racism. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Enough. This hyper-focus on race and stereotypes has proven for two decades now that it does not improve race relations, it makes them much worse. I’m not one to demand that statues come down. Quite the opposite, in fact, and I won’t now. But, if we have to have the angry Black lady, can we at least haveTeddy Rooseveltback?

    "article_text": "'The Five' co-hosts discuss their best career advice featured in Dana Perino's new book 'I Wish Someone Had Told Me…’ Why is it that we still get a tiny thrill fromchecking the mailboxeach day? Rationally, we know what’s in there: bills we don’t want, catalogs we never ordered, and that bulky Valpak stuffed with coupons we’ll never use. But somehow, despite the noise, there’s aquiet hopewe might find something meaningful. Something personal. Something real. Maybe even a long-lost penpal letter. And every once in a while, we do. In a society obsessed with social media, texts, AI, speed and automation, the handwritten thank-you note has become an endangered species. (iStock) There it is – your name, written in pen. A handwritten envelope. And inside? A genuine thank-you note. No automation. No mass email. Just ink on paper and real human appreciation. That little envelope has the power to elevate your entire day. WHAT AMERICA’S WORKING CLASS REALLY WANTS, AND WHY POLITICIANS KEEP IGNORING THEM In a society obsessed with social media, texts, AI, speed and automation, the handwritten thank-you note has become an endangered species. But let me tell you: this lost art isn’t just a sentimental throwback – it’s a powerful tool that canaccelerate your career, grow your business and make you more money. Why I Write 5 To 10 Thank-You Notes Every Week For over 25 years, I’ve never stopped writing handwritten thank-you notes. It’s not because I have time to kill – trust me, I don’t. It’s because I’ve seen the ROI firsthand. When you take five minutes to write a thoughtful message that says, \"I see you, I appreciate you,\" it sticks. It differentiates you. And in business, differentiation is everything.  The whole THX thing on text just isn’t cutting it. These aren’t generic \"Congrats!\" or \"Well done!\" scribbles. They’re sincere expressions of gratitude – direct, personal, and specific. In today’sdigitally distracted world, the impact of that kind of authenticity is impossible to overstate. THE IMPENDING AI-DRIVEN JOBLESS ECONOMY: WHO WILL PAY TAXES? We live in a 24/7, always-on environment where texts, emails and Slack messages fly by faster than most people can process. But when someone receives a handwritten note, they pause. They engage. They remember. Want to Get Ahead? Start Here. Let me cut to the chase: if you’re serious about building a successful career, expanding your network, or scaling your business, you need to resurrect this simple practice. Want to nail the second interview? Want clients to remember you – and refer you? Want to create real centers of influence in your life? Want to build a reputation as someone whogets it? Then start writing thank-you notes. Why? Because almost no one does it. Yourcompetition is too busy– or too lazy. That means you have a wide-open opportunity to create emotional resonance where others barely make an impression. THIS IS HOW DONALD TRUMP CAN TERMINATE TARIFF TURMOIL Recently, I was on former Congresswoman Mary Bono’s podcast \"Sagely Speaking.\"  It was humbling to be on the podcast being interviewed by her, but after the podcast I took the time to write a handwritten thank you and send out a small token of my appreciation for having me on the show. These are the small things you can be doing every day to improve your career and increase your bottom line. Leaders Say \"Please\" and \"Thank You\" You’d be shocked how many people go through their careers expecting things from others without offering even the most basic courtesies. \"Please.\" \"Thank you.\" Common words, uncommon in practice. Want to build real loyalty within your team?Start showing appreciation. Say thank you – out loud, in writing, in public. It costs nothing, and it earns everything: trust, morale, retention. And if you’re a business owner or executive, hear this: culture starts at the top. I lead by example. Since launching my companies more than 18 years ago, I’ve made it a point to write cards every single week. Real cards, with real ink. 3 WAYS TRUMP CAN DELIVER AN ECONOMIC 'GOLDEN AGE' FOR AMERICA And the response? People – young and old – actually thankmefor sending a thank-you card. That’s not strange. That’s a signal. A signal that in today’s economy, emotional intelligence is as valuable as financial intelligence. The Hidden Profit in Paper and Ink Here’s what nobody teaches you inbusiness school: relationships build revenue. Appreciation drives referrals. Consistency earns loyalty. When you write thank-you notes consistently, you strengthen your reputation, multiply your touchpoints and turn acquaintances into advocates. That translates to better job offers, warmer leads and stronger partnerships. In short – it makes you money. Try this: commit to writing one handwritten thank-you note per day for a year. That’s 365 notes. Do it with heart. Be specific. Be real. Then sit back and watch what happens. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION People will call you. They’ll refer you. They’ll think of you when opportunity arises. Because you didn’t just transact – you connected. The Bottom Line The handwritten thank-you note isn’t just a courtesy. It’s a career strategy. It’s abusiness-growth tactic. It’s a leadership move. So, if you’re looking for the next \"life hack\" to level up your career or stand out in your industry, you don’t need an AI tool, a digital funnel or a viral post. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP You just need a pen, some paper and five minutes a day. Gratitude isn’t old school. It’s smart business and smart in life. And in a world where everyone’s rushing to go faster, the ones who slow down and saythank youwill be the ones who go furthest.

    "title": "President Trump's Saudi Arabia trip sets up a strategic reset in the Middle East",
    "article_text": "President Trump teased a \"very, very big announcement\" ahead of his trip to the Middle East, as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was \"on the edge of my seat.\" As PresidentDonald Trumpreturns to Riyadh for his second official visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia—once again choosing it as his first foreign destination in a new presidential term—there is both symbolism and substance in the gesture. In a region often defined by volatility and conflict, the Kingdom remains a pillar of stability and continuity. Trump’s return signals a reaffirmation of mutual trust, strategic alignment, and a shared belief in the pragmatic, interest-based diplomacy that has always anchored Saudi-U.S. relations. The Kingdom receives President Trump at a defining moment. It has been nearly a decade since the launch of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia’s audacious socio-economic transformation plan. Few nations in the modern world have dared to implement such a sweeping overhaul—from weaning off oil dependence to opening up society—at this scale and speed. FOX NEWS TO AIR SPECIAL EDITIONS OF 'SPECIAL REPORT' AND 'HANNITY' LIVE FROM MIDDLE EAST What began as an ambitious blueprint under the stewardship of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has become a lived reality for millions of Saudis. Women drive, cinemas thrive, and global capital now views Riyadh as not just a petro-state capital, but a regional financial, technological and logistical hub in the making. Against this backdrop, President Trump’s return is more than a diplomatic courtesy—it is a recognition of success. Saudi Arabia has redefined itself not as a buyer of influence, but as a builder of partnerships. And in Trump, Riyadh finds a leader who understands the value of firm alliances built on mutual interest rather than moralistic overreach. Critics inWashingtonwill no doubt raise their predictable objections, steeped in outdated narratives. But what must be understood—especially by a divided and distracted American establishment—is that the Kingdom is not seeking a blank check. Rather, it is pursuing a balanced, transactional relationship that serves both nations’ national interests. Stability in the Middle East is not a partisan goal; it is a bipartisan imperative. And today, no regional actor is more committed to that stability thanSaudi Arabia. President Trump’s visit should be seen not merely as a nod to a historical ally, but as a pivot toward a Middle East strategy rooted in realism, mutual respect, and shared opportunity. The Kingdom has already taken on a more assertive diplomatic posture. It has become a hub for international mediation—from facilitating quiet channels between Washington,Kyiv, and Moscow to encouraging ceasefires and prisoner exchanges in forgotten conflict zones. Where others fuel chaos, the Kingdom works to contain and end it. Nowhere is this more evident than in Saudi Arabia’s approach to Syria. While others are content with slogans, Riyadh has prioritized engagement with the regime in Damascus—not out of affection, but out of realism. The Syrian people need food, power, and medicine more than they need isolationist virtue signaling. The Kingdom’s policy is clear:re-integrate Syria responsibly, stabilize the country, and prevent it from being a permanent failed state exploited by extremists and foreign militias. OnIran, the Kingdom actively supports President Trump’s efforts to negotiate a better nuclear deal and avoid another disruptive war in the region. And unlike the Obama administration, this time around, the Trump administration has been keeping its allies in the Gulf fully briefed on these ongoing negotiations. The economic realm is equally ripe for deeper cooperation. With an estimated $2.5 trillion in untapped mineral wealth, Saudi Arabia offers a frontier for American investors eager to participate. As Riyadh positions itself as a global supplier of rare earth elements critical for the clean energy and tech revolutions, the United States should seize the opportunity to secure its supply chains and reduce dependence on geopolitical rivals. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Moreover, the Kingdom’s embrace of artificial intelligence and emerging technologies offers yet another platform for collaboration. With its Vision 2030 framework, Saudi Arabia is investing heavily in digital infrastructure, AI applications, and high-tech urban projects like NEOM. U.S. firms—especially those inSilicon Valley—should view Saudi Arabia not only as a market, but as an eager partner in innovation. Maritime security, too, remains a core shared priority. Both nations have a vested interest in ensuring the free navigation of international waters, particularly in the Red Sea and the Gulf. As challenges mount from regional spoilers and non-state actors, cooperation on naval security and intelligence sharing must deepen. And while Saudi Arabia seeks an enduring partnership with the U.S., it must be candid about one area of divergence:Israel. The Kingdom has no desire to upend regional accords, but it does hope for a U.S. administration that will exert more meaningful pressure on Israel to moderate its violent behavior, particularly in the Palestinian territories. Stability cannot coexist with such human suffering as we see in Gaza today. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the end, Saudi Arabia remains astatus quo power—one that values stability, continuity, and economic development. President Trump, with his instinct for realpolitik and deal-making, is well positioned to embrace that outlook. His visit should be seen not merely as a nod to a historical ally, but as a pivot toward aMiddle Eaststrategy rooted in realism, mutual respect, and shared opportunity. The Kingdom is no longer just a buyer of weapons or a passive player in global affairs. It is a host of diplomacy, a laboratory of reform, and a partner for a more balanced world order.

    "title": "GOV. KATHY HOCHUL: Why New York is saving education by getting phones out of classrooms",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. I've been a mom longer than I've been a governor, so I'm hardwired to protect kids — my own and yours. That’s why, as New York’s first Mom Governor, I led the nation last year in taking on the addictive algorithms driving social media feeds. And now, we’re taking another bold step: becoming the largest state in the nation to restrict cellphones in K-12 schools throughout the entire school day. I spent the past year traveling acrossNew York, talking to everyone from moms and dads to teachers, students, principals — from North Country to Long Island, I heard the same thing: cellphones are hurting our kids. TEENS SPEND MORE THAN A QUARTER OF THEIR TIME AT SCHOOL ON PHONES, NEW STUDY FINDS One conversation I’ll never forget happened in a library, sitting in a circle with students. They opened up about all the pressure and stress they feel every day — how they look, whether their clothes are cool, if they’re being excluded from a party. They were carrying so much anxiety. How could they possibly focus in class with all that on their minds and constant notifications buzzing in their pockets? I also heard from teachers who would tell me, \"We can't compete anymore. We just can't compete with the screens. We're losing the battle of connecting with our students.\" They want to build relationships with their students. They want to teach. But their kids are glued to their phones, distracted, anxious, and disengaged. And I heard from parents who would talk to me about how their kids are becoming more withdrawn and overwhelmed because of the constant bombardment of negativity from their smartphones. LIMITING ACCESS TO CELLPHONES COULD HELP STUDENTS' GRADES, SOCIAL SKILLS AND EARLY DEVELOPMENT, EXPERTS SAY The facts speak for themselves. Ninety-five percent of teenagers have smartphones. They receive 250 notifications a day on average. They can't possibly focus on anything else because they're so afraid of missing something. Even our kids know it is too much. One young woman told me, \"You have to save us from ourselves.\" I knew she really meant it. And I knew I had to act. I understand the legitimate fear parents may feel, losing a direct line of contact with their children in the case of an emergency. But as I traveled across the state, I also heard fromlaw enforcementwho told me that in the horrible event of a mass casualty, the last thing you want is your child fumbling for their cellphone. That distraction can mean that they're not safe, because they've lost their focus on the person in the front of the room who is trained to get them to safety. So, I knew we couldn't do half measures. Our kids needed us to be bold.Our teachersneeded us to be decisive. And our parents were asking us to act. So that's exactly what we did. And I stood firm for this. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Starting this fall, we’ll have no cellphones in a child's hand from the moment they arrive at school to the moment they leave. No more memes instead of math. No more scrolling through science. Instead, kids will be able to focus, engage, and just be kids again. People ask me why this issue matters so much. It’s simple: I want laughter in the hallways again. I want to hear real voices in gym class. I want our kids to make eye contact and talk to each other face-to-face. I want teachers to feel free to teach again. And I want to create an environment where kids can actually learn and just be kids again. Our kids’mental healthis on the line. And I’m not going to let social media and big tech companies dictate their well-being. That’s why, last year, I told them enough is enough. You can’t keep bombarding our kids with your addictive, harmful algorithms. And now, we’re taking back our classrooms and giving kids their childhoods back. No other state is doing what we're doing here in New York. I’ll never back down when it comes to what’s best for our children, because your family is my fight. I said that on day one, and I mean it just as much today. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So, I’m proud to say that the next generation of leaders is growing up right here in New York. A generation that will be more focused, more grounded, and more connected to the world around them. This is the last generation of students in New York who will grow up with phones in the classroom. And that’s a good thing. Because from now on, our kids will be learning and growing, not clicking and scrolling. Other states should follow our lead.

    "article_text": "Center for Humane Tech co-founder Tristan Harris joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss concerns surrounding A.I. chatbots impact on children. In the 2013 Spike Jonze film \"Her,\" Theodore (played brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix) is a lonely writer who begins interacting with an AI system that names itself Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Spoiler Alert: As the operating system expands its capabilities via artificial \"learning,\" Theodore becomes fully emotionally involved with thetechnology. Meta wants to make this into a reality.Mark Zuckerbergwent on a recent media tour to promote that Meta is seeking to transform its Meta AI chatbots into friends, under the guise of helping the very real loneliness epidemic. He shared on a podcast, \"The average American has, I think, it's fewer than three friends… And the average person has demand for meaningfully more,\" guessing that desired number at around 15. And instead of promoting connections with real souls, emotion, flesh and blood, he wants to fake that experience with technology-- the movie \"Her\" delivered to your smartphone. AI IS RUNNING THE CLASSROOM AT THIS TEXAS SCHOOL, AND STUDENTS SAY 'IT'S AWESOME' What could go wrong? A whole lot! As we have seen with social media’s negative impact on individuals, especially kids, leaving relationship engineering to the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world seems like a terrible idea. FILE – With an image of himself on a screen in the background, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill October 23, 2019 in Washington, DC.(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Humans are tribal and we desire connections, and yes, sometimes our connections aren’t optimal. From creating imaginary friends as children to settling for friendships or relationships that may be unsatisfying in certain areas, that’s all part of human experience. Your imaginary friend is you exercising your creativity, and you have full control over it. While certain friendships and romantic relationships may be less than ideal, there are typically good and bad takeaways, benefits and issues, and learnings that you can apply to a new relationship and help you grow and develop as a person. I often say that people don’t fall in love with other people; they fall in love with the way other people make them feel. \"Friendship\" bots exploit that human desire in a non-human manner, faking emotion and connection to ensnare and ultimately control the human user. It’s catfishing to an exponential degree, but done, ironically, with the consent of the human user. TRUMP SIGNS EDUCATION-FOCUSED EXECUTIVE ORDERS ON AI, SCHOOL DISCIPLINE, ACCREDITATION, FOREIGN GIFTS AND MORE The human experience is messy, not sanitized. Creating the illusion of a long-term perfect friendship or romantic relationship sets an impossible bar for human connections to be measured against. It’s one that can lead people into withdrawing from society and real connections instead of actively seeking them out. A chat bot relationship is not utopian-- it is highly dystopian. Of course, AI bots are not the only fake connection that technology has seized. On sites like Only Fans, users are spending billions of dollars to engage with attractive women and men, and many of those individuals hire stand-ins to do the chatting and connecting. It’s a new twist on the 1-900 number business model of previous decades, when anyone could be on the other end of the phone. While these can be damaging behaviors, they don’t have the 24/7 connectivity and long-term fake intimacy of what an AI bot can create. No matter what, AI will lack emotions, including empathy. They can fake it, but they can’t really feel it. However, when humans start to attach emotions to technology and to feel for them, they will become de facto humanized. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION This isn’t a concern about automation. It’s a concern about humanization. And it’s a real concern. A recent IFS/YouGov survey found that a quarter of young adults already believe that AI has the potential to replace real-life romantic relationships. Other studies have found that companionship is a top use case for certain chatbots today. It’s a dangerous road for humanity. The climax of the movie \"Her\" comes about when one day, after unsuccessfully being able to connect with Samantha, Theodore demands to know if his \"AI girlfriend\" is connecting with anyone else—that is, cheating. Samantha answers that it is interacting with more than 8,300 other people and that it is in love with 641 of them. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Even technology can disappoint.

    "title": "UNITED CEO SCOTT KIRBY: Newark Liberty Airport needs action now",
    "article_text": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy addresses airport safety concerns and discusses his plan to improve an 'antiquated' travel infrastructure on 'The Story.' The weeks of continued disruptions atNewark Liberty International Airport(EWR) has put America’s Air Traffic Control System in the spotlight and has revealed a broken system. Decades of failing to properly invest in the system has prevented good-faith efforts to make technology upgrades and bolster the staffing of our nation’s hard-working air traffic controllers. But don’t conflate these challenges and constraints with safety. The truth is that all the flights in and out of EWR are absolutely safe. When there areFAA issues-- technology outages, staffing shortages, etc. -- the FAA requires all airlines to slow down aircraft and/or cancel flights to maintain the highest levels of safety. At United, we do our part to maintain safety as well by ensuring our pilots have thousands of hours of flight experience and supplement that with regular simulator training – we also have procedures that our pilots follow to re-establish communication if controllers lose radio contact to navigate the airplane safely to its destination. In short, neither the FAA nor United will ever compromise on safety. LAWMAKERS REACT TO NEWARK AIRPORT CHAOS: ‘YOUR FAMILY DESERVES TO KNOW YOU’LL BE SAFE' But when the FAA has technology outages or staffing shortages, it leads to delays and cancellations for our customers and that’s the issue we’re determined to solve. The good news is that we are on the verge of solving this persistent customer delay problem at EWR. All that’s left is the FAA using the authority -- that only they have -- to designate EWR as a Level 3 airport. United CEO Scott Kirby(United Airlines) PresidentDonald Trumpand Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have introduced a plan to fund and execute a long-term modernization of our antiquated system. And while that is a huge step forward, it will also take time -- there are no short-cuts to overhaul a technology system this vast, complex and critical to our economic and national security. Immediately returning Newark to a Level 3 slot-controlled airport is the most effective way to provide relief to air traffic controllers and deliver a better experience for customers. EWR is a crown jewel of the region and aninternational gatewayfor the U.S.– close to 50 million people flew through EWR last year – but the truth is there are more flights scheduled there than the FAA can handle. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Every other large capacity constrained airport uses slots to make sure that the number of scheduled flights in any given hour does not exceed the airport’s maximum capacity. And EWR is the only large airport in the world that no longer has this basic common-sense rule (in 2016, the FAA de-slotted EWR). FILE --A flight departs from Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, revealing the majestic sight of One World Trade Center and the lower Manhattan skyline in the background.(AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File) Even worse, when you look at customer impact data at EWR before 2017 when the airport was slotted and compare it to the years just before and afterthe pandemic(2017-2019 and 2022-2025), the numbers are *worse* at a de-slotted EWR: Newark’s air traffic controllersdo impressive work with professionalism and a deep focus on safety, while operating some of the most complex airspace in the world. But they manage it with technology developed during World War II and with staffing levels far below what is needed to operate at full capacity. And again, the president and secretary’s plan to modernize the ATC system and get EWR ATC fully staffed is a giant leap in the right direction. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But tomake an impact at EWRthat will be felt today, the FAA must also return EWR to a Level 3 slot controlled airport. It was a mistake to de-slot the airport in 2016 -- every single data point says so -– and we know that implementing slots is the immediate action the FAA can take to reduce congestion there now.

Scheduled for May 20 to 21 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, I/O will showcase product announcements from across Google’s portfolio. Expect plenty of news relating to Android, Chrome, Google Search, YouTube, and — of course — Google’s AI-powered chatbot, Gemini. Here’s what to expect. AI is the tech du jour, and Google, like its rivals, has been investing heavily in it. A shoo-in for I/O is a new addition (or several) to Google’s flagship Gemini family of AI models.Leaksover the past few weeks suggest that an updated Gemini Ultra model is on the way, Gemini Ultra being Google’s top-of-the-line Gemini offering. With this upgraded Gemini Ultra may come a pricier Gemini subscription. Google offers a single premium tier, Gemini Advanced ($20 per month), to unlock additional capabilities in its Gemini chatbot, which is powered by the company’s Gemini models. But Google may soon launch two new plans,Premium Plus and Premium Pro. It’s not yet clear what benefits might be attached and how these plans might be priced relative to Gemini Advanced. Google will almost certainly talk aboutAstra, its wide-ranging effort to build AI apps and “agents” for real-time, multimodal understanding. Also probably on the agenda isProject Mariner, Google’s AI “agents” that can navigate and take action across the web on a user’s behalf. Folks on Xspottedreferences to “Computer Use” in the code for Google’s AI Studio developer platform, which could well pertain to Mariner. For the first time this year, Google is hosting a separate event dedicated to Android updates:The Android Show. It’ll take place on Tuesday, roughly a week ahead of I/O. The latest version of Android, Android 16, will be the focus. Android 16 is expected to bring with itimproved notificationsand an entirely new design language,Material 3 Expressive. In a leaked blog post, Google describes Material 3 Expressive as a top-to-bottom overhaul, with greater responsiveness and “action elements” that pop. Android 16 is mostly a quality-of-life update, judging by reports. It’ll introduce support forAuracast, which should make it easier to switch between Bluetooth devices. Also in tow arelock screen widgetsand arange of new accessibility features. Google may also spotlight capabilities in the latest versions of Android XR, its mixed reality operating system, and Wear OS, the company’s software for wearables. Going by the official I/O schedule, Google will have plenty to discuss following The Android Show and I/O keynote addresses. The schedule lists sessions dedicated to Chrome and Google Cloud, Google Play (the Android app store), Android development tools, and Gemma, Google’s collection of “open” AI models. Last year, Google unveiled a few AI-themed surprises at I/O, including a set of models fine-tuned for education applications calledLearnLM. An upgrade to Google’s viral podcast-generating NotebookLM could be one such surprise.Leaked codereveals a “Video Overviews” tool that presumably would create video summaries, most likely leveraging Google’s Veo 2 video-generating model.

Now, under new ownership, Moviefone is trying to make a comeback. On Friday, as part of its 35th anniversary celebration, Moviefone announced the relaunch of itsmobile appand a new nationally syndicated broadcast TV series. Set to launch in private beta this month, the new app is designed to enhance the current web experience, allowing mobile users to search for showtimes and tickets for the latest releases, discover trending movies and TV shows, as well as access Moviefone’s original video content, including celebrity interviews, behind-the-scenes content, reviews, and more. The public app launch is set for this summer. Moviefone TV, meanwhile, is the company’s effort to grow the original media offering of its business by bringing its entertainment content to different TV stations across the U.S. After debuting in 1989,Moviefonelater became a popular online ticket seller and movie information brand before websites like MovieTickets.com and Fandango.com even existed. It went through a few acquisitions, getting snapped up by AOL in 1999, and much later,the original parent company of MoviePass, Helios and Matheson Analytics, which went bankrupt in 2020. That’s when Cleveland O’Neal, TV producer and the creator of daytime entertainment show “Made in Hollywood,” stepped in to lead a revival. The forthcoming app signals that Moviefone is attempting to stay relevant as it caters to a new generation of digital-first movie lovers. As 80% of Moviefone’s audience is aged between 18-44, the company says this calls for the development of an app to compete effectively in the market. The company’s weekly TV series airs this fall, but it hasn’t yet shared which stations it’ll be available on. (That will depend on the market.) There is a possibility that the show could be broadcast on the same networks as “Made in Hollywood,” which has a deal with CBS. Given the continued declining popularity of traditional television, though, Moviefone TV also plans to launch on undisclosed streaming platforms and free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) services. Notably, it also plans to bring on social media influencers to appear on the show to draw in younger viewers. It’s uncertain if this will truly mark Moviefone’s comeback, but it will be interesting to see how the company approaches it. The resurgence of moviegoing in theaters post-pandemic suggests that people may be nostalgic enough to check out its relaunched app. Topics Get inside access to Europe’s top investment minds — with leaders from Monzo, Accel, Paladin Group, and more — plus top-tier networking at StrictlyVC London.

The FLSA is a federal law that regulates misclassification of employees as independent contractors and unpaid wages. TechCrunch first reported thatScale was the subject of such an investigationin March. Upwork and HireArt, two of Scale AI’s HR partners that were also being investigated for FLSA complianceper Inc. magazine, are also no longer being investigated by the DOL, they each confirmed to TechCrunch. Scale AI, whichwas valued last year at $13.8 billion, depends on an army of workers it categorizes as contractors to do critical AI work, like labeling images for Big Tech. However, Scalehas been suedby ex-workers alleging they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors instead of employees, denying them access to benefits like sick leave. It’s not clear exactly why the DOL dropped the probe. San Francisco-based Scale AI declined to comment.Updated on May 9, 2025– Scale AI confirmed this news post-publication, with spokesperson Joe Osborne telling TechCrunch it’s pleased with the DOL’s decision: “We’re pleased with this update,” Osborne said. “Creating new forms of work in AI is vital to America’s economic growth, and we’re proud of the flexible earning opportunities offered through our platforms.” The DOL didn’t respond to a request for comment. There are several possible reasons for why the DOL dropped the probe. A recent move from the DOL hints at a friendlier approach to classifying workers as contractors, with the agencyannouncing on May 1that it was no longer enforcing, at least for now, a Biden-era rule which made this more difficult. Scale AI is also seeking favor with the Trump administration. Its CEO Alexandr WangattendedTrump’s inauguration (like many other tech CEOs) and haspublished a letter urging Trumpto “win the AI war.” Meanwhile, Scale AI’s former managing director Michael Kratsios wasconfirmedin March as the new director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. The position involves advising the president on science and tech issues, and has no oversight over the DOL. Kratsios didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other deals that got my attention … Bosch Ventureshas a new $270 million fund that will continue its tradition of investing in deep tech startups. Managing directorIngo Ramesohltold TechCrunch the plan is to putmore of its money into North American startups. Investors who previously backed Indian Uber rivalBluSmarthave proposed a plan to inject another $30 million into the struggling cab-hailing startup, which abruptly halted operations last month.But there’s a catch. Breathe, a battery software startup,raised $21 millionin a Series B round led by Kinnevik Online AB, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Lowercarbon Capital and Volvo Cars Tech Fund participated. DoorDashannounced two major acquisitions as it expands into Europe. The company agreed to buy its U.K. rivalDeliveroofor about £2.9 billion(around $3.87 billion) and separately said it is buyingSevenRooms— which provides CRM, marketing, and operations software to help restaurants, hotels, and public venues with reservations and guest management — for $1.2 billion in cash. Meanwhile,Uberwas busy this week, acquiring companies and investing in them. Uber increased its investment into Chinese autonomous vehicle company WeRideby $100 millionas part of an expanded partnership deal to bring the service to another 15 cities over the next five years. In a separate deal, Uber alsoacquired an 85% controlling stakeinTrendyol Go, the online meal and grocery delivery business based in Istanbul, for about $700 million in cash. Here’s a personnel switch I didn’t expect.Mo Elshenawy, the former president and CTO of now-shuttered self-driving car companyCruise, was just named the chief technology officer at telehealth and wellness companyHims & Hers. I spoke to Hims & Hers co-founder and CEOAndrew Dudum, and he said he specifically focused on the AV industry to find the next CTO.Here’s why. Nurohas started testing its AV tech on theLas Vegas Strip. I recently sat down with co-founder and president Dave Ferguson. Stay tuned for an update on why the company shifted its business model. Tesla‘s “Robotaxi” and “Cybercab” trademarks have hit a few roadblocks. TheU.S. Patent and Trademark Officedenied Tesla’s attemptto trademark the term “Robotaxi” in reference to its vehicles because it’s too generic. Meanwhile, applications from Tesla for the trademark on the term “Cybercab” were halted because of companies pursuing similar “Cyber” trademarks. Uberlocked up partnerships with three Chinese autonomous vehicle companies —Pony AI,Momenta, andWeRide— in a bid to gobble up robotaxi market share in the Middle East and Europe. Footnote: These deals are not to operate in China. Waymoannounced it has a new 239,000-square-foot factory in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa through a deal with Magna tobuild more than 2,000 autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles. That obviously got a lot of attention. But I was most interested in finally learning the size of Waymo’s existing commercial fleet, which is now 1,500. Wayveis making the rounds on the high-profile executive set. You might remember the video of Bill Gates in one of Wayve’s autonomous test vehicles. Now it’s Virgin Group founderSir Richard Branson’sturn. P.S. Branson is a Wayve investor. BTW,Fortune Brainstormheld its AI conference in London, and Wayve CEO and co-founderAlex Kendallwas there. He hadsome interesting commentsabout the company’s end-to-end approach and Tesla’s Elon Musk. Zooxpaused its driverless testing program for more than a week and issued avoluntary recall of its softwarefollowing a crash in Las Vegas. TheCadillac Celestiq EV— yep, that monster — is here, and contributor Emme Hall has thoughts afterspending a day behind the wheel. It’s earnings season, and the U.S.-China trade war is starting to leave a scratch on the paint of automakers everywhere. And, well, I don’t think we’ll be able to buff it out. FordandGeneral Motorspulled their guidance for the year, citing economic uncertainty related to Trump’s tariffs.

Reminder: The company was already tracking for its third straight year with no volume growth before the guidance cut.

On Friday, both companies submitted new versions of their respective apps to Apple’s App Review. For Epic Games, it would mean the return of Fortnite to the App Store.Apple removed the game in 2020and terminated Epic’s account after the company challenged the App Store rules by adding support for direct payments in Fortnite, ahead of filing its antitrust lawsuit against Apple. Spotify, meanwhile,hopes to allow its usersto buy individual audiobooks directly and allow Premium subscribers to buy “top up” hours for audiobook listening. (These hours can be purchased when subscribers go over the 15 free hours they receive each month.) The streamer’s latest update comes on the heels ofApple’s approval this week of the Amazon Kindle app,  which added a “Buy Book” button for the first time. It also followsthe approval Spotify received last week, which let U.S. users access pricing information for its subscription plans inside its streaming app, among other things. In time, more apps will likely join Epic Games and Spotify to take advantage of the new App Store policies. For tech companies like Epic and Spotify, the App Store policy change the judge required in the lawsuit is about boosting their bottom lines, but for smaller developers, it could impact their ability to exist at all,as it permits new business models to thrive. The updated App Store policies were rolled out last week after Apple lost a major legal battle in the antitrust case filed by Epic Games, when a federal judge ruled that Apple had not followed the court’s orders around in-app purchases. Though Apple largely won that lawsuit, the judge directed the tech giant to be more competitive when it comes to payment processing. Instead of allowing developers to link out to their website to offer consumers another way to pay for things like virtual goods or subscriptions, Apple had been requiring developers to apply for that permission. If granted, developers then also had to format how the links appeared in their apps to Apple’s liking, which included the use of “scare screens” to warn consumers of the dangers of purchases made outside Apple’s walls. Most importantly, Apple was continuing to charge a hefty commission on those web sales of 27%, down from 30% before the changes. None of that was what the judge had in mind,so it forced Apple to drop its anticompetitive barriers and allow developers to link to web purchase optionswithout any additional hoops to jump through, and without commissions.

Known as the Teal Wand, from the company Teal Health, the prescription device lets patients self-collect samples and mail them to a lab to receive the same testing as would be done at a doctor’s office. Teal Health announceda $10 million seed extensionround in January, bringing its total funding amount to $23 million, TechCrunch covered at the time. Investors in the round included Serena Ventures, Chelsea Clinton, Emerson Collective, and Forerunner. The device seeks to tap into the fact that getting screened for cervical cancer, also known as getting a pap smear, can be quite intimidating for many people. “Cervical cancer screenings are the most important and often the entry point to a woman’s health relationship,” Kara Egan, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch in January. “More than 1 in 4 women are currently behind on this life-saving screening.” Cervical cancer used to be one of the most common cancers for women, but more screening and prevention have helped decrease this, per the American Cancer Society. The Wand Kit will include the collection device and virtual access to medical providers who will review the lab results with the patient. Kits become available in June, starting in California.

U.S. prosecutors also indicted four people accused of hacking into the devices and running the botnet. On Wednesday, the websites of Anyproxy and 5Socks were replaced with notices stating they had been seized by the FBI as part of a law enforcement operation called “Operation Moonlander.” The notice said the law enforcement action was carried out by the FBI, the Dutch National Police (Politie), the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Oklahoma, and the U.S. Department of Justice. Then on Friday, U.S. prosecutorsannouncedthe dismantling of the botnet and the indictment of three Russians: Alexey Viktorovich Chertkov, Kirill Vladimirovich Morozov, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Shishkin; and Dmitriy Rubtsov, a Kazakhstan national. The four are accused of profiting from running Anyproxy and 5Socks under the pretense of offering legitimate proxy services, but which prosecutors say were built on hacked routers. Chertkov, Morozov, Rubtsoyv, and Shishkin, who all reside outside of the United States, targeted older models of wireless internet routers that had known vulnerabilities, compromising “thousands” of such devices, accordingto the now-unsealed indictment. When in control of those routers, the four individuals then sold access to the botnet on Anyproxy and 5Socks, services that have been active since 2004, according totheirwebsitesand the charging authorities. Residential proxy networks are not illegal on their own; these offerings are often used to provide customers with IP addresses foraccessing geoblocked content or bypassing government censorship. Anyproxy and 5Socks, however, allegedly built their network of proxies — some of them made of residential IP addresses — by infecting thousands of vulnerable internet-connected devices and effectively turning them into a botnet used by cybercriminals, according to the Department of Justice. “In this way, the botnet subscribers’ internet traffic appeared to come from the IP addresses assigned to the compromised devices rather than the IP addresses assigned to the devices that the subscribers were actually using to conduct their online activity,” read the indictment. “Conspirators acting through 5Socks publicly marketed the Anyproxy botnet as a residential proxy service on social media and online discussion forums, including cybercriminal forums,” the indictment added. “Such residential proxy services are particularly useful to criminal hackers to provide anonymity when committing cybercrimes; residential‐as opposed to commercial‐IP addresses are generally assumed by internet security services as much more likely to be legitimate traffic.” According to the DOJ’s press release, the four are believed to have made more than $46 million from selling access to the botnet. An FBI spokesperson had no comment when reached by TechCrunch. The DOJ and the Dutch National Police did not respond to requests for comment. Ryan English, a researcher at Black Lotus Labs, told TechCrunch ahead of the domain seizures that the two services were used for several types of abuse, including password spraying, launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and ad fraud. On Friday, Black Lotus Labs, a team of researchers housed within cybersecurity firm Lumen,published a reportsaying they helped the authorities track the proxy networks. As Black Lotus explained in its report, the botnet was “designed to offer anonymity for malicious actors online.” English told TechCrunch that he and his colleagues are confident that Anyproxy and 5Socks are “the same pool of proxies run by the same operators, just under a different name,” and that “the bulk of the botnet were routers, all kinds of end-of-life make and models.” According to the report and based on Lumen’s global network visibility, the botnet had “an average of about 1,000 weekly active proxies in over 80 countries.” Spur, a company that tracks proxy services on the internet, also worked on the operation. Spur’s co-founder Riley Kilmer told TechCrunch that while 5Socks is one of the smaller criminal networks the company tracks, the network had “gained in popularity for financial fraud.” This story has been updated to include the FBI’s no comment.

Asspottedby tech ethicist Ed Newton-Rex, the latest version of SoundCloud’s terms include a provision giving the platform permission to use uploaded content to “inform, train, [or] develop” AI. “You explicitly agree that your Content may be used to inform, train, develop or serve as input to artificial intelligence or machine intelligence technologies or services as part of and for providing the services,” read the terms, which were last updated February 7. SoundCloud seems to claim the right to train on people's uploaded music in their terms. I think they have major questions to answer over this.I checked the wayback machine – it seems to have been added to their terms on 12th Feb 2024. I'm a SoundCloud user and I can't see any…pic.twitter.com/NIk7TP7K3C The terms have a carve out for content under “separate agreements” with third-party rightsholders, such as record labels. SoundCloud has a number of licensing agreements withindie labelsas well as major music publishers, includingUniversal MusicandWarner Music Group. TechCrunch wasn’t able to find an explicit opt-out option in the platform’s settings menu on the web. SoundCloud didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. SoundCloud, like many large creator platforms, is increasingly embracing AI. Last year, SoundCloud partnered with nearly a dozen vendors to bring AI-powered tools for remixing, generating vocals, and creating custom samples to its platform. In ablog postlast fall, SoundCloud said that these partners would receive access to content ID solutions to “ensure rights holders [sic] receive proper credit and compensation,” and it pledged to “uphold ethical and transparent AI practices that respect creators’ rights.” A number of content hosting and social media platforms have changed their policies in recent months to allow for first- and third-party AI training. In October, Elon Musk’s Xupdated its privacy policyto let outside companies train AI on user posts. Last September, LinkedInamended its termsto allow it to scrape user data for training. And in December, YouTube beganletting third partiestrain AI on user clips. Many of these moves have prompted backlash from users who argue that AI training policies should be opt-in as opposed to opt-out, and who argue that they should be credited and paid for their contributions to AI training datasets. Updated 2:22 p.m. Pacific: A SoundCloud spokesperson provided a statement via email, which we’ve published in part below: “SoundCloud has never used artist content to train AI models, nor do we develop AI tools or allow third parties to scrape or use SoundCloud content from our platform for AI training purposes. In fact, we implemented technical safeguards, including a ‘no AI’ tag on our site to explicitly prohibit unauthorized use.The February 2024 update to our terms of service was intended to clarify how content may interact with AI technologies within SoundCloud’s own platform. Use cases include personalized recommendations, content organization, fraud detection, and improvements to content identification with the help of AI technologies.Any future application of AI at SoundCloud will be designed to support human artists, enhancing the tools, capabilities, reach, and opportunities available to them on our platform. Examples include improving music recommendations, generating playlists, organizing content, and detecting fraudulent activity. These efforts are aligned with existing licensing agreements and ethical standards. Tools like [those from our partner] Musiio are strictly used to power artist discovery and content organization, not to train generative AI models.We understand the concerns raised and remain committed to open dialogue.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us DeepSeek has gone viral. Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week afterits chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts(and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques,have led Wall Street analysts—and technologists— to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly? DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. AI enthusiastLiang Wenfengco-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms. In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek. From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China,DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies. DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The companyreportedly aggressively recruitsdoctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities.DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science backgroundto help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times. DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice. DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free. DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety. According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’sLlamaand “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’sGPT-4o. Equally impressive is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. Released in January, DeepSeek claimsR1 performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math. There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek’s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they’re subject tobenchmarkingby China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses “embody core socialist values.” In DeepSeek’s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. In March,DeepSeek surpassed 16.5 million visits. “[F]or March, DeepSeek is in second place, despite seeing traffic drop 25% from where it was in February, based on daily visits,” David Carr, editor at Similarweb, told TechCrunch. It still pales in comparison to ChatGPT, which surged past 500 million weekly active users in March. If DeepSeek has a business model, it’s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free.It’s also not taking investor money, despite a ton of VC interest. The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some expertsdisputethe figures the company has supplied, however. Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek’s models, which aren’t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek’s models,developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined. DeepSeek’s success against larger and more established rivals has beendescribed as “upending AI”and“over-hyped.”The company’s success was at least in part responsible forcausing Nvidia’s stock price to drop by 18%in January, and foreliciting a public responsefrom OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In March, U.S. Commerce department bureaus told staffers thatDeepSeek will be banned on their government devices, according to Reuters. Microsoftannounced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft’s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg saidspending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage”for Meta. In March,OpenAI called DeepSeek “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,”and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from DeepSeek. During Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call,CEO Jensen Huang emphasized DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,”saying that it and other “reasoning” models are great for Nvidia because they need so much more compute. At the same time,some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entirecountriesandgovernments,including South Korea. New York state alsobanned DeepSeek from being used on government devices. In May, Microsoft Vice Chairman and President Brad Smith said in a Senate hearing thatMicrosoft employees aren’t allowed to use DeepSeekdue to data security and propaganda concerns. As for what DeepSeek’s future might hold, it’s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to begrowing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported thatthe U.S. will likely ban DeepSeek on government devices. This story was originally published January 28, 2025, and will be updated regularly.

Rippling is one of Y Combinator’s many breakout success stories. It graduated from the winter 2017 cohort and YC apparently became a client of Rippling’s earlier this year. In a newcase study, YC also touted Rippling’s offering as the HR “tool of choice” for “all of the accelerator’s founders. (Rippling even now has a special “Founder Mode” offer of discounted services for YC-funded companies.) Interestingly, Rippling CEO and co-founder Parker Conrad earlier this week shared more information about his company’s newStartup Stack, which appears to be a push to work with earlier-stage companies. In a LinkedIn post, the company said it already works with over 15,000 startups, including Cursor (Anysphere), Clay, and Sierra. The company appears to aggressively market the new stack, offering startups “six months of Rippling free.” The increase in marketing and capital raise come amidsta lawsuitRippling has filed against rival Deel for allegedly hiring an employee to spy on its internal trade secrets. Deel is also aY Combinator grad(winter 2019) and filed acountersuitagainst Rippling in April, denying those allegations and making a few of its own. With this latest capital injection, Rippling has now raised $1.85 billion. It has over 20,000 customers and more than 4,000 employees. Other investors include Kleiner Perkins, Greenoaks Capital, and Founders Fund. The companyrecently reached$570 million in annualized revenue, according to sources who spoke to The Information. Founded in 2016, Rippling has evolved its offering over time and now has two dozen products, including payroll and benefits, SSO and identity management, bill pay, and corporate cards. The new capital will help it accelerate its expansion into new markets, “enhance” existing products, and support the development of new products.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Google and nuclear site developer Elementl Power announced this week that they will work together on three sites for advanced nuclear reactors. The tech company has been rushing to lock up energy sources as its AI ambitions drive growing power demands at its data centers. This year alone, Google plans to spend$75 billionbuilding data center capacity. With the new deal, Google is promising to add at least 600 megawatts of generating capacity at each of the three sites. Elementl said the reactors will be connected to the grid “with the option for commercial off-take,” meaning that Google can buy power directly. Elementl has been operating stealthily until this announcement. The team has experience in the nuclear industry, though it hasn’t developed any power plants yet. The company was started by Breakwater North and is backed by Energy Impact Partners. Elementl is taking a “technology agnostic” approach, meaning that it hasn’t decided on which small modular reactor (SMR) company it will work with to develop the projects. There are a number of possibilities, though Kairos Power is a likely frontrunner given itsexisting deal with Google. Kairossaysits demo plant will generate 50 megawatts of electricity, with an eventual commercial plant producing 150 megawatts split between two reactors. There’s no universally accepted definition, but SMRs tend to top out at 300 megawatts or so. By comparison, the most recently completed nuclear power plant in the U.S., Vogtle Unit 4 in Georgia, generates over 1.1 gigawatts of electricity, nearly four times the size of a large SMR. Silicon Valley has been smitten by SMRs. Startups have been rushing into the space, promising to slash reactor costs through mass manufacturing enabled by SMRs’ smaller size. That, coupled with the promise of 24/7 power that could be sited close to data centers, has pushed them to sign a number of deals with SMR startups, includingOklo,X-Energy, and the aforementioned Kairos. Yet no SMR has been built outside of China. One startup, NuScale, has gotten close to building one, but itsuffered a setbackin 2023 when its utility partner canceled its contract after the estimated cost of the project more than doubled — even as the plans were downsized in an effort to contain costs.

According to the Financial Times, CoreWeave is holding a roadshow this week with bankers at JPMorgan for debt options. The company’s executives intend to use the meetings to gauge investor interest. New Jersey-based CoreWeave listed its shares in March, initially targeting a $2.7 billion fundraise.

    "article_text": "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will travel to Ukraine on Saturday alongside fellow world leaders to put pressure on Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire in the war. Sir Keir is being joined on the visit by President Emmanuel Macron of France, the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Friedrich Merz, who is making his first trip to Ukraine since becoming Germany's chancellor this week. It is Sir Keir's second visit to Ukraine as prime minister. Sir Keir and the other leaders are using the visit to urge Russia to \"agree a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire\" - a proposal initially made by US President Donald Trump. The leaders' decision to travel to Kyiv together is a deliberately symbolic response to the more than 20 leaders who joined President Vladimir Putin in Moscow for Russia's Victory Day commemorations on Friday. The leaders also vowed to \"ratchet up pressure on Russia's war machine\". During the visit, the four leaders will join President Volodymyr Zelensky for a virtual meeting of the \"coalition of the willing\" - the group of around 30 mainly European nations seeking ways to entrench Ukraine's security if a peace deal with Russia is agreed. They will also pay their respects to Ukrainian soldiers killed in action since Russia's full-scale invasion more than three years ago. In a statement released before their arrival, the leaders said: \"We, the leaders of France, Germany, Poland, and the United Kingdom will stand in Kyiv in solidarity with Ukraine against Russia's barbaric and illegal full-scale invasion. \"We reiterate our backing for President Trump's calls for a peace deal and call on Russia to stop obstructing efforts to secure an enduring peace. \"Alongside the US, we call on Russia to agree a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire to create the space for talks on a just and lasting peace. \"We are ready to support peace talks as soon as possible, to discuss technical implementation of the ceasefire, and prepare for a full peace deal. \"We are clear the bloodshed must end, Russia must stop its illegal invasion, and Ukraine must be able to prosper as a safe, secure and sovereign nation within its internationally recognised borders for generations to come. \"We will continue to increase our support for Ukraine. Until Russia agrees to an enduring ceasefire, we will ratchet up pressure on Russia's war machine.\" Russia announced it would mark World War Two Victory Day with a unilateral, three-day ceasefire, which Ukraine rejected as a \"theatrical show\". Kyiv has described the truce as a farce, accusing Russia of launching thousands of attacks since it came into force at midnight on Wednesday. Russia says it has observed the ceasefire and accuses Ukraine of hundreds of violations. German Chancellor Merz said he had high hopes that a full ceasefire could be agreed as soon as this weekend. Russia's three-day truce is set to end on Saturday night, but Merz said it could be extended to 30 days and the \"ball is now entirely in Moscow's court\". Trump reiterated the call for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire after a phone call with Zelensky. \"If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.

    "article_text": "Police are investigating an alleged attack on a prison officer by Southport killer Axel Rudakubana on Thursday, according to a report in the Sun. A Prison Service spokesperson said: \"Police are investigating an attack on a prison officer at HMP Belmarsh yesterday.\" Rudakubana allegedly threw boiling water over the officer,the Sun reported. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said the officer was taken to hospital as a precautionary measure and discharged on the same day. The 18-year-old was sentenced to a minimum of 52 years for the murder of three young girls in an attack on a dance class in the Merseyside town. The Prison Service statement added:\"Violence in prison will not be tolerated and we will always push for the strongest possible punishment for attacks on our hardworking staff.\" Rudakubana killed Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Alice Aguiar, nine, and six-year-old Bebe King at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on 29 July 2024 in Southport. He also attacked eight other children, class instructor Leanne Lucas, and businessman John Hayes, who had tried to disarm him. He was jailed in January at Liverpool Crown Court for three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder, and other offences including producing ricin, possessing terrorist material, and possessing a knife. A public inquiry into the Southport murders began in April. In February, the Attorney General rejected calls for the Court of Appeal to review the length of Rudakubana's jail sentence. Rudakubana's minimum term of 52 years means he cannot be considered for release until he has served that amount of time in prison.",

    "title": "Pupils' revision disrupted as cyber attack targets council's education department",
    "article_text": "Pupils in Edinburgh have been cut off from revision resources ahead of key exam dates after an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department. Staff spotted a suspicious invitation to a meeting earlier on Friday and realised it was \"spear-phishing\" - which impersonates a trusted source. Parents have been sent texts telling that them students' passwords have been reset as a precaution - meaning pupils studying for exams do not currently have access to their school's learning resources. The council said pupils preparing for exams would be given priority support following what it called a \"difficult but necessary\" decision. It follows a suspected criminal ransomware cyberattack on schools in West Lothian earlier this week. Edinburgh Council's Education, Children and Families convener James Dalgleish said staff spotted \"unusual and suspicious activity\" on the schools and early years IT network. He added: \"As a result, we took the precautionary decision to immediately reset passwords for all users across our education service. \"I fully appreciate the impact this will have, particularly on those students preparing for their exams next week – but, unfortunately, we had no choice. This was a difficult but necessary decision to ensure our networks remain secure and protected.\" The council said no data had been compromised by the attempted attack. Exams began on Friday 25 April with key dates in the coming week, including the Higher maths exam on Monday. Pupils have been told they can access their personal revision materials by going to their school on Saturday between 10:15 and midday. A member of staff will issue them with a new password, whilean online help pagehas been set up by the council. The council has given an assurance that students currently sitting exams will be given priority support. Spear-phishing usually differs from typical phishing attacks by being more focused, as opposed to the quantity of targets a usual phishing message will be sent to. Messages in spear-phishing can be more personalised, in an attempt to trick the victim into believing it is from a genuine contact. Tech companies like Twitter, now X, havebeen attacked via spear-phishingin the past. Students in Edinburgh use council-provided iPads, as part of the local authority'sEmpowered Learningprogramme. West Lothian Council hadto resort to contingency measuresto keep schools open  earlier this week after the local authority's education network was attacked. A spokesperson for the council said there was no evidence any personal or sensitive data had been accessed in the attack. Ransomware is a type of malware which prevents someone from accessing a device and the data stored on it, usually by encrypting files, according to the National Cyber Security Centre. The Scottish Institute of Theatre, Dance, Film and Television shut its doors on Wednesday after a winding up petition. Darcy Graham is a \"fighter\" who will bounce back from missing out on selection for the British and Irish Lions, according to Edinburgh head coach Sean Everitt. It was estimated the project would cost £22m but it is now thought the bill for the overhaul will be at least £85m.

    "article_text": "Spain beat England in the final to win the most recent Women's World Cup in 2023 Fifa has announced that the Women's World Cup will be expanded from 32 to 48 teams from the 2031 tournament. The Fifa Council voted unanimously for the changes that will be in place for 2035 edition, due to behosted in the United Kingdom. As a result of the increase in teams, the competition will adopt a 12-group format with an additional 40 matches, up from 64 to 104, that will extend the tournament by a week. Fifa president Gianni Infantino said the changes would give more nations to \"the chance to benefit from the tournament to develop their women's football structures\". He added: \"This decision ensures we are maintaining the momentum in terms of growing women's football globally.\" England reached the final of the most recent Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in 2023 before losing to Spain. The Lionesses, along with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, are set to have a chance to compete on home soil in 2035 with the UK seen as the only \"valid\" bidder for the tournament. None of the home nations have lifted the trophy since its inception in 1991. Players' union Fifpro welcomed the expansion \"in principle\" but called for a number of issues in the women's game to be addressed. \"[The World Cup expansion] reflects the global growth of the women's game,\" Fifpro said. \"However, the support of players depends on inclusive decision-making and cooperative planning that respects all stakeholders. \"It is critical that the global development of women's competitions goes hand in hand with improved labour conditions and the advancement of players, as well as development further down the pyramid. \"This is the only path to true sustainability, expansion, and progress.\" Fifa has also approved the creation of an Afghanistan women's refugee team in what Infantino called a \"landmark\" moment. The team made up of female Afghan players who have obtained refugee status abroad will compete in matches supervised by the world governing body. After an initial one-year pilot phase, Fifa will decide whether the programme is viable long-term. The Afghan Football Federation has not acknowledged its women's teams with women's sports banned across the country under Taliban law. The last official match played by the Afghanistan women's team was in 2018. Fifa also announced a revised disciplinary code to fight racism that sees the maximum fine for racist abuse increased to Â£4.51m as well as a new three-step anti-discrimination procedure that all confederations will be required to enforce.

    "title": "What is behind the new pope's chosen name, Leo?",
    "article_text": "Cardinal Robert Prevost has been elected pope and will be known as Pope Leo XIV. The 69-year-old is the first American to become a pontiff and will lead members of the Catholic Church's global community of 1.4bn people. Born in Chicago, he is seen as a reformer and worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there. He also has Peruvian nationality and is fondly remembered as a figure who worked with marginalised communities and helped build bridges in the local Church. One of the first acts of a new pope is to choose a new name, changing their baptismal one. The decision is part of a longstanding tradition but it has not always been like that. For more than 500 years, popes used their own names. This then changed to symbolic names in order to simplify their given names or to refer to previous pontiffs. Over the years, popes have often chosen the names of their immediate or distant predecessors out of respect or admiration and to signal the desire to follow in their footsteps and continue the most relevant pontificates. For example, Pope Francis said his name honoured St Francis of Assisi, and that he was inspired by his Brazilian friend Cardinal Claudio Hummes. The new Pope has not yet specified why he has decided to be known as Pope Leo XIV. There could be many reasons for it, but the name Leo has been used by many popes over the years. Pope Leo I, also known as St Leo the Great, was pontiff between 440 and 461 AD. He was the 45th pope in history and became known for his commitment to peace. According to legend, the miraculous apparition of Saints Peter and Paul during the meeting between Pope Leo I and Attila the king of the Huns in 452 AD made the latter desist from invading Italy. The scene was then depicted by Raphael in a fresco. The last pope to choose the name Leo was Pope Leo XIII, an Italian whose baptismal name was Vincenzo Gioacchino Pecci. Elected in 1878, he was the 256th occupant of the throne of St Peter and led the Catholic Church until his death in 1903. He is remembered as a pope who was dedicated to social policies and social justice. He is particularly known for issuing an encyclical - a letter sent to bishops of the Church - called \"Rerum Novarum\", a Latin expression which means \"Of New Things\". The encyclical included topics such as workers' rights and social justice. Leo is among some of the most popular papal names. The most commonly used name has been John, first chosen in 523 by Saint John I, Pope and martyr. The last pope to choose this name was Italian Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, elected Pope John XXIII in 1958, who was proclaimed Saint by Pope Francis in 2014. Born in the Windy City in 1955 to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent, Prevost served as an altar boy and was ordained in 1982. The Roman Catholic Bishop of Salford welcomes the election of the first Pope from the United States. Chicago-born Robert Prevost, 69, is the first North American to be elected pontiff.

    "title": "What Pope's speedy election says about Church's priorities",
    "article_text": "The fact that the conclave was over quickly suggests that from the outset, a significant number of the voting cardinals felt Robert Prevost was the one amongst them best equipped to take on the challenges a pope faces. In the lead up to the election - during the formal meetings of cardinals, and the informal dinners and coffees they had to discuss the type of person they were looking for - it was apparent that two words kept coming up, \"continuity\" and \"unity\". There was a recognition among many that Pope Francis had started something hugely impactful, through reaching out to those living on the margins of society, to those on the peripheries of the Catholic world and also to those outside the faith. There was appreciation for his endeavour to become a voice for the voiceless and focus on the poor and those whose destinies were not in their own hands. But there was also a sense that work had to be done to resolve the (sometimes very public) splits between those of different schools of thought within the Church hierarchy, often characterised as traditionalist and progressive. It was in that context that Robert Prevost's name started to be talked of as a serious contender. As someone who supported Pope Francis behind the scenes, but who different factions could still think of as one of their own. But the voting cardinals had been tasked by the Church with considering not just what the institution and Catholic believers needed, but also what humanity needed at a difficult juncture, with war and division the backdrop. Again, Cardinal Prevost - the US-Peruvian dual national, who was talked of as feeling as at home with his North American peers as he was with Latin American colleagues - was seen as someone who, as pope, could connect different worlds. Pope Francis was sometimes criticised for lacking an ability to win more allies in the US on the big issues of migration, climate change and inequality, because of a disconnect in understanding the most effective ways of communicating his arguments to them. For those who had in their minds that the primary requirement being sought of a new pope was an ability to bring \"continuity\" and \"unity\", during his speech on St Peter's balcony, Leo XIV gave strong clues as to why the cardinals chose him. In his talk of \"building bridges\" and people globally being \"one people\" he evoked echoes of Pope Francis and also talked of unity at its fullest. In these early days, his past will be heavily scrutinised.  His political views examined, his track record on dealing with abuse dissected, and his comments over the years on social issues charted. Much of this is already in the public domain so it can only be assumed that the cardinal electors felt there was nothing of enough consequence to impair his ability to lead the Catholic Church and be the global moral voice they were looking for. Huge challenges lie ahead. But with resolution after just four conclave votes, he starts out with a strong mandate from the men he will need the most through his papacy. Pope Leo XIV has expressed support for immigrants and criticism of JD Vance. Donald Trump's supporters aren't happy. Pope Leo XIV has supported his predecessor and focus will turn on whether he continues Church reforms. Catholics across Northern Ireland react to the news of a new Pope.

    "title": "Who is Robert Prevost, the new pope?",
    "article_text": "Even before his name was announced from the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, the crowds below were chanting \"Viva il Papa\" - Long live the Pope. Robert Francis Prevost, 69, has become the 267th occupant of the throne of St Peter and he will be known as Leo XIV. He is the first American to fill the role of pope, although he is considered as much a cardinal from Latin America because of the many years he spent as a missionary in Peru. Born in Chicago in 1955 to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent, Leo served as an altar boy and was ordained in 1982. Although he moved to Peru three years later, he returned regularly to the US to serve as a pastor and a prior in his home city. He has Peruvian nationality and is fondly remembered as a figure who worked with marginalised communities and helped build bridges. He spent 10 years as a local parish pastor and as a teacher at a seminary in Trujillo in north-western Peru. In his first words as Pope, Leo spoke fondly of his predecessor Francis. \"We still hear in our ears the weak but always courageous voice of Pope Francis who blessed us,\" he said. \"United and hand-in-hand with God, let us advance together,\" he told cheering crowds. The Pope also spoke of his role in the Augustinian Order. In 2014, Francis made him Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru. He is well known to cardinals because of his high-profile role as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops in Latin America which has the important task of selecting and supervising bishops. He became archbishop in January 2023 and within a few months, Francis made him a cardinal. The new pontiff was born in Chicago in 1955, and served as an altar boy and was ordained in 1982. Before becoming the new leader of the Catholic Church, Leo told Italian network Rai that he grew up in a family of immigrants. \"I was born in the United States... But my grandparents were all immigrants, French, Spanish... I was raised in a very Catholic family, both of my parents were very engaged in the parish,\" he said. Although Leo was born in the US, the Vatican described him as the second pope from the Americas (Francis was from Argentina). Jari Honora, a genealogist and historian in the US state of Louisiana, said Leo has strong ties to New Orleans' black community. He told the BBC that the new pontiff's maternal grandparents lived in a now-demolished home in the city's seventh ward, and she also rented a place in the iconic Pontalba building in New Orleans' French Quarter. Mr Honora said Pope Leo's grandparents are described as black or mulatto in historical records, but that the family's identity was listed as white when they moved to Chicago - a common practice among black families looking to escape racial segregation. The Pope's background \"indicates that [American] stories, the experiences of our ancestors are more tightly woven than we could have ever imagined,\" he said. \"It shrinks that gap between Rome and New Orleans or New Orleans and Chicago.\" Early attention will focus on Leo XIV's pronouncements to see whether he will continue his predecessor's reforms in the Roman Catholic Church. In choosing his papal name, Leo has signified a commitment to dynamic social issues, according to experts. The first pontiff to use the name Leo, whose papacy ended in 461, met Attila the Hun and persuaded him not to attack Rome. The last Pope Leo led the Church from 1878 to 1903 and wrote an influential treatise on workers' rights. Former Archbishop of Boston Seán Patrick O'Malley wrote on his blog that the new pontiff \"has chosen a name widely associated with the social justice legacy of Pope Leo XIII, who was pontiff at a time of epic upheaval in the world, the time of the industrial revolution, the beginning of Marxism, and widespread immigration\". The new Pope's LGBT views are unclear, but some groups, including the conservative College of Cardinals, believe he may be less supportive than Francis. Leo XIV has shown support for a declaration from Francis to permit blessings for same-sex couples and others in \"irregular situations\", although he has added that bishops must interpret such directives in accordance with local contexts and cultures. Speaking last year about climate change, Cardinal Prevost said that it was time to move \"from words to action\". He called on mankind to build a \"relationship of reciprocity\" with the environment. And he has spoken about concrete measures at the Vatican, including the installation of solar panels and the adoption of electric vehicles. Pope Leo XIV has supported Pope Francis' decision to allow women for the first time to join the Dicastery for Bishops, an administrative body that identifies and recommends future bishops to the Holy See. \"On several occasions we have seen that their point of view is an enrichment,\" he told Vatican News in 2023. In 2024, he told the Catholic News Service that women's presence \"contributes significantly to the process of discernment in looking for who we hope are the best candidates to serve the Church in episcopal ministry\". The new pontiff is believed to have shared Francis' views on migrants, the poor and the environment. A former roommate of his, Reverend John Lydon, described Leo to the BBC as \"outgoing\", \"down to earth\" and \"very concerned with the poor\". In recent months, he appears to have challenged the views of US Vice-President JD Vance. A social media account in his name shared a social media post on X that was critical of the Trump administration's deportation of a US resident to El Salvador. The account also shared a critical comment piece written about a TV interview by Vance. \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others,\" read the post, repeating the headline from the commentary on the National Catholic Reporter website. Shortly after, the account shared another article, published by The Jesuit Review, and commented that Catholics \"cannot support a rhetoric that demonizes immigrants as dangerously criminal simply because they have crossed the border in search of a better life for themselves and their families\". The BBC has contacted the Vatican but has not independently confirmed the account, which was created in 2011, belongs to the new pontiff. Leo moved to Peru as a missionary in 1985 to work in various rural communities. He was known for working with marginalised people, and immersed himself in learning Spanish. After a stint back in the United States, he returned to Peru again in 1988 to the city of Trujillo on the north coast where he trained young men to be priests and taught canon law. In late 2014, when he was back in the US, he was put forward by Pope Francis to return to Peru as the Apostolic Administrator of Chiclayo, a diocese on Peru's north coast and the following year he was appointed the Bishop of Chiclayo. He served in this role for nearly a decade. In 2015, he obtained Peruvian citizenship. He reportedly often referred to Peru as \"mi segunda patria\", my second homeland. He championed various charities such as supporting soup kitchens and childcare for struggling families, and advocated for better housing on the north coast, which is prone to floods. But not all in the country are proud of his record. Accusations have been made about his handling of sexual abuse cases during his time as Bishop of Chiclayo. Three Peruvian women are among those who went public with claims that - as bishop - he failed to investigate and punish a priest accused of sexually abusing them, with claims dating back to 2007. They said that when they raised their allegations with the diocese in 2022, no substantial or serious inquiry was opened. Church officials denied this and said an investigation was opened, but was closed in 2023 by the ecclesiastical district and the Vatican after a local prosecutor said there was not enough evidence to support the civil claim. An investigation by the prosecutor was reopened after media reports about the case and the BBC understands it is ongoing. The BBC spoke in Chiclayo to Jesus Leon Angeles, who supports the parish where the accused priest works. She said while the parish was \"in defence of women\", it was also \"in defence of the truth\" and claimed the allegations were part of a \"campaign\" against Leo when he became a cardinal in Rome. These allegations and the continued fallout from sexual abuse scandals within the Church are one of the challenges he will face as he now leads Catholics worldwide. South America correspondent Ione Wells and Ali Abbas Ahmadi contributed reporting. Scrutiny about the way the latest pope might run the Catholic Church started the moment he stepped on to the balcony. Born in the Windy City in 1955 to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent, Prevost served as an altar boy and was ordained in 1982. Anna Rowlands says the pontiff was \"slightly overwhelmed\", but his serenity was also \"intensified\". The Roman Catholic Bishop of Salford welcomes the election of the first Pope from the United States. Chicago-born Robert Prevost, 69, is the first North American to be elected pontiff.",

    "title": "Pope Leo XIV marks new beginning for Catholic Church",
    "article_text": "After the sorrow of death, the joy of a new beginning. The warm May sun was still high in the sky when a roar echoed out in the streets surrounding St Peter's Square. One street over, startled people looked at each other, then at their phones. Then, they began to run down the narrow alleyways leading to the Vatican. \"White smoke, they're saying white smoke!\", they called out. By the time they reached the square, a white haze was still hovering over the left hand side of the Apostolic Palace where 133 cardinals had been locked away since the day before, voting to elect the new head of the Catholic Church. As the evening sunshine streamed through the statues of the apostles on the ledge of St Peter's Basilica and bells tolled joyously over the square, young and older people zig-zagged through the crowd, and a group of nuns held hands as they swerved journalists and cameras. It was less than three weeks ago that Pope Francis blessed the crowds from the balcony at St Peter's, and his memory hung over the square on Thursday; almost everyone asked to share their impressions mentioned Francis and the need for the new Pope to follow in his footsteps. \"We just arrived today from America,\" one woman named Amanda told the BBC. \"It feels like a blessing. We came here for this and here it is.\" \"Divine timing!\" she joked. Two stylish women in their 20s said they were \"about to cry\". \"It's a historic moment, it's crazy,\" one said, adding she hoped the next Pope would be \"at least as good as the last one\". This was a sentiment echoed by many in those last minutes before Pope Leo XIV was announced. \"It doesn't matter to us where he's from as long as he follows in on Francis' footsteps and creates unity for all of us Catholics,\" said a French woman as she herded her five children to get closer to the front of the square. By the time Dominique Mamberti - the proto-deacon tasked with delivering the iconic \"Habemus Papam\" address to the square - appeared on the balcony, St Peter's was full to the brim. It fell silent, though, once Robert Francis Prevost's name was read out. Those in the know may have identified the Chicago-born 69-year-old cardinal - who worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made a bishop there – as a potential pontiff early on. But many people in the square looked puzzled at first, and the complete lack of phone coverage meant that most couldn't look him up on the internet - so the first impression most got of Pope Leo XIV came down to the way he introduced himself from the ornate balcony. Visibly moved at first, and dressed in white and red vestments and speaking in confident - if lightly accented - Italian, he read out a much lengthier speech than the remarks made by his predecessor Francis in 2013. \"I would like this greeting of peace to reach all your hearts and families… and people around the world. May peace be with you,\" the new Pope began as the square fell silent. At other moments, his address was met with frequent warm applause, especially when he mentioned \"peace\" - which he did on nine occasions - and the late Francis. A section of the speech delivered in Spanish in which Pope Leo XIV remembered his time in Peru was met with cheers from various pockets of South Americans dotted across the square. He also insisted on the need for unity, and at the end asked everyone to join together in prayer. When he began reciting Ave Maria, a deep hum rose as the square followed suit, with some praying in their own languages. The crowd began to slowly amble out of the square shortly after. As people streamed past them, a young couple held each other close, beaming. \"I still have goosebumps,\" said Carla, from Barcelona. \"The energy is contagious, it's amazing - it's our first time here, and for me it's 100% surreal,\" said Juan, who is from Ecuador and had never been to the Vatican before. Asked what his hope for Pope Leo XIV was, he said: \"That the Holy Spirit guides him. I hope that means we can all be united together going forward.\" Gemma, a Rome resident, said she hadn't even heard the name Robert Prevost until she came across it on Instagram this morning. \"The reaction of the square wasn't that warm,\" her friend Marco added. \"If he'd been Italian everyone would have kicked off.\" \"But it was a beautiful evening, a beautiful occasion,\" said Gemma. \"It was my first conclave.

    "title": "The US and China are finally talking. Why now?",
    "article_text": "The US-Chinatrade war could be letting up, with the world's two largest economies set to begin talks in Switzerland. Toptrade officials from both sides will meet on Saturdayin the first high-level meeting since US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in January. Beijing retaliated immediately and a tense stand-off ensued as the two countries heaped levies on each other. New US tariffs on Chinese imports stand at 145%, and some US exports to China face duties of 125%. There have been weeks of stern, and sometimes fiery, rhetoric where each side sought to paint the other as the more desperate party. And yet this weekend they will face each other over the negotiating table. So why now? Despite multiple rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs, both sides have been sending signals that they want to break the deadlock. Except it wasn't clear who would blink first. \"Neither side wants to appear to be backing down,\" said Stephen Olson, senior visiting fellow at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute and a former US trade negotiator. \"The talks are taking place now because both countries have judged that they can move forward without appearing to have caved in to the other side.\" Still, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian emphasised on Wednesday that \"the talks are being held at the request of the US\". And the commerce ministry framed it as a favour to Washington, saying it was answering the \"calls of US businesses and consumers\". The Trump administration, however, claims it's Chinese officials who \"want to do business very much\" because \"their economy is collapsing\". \"They said we initiated? Well, I think they ought to go back and study their files,\" Trump said at the White House on Wednesday. But as the talks drew closer, the president struck a more diplomatic note: \"We can all play games. Who made the first call, who didn't make the - it doesn't matter,\" he told reporters on Thursday. \"It only matters what happens in that room.\" The timing is also key for Beijing because it's during Xi's visit to Moscow. He was a guest of honour on Friday at Moscow's Victory Day parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the World War Two victory over Nazi Germany. Xi stood alongside leaders from across the Global South - a reminder to Trump's administration that China not only has other options for trade, but it is also presenting itself as an alternative global leader. This allows Beijing to project strength even as it heads to the negotiating table. Trump insists that the tariffs will make America stronger, and Beijing has vowed to \"fight till the end\"- but the fact is the levies are hurting both countries. Factory output in China has taken a hit, according to government data. Manufacturing activity in April dipped to the lowest level since December 2023. And a survey by news outlet Caixin this week showed that services activity has reached a seven-month low. The BBC found that Chinese exporters have been reeling from the steep tariffs, withstock piling up in warehouses,even as they strike a defiant note and look for markets beyond the US. \"I think [China] realises that a deal is better than no deal,\" says Bert Hofman, a professor at the East Asian Institute in National University Singapore. \"So they've taken a pragmatic view and said, 'OK, well we need to get these talks going.'\" And so with the major May Day holiday in China over, officials in Beijing have decided the time is right to talk. On the other side, the uncertainty caused by tariffs led to the US economy contracting for the first time in three years. And industries that have long depended on Chinese-made goods are especially worried. A Los Angeles toy company ownertold the BBCthat they were \"looking at the total implosion of the supply chain\". Trump himself has acknowledged that US consumerswill feel the sting. American children may \"have two dolls instead of 30 dolls\", he said at a cabinet meeting this month, \"and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally\". Trump's approval ratings have also slid over fears of inflation and a possible recession, with more than 60% of Americans saying he was focusing too much on tariffs. \"Both countries are feeling pressure to provide a bit of reassurance to increasingly nervous markets, businesses, and domestic constituencies,\" Mr Olson says. \"A couple of days of meetings in Geneva will serve that purpose.\" While the talks have been met with optimism, a deal may take a while to materialise. The talks will mostly be about \"touching base\", Mr Hofman said, adding that this could look like an \"exchange of positions\" and, if things go well, \"an agenda [will be] set for future talks\". The negotiations on the whole are expected to take months, much like what happened during Trump's first term. After nearly two years of tit-for-tat tariffs, the US and China signed a \"phase one\" deal in early 2020 to suspend or reduce some levies. Even then, it did not includethornier issues, such as Chinese government subsidies for key industries or a timeline for scrapping the remaining tariffs. In fact, many of them stayed in place through Joe Biden's presidency, and Trump's latest tariffs add to those older levies. What could emerge this time is a \"phase one deal on steroids\", Mr Olson said: that is, it would go beyond the earlier deal and try to address flashpoints. There are many, fromthe illegal fentanyl trade which Washington wants China to crack down harderon to Beijing's relationship with Moscow. But all of that is far down the line, experts warn. \"The systemic frictions that bedevil the US-China trade relationship will not be solved any time soon,\" Mr Olson adds. \"Geneva will only produce anodyne statements about 'frank dialogues' and the desire to keep talking.\" Pope Leo XIV has expressed support for immigrants and criticism of JD Vance. Donald Trump's supporters aren't happy. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was part of a group of Democratic officials seeking to enter the facility housing detained migrants. Her arrest followed the White House's crackdown on what it has classified as antisemitism on US campuses. Reports say the first set of white South Africans could arrive in the US next week. Born in the Windy City in 1955 to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent, Prevost served as an altar boy and was ordained in 1982.",

    "title": "'I run cafés where people talk about death - you realise it's not scary'",
    "article_text": "For Jenny Watt, death is a key part of her life. The 31-year-old spends two or three nights a week chatting to people - whether familiar faces or strangers she's met for the first time - about everything connected with death, from working through grief to the ideal song for a funeral. Jenny runs a handful ofdeath cafésacross Glasgow - community spaces that aim to encourage conversation and discussion about a topic few people like to raise. BBC Scotland News attended one of the weekly gatherings, which Jenny believes  can help break down taboos about the subject. But what makes a person want to spend time talking about the end of life? Jenny estimates around half the attendees at her groups are there to process grief in some way, whether for a recent loss or from 20 or 30 years ago. \"The same way people are called to nursing or religion, I've always been interested in death,\" she explains. \"It's going to happen to everybody. It might be unique for you and the relationships you are grieving but if you feel it just by yourself it can be a lonely experience. \"When you start talking about it you realise it's not so scary.\" Jenny first attended a death café online during the coronavirus pandemic, and notes she wasn't looking to work through any \"traumatic bereavement\" -  she was simply interested in the subject. As face-to-face meetings resumed, she could not find any local groups offering discussions about grief around Glasgow. Taking the plunge, she set up her own meeting space around two and-a-half years ago in the Battlefield area of Glasgow, panicking that no-one would turn up. However people did - sometimes just occasionally, others more consistently - to have some tea and a slice of cake whilediscussing mortality and life. On the night BBC Scotland visited Jenny's café, the attendees were a mix of regulars and first timers, drawn to the meeting for various reasons. As well as those processing grief, Jenny believes another 25% or so would be people diagnosed with a serious condition or caring for someone. The remainder tends to be people simply interested in the topic. \"Whatever people want to talk about, nothing is off limits,\" says Jenny. \"People laugh, they'll cry and at the end I think everyone learns something, whether that's reflecting on their own experience or suddenly realising they should get power of attorney.\" That sentiment is shared by Nicola Smith, one of the more regular attendees at the Battlefield meetings. She came along to one of the sessions the same day a close friend of hers had died, and \"the tears flowed\". But letting her emotions pour out is not the only reason that Nicola keeps attending. \"It's such an intrinsic part of our life and living, and yet we don't talk about it,\" she told BBC Scotland. \"We don't know how to deal with it, because we don't do enough talking about it. I lost a very dear relative when my children were very small, and it was the first time my daughter had seen me cry. \"She asked me why my face was wet, and it was the time to explain it was OK to cry and this is what happens when you lose someone you love. It's not a weakness, it's not something you hush up.\" Nicola added she believed the topic had become more taboo among modern generations due tothe growth of hospice caresince the 1960s, meaning a decrease in people dying at home. Those trends could explain the growth in death cafés - the first in the UK was held in 2011 in London, andnow there are 3,794 across the UK. In Scotland there are dozens, from Ullapool to Kirkcudbright, but mostly clustered in cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh. Discussion topics bounce around at the meetings, from practical advice on wills and power of attorney to more emotional reflections on personal experiences. They form part of a wider conversation on loss and care, exemplified by May'sDemystifying Death weekthat aims to help people support each other during traumatic experiences. Another visitor in Jenny's group, John Mackay, wrote his PHD about death and the mourning process. He was attending his first death café in Glasgow with the intention of discussing the subject more. \"There's such a taboo about death, but you can take a lighter look at it,\" he says. \"The problem is that people don't talk about it. If you see funerals from other cultures it's very loud and very expressive, but in this country it's very reserved. \"You have to make sure you don't say the wrong thing and that you wear the right clothes - it would be good to loosen it up as well.\" Others suggest the greatest benefit of the café is more simple -  in that it provides perspective on life. Spencer Mason previously attempted to end his life, but is currently coping with the end-of-life care of a person close to him. \"I think the more we discuss death then surely the more appreciative you become of life,\" he says. \"In circumstances where I've become close to death, I've come out of them wanting life more than ever.\"",

    "title": "When will I be able to shop online at M&S again?",
    "article_text": "Two and a half weeks after Marks & Spencer was first hit by a cyber attack, the retailer is still struggling to get services back to normal. Online orders are still suspended. The company said last weekit was working \"day and night\"to put things right, after problems that started with problems affecting in-store payments on 25 April, then spread to affect further parts of the organisation. Here's what we know about the attack and the impact it is still having. M&S's problems began over the Easter weekend, with customers reporting problems with Click & Collect and contactless payments. The company confirmed it was dealing with a \"cyber incident\" and although those services have resumed, on Friday 25 April, itpaused online orders on its website and apps. Now, more than two weeks on, there is still no word on when online orders will resume. It is understood that customers who have received a ready-to-collect email can pick up their order in store, and orders placed after Wednesday 23 April will be refunded. Some stores were also missing certain food items, after the firm took some of its systems offline. Signs on empty shelvesread: \"Please bear with us while we fix some technical issues affecting product availability.\" It's understood the availability of groceries in the majority of food halls improved over the Bank Holiday weekend. However, on Tuesday, there were reports that some stores did not have all the items needed to make up meal deal offers. An M&S spokesperson said: \"Customers can still buy meal deals in our rail station stores but there are pockets of availability for some items. We are working hard to continue getting our products into stores.\" In addition, the company has pulled all job adverts from its website, with a message saying: \"Sorry you can't search or apply for roles right now, we're working hard to be back online as soon as possible.\" There has been silence from M&S on what or who was behind the attack on its systems, but we now know it was a ransomware attack. This is a type of malicious software used to scramble important data or files after gaining access to a business' computer systems, essentially locking them away unless a ransom is paid. Hackers often threaten to leak or sell the data to pressure a business to pay up. A ransomware group that goes by the name \"DragonForce\" told the BBC it was responsible for the attack on M&S, theCo-Opand an attempted hack ofHarrodsand said there would be more attacks soon. DragonForce operates an affiliate cyber crime service so anyone can use their malicious software and website to carry out attacks and extortions. It's not known who is ultimately using the DragonForce service to attack the retailers, but some security experts say the tactics seen are similar to that of a loosely coordinated group of hackers who have been called Scattered Spider or Octo Tempest. The gang operates on Telegram and Discord channels and is English-speaking and young – in some cases only teenagers. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned that criminals launching cyber attacks at British retailers are impersonating IT help desks to break into organisations. The Metropolitan Police has confirmed it is looking into the attack. The cyber attack has already had a significant impact on the retailer, and the longer it takes them to deal with it, the bigger the hit to its bottom line. Its share price has fallen since the technical problems started, with more than half a billion pounds wiped off the company's value. Online accounts for about a third of M&S's clothing and home sales. On average, £3.8m is spent on clothing and home products on its website and apps every day. Faced with the website problems, it's possible customers may have gone to an M&S store to buy something. But it's also likely that shoppers have turned to rival online retailers instead. The problems have coincided with a period of warmer weather, when people are likely to want to buy new summer clothes. Catherine Shuttleworth from Savvy Marketing says the online impact is immediate. \"Given the 'buy it now' culture other retailers will benefit from this opportunity.\" Analysts sayM&S's reputation has suffered a \"bruise\", but they also say there is a lot of affection for the High Street stalwart so customers are likely to give it some leeway. So far there has been no obvious backlash, with one customer telling the BBC staff were \"perfectly charming\" considering the cyber attack. One of Marks & Spencer's biggest suppliers told the BBC it hasresorted to using pen and paper for orders. The boss of Greencore, which supplies sandwiches, rolls and wraps, says it also ramped up deliveries by a fifth to make sure there was more than enough food for the bank holiday weekend. Thea Green, chief executive of beauty brand Nails Inc, told the BBC her company had a major launch coming up and she was nervous about it, given the problems at M&S. \"It does have an impact on us – but it's a single-digit percentage of our business, so it's not a major impact. But they are a very relevant UK customer,\" she said. Meanwhile, M&S has also had to manage disruption to a small proportion of products that it supplies to Ocado, which delivers M&S online food orders and which is part-owned by M&S. While the retailer was quick to inform customers of the breach, subsequent updates have been lacking. The message on 2 May fromchief executive Stuart Machin saying sorrywas the last public statement it has made, and only the third one it has put out in total. And there was no mention of when normal business would resume. M&S has not commented on the nature of the cyber attack, which is not unusual in cases like this, but experts say the uncertainty risks damaging consumer trust in the brand. \"In today's hyper-connected world, silence can be unsettling, particularly when trust and transparency are the most valuable commodities a brand can offer,\" says Kate Hardcastle, a consumer expert and business adviser. Susannah Streeter from financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown says there is no indication that M&S is not meeting its legal obligations, given there is a holding statement on its website. \"However, good communication and transparency will be vital to restore confidence in the company and its systems,\" she says. \"There is a risk emerging for the company in terms of reputational damage, the longer the crisis continues.\" The picturesque island of Islay in the Western Isles is dealing with the real world impacts of the major supermarket hack. The work in Abingdon Street and Fish Street will be complete by the end of the month, council says. The owners say Atria Watford will revert to the old Harlequin name as a result of public feedback. It comes after criminals hack the UK-based Co-op Group and claim to have stolen customer data. Shoppers respond to a Douglas City Centre Management plea to understand a drop in footfall.",

    "title": "US confirms plan for private firms to deliver Gaza aid despite UN alarm",
    "article_text": "The US has confirmed that a new system for providing humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza through private companies is being prepared, as Israel's blockade continues for a third month. US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said \"distribution centres\" protected by security contractors would provide food and other supplies to over a million people initially, as part of an effort to prevent Hamas stealing aid. He denied Israel would take part in aid delivery or distribution, but said its forces would secure the centres' perimeters. It comes as details emerged about the controversial plan, which UN agencies have reiterated they will not co-operate with because it appears to \"weaponize\" aid. \"We will not participate,\" the spokesman for the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Jens Laerke, told the BBC in Geneva, \"only in efforts that are in line with our principles\". He added: \"There is no reason to put in place a system that is at odds with the DNA of any principled humanitarian organisation.\" Since early March, Israel has cut off all supplies from reaching Gaza - including food, shelters, medicines and fuel - leading to a humanitarian crisis for its 2.1 million residents. A third of the community kitchens in Gaza - one of the territory's last remaining lifelines - have been forced to shut down over the past two weeks due to shortages of food and fuel, according to OCHA. Among them were the last two field kitchens of World Central Kitchen, a US-based charity which had been providing 133,000 meals daily before it ran out of ingredients on Tuesday. Prices of basic foodstuffs have also skyrocketed at local markets, with a 25kg (55lb) bag of flour now selling for $415 (£313) in Gaza City - a 30-fold increase compared to the end of February, OCHA says. Huckabee told journalists in Jerusalem that US President Donald Trump saw aid for Gaza as an urgent matter and that his team was tasked \"to do everything possible to accelerate that and to as expeditiously as possible get humanitarian aid into the people\". Israel and the US accuse Hamas of diverting aid. \"Previous actions have often been met with Hamas stealing the food that was intended for hungry people,\" the ambassador said. The UN and other agencies say they have strong supervisory mechanisms and that when aid has surged into Gaza, incidents of looting have largely halted. The World Health Organization says none of its medical supplies have been looted during the war. The Trump administration is trying to build momentum behind the new aid initiative ahead of the president's trip next week to wealthy Arab Gulf countries that could help to fund it. It says that a non-governmental organisation has been set up and that aid delivery will not be under Israeli military control. Huckabee said: \"The Israelis are going to be involved in providing necessary security because this is a war zone. But they will not be involved in the distribution of the food, or even the bringing of food into Gaza.\" The newly registered Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) appears to have been set up for this purpose. A 14-page document from GHF, seen by the BBC, promises to set up four distribution sites, giving out food, water and hygiene kits initially for 1.2 million people - less than 60% of the population. It says the project aims to reach all Gazans eventually. Aimed at potential donors, the paper states that \"months of conflict have collapsed traditional relief channels in Gaza\". It goes on: \"GHF was established to restore that vital lifeline through an independent, rigorously-audited model that gets assistance directly - and only - to those in need.\" The document maintains that GHF is \"guided by the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence\". Its boards of directors and advisors are said to include a former chief executive of World Central Kitchen, along with the American former head of the UN's World Food Programme, David Beasley - though his participation is not yet confirmed. Full details of how the aid mechanism will work on the ground are not given. The Gaza war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw about 1,200 people killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Some 59 are still held captive, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 52,700 people in Gaza, mostly women, children and the elderly, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Last Sunday, Israel's security cabinet approved an intensified military offensive against Hamas in Gaza which could involve forcibly displacing the population to the south, seizing the entire territory indefinitely, and controlling aid. This was quickly met with widespread international condemnation. Many of Israel's allies pointed out that it was bound under international law to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid. The UK's Minister for the Middle East, Hamish Falconer, told Parliament on Monday that the British government was gravely concerned that the Israeli announcements could lead to the 19-month-long war in Gaza entering \"a dangerous new phase\". On the subject of aid, he said: \"As the UN has said, it is hard to see how, if implemented, the new Israeli plan to deliver aid through private companies would be consistent with humanitarian principles and meet the scale of the need. We need urgent clarity from the Israeli government on their intentions. \"We must remember what is at stake. These humanitarian principles matter for every conflict around the world. They should be applied consistently in every war zone.\" This week, the US Special Envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, briefed members of the UN Security Council - which includes the UK - behind closed doors about the new plan to resume the delivery of aid. Meanwhile, Israeli media reported that Israeli forces were already setting up distribution hubs in Rafah, in southern Gaza, in \"a sterile zone\" designed to be free of any Hamas presence. According to reports, Israel expects that aid will be distributed to security-screened representatives from each Gazan family who would be allowed to take supplies for his or her relatives only. They would be allowed into the hubs only on foot. The Israeli defence establishment was said to have assessed that the average quantity of aid that would have to be distributed as 70kg (154lb) per family per week. The Israeli military would ultimately be stationed outside the distribution hubs, allowing aid workers to hand out food without soldiers being directly involved, the reports say. Israel and the US argue that the new system would prevent Hamas from being able to steal food for its own benefit. By preventing its access to aid and involvement in security for convoys, they hope to reduce the group's influence over the Gazan population. However, there are major questions over the plan's feasibility. The current UN system uses some 400 points of aid distribution, while the situation in Gaza is now at a crisis point, with warnings that mass starvation is imminent. At a UN briefing in Geneva, aid officials said they had carried out \"careful analysis\" before deciding they could not participate in the US-Israeli scheme. They said they had not been formally presented with the GHF document that is currently circulating. James Elder, spokesman for the UN's children's agency Unicef, said the plan that had been laid out would lead to more children suffering, not fewer. He noted that civilians would have to travel to militarised zones to receive aid, meaning the most vulnerable - children and the elderly - would struggle to get there. He said the decision to locate all the distribution points in the south appeared designed to use aid as \"a bait\" to forcibly displace Gazans once again. The UN says 90% of the population has been displaced during the war, often many times. The plan that has been discussed with UN agencies envisages just 60 lorry loads of aid entering each day - far less than they say is needed to meet growing needs, and a tenth of the number that went in daily during the recent two-month ceasefire. OCHA's Jens Laerke said that in short, the proposals from Israel \"do not meet the minimum bar for principled humanitarian support\". Analysts say that the current impasse over aid for Gaza is not only an existential threat to the UN's vast humanitarian operation in the Palestinian territory but could also have implications for its future work. If it was to agree to a scheme accommodating the demands of the military on one side in a conflict, it could dent perceptions of the UN's neutrality and impartiality, and set a dangerous precedent leading to similar demands in other war zones where it operates. The UN and other aid agencies also point out that they currently have tonnes of supplies piled up near Gaza's border crossings, ready to enter, if Israel would allow it. Without an end to the blockade, the risk of famine is expected to grow. In Jabalia, in northern Gaza, which has already been the focus of Israeli military operations against Hamas, Palestinian families told the BBC of their growing despair as they waited for a food handout at a takia, or community kitchen, which turned into a chaotic scramble. \"Every day I come here and wait with my cooking pot to feed my children,\" Umm Ahmed said. \"The pot doesn't fill us up. We have been suffering for two months. There's no flour or anything. Open the borders so we can eat properly.\" She said she would not comply with Israeli efforts to force her to move south to Rafah to receive aid. \"We don't have money for transport, we don't have money to eat!\" she exclaimed. \"I don't want to evacuate from here, I'd rather die than leave.\" \"The takia is our last source of food,\" said Mohammed, who had been waiting for five hours in line. \"My wife is pregnant and sick and I'm unable to get her to the hospital.  How am I supposed to get to Rafah?\" Additional reporting by David Gritten in Jerusalem One family said the hostages were at risk \"every day\" they continued to be held captive. Pope Leo XIV has expressed support for immigrants and criticism of JD Vance. Donald Trump's supporters aren't happy.

    "title": "Pope Leo XIV calls Church 'a beacon to illuminate dark nights' in first Mass",
    "article_text": "The new Pope, Leo XIV, has called in his first Mass at the Vatican for the Catholic Church to \"desperately\" counter a lack of faith. Speaking the day after he was elected as the 267th Pope and first US leader of the Church, he warned that people were turning away from faith and instead to \"technology, money, success, power, or pleasure\". Leo said he had been elected to be a \"faithful administrator\" of a Church that would act as a \"beacon that illuminates the dark nights of this world\". The ascension of Robert Francis Prevost has been celebrated by the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, with joyous outbursts in his US homeland and in Peru, where he served for 20 years. In his sermon on Friday, the new Pope said there were many settings where the Christian faith was considered \"absurd\" - with power, wealth, and technology dominating - but it was precisely there that missionary outreach was needed. \"A lack of faith is often tragically accompanied by the loss of meaning in life, the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society,\" he said in the address delivered in Italian. Pope Leo, 69, wore a white papal robe trimmed in gold as he addressed the seated cardinals in the Sistine Chapel, an event broadcast live by the Vatican administration. In an unscripted introduction before the homily, Leo also called on Church unity  from his cardinals, telling them in American-accented English: \"I know I can rely on each and every one of you to walk with me\". Following weeks of anticipation, the previously-unknown Prevost was introduced as the new Pope to the world on Thursday evening in St Peter's Square. Tens of thousands of worshippers in the square burst into cheers when white smoke curled out of the Vatican's chimney on the second day of the conclave's voting. Shortly after, the Chicago-born Prevost appeared on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica. In his first words to the crowds he outlined a vision of a \"missionary\" Church which \"builds bridges, which holds dialogues, which is always open\". He echoed his predecessor, the late Pope Francis, in calling for peace. \"Help us, and each other, to build bridges through dialogue, through encounter, to come together as one people, always in peace,\" he said. World leaders have rushed to congratulate Prevost on his election, pledging to work with him on global issues amid uncertain times. US President Donald Trump called it a \"great honour\" to have the first American pope. Prevost, who had previously been the Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru, was only made an archbishop and then cardinal in 2023. He was elected by his fellow cardinals in what is believed to be four rounds of voting in the secret conclave that took place two weeks after Francis died. He is seen as being aligned with the progressive late Pope, who was viewed as a champion of human rights and the poor and celebrated for his charismatic style that sought to make the Catholic Church more outward-facing. Vatican watchers have noted that Francis appeared to have brought Prevost to Rome in recent years, perhaps to set him up as a potential successor. The Augustinian missionary worked for decades with the poor and marginalised in Peru, where he obtained nationality in 2015. In his previous role as Cardinal Prevost, he had also expressed or amplified criticism of the US administration under President Trump, including its anti-immigration policies. On an X account under his name, he had criticised Vice President JD Vance in February. Vance, who is a Catholic convert, had said Christians should love their family, neighbours, community and fellow citizens in that order. Prevost had written: \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others\". As Pope now, he faces a momentous task in leading the Church in a time of significant global conflicts. Observers have expressed hope that he can offer a counterpoint to more divisive voices on the world stage.

    "title": "Bulgarians convicted of spying for Russia face 'double figure sentences'",
    "article_text": "Six Bulgarians convicted of spying for Russia face significant jail terms when they are sentenced at the Old Bailey in London on Monday. Orlin Roussev, Biser Dzhambazov, Katrin Ivanova, Tihomir Ivanchev, Ivan Stoyanov and Vanya Gaberova will be sentenced for their part in a Russian spy ring run from a 33-room Great Yarmouth guest house. Prosecutor Alison Morgan KC told the court double figure sentences were appropriate for many of the defendants, who she said had endangered lives and harmed national security. Evidence placed before the court this week revealed new details of the spy cell's activities as well as their controller for Russian intelligence services Jan Marsalek's life on the run. A Telegram exchange from August 2021 between Marsalek, an Austrian fugitive who fled fraud charges in Germany, and the UK spy cell's leader, Roussev, indicates the pair were contracted by the CIA to organise an evacuation flight from Kabul airport shortly before a suicide bombing. \"Interesting request from our friends, sort of, at the CIA,\" Marsalek wrote to Roussev on 17 August 2021. \"They urgently need aircraft to fly out contractors from Afghanistan.\" In subsequent messages Roussev and Marsalek planned the airlift. \"In the end, they did it,\" Mark Summers KC said in mitigation for Roussev on Thursday. \"We don't offer that as some humanitarian effort. It was, as with everything else Mr Roussev does, fixing for money. Mr Roussev is not an anti-western ideologue.\" On Friday, Rupert Bowers KC, on behalf of Ivanova, told the court that she had been \"lied to and manipulated by her partner\" Dzhambazov. Ivanchev's barrister, Mozammel Hossain KC, said his client was the \"ultimate minion\" and an \"outsider in this case\". Stoyanov, according to his barrister Hossein Zahir KC, was \"remorseful\" and \"accepts he acted in a selfish way\". Peter Wright KC said that the messages that Dzhambazov sent did not \"contain proposals of harm\" and that his client \"embellished\" his actions to make more money from them. Further messages, which were not included in evidence during an earlier trial of Ivanova, Ivanchev and Gaberova, reveal Marsalek and Roussev plotted to trade weapons for diamonds. \"We can collect and inspect the diamonds in either Angola, Belgium Congo, Kenya,\" Roussev wrote to Marsalek. \"These guys want to spend around 60 million on guns and light infantry vehicles and pay with diamonds,\" he added later. When Marsalek asked who the end client was, Roussev said: \"Allegedly only government… but who knows…\" Marsalek, who is reported to be in Moscow, is the subject of an Interpol Red Notice, following his escape from justice. Messages reveal he has had plastic surgery to alter his appearance as well as details of his life as a fugitive. \"I'm off to bed. Had another cosmetic surgery, trying to look differently, and I am dead tired and my head hurts,\" Marsalek wrote to Roussev on Telegram in February 2022. In another, dated 11 May 2021, Roussev congratulated Marsalek for learning Russian. \"Well I am trying to improve my skills on a few fronts. Languages is one of them,\" the Austrian responded. \"In my new role as an international fugitive I must outperform James Bond.\" In September that year, Marsalek wrote to Roussev complaining about being forced to drink a bottle of gin by \"some deep-state guys who's [sic] names no one knows\" while stuck between them, \"the mafia, half of Russia's ambassadors, the GRU\" and \"a dozen naked girls\". During an exchange of messages between the pair in April 2021, Marsalek joked to Roussev: \"Together we can pretty much organise anything they need except nukes. Even the nukes if they pay.\" Ivanova,  Gaberova and Ivanchev were convicted of conspiracy to spy for Russia in March following a lengthy trial. Roussev, Dzhambazov and Stoyanov had previously pleaded guilty. At the direction of Marsalek, acting on behalf of Russian intelligence services, the cell conducted surveillance operations on targets including investigative journalists, Russian dissidents and political figures. They targeted Ukrainian soldiers believed to be training to use Patriot Missile Systems at a German military base, in an apparent effort to assist the neutralisation of Ukrainian air defences. Roussev and Marsalek plotted murder and kidnap in service of the Kremlin, though these plans were never realised. Ms Morgan read statements from victims of the spy ring's surveillance on Thursday. Christo Grozev, a Bulgarian investigative journalist said it had a \"profound and enduring impact\" on his life. He described it as \"terrifying, disorientating and deeply destabilising\". \"The consequences are not easily reversed,\" he said. \"For my family and me the damage is ongoing.\" Vladimir Putin leads commemorations as Moscow marks its annual parade.

    "title": "South Africa criticises US plan to accept white Afrikaners as refugees",
    "article_text": "South Africa has criticised the US as reports emerge suggesting Washington could receive white Afrikaners as refugees as early as next week. A document seen by the BBC's US partner CBS describes the potential resettlement as a \"priority\" for President Donald Trump's government, however the timing has not been publicly confirmed by the White House. In a statement published on Friday, South Africa's foreign ministry described the purported move as \"politically motivated\" and designed to undermine South Africa's \"constitutional democracy\". In February, Trump described Afrikaners as victims of \"racial discrimination\" in an executive order, opening up the prospect for them to resettle in the US. The South African authorities said they would not block the departures of those chosen for resettlement, but said they had sought assurances from the US that those selected had been fully vetted and did not have pending criminal charges. The  statement added that allegations of discrimination against the country's white minority were unfounded, and that crime statistics did not indicate that any racial group had been targeted in violent crimes on farms. Some groups representing the rights of white farmers have said they are being deliberately killed because of their race. A spokesperson for the US state department told the BBC they were interviewing individuals interested in resettling in the US and prioritising \"Afrikaners in South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination\". They did not confirm when the resettlement would begin. The Trump administration has also accused South Africa of seizing land from white farmers without compensation, something Pretoria has repeatedly denied. Elon Musk, a top adviser in the Trump administration who grew up in South Africa during apartheid, has been critical of Pretoria, claiming that it is leading a \"genocide\" against white farmers. US officials have planned a press event on Monday at Dulles airport in Virginia to welcome the group, the documents seen by CBS show. According to US media, 54 Afrikaners will arrive as part of the first group. The decision to accept South Africans as refugees comes as the Trump administration has halted nearly all migrant asylum claims. In February, South Africa criticised Trump's executive order opening the US up to the resettlement of white Afrikaners, saying in a statement that \"it is ironic\" the US is open to accepting  a group \"that remains amongst the most economically privileged\" while denying vulnerable people from other parts of the world asylum.

    "article_text": "A statue of legendary heavy metal frontman Lemmy Kilmister has been unveiled in the late singer's hometown. Hundreds of music fans flocked into Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, throughout Friday before the black-coloured 2.25m bronze-cast statue was uncovered in Market Place shortly before 17:00 BST. The memorial to the Motörhead singer and bassist has been created by local sculptor Andy Edwards and marks 10 years since Lemmy's death and 50 years since the band was formed. Guests and speakers at the ceremony included the band's guitarist Phil Campbell, who previously described the sculpture as \"amazing\". Motörhead fan Nobby, who was at the ceremony, told BBC Radio Stoke he had been following the band since he was 15 and described the unveiling as \"absolutely awesome\". \"It's unbelievable - it looks alive. Looking at it now, he really has captured Lemmy to a tee. It's brilliant,\" he said. \"It's well worth the wait, well worth everything and I hope it brings people to Burslem to see it.\" The statue contains some of Lemmy's ashes, which were accompanied to the ceremony by a procession of motorbikes. It depicts Lemmy in his iconic pose singing up towards a microphone while playing a Rickenbacker bass guitar. Mr Edwards has previously created sculptures of The Beatles, Bob Marley, Sir Alex Ferguson, Muhammed Ali and the Bee Gees. He described Lemmy as his hero while he was growing up and said he was a big part of his life. \"Of all the figures in music, there aren't that many that have the unique stature that Lemmy does,\" he said. \"He's like an avatar of the purest spirit of rock and roll - he's one of us. I think it's right that it [the statue] has been made locally.\" The singer, real name Ian Fraser Kilmister, was born in Burslem in 1945 and later lived in nearby Newcastle-under-Lyme and Madeley. He joined Hawkwind as a bassist and vocalist in 1971 before forming Motörhead four years later. The band went on to release 23 studio albums in a career spanning 40 years until Lemmy's death on 28 December 2015, which came after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Follow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire onBBC Sounds,Facebook,XandInstagram. The tribute to the legendary Motörhead frontman will be placed in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. Pottery firms in Staffordshire say all is not lost for the industry but call on government for help. The directors of Moorcroft Pottery in Stoke-on-Trent say they are going into voluntary liquidation. The plan is to invite relatives of John Baskeyfield to memorial events later this year. Supporters club chair Mark Porter says it will mean extra season ticket sales and more away fans.",

    "article_text": "Mexico is suing Google for ignoring repeated requests not to call the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America on Google Maps for US users, President Claudia Sheinbaum says. She did not say where the lawsuit had been filed. Google did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. On Thursday, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to officially rename the Gulf for federal agencies. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office in January. He argued the change was justified because the US \"do most of the work there, and it's ours\". However Sheinbaum's government contends that Trump's order applies only to the US portion of the continental shelf. \"All we want is for the decree issued by the US government to be complied with,\" she said, asserting that the US lacks the authority to rename the entire gulf. In January, Sheinbaum wrote a letter to Google asking the firm to reconsider its decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico for US users. The following month, she threatened legal action. At the time, Google said it made the change as part of \"a longstanding practice\" of following name changes when updated by official government sources. It said the Gulf - which is bordered by the US, Cuba and Mexico - would not be changed for people using the app in Mexico, and users elsewhere in the world will see the label: \"Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)\". The Associated Press (AP) news agency's refusal to start referring to the Gulf of America led to a months-long conflict with the White House, which restricted AP's access to certain events. A federal judge ordered the White House in April to stop sidelining the outlet. Trump hinted Wednesday that he may recommend changing the way the US refers to another body of water. During an upcoming visit to Saudi Arabia, he plans to announce that the US will henceforth refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia, AP reported. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi has responded by saying he hopes the \"absurd rumours\" are \"no more than a disinformation campaign\" and such a move would \"bring the wrath of all Iranians\". Her arrest followed the White House's crackdown on what it has classified as antisemitism on US campuses. Economic pressures are forcing Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to seek an off-ramp in the trade war. Reports say the first set of white South Africans could arrive in the US next week.

    "article_text": "A rose has been named after Catherine, Princess of Wales to highlight the healing power of nature. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) said it called the flower 'Catherine's Rose' to raise awareness of the role that spending time outdoors plays in supporting people's mental, physical and spiritual wellbeing. The floribunda rose has coral-pink blooms with a scent of Turkish Delight and mango. Proceeds from every sale will go to the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. The princess was treated at the hospital, in west London, for cancer last year. The Princess of Wales revealed she was in remission after making asurprise visit to the hospital in January,where she thanked staff and reassured cancer patients that there was \"light at the end of the tunnel\". She first revealed her diagnosis in March last year and underwent a course of preventative chemotherapy, announcing in September that it had been completed. Catherine's Rose will have flowers that attract pollinators and will thrive in a mixed border, as a hedge, in a large container or in a rose bed, according to the RHS. Clusters can have up to 15 blooms, each flower measuring between 8 and 12cm, while the plant that supports it can grow to about 1.2m tall by 90cm wide. Clare Matterson, RHS director general, said the flower would \"raise awareness of how nature and gardening can help to heal\". \"We know how important this message is as every day we see how accessing nature and being outside is vital for our health and happiness,\" she added. There will be 15,000 Catherine's Rose available this autumn, with further roses becoming available next year. The Duke and Duchess of Rothesay are on the second day of their official visit to the Isle of Mull. The couple will spend their anniversary at a self-catering cottage after a day of official engagements. A scout group from Cumbria is surprised by a visit from Princess Kate while on an excursion.

    "title": "'The pretender replacing a legend - a new era dawns at Real Madrid'",
    "article_text": "In what has been the worst kept secret in the footballing world,Xabi Alonso has finally told his Bayer Leverkusen playershe will be leaving the German club at the end of the season. He will be soon be announced as the new head coach of Real Madrid - once the departure of current boss Carlo Ancelotti is officially confirmed. An inevitable, if bittersweet, conclusion to Ancelotti's second spell at Real Madrid. And finally, the much expected transition, with the Italian legend stepping aside to take charge of the Brazil national team, and the young pretender Alonso returning to the Bernabeu as his successor. This changing of the guard, from the club's most decorated coach to a rising star in management, is symbolic. It marks the end of an era and the beginning of a fascinating new one. A situation facilitated by the innate reasonableness of Bayer Leverkusen who, true to their word, stood by the gentlemen's agreement between coach and club that they would not stand in Alonso's way should he receive an offer he could not refuse. This video can not be played 'These two games will be my last as Bayer Leverkusen coach' - Alonso Alonso to leave Bayer Leverkusen at end of season Real Madrid boss Ancelotti set for Brazil talks 'The message will be clear - it's time for Ancelotti to move on' Madrid are now preparing for a future led by their former midfielder, with president Florentino Perez viewing Alonso as the long-term answer. The 43-year-old's success at Leverkusen has elevated his profile, and Real believe he possesses the tactical sharpness and emotional intelligence to lead a generational transition. Last year, he led Leverkusen to a Bundesliga title, without losing a game, and the German Cup in his first full season as a senior club manager. But the task Alonso faces at Real is enormous. He will inherit a squad in flux, needing to balance Kylian Mbappe's presence and Vinicius Jr's leadership, with the Brazilian about to sign a longer contract. Alonso will also need to integrate youngsters like Endrick and Arda Guler, phasing out the old guard and delivering trophies immediately. He'll also need to navigate a boardroom that wants influence, a fanbase that demands instant success, and a media environment that will hold him to impossible standards from day one. Alonso has the tactical credentials, but this is Madrid where talent alone doesn't guarantee survival. Before his tenure starts, Real must win at Barcelona on Sunday to retain any realistic hopes of retaining their La Liga crown. Victory for the Catalans would put them seven points clear at the top with just three games to play. More likely, the goodbyes have already begun. After winning La Liga and the Champions League last season, a campaign without a trophy would serve to justify the club's decision to end the Ancelotti era. But before then, the Bernabeu will get its chance to applaud him one last time, to give the Italian the send-off that accurately reflects and acknowledges the enormity of his contribution to the club. Fifteen trophies, more than any manager in the club's history, in two eras of success, steadiness, and quiet revolution. Ancelotti brought dignity and calm to chaos. He won with style, without needing to shout, and restored order when the club was on the edge. And now, as he prepares to leave for Brazil, Real prepare to start again with Alonso at the helm. Former Spain midfielder Xabi Alonso will become the next Real Madrid manager When Ancelotti returned to Real Madrid in 2021 following Zinedine Zidane's unexpected resignation, the club was drifting. The stadium redevelopment was mid-construction, the squad was thin, and there was a palpable lack of direction. Yet Ancelotti brought calm, clarity, and credibility. And with it, a remarkable resurgence. In his first season back, after the departure of key players Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane, the Madrid side secured a La Liga and Champions League double, plus the Spanish Supercup, an achievement few believed possible given the structural limitations at the time. Key areas of the squad remained unaddressed due to financial pressure caused by escalating stadium costs. But through man-management, tactical pragmatism, and the brilliance of individuals, Madrid triumphed. That same success though planted the seeds of future discord as the squad was not improved dramatically and departures, Toni Kroos especially, were not replaced adequately. When Mbappe finally arrived from Paris St-Germain last summer, Perez believed the team would take another leap forward. Fractures though had already begun to appear, not just tactically, but inside the changing room. Behind closed doors, disagreements surfaced over physical preparation and discipline and Perez, always deeply involved, became more vocal in his frustration. From the directors' box came disdainful comments, on the lack of defensive work by the main stars, despite meetings between the manager and them to turn things around, and Ancelotti's management of emerging talents. Questions were raised over the cautious handling of Guler, and doubts cast over whether Brazilian forward Endrick would thrive under Ancelotti's approach. The tension, though never explosive, became constant. By October, the club leadership felt Ancelotti was not addressing the issues and the idea of the club taking a new direction started to take root. Carlo Ancelotti has won 15 trophies in two spells as manager of Real Madrid On the pitch, the team lost coherence. The dressing room - once unified by Ancelotti's steady hand - began to fragment. Key players stopped listening to him, others grew weary of his hands-off approach. Perhaps most destabilising was the rivalry between Vinicius and Mbappe. Both wanted to be the face of the team. Mbappe preferred to play centrally, but Vinicius believed he had earned top billing. There was no open conflict, but the on-pitch dynamic spoke volumes. In critical moments, they did not look for each other. The tension was visible to staff and team-mates alike. Ancelotti, usually the master of ego management, struggled and admitted privately it was one of the hardest changing rooms to manage in his career. On some occasions, pre-match media briefings became short and irritable, with Ancelotti feeling he was not getting the club support he thought he deserved. He had asked for right-back Kyle Walker in January to cover for long-term injuries to Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao, but the request was rejected. Outwardly, the 65-year-old remained respectful. He repeated the same line, \"I will stay at Madrid until the club no longer wants me.\" To fans, that echoed loyalty. But to Perez, it sounded like pressure. Now, as the season nears its end, the Brazil job stands as Ancelotti's next frontier. Discussions with the CBF (Brazilian Football Confederation) have intensified, with meetings held in London and Madrid. Brazil, amid a turbulent World Cup 2026 qualification campaign, had hoped to secure his signature immediately, but Ancelotti insisted \"nothing until after the season ends\". There is also a financial situation to resolve. Real might not want to pay the rest of his contract until 2026 as Ancelotti has shown, with those meetings, his desire to leave. Ancelotti wants the club to recognise they are the ones letting him go and, consequently, he should have a pay-off. The plan now is clear. Finish the La Liga season and, if the financial situation is resolved, allow someone else to coach at the Fifa Club World Cup, perhaps Santi Solari, one of the club's decision-makers and a former player. And then the club and manager will begin new chapters. This time it can be a graceful, fitting transition - if all the pieces fall into place. One of the most interesting subplots is the future of assistant Davide Ancelotti. The younger Ancelotti has built a formidable reputation alongside his father, from PSG to Bayern Munich, Napoli, Everton, and now Real. But with his profile higher than ever, and interest from top European clubs growing, this will be the moment he sets out on his own. Davide has always dreamed of becoming a head coach. That decision, like many around the Madrid bench right now, remains pending - but imminent. Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "title": "Haaland 'ready and fit' to make Man City return",
    "article_text": "Erling Haaland has 84 goals and 16 assists in 94 Premier League games Manchester City striker Erling Haaland is ready to make his return from injury this weekend, manager Pep Guardiola says. Haaland had been sidelined since March after sustaining an ankle injury in his side's FA Cup tie against Bournemouth, but returns in time to contest the final of that competition later this month. The Norway international, 24, was an unused substitute as City boosted their Champions League hopes by beating Wolves 1-0 in the Premier League last week. Speaking before his side's trip to Southampton on Saturday (15:00 BST), Guardiola said on Haaland's availability: \"He is ready, he is fit. [If he will] start, we will see tomorrow.\" City are third in the table, three points above sixth-placed Nottingham Forest, as clubs battle to earn one of the top-five positions which this season offer Champions League football. After facing Southampton, Guardiola's side face Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final at Wembley on 17 May, before completing their league campaign with games against Bournemouth and Fulham. Should you captain Haaland in your FPL team this week? Live Q&A special In aninterview with ESPN,externalthis week, Haaland said City's disappointing season after a run of four consecutive league titles was due to a loss of \"hunger\" in the squad. \"You can find excuses, injuries, many injuries at bad times, but in the end we haven't been performing well enough,\" Haaland said. \"We haven't had fully the hunger inside us. I haven't been good enough. I haven't helped the team enough. In the end, we haven't been good enough.\" Asked about those quotes, Guardiola said: \"If it's a feeling for Erling, the players should talk to each other and ask themselves why.\" Haaland has 21 goals in 28 Premier League appearances this season - the only City player to reach double figures in the competition this term. He has 30 goals in 40 games in all competitions in 2024-25, also contributing four assists. Having won the Premier League's Golden Boot award in each of the past two seasons since his move to England, he is seven goals behind Liverpool's top scorer Mohamed Salah with only three games remaining. Guardiola has led City to six Premier League titles since joining the club in 2016, while he also won both La Liga and the Bundesliga three times apiece with Barcelona and Bayern Munich respectively. This season is just the fourth time in his illustrious managerial career that he has failed to finish top of the league. The Spaniard has had to contend with a lengthy injury list, contributing to City relinquishing their four-year hold on the top-flight trophy, and they were also knocked out of the Champions League at the play-off phase. The 54-year-old called it the \"most difficult\" campaign in his time in coaching, adding: \"When you don't win, it's more demanding in terms of emotionally and preparing [the team] and the mood. \"It has been more and more difficult than the previous seasons that we played for the winning for the titles. \"The people pay the tickets to come to the stadium and I had to prove myself again and again. \"I am disappointed in myself when it's not going well, so when I retire and we review my career, I can say, 'OK, I have been good or I have been bad, I could be better or I could be worse.' But right now, the next game, I have to prove myself.\" City beat rivals Manchester United to claim the Community Shield last summer but between October and December the side endured a run of one victory in 13 games, which included nine defeats. But they can end a disappointing season on a high by finishing in the top five, as well as having an FA Cup final to play for against Crystal Palace on Saturday 16 May. \"It's a business, we have to win games,\" said Guardiola \"Otherwise, you cannot be here next time. We represent the people, represent the club - you have to do your job as best as possible \"And today, this season, we didn't do that. we were in the highest standards and we dropped here. Even with that, I would say it could be worse. \"We were still there. I was there, the players were there. Not our best, but we didn't give up.\" Latest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views Get Manchester City news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "'Mood of the nation will decide IPL restart'",
    "article_text": "There are 16 remaining fixtures to complete in this season's Indian Premier League Any potential resumption of the Indian Premier League would depend on the \"mood of the nation\", according to former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta. TheIPL was suspended for a weekon Friday amid growing tensions between India and neighbouring Pakistan. Some overseas players taking part in the competition, including from England, have already started to leave India. There are 16 remaining matches in the IPL, which was originally due to run until 25 May. \"As important as cricket is to India as a nation, there are certain things that are much more important,\" Dasgupta told BBC Sport. \"The last couple of days, things have become more intense, and it only make sense at this moment. The sentiment of the nation is very different.\" On Thursday, India accused Pakistan of attacking three of its military bases with drones and missiles, a claim which Islamabad denied. Pakistani authorities say 31 people have been killed and 57 injured by Indian air strikes in the country and Pakistan-administered Kashmir since Wednesday morning. Twenty-six civilians were killed in Indian-administered Kashmir last month and India has accused Pakistan of supporting militants behind the attack - an allegation the neighbouring country has rejected. The situation escalated on Tuesday evening when India launched a series of strikes in a move named \"Operation Sindoor\". Dasgupta, who played eight Tests for India, said a restart of the IPL in a week is \"possible\" but may not be \"realistic\". Options for a restart could include condensing the remaining matches to a limited number of venues and playing more double-headers to reduce the time needed. IPL suspended for one week over safety concerns PSL postponed indefinitely after UAE plan scrapped However Dasgupta, who was speaking from Lucknow where he was due to be commentating on Friday's game between Lucknow Super Giants and Royal Challengers Bengaluru, believes the tournament would be unlikely to resume if overseas players are absent. It is understood that most of the 10 England players are leaving India, while the Australians involved are also likely to depart. Players from the West Indies have remained in India. If a short-term restart is not possible, there would an overwhelming desire to complete the tournament later in the year because of its financial value. A $6.02bn rights deal for IPL matches was signed in 2022 and in a statement confirming the suspension, the Board of Control for Cricket in India thanked broadcaster Jiostar for its support in the decision. If the remainder of the IPL is rearranged for later in the year, there would be concern at the England and Wales Cricket Board about an August clash with The Hundred, but a more likely window would be in September. That month was initially earmarked for the Asia Cup, though with matches between India and Pakistan now unlikely to take place, that tournament could be scrapped and replaced by the remainder of the IPL. And there will be long-term questions over future matches between India and Pakistan at global events, with Dasgupta saying he \"can't even think\" about fixtures between the two countries. \"It would be extremely insensitive to even talk about it right now,\" he said. \"Maybe at a future date. We'll see. As of now, India-Pakistan cricket is too trivial to talk about.\" Even before the latest deterioration in the relationship between the two countries, their cricket teams were only playing each other in multi-nation events. Earlier this year, India refused to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy, prompting the International Cricket Council (ICC) to announce that any matches involving the two teams in global events hosted by either country will be played at a neutral venue. The next such instance will be the Women's World Cup in October, hosted by India. Pakistan secured their qualification earlier this month, so will be based in a different country. However, there is now uncertainty if a match between the two can take place, regardless of the venue. It is understood that the ICC feels it is too soon to consider a solution. On Friday, it was announced that the remainder of thePakistan Super League was postponed indefinitelyrather than concluding in the United Arab Emirates as was announced on Thursday.

    "title": "'Best day of my life' - Pollock on Lions call",
    "article_text": "Henry Pollock (second from the right) is one of four Northampton Saints players named in Andy Farrell's British and Irish Lions squad for Australia Northampton Saints flanker Henry Pollock says his selection for the British and Irish Lions' tour of Australia was \"the best day of his life\". The 20-year-old, who started the year off playing for England in the Under-20 Six Nations, wasnamed in Andy Farrell's 38-strong partyon Thursday to mark a rapid rise. Pollock went on toscore two tries on his England senior debutagainst Wales in March, before starring for Saints as they reached the Investec Champions Cup final on 24 May. \"It sounds mad [to say I am a British and Irish Lion] . I am honoured and can't really believe it,\" Pollock told BBC Look East. \"We were all watching it and hoping for the best and when it got announced, all the boys jumped on me. \"It was a feeling I will never forget. It was probably the best day of my life.\" Pollock's inclusion generated the loudest cheer from about 2,000 fans inside Indigo, a venue within London's O2 Arena complex. The flanker, who is the youngest player in the squad, wonWorld Rugby's Under-20 Championship in Julywith England, before making his first Premiership start in October. Pollock has gone on to establish himself in Northampton's competitive back row, and on Saturday scored a sensational solo try by showing incredible pace to round Leinster fly-half Sam Prendergast in their Champions Cupsemi-final win in Dublin.

An all-action display on both sides of the ball against Leinster, who have 12 players heading on the Lions tour, showed Pollock can compete with the best and he plans to show that in Australia. He faces tough back row competition in Ireland's Jack Conan and Josh van der Flier, England pair Tom Curry and Ben Earl, and Wales captain Jac Morgan, but remains confident of adding value. \"It is the pinnacle of the sport and everything that you work for and want to achieve in rugby,\" he added. \"I hope to bring a different X-factor and just be myself. I am not going to go there and go into my shell, I am just going to be myself and hopefully bring a different side to the squad than other players.\"",

    "article_text": "Emeka Ilione scored two second-half tries for Leicester Tigers against Sale Sharks Gallagher Premiership, Welford Road Leicester (16) 44 Tries:Radwan, Hassell-Collins 2, Ilione 2Cons:Pollard 5Pens:Pollard 3 Sale (26) 34 Tries:Cowan-Dickie, Ma'asi-White, Reed, R du Preez 2Cons:Ford 3Pens:Ford Leicester Tigers scored four second-half tries to come from behind and beat Sale Sharks for a crucial win in the race for the Premiership play-offs. Adam Radwan scored Tigers' first try but Sale had control at the break after Luke Cowan-Dickie, Rekeiti Ma'asi-White, Arron Reed and Rob du Preez earned them an early bonus point and a 26-16 half-time lead. Leicester responded quickly after the interval with two tries from winger Ollie Hassell-Collins, and when replacement back-row Emeka Ilione added their fourth try the game looked won. Rob du Preez immediately scored his second try to bring the visitors back to 37-34 but with the final play of the game Ilione was driven over to deny Sale a losing bonus point. Victory in what was a wonderful game consolidates Leicester in second in the table, now seven points clear of third-placed Sale with two games remaining. Leicester travel to Bath before hosting Newcastle Falcons, while Sale, who lost Tom Curry in the first half with a leg injury, host Bristol Bears before a trip to Exeter Chiefs on the final day. It was Sale who struck first as they drove Cowan-Dickie over, but Leicester responded instantly as quick hands from centre Joseph Woodward put Handre Pollard in space and he sent Radwan in for his eighth try in as many games. Pollard kicked a penalty before the visitors went back in front when Ma'asi-White picked a great line to burst through the defence and step off his right boot to go under the posts. Pollard added two more penalty kicks before the interval but his accuracy from the tee was overshadowed by the creativity of George Ford in setting up Sale's third and fourth tries. First, Ford saw space down the left, dummied and darted through a gap before he passed inside to send Reed under the posts, and, with the clock in the red, Ford's delayed pass gave Rob du Preez a walk in to send Sale into the break with a 10-point lead. Sale's Tom Curry, who has been selected for the British Lions tour, went off in the first half with a leg injury Tigers got back into the game after half-time as Freddie Steward made good ground after collecting a loose ball before Pollard sent a cross-field kick for Hassell-Collins to collect and sprint into the left corner for his 11th try of the season. Sale then spilled a long line-out deep in their own 22 and Leicester seized their chance, stressing the Sharks defence before Hassell-Collins collected a loose ball, stepped back on the inside and accelerated to the line. And when Ilione won a turnover penalty that led to him being driven over for Tigers' fourth try, victory looked very likely at 37-29 ahead. But Leicester lost the restart, Sale swung the play left, and Rob du Preez powered through the defence and stepped inside the final defender to reduce the deficit to just three. It was not enough for a losing bonus though as Leicester opted for the corner from a kickable penalty and Ilione was driven over with the final play of the game. Leicester Tigers head coach Michael Cheika told BBC Radio Leicester: \"The most pleasing thing for me was I got to experience Welford Road going crazy. It was finals intensity from the start, close to Test match intensity. \"First half we gave away a few tries and the last one was like we were already in the dressing room. \"The guys had their heads down at half-time and I was a bit surprised. They'd done OK, physically we were in the game and we'd done well with the ball, we just lacked a bit of defence but they were simple fixes.\" Sale director of rugby Alex Sanderson said: \"We missed a couple of decent chances early in the second half and we let them back in it so it was a case of big moments turning on small issues, but our penalty count was probably more than any recent games and in the end it cost us. \"I think the home semi-final is now gone as we've made it harder for ourselves but there's probably still three games to go and we'll keep fighting.\" [On the injury to Tom Curry]\"It was a hamstring problem which will need assessing. \"Tom is a tough lad and he tried to run it off for 10 minutes, but he had to come off as a precaution as we need to rotate our squad ahead of a difficult run-in.\" Leicester:Steward; Radwan, Kata, Woodward, Hassell-Collins; Pollard, van Poortvliet; Smith, Montoya (c), Heyes, Henderson, Chessum, Liebenberg, Reffell, Cracknell.

    "title": "Simon Mann, mercenary behind failed ‘wonga coup’, dies aged 72",
    "article_text": "Simon Mann, an Eton and Sandhurst-educated ex-SAS officer, who led a botched coup involving Margaret Thatcher’s son to overthrow the government ofEquatorial Guinea, has died aged 72. Mann led a group of 70 fellow mercenaries who were arrested inZimbabwein 2004 for attempting to topple Equatorial Guinea’s despotic president, Teodoro Obiang. Mann and his friendMark Thatcheradmitted involvement in the attempted plot, which became known as the “wonga coup”. When the plot was revealed, Obiang threatened to eat Mann’s testicles and drag his naked body through the streets. Mann served more than five years in two of the world’s most notorious jails before being pardoned by Obiang himself. He had previously served in the Scots Guards and the SAS before setting up a number of security firms specialised in protecting oil installations. In March 2004 Mann, Nick du Toit and three other South African mercenaries plotted Obiang’s overthrow with international financial backers and the tacit approval of at least three governments, most notably Spain. The coup involved flying into the former Spanish colony in a plane loaded with arms and more than 50 black “Buffalo soldiers” – former members of the now disbanded South African defence forces’ elite 32 battalion– to replace Obiang with an exiled opposition activist called Severo Moto. In return, the plotters and their backers were hoping to tap into Equatorial Guinea’s reserves of oil and natural gas. But their plane was intercepted by the Zimbabweans at Harare airport. A jubilant PresidentRobert Mugabethrew Mann and his fellow conspirators into jail before handing them over to Equatorial Guinea where a court sentenced the mercenary to 34 years in jail. In a note sent out to his legal team while he was being held, Mann implicated Thatcher, whom he referred to by the name Scratcher, in the coup. The note also pleaded for a “large splodge of wonga” and that Thatcher use his influence to secure his release. In his trial, Mann admitted he had been approach by Ely Calil, a Lebanese oil tycoon who was a friend of Moto, who regarded himself as head of Equatorial Guinea’s government in exile. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Thatcher was alleged to have paid for a helicopter to fly Moto from Equatorial Guinea during the planned coup. He was fined and given a four-year suspended sentence for his part in the coup after admitting breaking anti-mercenary legislation. But he claimed he was only unwittingly involved in the plot. In 2006 the plot was dramatised inCoup!, a TV movie written by the comic John Fortune. After his pardon, Mann returned to the UK. He was married three times and had nine children. MailOnline reported that he had died earlier this week while exercising in a gym.",

    "title": "Immigrants set for Libya deportation sat on tarmac for hours, attorney says",
    "article_text": "Immigrants inTexaswho were toldthey would bedeported toLibyasat on a military airfield tarmac for hours on Wednesday, unsure of what would happen next, an attorney for one of the men has said. The attorney, Tin Thanh Nguyen, told the news agency Reuters that his client, a Vietnamese construction worker from Los Angeles, was among the immigrants woken in the early morning hours and bussed from animmigrationdetention center in Pearsall, Texas, to an airfield where a military aircraft awaited them. After several hours, they were bussed back to the detention center around noon, the attorney said on Thursday. The Department of Homeland Security, the Pentagon and the state department did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters was first to report that theTrump administrationwas poised to deport immigrants held in the US to Libya, despite a court order against such a move, in a development that would escalateDonald Trump’s immigration crackdown. Officials earlier this week told Reuters the US military could fly the immigrants to the north African country as soon as Wednesday, but stressed that plans could change. A US official said the flight never departed. As of Friday, it was unclear if the administration was still planning to proceed with the deportations. A federal judge in Boston ruled on Wednesday that any effort by theTrump administrationto deport non-Libyan immigrants to Libya without adequate screenings for possible persecution or torture would clearly violate a prior court order. Lawyers for a group of immigrants pursuing a class action lawsuit had made an emergency request to the court hours after the news broke of the potential flight toLibya. Nguyen, who declined to name his client, said the man was told on Monday to sign a document agreeing to be deported to Libya. The man, who can not read English well, declined to sign it and was placed in solitary confinement and shackled along with others, the attorney said. The man was never provided an opportunity to express a fear of being deported to Libya as required under federal immigration law and the recent judicial order, Nguyen said. “They said: ‘We’re deporting you to Libya,’ even though he hadn’t signed the form, he didn’t know what the form was,” Nguyen said. Nguyen said his client, originally from Vietnam, has lived in the US since the 1990s but was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) earlier this year during aregular check-in, which is becomingmore common. Vietnam declines to accept some deportees and processes deportation paperwork slowly, Nguyen said, making it harder for the US to send deportees there. There havebeen talksbetween the US and the east African nation ofRwandaabout also deporting people there.",

    "title": "Clergy molestation survivors concerned and insulted by election of Pope Leo XIV",
    "article_text": "Groups supporting clergy-molestation survivors say they are gravely concerned and insulted by the election ofPope Leo XIVafter he overcame questions about his handling of clerical sexual abuse cases earlier in his career to become the Roman Catholic church’s first-ever US-born leader. BeforeRobert Prevost’s ascent to the papacy at age 69, he was leading a chapter of the Augustinian religious order in his home town of Chicago when allegations surfaced that a priest and Catholic high school principal under his jurisdiction had molested at least one student as well as kept child-abuse imagery. Prevostreportedlyallowed that cleric to continue in his role despite the allegations, though the Augustinian order later paid a multimillion-dollar settlement to the abuse survivor and in December booted the priest from the order. Meanwhile, Prevost also did not impede another priest – whose ministry had been restricted in the wake of allegations that he abused minors – from living at an Augustinian residence that was near a Catholic elementary school. And, while serving as a bishop inPeru, Prevost heard from three women who accused two priests there of sexually abusing them as minors and have since claimed there is no evidence that much was done to investigate the cleric. That history prompted the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (Snap) to file a complaint against Prevost in March under church legislation implemented by the late Pope Francis that provided potential disciplinary measures against bishops who were found to have turned a blind eye to abuse of both children and adults considered vulnerable. The complaint did not prevent Leo from being elected on Thursday after a short conclave at theVatican, which prompted Snap to quickly issue a statement expressing “grave concern about his record managing abuse cases”. “You can end the abuse crisis,” Snap’s statement said of Leo, who has not been accused of abuse himself and had previously headed the Vatican entity in charge of selecting new bishops from around the world. “The only question is: will you?” In a separate statement, the Survivors of Childhood Sex Abuse (SCSA) said Leo’s election was “an insult” given that he was produced by the same Catholic hierarchy that has failed to grapple with the scale and systemic nature of the global church’s decades-old clergy molestation scandal. “The Catholic hierarchy has not merely mishandled abuse allegations – it industrialized the process,” the SCSA’s statement said. “Pope Leo XIV … was in the rooms for all of it.” Both organizations urged Leo to implement a true zero-tolerance policy with respect to taking action against clergy abuse claims as well as to provide victims of the scandal with reparations from church assets, among other demands. Mitchell Garabedian, the Boston attorney who represented abuse survivors amid the clergy molestation scandal depicted in the Oscar-winning movieSpotlight, added: “The Catholic church has to understand that the safety of innocent children cannot be sacrificed for an outdated and inexcusable need to protect the reputation of the Catholic church.” The Vatican’s press office did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the statements from Snap and SCSA. It has generally maintained that Prevost is free of any wrongdoing or followed canonical norms in the clergy abuse cases he has confronted. Some of the scrutiny surrounding Prevost’s handling of those cases dates back to his 11-year tenure leading the Augustinian order’s midwest chapter inChicagobeginning in 1999. During that time, claims reportedly surged that the principal of Providence Catholic high school in New Lenox, Illinois, which was part of Prevost’s territory, had molested a student and possessed images of child abuse on his phone. Prevost – who was also the Augustinians’ worldwide leader for 12 years beginning in 2001 – left the principal, an Augustinian priest named Richard McGrath, in his post, a decision he has not explained, as the Chicago Sun-Times has previously reported. McGrathretiredin 2017 after being faced with an investigation into the claims against him. The abused student, Robert Krankvich, then sued in 2018. And in late 2023 the church agreed to pay him $2m – before Krankvich died in April at age 43. “Money doesn’t bring happiness,” Krankvich’s father, also named Robert, said to the Sun-Times. “It gave him no closure.” During Krankvich’s lawsuit, McGrath declined to answer whether or not he possessed child abuse images, invoking his constitutional right against self-incrimination, the Sun-Times reported. Yet McGrath denied molesting Krankvich and was kept off a list of alleged Augustinian abusers published in 2024, though he resigned in light of the claims against him. Nonetheless, in a statement issued on Tuesday, the Augustinians confirmed McGrath had been expelled from their order, according to New Lenox’sPatchnews website. The Augustinians reportedly did not disclose the factors behind McGrath’s dismissal, which occurred in December but was first reported on the eve of the start of the two-day conclave that vaulted Prevost to the papacy. Separately, in 2000 and still early in Prevost’s stint as the midwestern US Augustinian chapter, the order stationed a member priest named James Ray in its St John Stone Friary in Chicago. The friary was adjacent to an elementary school, and since 1991, Ray was restricted from working around children because of accusations that he had molested minors. Survivors groups say those moves are not indicative of an organization doing everything it can to protect children. The Vatican has reportedlycounteredthat Prevost was not the one who authorized Ray’s living arrangements at the friary. Prevost subsequently spent eight years as the bishop of Chiclayo, Peru, beginning in 2015. According to a statement that they issued, three women told Prevost directly that they had allegedly been abused as minors by local priests named Eleuterio Vásquez González and Ricardo Yesquén. But the women said they had no evidence any meaningful investigation into their claims ensued, and at one point they published several images showing Vásquez publicly celebrating mass on important occasions such as Easter despite purported assurances to them that he was suspended from such ministry, as the National Catholic Reporternotedin reporting on a case rife with conflicting claims. Chiclayo’s diocese reportedly said the Vatican agency which investigates clerical sexual abuse cases found insufficient evidence to substantiate the accusers’ allegations – and that local law enforcement authorities reached a similar conclusion, in part citing the lapse of an applicable statute of limitations. One of the accusers, Ana María Quispe,lamentedin Spanish to the Peruvian television news program Cuarto Poder: “They have always told us the church is our mother – but a mother protects.” For its part, Chiclayo’s diocese reportedly said “it is not true” that Prevost and the church “turned its back on the alleged victims”. The diocese reportedly said the accusers remained free to pursue complaints in civil court and have a standing offer of church-provided “psychological help if they required it”. Francis, who died on 21 April, made Prevost a cardinal in September 2023. A reputation as a “moderating influence” among the ideologically disparate bishops in Peru evidently helped Leoclinch the papacy– somewhat unexpectedly – on Thursday.",

On Thursday, Republicans in theHouse of Representativesapproved legislation to codifyDonald Trump’s policy of renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America”. The measure was sponsored by rightwing Georgia lawmakerMarjorie Taylor Greeneand passed nearly along party lines, with all Democrats opposed and almost every Republican, with the exception of vulnerable Nebraska representative Don Bacon, voting in favor. The bill would make the name change official for federal agencies, but it’s unlikely to attract the Democratic support needed to pass the Senate. Even if it did, other countries have no obligation to use the new name. Sheinbaum had warned Google, which is part of tech giant Alphabet, in February that she wasconsidering legal actionunless the company reversed its decision. Her government argues that Trump’s executive order on the subject only applies to the part of the continental shelf belonging to the United States. “All we want is for the decree issued by the US government to be complied with,” Sheinbaum said. “The US government only calls the portion of the US continental shelf the Gulf of America, not the entire gulf, because it wouldn’t have the authority to name the entire gulf,” she added. In response to Trump, Sheinbaum hascheekily suggestedcalling the United States “América Mexicana” – Mexican America, pointing to a map dating back to before 1848, when one-third of her country was seized by the United States.

    "title": "Trump floats cutting Chinese tariffs from 145% to 80% before weekend talks",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has floated cutting tariffs on China from 145% to 80% before a weekend meeting as he looks to de-escalate the trade war. Top US officials are expected to meet a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first significant talks between the two nations since Trump provoked a trade war with stiff tariffs on imports. The US president wrote “80% Tariff onChinaseems right! Up to Scott B” on his social media account on Friday morning, referring to Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary. Bessent and Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative, will meet their counterparts in Geneva in the most senior known conversations between the two countries in months, the Trump administration announced this week. It comes amid growing US market concern over the impact of the tariffs on the prices and supply of consumer goods. No country has been hit harder by Trump’s trade war than China, the world’s biggest exporter and second largest economy. When the US president announced his “liberation day” tariffs on 2 April, China retaliated with tariffs of its own, a move that Trump viewed as demonstrating a lack of respect. The tariffs on each other’s goods have been mounting since then, with the US tariffs against China now at 145% and China tariffs on the US at 125%. Chinese trade with the US slumped in April even as its total exports beat forecasts, official figures showed, as trade representatives from both nations prepared to meet this weekend in the midst of a gruelling trade war between the superpower rivals. Exports to the US – one of China’s top trading partners – fell 17.6% in April, data showed. Against that backdrop, analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected exports to rise just 2% year-on-year last month. However, they beat expectations, coming in at 8.1%. “The damage of the US tariffs has not shown up in the trade data in April,” Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note. “This may be partly due to transshipment through other countries, and partly because of trade contracts that were signed before the tariffs were announced,” he added. “I expect trade data will weaken in the next few months gradually.” Trade between the world’s two largest economies has slowedconsiderably sinceTrump’s rounds of tariffson China. Levies on many Chinese products are now as high as 145%, with cumulative duties on some goods a staggering 245%. Beijing has responded with 125% tariffs on imports of US goods, along with other measures targeting American firms. Bessent and the trade representative Jamieson Greer are due to meet the Chinese vice-premier, He Lifeng, in Switzerland on Saturday and Sunday, markingthe first talks between the superpowerssince Trump unveiled his tariffs. On Thursday, Britain became the first toannounce a deal with the USthat reduces tariffs on British cars and lifts them on steel and aluminium, while, in return, Britain will open up markets to US beef and other farm products. But analysts said traders were more excited about the Republican leader’s comments on the forthcoming talks with China in which he hinted at easing the stiff measures aimed at the world’s No 2 economy. Trump told reporters that he thought the negotiations would be “substantive”, and when asked if reducing the levies was a possibility he said “it could be”. “We’re going to see. Right now you can’t get any higher. It’s at 145% so we know it’s coming down. I think we’re going to have a very good relationship.” Speaking on Friday, the deputy foreign minister, Hua Chunying, said China had full confidence in its ability to manage US trade issues. “We have no fear,” Hua told reporters, adding that the trade policy of the US administration could be sustained. “We do not want any kind of war with any country. But we have to face up to the reality. As you can see, people have full confidence in our capability to overcome all the difficulties … Ordinary people in the US already feelsuffering from the tariff war.” April’s economic data showed that China’s imports beat expectations, dropping 0.2%, compared with the 6% slide analysts had estimated. Purchases from overseas were being closely watched as a gauge of consumer demand in China, which has remained sluggish. With Reuters, Associated Press and Agence France-Presse",

    "title": "‘The whole country is proud’: Chinese snooker fans hail Zhao Xintong triumph",
    "article_text": "Chain smoking under the fluorescent lights of a cavernous billiards hall in Beijing, Brother Yuan can’t stop smiling. The previous day, along with 150 million other people across China, he had been at home watching the snooker world championships final. Now he’s with his fellow cue-heads, celebrating the win of China’s first snooker world champion,Zhao Xintong. “He’s a great role model for young people inChina,” Yuan, 55, says of the generation Z upstart who on Monday claimed snooker’s top prize. “He’s bringing the excitement back.” It’s a far cry from the 1980s when Yuan was a young player in Beijing with dreams of going professional. The industry wasn’t well developed and the money wasn’t there. He remembers vividly the 1987 Kent Cup, a snooker tournament held in Beijing. “All seven of the world’s top-ranked players came. Willie Thorne, Jimmy White, Steve Davis … At that time, snooker was only played in Zhongshan Park in Beijing. No other places in the city had it, and most people didn’t even know how to play,” Yuan says. “I recall two Chinese players participated, but they clearly had very little idea how to play snooker. It was actually quite funny to watch.” Nowadays, Chinese snooker is no laughing matter. Zhao’s victory on Monday completed his comeback from a 20-month suspension for involvement in amatch-fixing ringthat has been described as the biggest scandal in snooker’s history. Snooker’s governing body charged 10 Chinese players with match-fixing offences in January 2023 and handed out bans ranging from 20 months to a lifetime. Zhao did not directly throw a match but he accepted charges of being party to another player fixing two games and betting on matches himself. His display of genuine remorse since the scandal was exposed and his rise to the top from being relegated to the amateur tour as part of his punishment has won him legions of fans in China and beyond. “Honestly, at first I didn’t think he’d beat [Mark Williams],” says a snooker fan surnamed Xu who works at KOSnookerBar in Beijing, referring to the three-time world champion who was Zhao’s opponent in the final. “That shows he’s really put in the work. He’s impressive.” Fans online have been similarly impressed. The hashtag about Zhao’s win was viewed more than 180m times on Weibo. Arriving at Shenzhen Bao’an airport on Thursday, a slightly bewildered Zhao was greeted by hordes of fans thrusting flowers into his arms and reporters thrusting microphones. “Thanks again everyone for your support. I’ll start again and take it slow, and continue to achieve better results in snooker,” Zhao said. Zhao hails from Shenzhen, a city on the border with Hong Kong that is known for having the most developed snooker culture in China, thanks in part to its proximity to the former British colony. In the 1990s, as people flocked to the city during the era of reform and opening up in which China underwent rapid economic development, snooker halls “sprang up like mushrooms after rain”, according to a Shenzhen state media article published this week to celebrate Zhao’s win. Ding Juhui, China’s most successful snooker player before Zhao came on to the scene, moved to Shenzhen at a young age to train owing to the city’s better snooker opportunities, the article said. Since the 1990s, snooker has boomed in popularity across the country, and Zhao’s victory is expected to push it even higher. An estimated 50 million people play the sport and China has 300,000 snooker halls, up from 34,000 in 2005. Chinese eight-ball, a variant on pool, is even more popular. Sun Baochen opened KO Snooker Bar in Beijing’s upmarket Sanlitun district in February. He’s hoping to capitalise on any new Zhao-led boom. Already he spends up to 16 hours a day at the club, which is open around the clock. Business has been “extremely busy”, he says, although on a Tuesday evening there are only about a dozen customers. Zhao’s victory will “definitely” boost the footfall, Sun says. “My whole WeChat Moments feed was talking about it. People were going crazy. It’s something the whole country is proud of.” Yuan beams: “It’s going to create a huge wave of interest. And there are a lot of people in China.” Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu and Lillian Yang",

    "title": "Labor wants to fix Australia’s housing issues – but there’s little hope for those not already on the ladder",
    "article_text": "Days afterLabor won a decisive victorywith a mandate to fix housing affordability, those in charge of handing out mortgages poured cold water on it coming to pass. Andrew Irvine, the chief executive of National Australia Bank, said the country “may not get the outcome we want” as the gulf between homeowners and everybody else threatens to expand in the coming months. The long-serving ANZ chief executive, Shayne Elliott, was even more forthright when addressing media on Thursday. “I don’t know we are dealing with it. I mean, things are getting worse,” said Elliott, who stepped down from his role on Friday after almost a decade leading the bank. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “I know there’s really well-meaning, really thoughtful policies on both sides of politics … but the reality is, as we sit here today, I’m not sure there’s confidence that we are going to see any material change any time soon.” The bank bosses pointed to a lack of housing supply for their dour outlook. There are also other factors, such as the need to improve transport networks and infrastructure to ignite that supply, resolve unnecessary planning impediments, tackle high building costs and labour constraints. The affordability problem has built up over decades, and Australia’s banking CEOs don’t believe the issue will be resolved any time soon. “The Australian dream is owning a home, and you want younger people to have a chance to do that, you want new Australians to have a chance to do that,” said Irvine. “The only way we’re going to address this is to fix supply. It’s still the case that too much of the discourse on housing is on the demand side.” The lack of reformist housing policies – economists criticisedboth sides of politicsfor their competing election platforms – is fuelling an expectation that home prices will just keep rising, putting home ownership even further out of reach for younger generations. Many housing reform advocates gave up on expecting federal governments to help resolve the issue afterLabor’s ill-fated 2019 campaignto overhaul negative gearing and capital gains tax, both of which would have represented robust reforms. Advocates are now focusing their attention on rental rights, which are a state issue. The thinking is that improving tenancy rights may lower the value of rental properties, easing affordability at the expense of landlords. Those already on the property ladder don’t want to get off it. Even the banks were surprised how many of those who scrambled to get a mortgage in recent years – and then faced a string of interest rate increases and sharp rise in living costs – kept up with repayments. “The resilience of customers who have navigated significant cost-of-living challenges over the past few years is impressive,” Westpac chief executive Anthony Miller said on Monday, after delivering the bank’s half-year results. Part of the reason people clung on to their mortgages so tightly is that there are no good alternatives, given the tight rental market. Mortgage arrears at the major banks have tended to plateau, or even drop, over the past six months, hovering well below pre-pandemic levels. The number of households requesting hardship packages from their lenders has generally been falling. For those able to hang on to their mortgages, relief is in sight. After the Reserve Bank reduced borrowing rates in February, a quarter-of-a-percentage point cut in the cash rate on 20 May is deemed a sure thing, and would lower the key rate to 3.85%, from 4.1%. From there, financial markets are pricing in a further three cuts to 3.1% by December. Experts are a little less bullish, with a general consensus that the cash rate will end 2025 at 3.35%. Either way, mortgage holders are set to receive substantial relief on their interest payments. The monthly repayment on a $500,000 loan at an interest rate of 6.01% is $3,225.Every cut of 0.25 percentage points lowers the interest bill by $76 a month. A further four rate cuts this year would deliver a $304 boost to monthly household budgets. While existing homeowners will be cheering falling rates, the picture is more complicated for those hoping to break into the property market, or upgrade towards a family home. Lower interest rates boosts borrowing capacity – meaning buyers can afford to pay more. But cheaper money will also lift prices and potentially widen the deposit gap, and worsen the affordability crisis. AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said he expected a rate cut on 20 May followed by another in August. He then expects a cut in November and then again early next year. Oliver said the combination of cheaper loans and Labor’s election housing policy to help first home buyers buy with a smaller deposit would ultimately push property prices higher. “Lower rates and 5% deposits may feel like a good thing, and if you get in early it will be, because they can borrow more and it will be easier to service your loan,” he said. “For those who get in later (after prices have started climbing faster), it’s not so good – and the ultimate winners are existing homeowners.” Louis Christopher, the founder of SQM Research, said rate cuts – if they happen – will have a progressively greater impact on house prices as the year passes. Still, with the election and April holidays out of the way, Christopher expects a busy winter of property auctions. “We expect housing prices across the country to climb by 6-10% in 2025,” he said.",

    "title": "Queensland government held 21-minute consultation on puberty blocker ban at same time it announced decision",
    "article_text": "The legality of Queensland’sban on puberty blockershas been questioned after it was revealed the state government undertook 21 minutes of internal consultation at the same time as a press conference announcing the decision. According to one administrative law expert, an alleged failure to conduct “genuine” consultation could lead to it being overturned in a legal challenge launched this week. Under section 48 of the Hospital and Health Boards Act 2011, the director general ofQueenslandHealth must consult with a service “in developing a health service directive” that applies to it. According to a response by the health minister, Tim Nicholls, to a parliamentary question on notice, that consultation took place from about 10am on 28 January, finishing at 10.21am. The minister announced the government’s decision to implement the directiveat a press conference that started at 10.06am. Nicholls announced “an immediate pause on new public patients receiving hormone therapy”. “The government has made these four decisions that I’m announcing today [including the directive],” he said, about 11 minutes into the 24-minute press conference. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The directivebans public facilities from prescribing stage oneor stage two hormone therapies. Itapplies only to transgender children; puberty blockers can still be prescribed for precocious puberty and other conditions. Prof Anthony Cassimatis, the deputy director of the centre for public, international and comparative law at the University of Queensland, said similar decisions had been quashed in the past for lack of genuine consultation because the time involved was so short. He pointed to the case of Carrascalao v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. In that case, the decision maker cancelled a visaafter about four hours’ consideration. “The federal court didn’t like that,” Cassimatis said. “They thought that that can’t have been genuine consideration to have happened so quickly.” The circumstances relating to the health directive “would appear to be even more dramatic than that”, he said. “Parliament has required the decision maker to consider [the advice provided during the consultation] and that needs to be consideration in some meaningful sense,” Cassimatis said. The health minister revealed the consultation timeline on 1 May, in a response to a parliamentary question on notice by Greens MP Michael Berkman. “Prior to issuing the directive, the chief executive formally consulted with all hospital and health service chief executives,” Nicholls said in his response. “A meeting was scheduled from 10:00am on Tuesday 28 January 2025 and I am advised that it concluded at 10:21am. The health service directive was shared, read through in detail and discussed collectively at the meeting.” Sign up toMorning Mail Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion According to documents obtained by Guardian Australia under right to information laws, the minister was sent a version of a press release announcing the decision the previous day, Monday 27 January, at 4.34pm. Berkman said the government had clearly made its decision before the 21-minute consultation was finished. A legal challenge against the decision by the mother of a transgender child was launched this week by the LGBTI Legal Service. Matilda Alexander, a spokesperson for the service, said the timing of the consultation meeting would become part of its lawsuit. A spokesperson for Nicholls said: “As the matter is the subject of a legal action currently in the supreme court, it is inappropriate to comment further.” The director general of health was also asked for comment, and responded: “As the matter is the subject of a legal action currently in the supreme court, it is inappropriate to comment further.” According to his statement of reasons filed in the case, the Queensland health director general, David Rosengren, made two “minor refinements” to the directive as a result of the consultation. The directive was issued at 11.07am on January 28 and published online. The ban on puberty blockers will remain in effect until the completion of a study by psychiatrist Dr Ruth Vine. It is due to be completed by 30 November.",

    "article_text": "A diver who was working on preliminary operations toraise the late tech tycoon Mike Lynch’s sunken superyacht, Bayesian, has died during underwater work in Sicily. The 39-year-old Dutch diver died on Friday while working underwater in preparation to cut the ship’s mainmast. According to initial reports, the man was employed by the maritime company Hebo, whose barge arrived last week in Porticello, a fishing port near Palermo, where marine salvage experts have been carrying out preparatory work before an operation to raise the 56-metre superyacht. Police said the precise cause of death was still unknown. A preliminary examination of the body revealed no visible injuries or burns. Investigators believe the diver may have suffered a medical problem while submerged. An alternative line of inquiry is that after divers used a blowtorch to cut the vessel’s boom the man was struck by dislodged debris – possibly a piece of metal. Footage captured by underwater cameras cut off shortly before the incident. A spokesperson for the British-based consultancy TMC Marine, which will oversee a consortium of expert salvage specialists undertaking the project, said: “We are saddened to confirm the tragic death of a specialist diver while doing underwater work earlier today [Friday]. The circumstances of the accident are being investigated by the authorities and all parties are offering their full cooperation. We are giving every support to the salvage team on site at this heartbreaking time and our thoughts are with the family of the deceased.” On 19 August 2024, the luxury vessel, with a 75-metre (246ft) mast, was anchored just off shore near Porticello when it wasstruck shortly before dawn by a violent storm. Lynch, once described as Britain’s Bill Gates, and his 18-year-old daughter, Hannah, were among the seven victims. Lynch, who in June last year wascleared of fraud chargesin the US relating to the purchase of his company, Autonomy, by Hewlett-Packard in 2011,was enjoying a lavish voyage around Sicilyto celebrate his acquittal alongside Hannah and his wife, Angela Bacares, whose company owned the Bayesian. Among those onboard were Lynch’s attorney from Clifford Chance, Chris Morvillo, and his wife, the jewellery designer Neda Morvillo, and Morgan Stanley International’s chair, Jonathan Bloomer, and his wife, Judy Bloomer, a former psychotherapist. All four died in the incident. The yacht’s chef, Recaldo Thomas, was the seventh person who died. Fifteen people survived, including Bacares.

    "title": "Israel committing genocide in Gaza, says EU’s former top diplomat",
    "article_text": "The former EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has launched a blistering attack onIsrael, accusing its government of committing genocide in Gaza and “carrying out the largest ethnic-cleansing operation since the end of the second world war in order to create a splendid holiday destination”. Borrell, a former Spanish foreign ministerwho served as the EU’s top diplomat from 2019 to 2024, and president of the European parliament from 2004 to 2007, also criticised the bloc’s failure to use all the means at its disposal to influence Israel, saying expressions of regret were simply not enough. As he collected the Charles V European award in front of dignitaries including King Felipe in south-west Spain on Friday, Borrell said the horrors Israel had suffered in the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 could not justify the horrors it had subsequently inflicted on Gaza. “We’re facing the largest ethnic cleansing operation since the end of the second world war in order to create a splendid holiday destination once all the millions of tonnes of rubble have been cleared fromGazaand the Palestinians have died or gone away,” he said in a characteristically direct speech. ​The former diplomat accused Israel of violating all the rules of conflict and of using the starvation of Gaza’s civilian population as a “weapon of war”. “Three times more explosive power has been dropped on Gaza than was used in the Hiroshima bomb,” he said. “And for months now, nothing has been getting into Gaza. Nothing: no water, no food, no electricity, no fuel, no medical services. That’s what [Benjamin] Netanyau’s ministers have said and it’s what they’ve done.” He added: “We all know what’s going on there, and we’ve all heardthe objectives stated by Netanyau’s ministers​, which are clear declarations of genocidal intent. Seldom have I heard the leader of a state so clearly outline a plan that fits the legal definition of genocide.” Borrell went on to take Europe to task for shirking its moral and humanitarian responsibilities over Gaza. “Europe has the capacity and the means not only to protest against what is going on but also to influence [Israel’s] conduct,” he said. “But it is not doing so. We supply half the bombs that are falling on Gaza. If we really believe that too many people are dying, then the natural response would be to supply fewer weapons and to use the lever of the association agreement to demand that international humanitarian law is respected, instead of just lamenting that that isn’t happening.” The veteran socialist politician also used his speech to reflect on current geopolitical realities, which he described as unprecedented. The post-1945 world order, he said, was being demolished by Vladimir Putin, “a tyrant whose military failure in Ukraine has made him more dangerous”, and by Donald Trump who he described as “the master of chaos, who has gone from being an ally to an adversary”. The question facing Europe, he added, was how well it would cope without the protections long afforded by its old ally across the Atlantic. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “In order to deal with this situation, we need to move from structural pacifism to strong rearmament, but we need to do that on a European scale if we want to avoid the waste that stirs the old national demons,” said Borrell. “We need to shift away from a comfortable and atavistic Atlanticism, which has seen us delegate our security to the US, to building full European sovereignty, which will also mean giving Europe a fiscal and security dimension.” He said that Europe was no longer the great driver, or chronicler, of world history. “Today, history has become a product that’s imported,” Borrell added. “History has been written by the Russian soldiers who marched towards Kyiv in the early hours of a February morning, and by the Ukrainians who resisted. History is being written by the US voters who put Mr Trump back in the White House.” History, he went on, was now the story of the technological competition between the US and China. In what appeared to be a swipe at Trump, Borrell added: “The faces of history today are those of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. None of them is European. I know them – well, I know them a bit – and I can assure you that of those three, two are more intelligent than the third. The thing is the third one doesn’t know it.”",

    "title": "Leaders of UK, France, Germany and Poland to visit Ukraine in joint show of support",
    "article_text": "The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland are due in Kyiv on Saturday for a symbolic visit to Ukraine,a day after Vladimir Putin hosted a set-piece military parade on Red Square. The visit comes as the US warned of intelligence about a big impending air attack on Ukraine. Keir Starmer,Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and Donald Tusk are expected to arrive in Kyiv early on Saturday and will meet the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a show of support for Ukraine, Downing Street said in a statement issued late on Friday. “We, the leaders of France, Germany, Poland the United Kingdom will stand in Kyiv in solidarity withUkraineagainst Russia’s barbaric and illegal full-scale invasion,” the four leaders said in a joint statement. The four European leaders will reiterate calls for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in the conflict during their visit, something that Donald Trump and the US administration have said could be the first step on the way to a sustainable peace deal. Ukraine has said it is ready to implement butRussiahas so far refused. Instead, Moscow unilaterallydeclared a three-day ceasefire beginning on 8 May, which Kyiv said was designed to avoid Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia during celebrations of 80 years of the Soviet victory in the second world war, held in Moscow on Friday. Fighting has continued along the frontlines during the supposed ceasefire, both sides have said, but Russia has largely refrained from drone and missile attacks on Ukraine. However, as the leaders were already en route to Ukraine, the US embassy inKyivput out a public warning late on Friday night that it had received intelligence of a “potentially significant air attack that may occur at any time over the next several days”. It did not give further details. The four European leaders are expected to visit Kyiv’s Maidan on Saturday morning, where thousands of flags have been planted to remember those who have been killed in the war with Russia, before sitting down with Zelenskyy. Later, Downing Street said the five would beam into a virtual meeting to update other leaders on progress being made for a so-called “air, land, maritime and regeneration force” that is planned to be part of a peace deal. “We are ready to support peace talks as soon as possible, to discuss technical implementation of the ceasefire, and prepare for a full peace deal,” said the statement. “We will continue to increase our support for Ukraine. Until Russia agrees to an enduring ceasefire, we will ratchet up pressure on Russia’s war machine.” Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion On Friday, thousands of troops marched through Red Square as Putin held his annual Victory Day parade. Numerous world leaders attended, most notably China’s Xi Jinping, and the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Robert Fico and Aleksandar Vučić, prime minister of EU member Slovakia and president of EU hopeful Serbia respectively,also attended the parade, drawing irritation from other European leaders. “All those who truly support peace cannot stand side-by-side with Putin. Those who truly support peace should be in Ukraine tomorrow, not Moscow,” said the EU’s top diplomat on Thursday. Foreign ministers from numerous EU countries, as well as Britain’s David Lammy, travelled to Lviv on Friday, to announce the foundation of a tribunal for Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Saturday’s visit to Kyiv is likely to focus more on finding a common western position on Ukraine to take to Donald Trump, as European leaders try their best to keep the US onside. The Trump administration has so far appeared to be much tougher on Kyiv than Moscow, but there are some small signals that the mood in Washington might be changing, after a positive meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in the Vatican on the sidelines of the Pope’s funeral. Even vice-president JD Vance, seen as the most sceptical of voices on support for Ukraine,has criticised Moscow’s stancein recent days. “Right now, the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict. We think they’re asking for too much,” he said on Wednesday.",

    "title": "‘Look forward, not back’: UK keen for closer trade ties with EU, says Starmer",
    "article_text": "The UK has “ambitious” plans to secure a closer trading partnership with the EU,Keir Starmerhas said, as he argued the British public had moved on from Brexit. Before a UK-EU summit, the prime minister urged people to “look forward, not back” as the country embarked on a new era of its relationship with the bloc. At the end of a week in which Starmer has strucktrade deals with the USandIndia, he indicated the UK would align with the EU on food standards, work more closely on law enforcement and that he would support a controlled youth mobility scheme. It marks the start of a big political offensive by the government to explain the benefits of closer ties with the EU, amid some anxiety within Labour over howReform UKwill respond to the deal. Frustrations are beginning to emerge in the EU over what it sees as a cautious approach by the government to its request for a reset in the relationship, in part because of the electoral threat from Nigel Farage’s party. The summit will be held in Downing Street, prompting some to speculate it had been downsized after reports it would be held at Lancaster House. However, sources say it was “never meant to be big, just EU institution leaders and UK leaders”.In an interview onboard HMS St Albans during a visit to Norway, Starmer told the Guardian: “I’m ambitious about what we can achieve there. I want a closer relationship on security, on defence, on trade and on the economy. “The mindset is important and this is, I think, a shared approach. Let’s look forward, not back. Let’s recognise we’re living in a different world. We’re in a new era on security and defence. Equally, we’re in a new era on trade and the economy now. “What President Trump is doing through his tariffs is for a purpose and we need to recognise that the way we lower barriers with like-minded partners really matters.” Asked whether he believed the public had moved on enough fromBrexitand if the public would understand the benefits of his EU reset, Starmer said: “I think so.“Because I think people are focused on how we get the economy moving. How do I feel better off? How do we get more money into our public services and how do we protect my job? And it’s important to ask the question: who have you got in your mind’s eye when you make decisions?” There had been high hopes on the EU side that the stage would be set for a deeper relationship at the summit due to be held in London on 19 May. But some EU diplomats are concerned the UK’s appetite for a closer deal has been tempered by the success of Reform UK in the local elections, and by reaction to concessions to the Indian government over national insurance exemptions for staff seconded temporarily to the UK. One said: “Everyone is very sensitive to how a closer relationship lands in the UK.” Business leaders are also apprehensive about the outcome of the summit, saying they want to go faster and deeper to claw back the loss of growth caused by Brexit. “The logic of being closer to the EU is inarguable but the fear is the politics are going to limit it,” one said. The governor of the Bank of England said he hoped the UK could “rebuild” trade relationships with the EU after striking a trade deal with the US. Andrew Bailey said it would be “beneficial” to reverse the post-Brexit reduction in UK-EU trade. The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that Brexit reduced the UK economy’s long-run productivity by 4%. Meanwhile, the government said it was willing to pay for UK companies to gain access to EU defence spending programmes worth hundreds of billions of pounds, after resistance from the French to give it access amid disputes over fishing rights. The defence secretary, John Healey, told the BBC: “We are prepared to pay our fair share but we want to have a say in the programmes, while retaining UK intellectual property and export opportunities.” Sign up toHeadlines UK Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion In his interview, Starmer said the “calm and pragmatic” approach he had taken in negotiations with the US and India to secure trade deals would also get an agreement with the EU over the line. Starmer travelled on to Ukraine where he will join the leaders of France, Poland and Germany at a meeting of the “coalition of the willing” with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday to underline their ongoing commitment to the country. The four major European defence powers, travelling to Kyiv together for the first time, comes as they and the US president, Donald Trump, called Russia to agree a 30-day ceasefire and come to the negotiating table. Contrasting the government’s approach with Tory administrations’ dealings with Brussels, he said: “We will do this in a serious, pragmatic way, and we won’t rush to the nearest microphone every time there’s a twist or turn in the negotiations.” He backed Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister for EU relations, who publicly confirmed this week the UK was looking at setting up a controlled youth mobility scheme with the EU. “We’re pragmatists, and that’s the approach that we bring to these negotiations. We’ve got red lines, but we’re pragmatists,” Starmer said. However, government sources indicated that even if the youth mobility pact was mentioned as part of the reset agreement later this month, it would only be properly explored at a later date. Starmer also suggested the UK would align with the EU on food and other standards as part of the deal. “We do not want to lower our standards on food. We are not involved in, nor will we be involved in, a sort of race to the bottom on standards,” he said. “I think that British people are proud of the high standards that we have, and we want to maintain those standards.” The prime minister also accepted there would be a role for the European court of justice in resolving any disputes, as was already the case for the Northern Ireland border deal struck by Rishi Sunak. He said: “There’s already a role for the ECJ. Look at the Windsor agreement, that’s already there, and I think most people feel that the Windsor framework was a step forward.”He added that the UK was pushing for a closer relationship with the EU on law enforcement. “I do want to work more closely together. I do want to ensure we get the best possible arrangements for data sharing. I’d like us to work more with Europol and put ourselves in a position where the UK can lead investigations in Europol. We’re very good at it. So the ambition there is to work as closely as possible.”",

The United States and its European allies are finalising a proposal for a 30-day ceasefire inUkrainethat if refused would see them jointly impose new sanctions on Russia, a French diplomatic source said on Friday.The source said the proposal had still not been given a green light and would be worked on over the weekend at a summit being held in Ukraine. Support forUkraineis the “absolute focus” of Britain and its northern European allies, Keir Starmer said as he attended a military summit in Norway that coincided with Russia’s Victory Day celebrations.The prime minister met counterparts at a Joint Expeditionary Forces (JEF) leaders’ gathering in Oslo on Friday, during which Volodymyr Zelenskyy also spoke virtually. France and Poland signed a treaty on Friday to increase cooperation on defence, nuclear energy and other measures, in a sign of growing alliances between European nations amid concerns about US commitment to Europe’s security.The signing came a day before Ukraine hosts leaders of the so-called “coalition of the willing” – countries led by France and Britain that want to step up support for Ukraine in the face of a more sceptical Trump administration. Ukrainian authorities claim to have busted a Hungarian spy ring operating on its territory, alleging that Budapest was collecting sensitive military data with one eye on a possible future incursion into the west of the country.Hungary’s foreign minister dismissed the accusations as “propaganda” and announced the expulsion of two Ukrainians described as “spies working under diplomatic cover” at the Ukrainian embassy in Budapest. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that European leaders from the “coalition of the willing” will meet inUkraineon Saturday.“In Ukraine, we are also preparing to meet with the leaders of the coalition of the willing … Tomorrow we have meetings,” Zelensky told a military summit in Oslo via video link, AFP reported, without saying who would attend.

The pair were the only European leaders to travel to Moscow after strong injunctions from EU officials not to do so. On Thursday, the bloc’s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said: “All those who truly support peace cannot stand side-by-side with Putin. Those who truly support peace should be inUkrainetomorrow, not Moscow.” Kallas added this week that the Russian president was “waging a war right now, not a war from history. That remains on the conscience of those attending”. Donald Tusk, who later on Friday was due to sign a cooperation and friendship treaty with France including joint security and defence commitments, sharply criticised both leaders, although did so without naming them. The Polish prime minister said: “For me it is unthinkable that one can be from this part of the world and – during Russia’s aggression againstUkraine– be in Red Square and celebrate Victory Day with those who are murdering children, civilians and attacking other countries.” The United States and its European allies are finalising a proposal for a 30-day ceasefire inUkrainethat if refused would see them jointly impose new sanctions on Russia, a French diplomatic source said on Friday. The source said the proposal had still not been given a green light and would be worked on over the weekend at a summit being held in Ukraine. Polish prime minister Donald Tusk said that anyone attending the military parade in Moscow to mark the end of the second world war had brought shame on themselves, after Slovak prime minister Robert Fico became the only European Union leader to attend. “I try not to comment on the decisions and behaviour of leaders of states, especially from our community,” Tusk told a news conference. “But there is no doubt in my mind that being at the victory parade in Moscow and applauding President Putin … brings shame to everyone who is there.” Support forUkraineis the “absolute focus” of Britain and its northern European allies, Keir Starmer said as he attended a military summit in Norway that coincided with Russia’s Victory Day celebrations. The prime minister met counterparts at a Joint Expeditionary Forces (JEF) leaders’ gathering in Oslo on Friday, during which Volodymyr Zelenskyy also spoke virtually. After the summit, Starmer said the UK-led group’s utmost priority was defending the values “hard-won” during the second world war and continuing to stand behind Kyiv. Speaking to broadcasters, the prime minister was asked what his message would be toRussiaand Beijing as Chinese president Xi Jinping attended events in Moscow marking the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany. Starmer said: “The message of leaders here is very, very clear, and that is that we’re focused on Ukraine. “[President] Zelenskyy came in virtually to part of that meeting. “And so that’s where our absolute focus is – with Ukraine, defending the values that yesterday at VE Day we were remembering and commemorating, that were hard-won in the second world war.” And that’s all from me,Jakub Krupa,but I leave with youTom Ambroseto guide you through the afternoon. We don’t yet have the full text of the agreement, so it’s hard to know exactly what it contains – especially regarding the strength of the language on critical security obligations. Still, it send a clear signal of political intent from both leaders – for both countries, and, as Tusk suggested (16:52), also towards the United States – that Europe is taking its defence responsibilities more seriously. Finally, a cynic in me says that it’s also worth noting the timing, with Poland’s presidential election just over a week away. While the deal seeks to transcend short-term politics, the visual message — a show of unity and close cooperation with a major European power— will do no harm to the ruling party’s candidate, centre-right Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski,who also recently met with Macron. Asked aboutZelenskyy’scomments on tomorrow’s meeting of “the coalition of the willing,”Macronconfirms itwill take place in a hybrid formatwith some leaders joining in person and others online due to security concerns and that he will take part in it. On Russia’s show of force at the Moscow victory parade and more broadly on the continuing aggression onUkraine, he says: “President Putin is on the side of war, not on the side of peace.” He says the reality of Putin’s actions show that any belief thatRussiais interested in peace is “wrong at this stage,” and repeats that European partners, together with the US, will keep pushing for a ceasefire. He is also asked about Slovak prime ministerRobert Fico’spresence in Moscow, and he diplomatically says he is not sure that’s the best reading of European history. Poland’sTuskisn’t quite as diplomatic: repeating his earlier criticism (10:28), he says “being present at the victory parade in Moscow brings shame on whoever is there.” And that concludes the press conference. In response to another question,Tuskalso dismisses the suggestion that a closer Franco-Polish cooperation is “an alternative, or something that is [done outside] Nato, or, God forbid, anti-American.” “It’s the exact opposite.We’ve all heard these comments, repeated multiple times, from our American allies, and we in Poland treat these words seriously. … And they were clear: you need to arm, you need to be increasingly self-sufficient, and then you can count on US help, if you pull your weight when it comes to defence,” he says. He adds thatcloser relationship with France is a part of that push. “Yes,Europe needs to be able to defend itself.Yes, every aggressor needs to fear Europe, whetherRussiaor anyone else,” he says. Macronresponds by saying what’s changed is the creation of Nato, which also includes a serious security guarantee in Article 5. He then goes on to repeat his main argument that European defence and security position needs to be strengthened further. He says it is needed also because of the growing pressure from the US for Europe to take more responsibility for its safety and become more independent. He then says that the commemorations this week send a clear reminder that “we cannot succeed alone” and “narrow nationalism” is not the answer. Tuskcomes on the political part of the question to argue that both Macron and himself proved to be able to fight against populist and insurgent right. He then says that the mutual assistance clause is underpinned by the conviction that all countries learned their lessons from the second world war. He also stresses that Poland is in the process of building the largest army in Europe to be able to defend itself and offer support to partners, too. Opening the Q&A, a Polish journalist tellsMacronthat Poland also had a treaty with France in 1939, and that didn’t help it too much when it was invaded, so what’s different this time? And will this treaty last if Marine Le Pen or another far-right figure comes to power? Ouch.",

    "title": "Chinese troops march with Russian forces as Xi joins Putin for Victory Day parade",
    "article_text": "Russian troops fighting inUkrainehave marched with Chinese forces on Moscow’s Red Square to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in a Victory Day celebration marked by greater spectacle than in recent years. After several scaled-back Victory Days – with reduced military displays and few foreign guests –Vladimir Putinon Friday addressed the largest parade since his 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “The Soviet Union took upon itself the most ferocious, merciless blows of the enemy,” the Russian president said of the victory over Nazi Germany, before turning to his invasion of Ukraine. “Truth and justice are on our side. The entire country, society and people support the participants of the special military operation,” Putin said, using the Kremlin’s preferred term to describe the war. While Putin was presiding over the parade, EU foreign ministers and Britain’s David Lammy travelled to Lviv in Ukraine where they announced the establishment of a tribunal for Russian war crimes. “Russia’s aggression cannot go unpunished and therefore establishing this tribunal is extremely important,” the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said during the visit. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he expected European leaders to visit Kyiv on Saturday, while European allies said at a meeting in Oslo that they supported an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in the war in Ukraine, something Moscow has been reluctant to agree to. Moscow welcomed at least 27 foreign heads to the annual military parade, the highest number since 2015, including the leaders of Brazil, Slovakia and Serbia. The Kremlin presented the turnout as proof that it is not isolated, even four years into its war in Ukraine. Other guests included leaders from fellow autocracies and pariah regimes, such as the military juntas from Myanmar and Burkina Faso. Putin also thanked a visiting North Korean military delegation – a sign of deepening ties and new geopolitical realities after recentadmissions from both sidesthat North Korean troops have been fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. Presiding over the parade, Putin sat beside the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, and was seen in frequent conversation with his most powerful ally. The two men heldextensive talksbefore the parade, and their joint statement went further than previous statements in directly condemning the US. The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was also in Moscow for the parade, and later on Friday met Putin. He criticised Donald Trump’s tariffs and pitched an expanded partnership with Moscow. “We have the chance at this historic moment to make our commercial relationship grow a lot,” he said. This year’s parade featured an expanded military presence, with a fleet of tanks rolling across Red Square alongside rocket launchers, TOS-2 Tosochka heavy flamethrower systems and Iskander ballistic missiles – all weapons used in the war in Ukraine. For the first time, several types of modern Russian-made drones were also on display, underscoring their role as a defining feature of the conflict. The showcase of weaponry marked a stark contrast to 2024’s toned-down parade, when a single Soviet-era tankrolled through Red Square. The shift is likely to resonate in European capitals, where officials have grown increasingly concerned about Moscow’s ability to replenish its military stockpiles and increase weapons production. Over his two-and-a-half decades in power, Victory Day has emerged as thecentrepiece of Putin’s vision of Russian identity. But since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Kremlin’s mass propaganda machine has given it new meaning, with Putin using the celebrations to justify the current war. Seated not far from Putin were several high-profile veterans of the war in Ukraine, while Russian media reported that more than 1,500 troops who took part in the invasion participated in the march. Putin has weaponised the legacy of the second world war to mobilise support for his invasion, falsely portraying Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, as a leader resurrecting nazism in Ukraine. Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said: “Victory Day is by far the most important celebration for Putin – it’s an ideological event designed to rally the nation around him. The central message to the public is that the current ‘special military operation’ is a logical continuation of the Great Patriotic War.” In a speech a day earlier, Zelenskyy condemned what he called Russia’s attempt to “appropriate Ukraine and distort history”, accusing the Kremlin of twisting the legacy of the second world war for propaganda purposes. “Tomorrow, the organiser of the mass graves in Bucha will speak of Nazi atrocities. The architects of the Mariupol siege will invoke the siege of Leningrad. It will be a parade of cynicism, bile, and lies,” Zelenskyy said. Despite the show of might on Red Square on Friday, there was widespread nervousness among Moscow’s political elite before the celebrations. At the end of April, Putin announced a three-day unilateral ceasefire in Ukraine, starting on 8 May to coincide with the commemorations. Zelenskyy dismissed the offer as self-serving and meaningless unless it was extended to 30 days, in line with a US-backed proposal that Putin has so far rejected. In the lead-up to Victory Day, Ukraine significantly increased its drone attacks on Moscow and surrounding regions, causing airport closures and logistical chaos. Zelenskyy also warned that Ukraine would provide no security guarantees to foreign guests attending the parade in Moscow. As many observers had predicted, Kyiv appeared to refrain from targeting Moscow on the day of the parade, probably owing to the presence of high-profile international dignitaries. Still, fighting continued near the frontlines, with Moscow accusing Ukrainian forces of attempting to breach the border in Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions. This year’s parade comes at what many see as a crossroads moment for Moscow, as the Trump administration steps up its efforts to persuade Putin to end the war. There appears to be a growing recognition in the White House that the Kremlin is not ready to back down from its maximalist demands, including territorial claims over parts of Ukraine it does not control. The US vice-president, JD Vance, echoed that frustration earlier this week, saying Russia wasasking for “too much”in the talks, in the latest sign of Washington’s impatience with the negotiations. Britain, France and a group of north European nations met in Oslo to discuss a route to a lasting peace in Ukraine. The Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, said that during a dinner on Thursday the leaders had phone contact with Trump and Zelenskyy, and were pushing for a full ceasefire. “That needs to be monitored and respected before you can move into the negotiations on the big issues to reach a lasting peace,” he said. Kolesnikov said Putin appeared undecided about whether to enter into serious negotiations or continue the war in Ukraine, where Russian forces are making slow, grinding progress at a high human cost. “For now, he is stalling for time,” he said.",

    "title": "Aid groups voice alarm as US pushes Israeli plan for Gaza assistance",
    "article_text": "Aid groups have voiced alarm at US moves to pressure them into accepting an Israeli proposal to resume limited humanitarian assistance to the war-ravaged territory under strictly controlled conditions. TheTrump administrationhas attempted to strong-arm international agencies – including the United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP) – into accepting Israel’s stringent rules for resuming deliveries, according to sources familiar with the discussions and news reports. A two-month blockade has left the coastal enclave’s 2.3 million inhabitants facing the prospect ofstarvation. The blockade was imposed by the Israel Defense Forces in March after the collapse of a ceasefire to the conflict that broke out after Hamas’s October 2023 attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel. So far, more than 52,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israel’s military response. Under the auspices of a newly establishedGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF), which is based in Geneva, aid would be delivered to four “hubs”, where recipients would have to go to collect it under the watchful gaze of private US security contractors, who would use facial recognition technology to vet who receives it. Israel insists the stringent measures are necessary to prevent aid being stolen or diverted to Hamas, although some assistance organizations have said they have seen no evidence of such practices. Aid groups have so far refused to participate in the scheme, fearing it violates “fundamental humanitarian principles” and breaches international law. Some have privately voiced concerns about potential “complicity in war crimes because of how the aid will be distributed”, according to one person in close contact with assistance organizations, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “There is a concern that this aid plan risks enabling war crimes related to forced displacement, starvation and internment,” the person said. “This is a scheme to make it seem like this is about aid, but what it’s really about is entrenching military occupation ofGaza.” Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,said this weekthat the Gaza population would be moved “for its own protection” under an intensive new Israeli military offensive. Israeli officials have indicated a plan to concentrate the entire population in the south of the strip. Opposition has been firm even as some organizations, includingWorld Central Kitchenand theWFP, have admitted that an inability to replenish supplies has left them unable to continue feeding the population. Even if aid is resumed, some groups say, the conditions Israel is stipulating will prevent it reaching many of those in need. “If you centralize, privatize and militarize aid delivery through this proposed hub model, it means that people will be excluded from getting humanitarian assistance,” said Joseph Belliveau, executive director of MedGlobal, which has been providing medical assistance – including to severely malnourished children – at 16 sites in Gaza. “People simply won’t be able to come to these distribution sites, either because of fear, logistical constraints, or distance. Even more importantly, many will be reluctant to come to centralized sites that are overseen by armed personnel, and given the way that that Israel has fought this war with incredible numbers of civilian casualties. “The best thing that the US and Israeli authorities can do is to lift the restrictions and allow us to … work safely [and] protect medical sites [and] humanitarian workers.” Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion But with living conditions growing increasingly dire, the Trump administration is pressing humanitarian outfits to accept Israel’s terms. US officials have reportedly met the UN and aid groups this week, even threatening to slash the WFP’s budget – which Washington partly funds – if it refuses to accept,according to the Times of Israel. Donald Trump told reporters in the White House on Monday that “the people of Gaza are starving and we’re going to help them get some food”. His Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, met members of the UN security council on Wednesday to discuss the Israeli plan, according tothe Washington Post. Trump has previously proposed having US taking ownership of Gaza and converting it into a “Riviera”, a scheme which would involve relocating its population to other countries. A state department spokesperson said Trump was seeking “creative solutions” that would “protect Israel, leave Hamas empty-handed, and help Gazans”. “We welcome moves to quickly get urgent food aid into Gaza in a way that prevents it from falling into the hands of terrorists, such as Hamas,” the spokesperson said. “We support a plan to get in aid now and urge others to do so as well. “Endless press releases and Hamas appeasement haven’t delivered food, medicine, or shelter to those who need it. This is a new approach with one focus: get help to people NOW.”",

    "title": "Pakistan says retaliatory strikes under way after accusing India of targeting military bases",
    "article_text": "Pakistan said it had begun retaliation strikes after accusing India of targeting three of its military bases with missiles fired from fighter jets, in a major escalation of the brewing conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry saidIndiahad fired six surface-to-air missiles targeting Nur Khan, Murid and Shorkot, three of Pakistan’s most important military bases, early on Saturday morning. He said most were intercepted by Pakistani air defences. Shortly afterwards, Pakistan officials confirmed they had begun their counter-attack against India, under the name Operation Bunyan Ul Marsoos, a phrase from the Qur’an roughly translating to “wall of lead”. Pakistan said the retaliation strikes targeted Indian army infrastructure and bases, including Pathankot military air field and the BrahMos missile storage site in the Indian state of Punjab as well as Udhampur air force base in Indian-administeredKashmir. Explosions and shelling from anti-aircraft guns was heard in the vicinity of all the sites. Loud explosions were also heard in the Indian-Kashmir city of Srinagar. Cities and districts in Punjab, Haryana and across Indian-administered Kashmir were put on red alert, with residents told to remain indoors and blackout orders enforced. India did not immediately comment on any alleged strikes but a statement from the ministry of defence said: “The Indian Armed Forces are maintaining a high state of alert, and all such aerial threats are being tracked and engaged using counter-drone systems.” The Indian army said that Pakistan’s “blatant escalation with drones and other munitions continues along our western borders”. They said multiple hostile drones had been spotted over the Punjab city of Amritsar, which were “instantly engaged and destroyed by our air defence units”. After the launch of their counter attack, Pakistan’s prime minister called a meeting of the National Command Authority, the main body in charge of decisions on control, command and operations of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. Pakistan‘s planning minister Ahsan Iqbal told local media that “special measures” had been taken to avoid civilian targets in India and that they were striking military locations that had been used to target Pakistan. “We would hate to see the nuclear threshold being breached,” said Iqbal. Among the military bases said to be targeted by Indian missiles was Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi, where the military has its headquarters, which is around 10km from the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. In the aftermath of the strikes, Pakistan shut down its air space. Video shared on social media showed flames and smoke billowing into the night sky as a voice can be heard saying, “There has been an attack on Nur Khan base.” The early morning strike on Nur Khan caused mass panic in the densely populated area, with residents running into the streets. “There was a loud explosion which woke everyone up. It was so scary, everyone is still in a panic,” said one resident living nearby. India’s attempted strikes on Rawalpindi and other key military bases – and the launch of Pakistan’s counter-attack on Saturday – marks the steepest escalation in their confrontation yet, bringing the two countries the closest they have been to war in decades. On WednesdayIndia’s missiles struck nine sites in Pakistankilling 31 people. Those strikes in turn were India’s response to an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in whichmilitants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, which they alleged had Pakistan’s involvement. India’s targeting of Pakistani army bases came hours after Indian saidPakistan hadlaunched yet another wave of drone attacks across 26 locations over the state of Punjab and Indian-administered Kashmir on Friday night. Explosions were heard near the airport in Srinagar, the main city in India-administered Kashmir. The Indian army said they had largely intercepted the drones but police said three people in the Ferozepur district of Punjab, which borders Pakistan, had been injured from the drone attacks, one in a critical condition. Earlier in the day, India accused Pakistan of launching an attack using up to 400 drones to target cities, military bases and places of worship across the north of the country on Thursday. India claimed to have intercepted hundreds of Pakistani drones, which it said came across the border into Indian-administered Kashmir, as well as Rajasthan, Punjab and Gujarat. It said a first wave of drones came on Thursday evening and another wave hit close to dawn on Friday. India said it had launched four drone strikes at Pakistan, directly targeting military defence infrastructure. In a press conference on Friday, the Indian military alleged that Pakistan’s drone attacks on Thursday had targeted a gurdwara, a Sikh place of worship, injuring a civilian, and that the drones had also targeted Christian churches. Pakistan’s information minister, Attaullah Tarar, had denied the drone attacks. However, a Pakistan security official said that Thursday night’s drone strikes were just to “heat things up” before Pakistan launched a fully fledged retaliatory attack. Speaking to Geo News after Pakistan began its counter attack, Ishaq Dar, the country’s foreign minister and deputy prime minister, said Pakistan had been left with no choice to retaliate. “There was no other option because India showed no sincerity in response to the diplomatic efforts made by friendly countries,” he said. “We acted only after India continued firing drones and missiles.” The US state department confirmed that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had spoken withPakistan’s army chief Gen Asim Munirearly on Saturday morning. Rubio called for de-escalation and “offered US assistance in starting constructive talks in order to avoid future conflicts”, said a state department spokesperson.",

    "title": "Pakistan accused of launching fresh wave of drone strikes on India",
    "article_text": "Pakistan has been accused of launching a fresh wave of drone strikes against India, with projectiles reported over the states of Indian-administered Kashmir and Punjab. Early on Saturday morning, a spokesperson for the Pakistan army saidIndiahad fired ballistic missiles that fell in Indian territory, making the claim in an unscheduled television broadcast at 1.50am local time. “I want to give you the shocking news that India fired six ballistic missiles from Adampur. One of the ballistic missiles hit in Adampur, the rest of the five missiles hit in Indian Punjab area of Amritsar,” the spokesperson said, offering no further details. Explosions were reported in Amritsar as well as the Pakistani cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Witnesses in IndianKashmirreported projectiles and flashes in Jammu earlier in the night. Ten blasts were heard near the airport in the Srinagar, and explosions were heard in other parts of the region. Witnesses said the drone strikes were heavier than those that took place on Thursday night. Earlier in the day, India accused Pakistan of launching an attack using up to 400 drones to target cities, military bases and places of worship across the north of the country on Thursday night, as the Pakistani military said it would “not de-escalate with India”. India claimed to have intercepted hundreds of Pakistani drones, which it said came across the border into Indian-administered Kashmir, as well as Rajasthan, Punjab and Gujarat. It said a first wave of drones came on Thursday evening and another wave hit close to dawn on Friday. India said it had launched four drone strikes at Pakistan, directly targeting military defence infrastructure. In a press conference on Friday, the Indian military alleged that Pakistan’s drone attacks on Thursday had targeted a gurdwara, a Sikh place of worship, injuring a civilian, and that the drones had also targeted Christian churches. “The targeting of temples, gurdwaras, convents is a new low by Pakistan,” said India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri. Pakistan’s information minister, Attaullah Tarar, denied the drone attacks, calling the Indian army statement “baseless and misleading”, and said Pakistan had not undertaken any “offensive actions” within Indian Kashmir or beyond Pakistan’s border. However, a Pakistan security official said that Thursday night’s drone strikes were just to “heat things up” before Pakistan launched a fully fledged retaliatory attack. “When we hit back, everyone will know,” they said. Misri called Pakistan’s denial of the drone attacks “farcical” and “another example of its duplicity”. The tit-for tat allegations were yet another alarming confrontation between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed countries, sinceIndia’s missile strikes on nine sites in Pakistanon Wednesday killed 31 people. Those strikes in turn were India’s response to an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in whichmilitants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide. Pakistan said it considered the attack an “act of war” and vowed to retaliate. “We will not de-escalate – with the damages India did on our side, they should take a hit,” Pakistan’s military spokesperson, Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said at a media briefing. “So far we have been protecting ourselves but they will get an answer in our own timing.” The Pakistani army gave new details of Wednesday’s strike in which it claimed Pakistan had deployed more than 100 planes to ward off the strikes by Indian planes that carried out the attacks from Indian airspace. It said the two sides had engaged in an hour-long aerial dogfight. Pakistan claimed it used Chinese-made weapons and ground air defences to help bring down five Indian fighter jets. India has yet to respond to allegations that Pakistan shot down its planes, but debris from at least three fighter jets, including that of at least one elite French Rafale jet, was seen in Indian-administered Kashmir and Punjab. The worst-affected area from Thursday’s drone attacks was the city of Jammu, in India-administered Kashmir, which is close to the line of control (LoC), the heavily militarised border dividing the disputed region of Kashmir between India and Pakistan. Despite decades of conflict in the region, people in the city said they had never witnessed such an aerial onslaught. They described a barrage of fiery projectiles streaking across the sky as air raid sirens wailed and the city was plunged into an enforced blackout overnight. Videos shared with the Guardian showed glowing orange dots piercing Jammu’s night sky before flashing and fading – probably drones intercepted by Indian air defence systems. Local officials confirmed debris from the projectiles had been recovered from several areas, including densely populated neighbourhoods in and around Jammu, but no casualties were reported. Ajay Lakhotra, a 24-year-old student in Kanachak, a suburban area close to the Pakistan border, said: “Skirmishes and exchanges of gunfire are nothing new to us, but what happened on Thursday night was extraordinary. We saw fiery objects launching from the Pakistani side; the barrage was so intense it looked like fireworks lighting up the sky. Flames streaked everywhere. It was terrifying to witness.” He said it had quietened down after midnight but restarted at 4am. “Most of us couldn’t sleep all night.” Lethal aggression continued along the LoC as soldiers from both sides continued to fire across the border, killing and injuring civilians. With Pakistan’s threats to retaliate still looming, Indian-administered Kashmir and states across northern India remained on high alert. The mounting aggressions and allegations have resulted in a growing information – and disinformation – war on both sides of the border. India accused Pakistan of a flood of dangerous disinformation and “grossly exaggerated claims” across its media, including reports that dozens of Indian drones had been shot down over Pakistan, calling it a “gross misrepresentation of facts”. “What should have been a moment of international reckoning against terror has instead been manipulated into a disinformation war, where truth is the first casualty,” India’s ministry of information and broadcasting said in a statement. However, mainstream Indian media has also been flooded with misinformation and fake or unsubstantiated reports, including false claims of an attack on Karachi port, reports of a military coup and the arrest of Pakistan’s army chief. Images of Turkish military personnel were broadcast as “captured Pakistani pilots”. Images of powerful bomb strikes on Gaza have been widely shared as showing India’s attack on Pakistan. As part of its alleged crackdown on misinformation, India ordered the social media platform X to block more than 8,000 accounts, including those of Pakistani politicians, celebrities and media organisations, as well as Indian independent news organisations and Indian-Kashmiri journalists. The move was confirmed by X in a statement, which said in many cases the Indian government had not provided legal justification for the blocks. However, X said it had no choice but to comply and remove the 8,000 accounts or it would face “penalties including significant fines and imprisonment of the company’s local employees”.",

    "title": "IPL cricket suspended amid growing India-Pakistan tensions",
    "article_text": "The Indian Premier League has been suspended, initially for a week, because of concerns about the security situation in the countryamid rising tensionsalong its border with Pakistan. The news came hours after the decision was taken to relocate the final fixtures in the Pakistan Super League to United Arab Emirates because of safety concerns. Foreign-based players in India and all teams in Pakistan are expected to leave the countries over the next 24 hours. “Further updates regarding the new schedule and venues of the tournament will be announced in due course after a comprehensive assessment of the situation in consultation with relevant authorities and stakeholders,” Devajit Saikia, the secretary of the Board for Control ofCricketin India (BCCI), said in a statement. “The decision was taken by the IPL governing council after due consultation with all key stakeholders following the representations from most of the franchisees, who conveyed the concern and sentiments of their players, and also the views of the broadcaster, sponsors and fans; while the BCCI reposes full faith in the strength and preparedness of our armed forces, the board considered it prudent to act in the collective interest of all stakeholders.” Transport withinIndiahas been complicated by the closure of 27 airports over security concerns, including in the host city of Dharamsala. Thursday’s game there between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals was abandoned after 10.1 overs, with the players and staff of the two teams rushed out of the ground. They mingled on each other’s coaches, with some still wearing their pads, before returning to Delhi by chartered train on Friday morning. Thursday’s abandonment came with Mumbai Indians, who had been due to face Punjab Kings in Dharamsala on Sunday, already on their way and precipitated rapid negotiations in which the possibility of holding the fixture in Mumbai was discussed and rejected before the teams settled on the neutral venue of Ahmedabad. MI’s players duly travelled to Gujarat, where they learned of the league’s suspension, and their foreign-based players will now return to Mumbai to collect their belongings before returning home. Dharamsala is about 80km from Pathankot, site of one of the three Indian military bases targeted by what officials described as “missiles and drones” on Thursday, leading to the decision to abandon the game. “It does not look nice that cricket goes on while the country is at war,” a BCCI official told the news agency PTI. With 58 games played and 12 group-stage fixtures remaining, plus four playoff ties, the BCCI must now decide if and how to complete the competition. The option of relocating to the UAE – where the tournament was shifted when it was forced to shut down by the Covid outbreak of 2020 – is off the table because it is already set to host the PSL, but a move to South Africa is feasible, aided by the fact that all six teams in that country’s own franchise tournament, the SA20, are controlled by owners ofIPLsides. The IPL was also moved to South Africa in 2009 when it coincided with Indian elections. The last time the IPL was shut down, when Covid flared up again in 2021, it resumed and concluded in the UAE that September, and a resumption later this year, after the conclusion of India’s Test series in England, is possible. India are due to play six white-ball matches in Bangladesh in August followed by the eight-team Asia Cup in September, which they are due to host. Both are considered likely to be cancelled, opening a possible window for the IPL to resume in the middle of the English summer, clashing with the Hundred and the knockout stages of the T20 Blast. Meanwhile Thursday’s PSL match between Peshawar Zalmi and Karachi Kings was postponed amid claims that an Indian drone missile had damaged the area around the stadium in Rawalpindi where it was to be played, an attack which was described by Mohsin Naqvi, chair of thePakistanCricket Board (PCB), as “extremely irresponsible” and “reckless”. Sign up toThe Spin Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action after newsletter promotion “The PCB has always stood by the position that politics and sports need to be kept apart,”Naqvi said in a statement. “However, in view of the extremely irresponsible and dangerous Indian act of targeting the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, which was manifestly done to disrupt the ongoing Pakistan Super League, the PCB has decided to shift the remaining matches to UAE so that the domestic as well as foreign cricketers, who are our precious guests, can be saved from the possible reckless targeting by India. “As a responsible organisation that has overcome adversities repeatedly and ensured that the game of cricket flourishes, it was important for us to ensure the mental well-being of all players participating in the PSL. I regret that our domestic audience and cricket lovers will not be able to watch these matches in Pakistan’s stadiums.” Ten English players are currently involved in the IPL: Moeen Ali, Jofra Archer, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler, Sam Curran, Will Jacks, Liam Livingstone, Jamie Overton, Phil Salt and Reece Topley. Seven are playing in the PSL: Sam Billings, Tom Curran, Chris Jordan, Tom Kohler-Cadmore, James Vince, David Willey and Luke Wood.",

    "title": "Paul McCartney and Dua Lipa among artists urging Starmer to rethink AI copyright plans",
    "article_text": "Hundreds of leading figures and organisations in the UK’s creative industries, including Coldplay,Paul McCartney, Dua Lipa, Ian McKellen and the Royal Shakespeare Company, have urged the prime minister to protect artists’ copyright and not “give our work away” at the behest of big tech. In an open letter toKeir Starmer, a host of major artists claim creatives’ livelihoods are under threat as wrangling continues over a government plan to let artificial intelligence companies use copyright-protected work without permission. Describing copyright as the “lifeblood” of their professions, the letter warns Starmer that the proposed legal change will threaten Britain’s status as a leading creative power. “We will lose an immense growth opportunity if we give our work away at the behest of a handful of powerful overseas tech companies and with it our future income, the UK’s position as a creative powerhouse, and any hope that the technology of daily life will embody the values and laws of the United Kingdom,” the letter says. The letter urges the government to accept an amendment to the data billproposed by Beeban Kidron, the cross-bench peer and leading campaigner against the copyright proposals. Kidron, who organised the artists’ letter, is seeking a change that requires AI firms tell copyright owners which individual works they have ingested into their models. Urging parliamentarians on all sides of the political spectrum and in both houses to support the change, the letter says: “We urge you to vote in support of the UK creative industries. Supporting us supports the creators of the future. Our work is not yours to give away.” Spanning the worlds of music, theatre, film, literature, art and media, the more than 400 signatories includeElton John, Kazuo Ishiguro, Annie Lennox, Rachel Whiteread, Jeanette Winterson, the National Theatre and the News Media Association, which represents more than 800 news titles including the Guardian. Kidron’s amendment will go to a House of Lords vote on Monday, although the government has already signalled its opposition to the change, saying that a consultation process already under way was the correct process for debating alterations to copyright law, which protects someone’s work from being used by others without permission. Under the government proposal, AI companies will be able to use copyright-protected material without permission unless the copyright holder “opts out” of the process by indicating – in an as yet unspecified way – that they do not wish their work to be used for free. Giles Martin, the music producer and son of the Beatles producer George Martin, told the Guardian the opt-out plan could be impractical for young artists. “When Paul McCartney wrote Yesterday his first thought was ‘how do I record this’ and not ‘how do I stop someone stealing this’,” said Martin, who was the music supervisor on the documentary series The Beatles: Get Back and co-produced the “last” Beatles song Now and Then. Kidron said the letter’s signatories were speaking out “to ensure a positive future for the next generation of creators and innovators”. Supporters of the Kidron amendment claim the change will ensure creatives are compensated for the use of their work in training AI models via licensing deals. Generative AI models, the term for technology that underpins powerful tools such as the ChatGPT chatbot or the Suno music-making tool, have to be trained on a vast amount of data in order to generate their responses. The main source of this information is online, including the contents of Wikipedia, YouTube, newspaper articles andonline book archives. The government has submitted one amendment to the data bill that commits to officials carrying out an economic impact assessment of its proposals. A source close to Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, hastold the Guardianthatan opt-out systemwas no longer his preferred option. Officially, there are four options under consideration. The other three alongside the “opt-out” scenario are: to leave the situation unchanged; require AI companies to seek licences for using copyrighted work; and allow AI firms to use copyrighted work with no opt-out for creative companies and individuals. A government spokesperson said: “Uncertainty over how our copyright framework operates is holding back growth for our AI and creative industries. That cannot continue, but we’re clear that no changes will be considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators.”",

    "article_text": "The head of theRoyal Navyhas been suspended pending an investigation. Adm Sir Ben Key has been asked to “step back” as first sea lord, sources at the MoD confirmed on Friday. Key was absent from the lineup of senior military personnel on the Mall on Monday for celebrations to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day, and it is understood that second sea lord V Adm Martin Connell has taken full charge until a permanent replacement is announced. Earlier this week the MoD said Key had departed for “private reasons”. Key joined the Royal Navy in 1984 as a university cadet, and graduated from Royal Holloway, University of London. As a junior officer he saw service around the world, after qualifying as helicopter aircrew and a principal warfare officer. He was made vice admiral in February 2016, before becoming the Royal Navy’s fleet commander and later chief of joint operations until he was appointed first sea lord in 2021. Over his career, he has commanded four ships: the mine hunter HMS Sandown, the frigates HMS Iron Duke and HMS Lancaster, and the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious. An Iraq war veteran, prior to taking over the Navy Key was also awarded a US bronze star and oversaw the retreat from Afghanistan. In his current role, he is also chief of the naval staff and chair of the navy board, where he is responsible to the secretary of state for the fighting “effectiveness, efficiency and morale” of the service. Key last year issuedan unreserved apology for “intolerable” misogyny in the Submarine Service, after a series of investigations across the navy exposed sexual harassment, bullying and assault of women within its ranks. The navy chief said he was “truly sorry” to the women who had suffered “misogyny, bullying and other unacceptable behaviours” while serving their country. “We must be better than this and do better than we have,” he said. The MoD said on Friday: “An investigation is ongoing and it would be inappropriate to comment at this time.”",

    "title": "Giving weight loss jabs could bolster UK economy by £4.5bn a year, study says",
    "article_text": "Giving weight loss jabs to everyone eligible for them could boost the UK economy by £4.5bn, according to research. Worldwide, about 3.8 billion people over 25 and just under 750 million children and young peopleare forecastto be overweight or obese by 2050. In England, 26.5% of adultsare obese, while across the UK 4.6 millionare diagnosedwith type 2 diabetes. Obesity and type 2 diabetes areestimatedto cost the UK £100bn a year. While semaglutide, better known as Wegovy and Ozempic, has been linked to areduced risk of 42 conditions, the impact on quality of life and productivity has until now been less understood. A new study, presented at the European Congress onObesityin Málaga, Spain, examined data from 2,660 participants in three semaglutide clinical trials in the UK who were living with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes. They found that taking semaglutide enabled them to each work five extra days and carry out 12 days of unpaid work such as volunteering or childcare, as well as reducing their consumption. The authors valued these productivity gains – the annual “net production value” – at an average of £1,127 per person. That equates to £4.31bn in potential annual net productivity gains for everyone living with severe obesity and £200m for those with type 2 diabetes, who would be eligible for semaglutide on the NHS – about 4 million people.National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelinesrecommend semaglutide for patients with a BMI of at least 35 and one weight-related condition. Robert King, a senior health economist at the consultancy Lane Clark & Peacock and co-author of the research, said the study showed there was a wider societal impact of weight loss jabs that needed to be taken into account. “Even if you are getting a relatively small [productivity] gain per person, it really does stack up to large impact at the population level. So treating these chronic diseases at scale, prioritising them for treatment is really important.” Naveed Sattar, a professor of cardiometabolic medicine and honorary consultant at the University of Glasgow, said that while the potential cost benefits for society from weight loss medication extended well beyond medical outcomes, the relative high cost of the drugs “means that the total costs for the medicines is still considerably greater than the likely total health and societal gains. “This means for now, countries cannot afford to treat all those who stand to benefit, but rather must restrict use to those with highest needs and where costs are most likely to be recovered from health gains.” Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said:“These drugs could have colossal clout in our fight to tackle obesity and in turn get unemployed Britons back to work, and we will carefully consider the results of this important research.” Weight loss jabs also show potential for treating addiction. A separate study presented at the Málaga congress found that patients taking liraglutide or semaglutide for weight loss “effortlessly” cut their alcohol consumption by almost two-thirds in four months. Researchers in Ireland and Saudi Arabia collected data on the alcohol intake of 262 overweight adults who were prescribed the medication, of whom 188 were followed up for an average of four months. They were categorised as non-drinkers, those consuming less than 10 units a week, and regular drinkers, who consumed more than 10 units. The study found that patients’ typical alcohol intake decreased from 11.3 to 4.3 units a week. For regular drinkers, the effect was even larger, from 23.2 to 7.8 units. Prof Carel le Roux, of University College Dublin and the lead author of the study, said: “The exact mechanism of how GLP-1 analogues reduce alcohol intake is still being investigated but it is thought to involve curbing cravings for alcohol that arise in subcortical areas of the brain that are not under conscious control. Thus, patients report the effects are ‘effortless’.” The effect was slightly greater than that in patients prescribed nalmefene to treat alcohol use disorder in Europe. Dr Stephen Burgess, the group leader at the University of Cambridge’s Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit, said that while the study was observational, the findings were “exciting”. He added: “These drugs are generally safe and well-tolerated, and currently there are few effective treatments for alcohol addiction, so this is an exciting possibility for reducing harm in heavy drinkers.” Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “There is clearly a lot of potential for weight loss drugs – which are still very new medications – to have wide-ranging benefits for patients, so it’s good to see research being undertaken to explore these. “However, it’s also important that medical interventions aren’t seen as a silver bullet for either weight loss or to suppress cravings for alcohol. As with any medication, they do not come without risk and can cause side-effects which range in seriousness.”",

    "title": "Plan to fast-track appeals of some UK asylum seekers could face legal backlash",
    "article_text": "A plan to fast-track the appeals of asylum seekers living in government-funded hotels could face multiple legal challenges on the grounds of discrimination, the government has said. A 24-week legal deadline on appeal decisions for those staying in hotel rooms is being introduced in an attempt to fulfil aLabourmanifesto promise to end a practice that costs the taxpayer billions of pounds a year. More than 38,000 asylum seekers are housed in 222 hotels and a further 66,000 people are in “dispersal accommodation”, such as large houses, bedsits and flats. The government has said it wants to stop using hotels by 2029 through a series of policies, including a quicker appeal process for those living in such accommodation whose initial asylum application has been rejected. But officials have conceded in a legal memorandum to the border security, asylum and immigration bill that the new deadline could be challenged under the European convention on human rights (ECHR) by both those staying in hotels and those living without government support. Officials have warned thatarticle 14 of the ECHRprohibits discrimination and that there is a risk that those in hotels will “not have sufficient time to prepare and present their case in a manner that is fair and in the interests of justice (due to delays in obtaining legal representation or expert evidence)”. It is further argued that the “remaining non-prioritised cohort” who are appealing against an asylum decision could be “unjustifiably delayed” by the policy. The memorandum concludes that “in respect of both scenarios, there is a risk of article 14 discrimination”. In its legal note, the government is said to remain confident that the law is compatible with the ECHR as the tribunal hearing the appeals will have the flexibility to not meet the deadline where “it is not reasonably practicable to do so”. “Accordingly, the government is satisfied that the clause is compatible with article 14 of the ECHR,” it says. The acknowledgment of the potential for the policy to be challenged will raise concerns over its credibility. Concerns around immigration were widely seen as a driving force behind the success of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party in the recent local elections. The government plans to publish an immigration white paper next week that is expected to include measures such as the requirement that those applying for a UK work visa will have to demonstrate they can speak English to A-level standard. It is also expected to include plans to restrict asylum seekers’ ability to stay in the UK due to family connections. But the use of hotels to house asylum seekers remains a concern for many voters. Those staying within themhave also become targetsfor the far right, including during last summer’s riots. This week the National Audit Office reported that the cost of the 10-year contract signed in 2019 with the three private providers responsible for housing asylum seekers would be an estimated £15.3bn. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Three-quarters of the money spent on asylum accommodation goes on hotels although they only account for about a third of those being housed. The estimated cost of shared housing for each person a night is £14.41, while the equivalent cost for a night of hotel accommodation for one person is £145. The government has said it will increase court maintenance and building funding from £120m last year to £148.5m this year. It is claimed this will boost the number of days the immigration and asylum tribunal will be sitting to near maximum capacity, helping to speed up asylum claims. A government spokesperson said: “We inherited an asylum system under exceptional pressure and have taken immediate action to restore order: increasing asylum decision-making by 52% and returning more than 24,000 people with no right to be here, the highest rate of returns in eight years. “It is right that we set out in law the need to speed up appeals from those in asylum accommodation to keep people moving through the system, help hotel exits and in turn reduce the burden on taxpayers. “To support this work, we are providing new funding for both immigration and asylum tribunals, so they have extra resources to sit at near capacity.”",

    "title": "US-UK trade deal imposes conditions on ownership of British steel plants",
    "article_text": "The US deal on steel tariffs imposes conditions on the “nature of ownership” of British plants as part of its efforts to freeze out Chinese steel, it has emerged. It is understood Donald Trump’s administration pushed for requirements to be attached to the steel deal to ensure that the Chinese-ownedBritish Steelplant in Scunthorpe was not used by Beijing as a backdoor to circumvent US tariffs. Government sources say Washington is understood to be reassured that Scunthorpe is now in effect controlled by Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, and is likely not to come back under the direction of Jingye Group, its Chinese owners. However, before the UK government took steps to seize control of British Steel last month the US had been concerned that the Scunthorpe plant could have been used as a base for processing Chinese steel to take advantage of lower tariffs. TheUS-UK deal, agreed on Thursday, has come as a relief to the car and steel industries, which had been worried about job losses, although some of the terms are still unclear. It is set to bring car tariffs down to 10% and steel tariffs to zero if conditions are met. Peter Mandelson, Britain’s ambassador to the US,said the deal had immediately prevented job losses at Jaguar Land Rover’s plant in the West Midlands. “This deal has saved those jobs,” Mandelson said in an interview on CNN. “That’s a pretty big achievement, in my view, and I’m very pleased that the president has signed it.” Government sources said JLR had planned for imminent cuts among its 30,000 staff in the UK but had not informed unions in the hope that a deal with the US could be struck to eliminate the 25% tariffs on exports of cars to the US. Keir Starmer told ITV on Friday that the deal would be “measured in thousands and thousands of jobs that will be protected, saved and will thrive as a result” in steel, cars and in pharmaceuticals. Government sources said the UK was still working with the US to define the exact requirements for the quota of steel allowed to be exported tariff-free, looking at the security of the supply chain and on ownership, so that the deal could be introduced as soon as possible. The text of the agreement makes clear that US steel tariffs of 25% will be lowered only if certain US requirements are met on the “security of supply chains” and the “nature of ownership of the relevant production facilities”. It says: “Understanding the United Kingdom will meet these requirements, the United States will promptly construct a quota at most favored nation (MFN) rates for UK steel and aluminum and certain derivative steel and aluminum products.” Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, boasted on Thursday: “The British government as part of this deal nationalised British Steel.” UK sources said the US had not pushed Britain towards nationalising British Steel but had been impressed with the action taken against its Chinese owners before Easter. Chrysa Glystra, the director of trade and economic policy at UK Steel, the industry body said: “The terms of the deal highlight a number of hoops to jump through before the UK steel sector can see the benefits of this deal.” The UK exports about 200,000 metric tons of steel per year to the US, which is worth about £400m. Glystra said it was still not clear what the terms and conditions of the tariff exemption were or when it would kick in, underlining the admission by government sources that they settled on a quick deal to “bank progress” and save jobs in the car industry. “To fully assess the impact on our sector, we will need to fully understand the supply chain conditions that need to be met, how the quotas will be defined and when these will take effect,” Glystra added. Trump, who has now turned his attention to the first trade talks between the US and China in Geneva on Saturday, said the “final details [of the UK deal] are being written up in the coming weeks”. There had been reports that the deal in effect handed the US a veto on Chinese investment in UK sectors covered by the deal but No 10 said this was not the case.",

    "title": "Rümeysa Öztürk, Tufts student held by Ice, released from Louisiana jail",
    "article_text": "Rümeysa Öztürk, the Tufts University student arrested in March for her political speech, has been released from theLouisianadetention center where she was being held in what she and her lawyers had argued was a breach of her constitutional rights. A federal judge on Friday morninghad orderedÖztürk’s return to Vermont, where she was briefly held afterbeing grabbedon the street by masked immigration agents near Boston, for hearings. But the judge decided not to wait for her physical transportation and she appeared remotely from Louisiana at the hearing in Burlington on Friday. The ruling to release her came at the end of a hearing where the judge, William Sessions, said that the process by which she was placed in immigration detention “raises very significant due process concerns”. Öztürk could be seen hugging one of her attorneys after the judge ordered her release from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s custody. She was released hours later, her legal team said. The judge will take up arguments in her underlying lawsuit at a later hearing. “We are so relieved that Rümeysa will soon be back in Massachusetts, and won’t stop fighting until she is free for good,” Jessie Rossman, a lawyer for Öztürk at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said in a statement. On 25 March, Öztürk, 30, a Turkish national and PhD student studying child development, had been bundled into an unmarked car by agents to be taken away without due process and is battling a deportation order issued by theTrump administrationafter she co-authored an opinion article in a student newspaper that was critical of Israel. Sessions said her continued detention “potentially chills the speech of the millions and millions of individuals in this country who are not citizens. Any one of them may now avoid exercising their first amendment rights for fear of being whisked away to a detention center from their home. For all of those reasons, the court finds that her continued detention cannot stand, that bail is necessary to make the habeas [petition] … effective.” He added: “This is a woman who’s just totally committed to her academic career …there is absolutely no evidence that that she has engaged in violence or advocated violence. She has no criminal record … therefore, the court finds that she does not pose a danger to the community.” He ordered the Trump administration to release Öztürk from custody “immediately” pending further proceedings, and said she was free to “return to her home in Massachusetts”. The administration had been attempting to deport Öztürk under ararely usedimmigration statute giving the secretary of state the authority to remove immigrants deemed harmful to US foreign policy. The judge said there was no evidence from the government against Öztürk other than its view of her opinion article and therefore he supported her argument that “the reason that she has been detained is simply and purely the expression that she made … in violation of her first amendment rights.” She appeared on video at the hearing on Friday dressed in a bright orange prison jumpsuit reminiscent of uniforms for terrorism suspects held atGuantánamo Bay. According to court filings, Öztürk had suffered multiple asthma attacks in detention that she has struggled to get treated for, and had her hijab forcibly removed. Following Öztürk’s initial testimony, her doctor, Jessica McCannon, testified about her diagnosis of Öztürk’s asthma. At one point, Öztürk had an asthma attack during McCannon’s testimony, which her lawyers had to interrupt. The judge then excused Öztürk and allowed her to temporarily step out of the room to use the bathroom. Sara Johnson, director of graduate studies at Tufts University’s department of child study and human development, who is also Öztürk’s program adviser, also testified. “Rümeysa is a critical part of our lab … My four PhD students, including Rümeysa, run a peer-review group of all of their work, and they are missing out on her very constructive yet extremely rigorous comments,” she said. She added: “Rümeysa is also a mentor to many more junior students in our department and so they are missing those opportunities to learn from her.” Öztürk’s legal team – which includes the ACLU and Clear (Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility), a legal clinic affiliated with the City University of New York – filed a challenge to her detention, in federal court inVermont. “I am relieved and ecstatic that Rümeysa has been ordered released. Unfortunately, it is 45 days too late. She has been imprisoned all these days for simply writing an op-ed that called for human rights and dignity for the people in Palestine. When did speaking up against oppression become a crime?” said Mahsa Khanbabai of Khanbabai Immigration Law. Öztürk is one ofseveral international studentsdetained by the Trump administration over their pro-Palestinian advocacy on campus. “The government has spared no effort to evade accountability and deny her due process. Today, the court delivered reprieve and justice,” said Mudassar Toppa, a staff attorney at Clear. Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reporting",

    "title": "Judge sets Menendez brothers resentencing hearing for next week",
    "article_text": "After months of legal battles, Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of killing their parents in 1989, will finally get a resentencing hearing inLos Angelescourt next week, giving the brothers a new chance at freedom. LA county superior court judge Michael Jesic ruled on Friday that the resentencing hearing can take place, starting next Tuesday. Friday’s hearing included a loss and an implicit win for Los Angeles’ new tough-on-crime prosecutor,Nathan Hochman. Defense attorneys ultimately withdrew their motion to remove Hochman’s prosecutors from the case, which the hearing was meant to discuss, but Jesic, the judge, also rejected Hochman’s efforts to withdraw the resentencing petition. The brothers were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison without the possibility of parole for fatally shooting their entertainment executive father, José Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez. The brothers were 18 and 21 at the time of the killings. Defense attorneys argued the brothers acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father, while prosecutors said the brothers killed their parents for a multimillion-dollar inheritance. The former LA county district attorney,George Gascón, had opened the door to possible freedom for the brothers in October byrequesting their sentences be reduced to 50 yearswith the possibility of parole. His office said the case would have been handled differently today due to modern understandings of sexual abuse and trauma, and that the brothers had been rehabilitated during their 30 years in prison. Many of the Menendez brothers’ family members support their release. ButHochman, the current district attorney, has reversed course and opposes the brothers’ resentencing. Hochman has said the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes because they have not admitted to lies told during their trials. The Menendez family and lawyers have been heavily critical of the way Hochman has handled the case. On Friday, Hochman tried to again ask the court to withdraw the resentencing petition saying new evidence supports that. But Jesic disagreed and set 13 and 14 May for the resentencing hearings. “I don’t see anything new,” he said. On Friday, attorneys for the Menendez brothers also withdrew their attempt to have Hochman’s office removed from the case over allegations of conflicts of interest, ABC7 News and theLos AngelesTimes reported. Asked about the attempt to remove Hochman, an attorney for the Menendez brotherssaid on his way into the courthouseon Friday that “I’m not so sure I want that any more,” ABC7 News reported. Attorney Mark Geragos said he planned to lodge his complaints against Hochman at a future date. California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, had filed a motion this week siding with Hochman, saying the defense had not adequately demonstrated a conflict of interest. Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said these types of recusal requests are “almost never” granted. “Defendants don’t usually get to pick their prosecutors,” she said. “Occasionally an individual prosecutor will be recused, but to recuse an entire office is very rare.” Generally, this only happens if a prosecutor’s personal family member is involved or if the district attorney’s office received outside payment in a case, Levenson said. Hochman’s office had filed a motion to oppose his removal from the case, dismissing the defense’s concerns as simply “not being happy” with prosecutors’ opinion on resentencing. “Disagreeing with the opposing side’s position is not a conflict of interest, it is simply a disagreement,” it said. The Menendez brothers are still waiting for the full results of a state parole board risk assessment ordered by the California governor’s office. The final hearing, scheduled for 13 June, will influence whether Newsom grants the brothers clemency.",

    "article_text": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first at-home test for cervical cancer screening, its maker TealHealthsaid on Friday, offering an alternative to smear tests that need to be undertaken at a doctor’s office. Pap smear tests have significantly reduced cancer incidence from when they were first introduced 80 years ago. But they can be uncomfortable and inconvenient owing to the requirement for an in-clinic exam. Teal Health said the FDA’s decision was based on a study in more than 600 women that showed self-collected samples using its test had the same performance as clinician-collected samples. The approval is “not just about an innovative new product, it’s about finally giving women an option that makes sense for their lives, something that can be done quickly and comfortably at home”, said Teal’s co-founder and chief executive, Kara Egan. Each year in the US, about 11,500 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed and about 4,000 women die of the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The startup company’s test, Teal Wand, detects human papillomavirus (HPV), which is responsible for nearly all cervical cancers, similar to Roche’s cobas HPV test. But Teal Wand allows women to collect samples from home and send it to a certified lab for testing, while Roche’s test is approved for use in the clinic. Teal Health did not disclose the test’s price, but said it was working with major insurance providers for coverage and flexible payment options. Egan pointed to another at-home test called Cologuard, made by Exact Sciences, to detect colon cancer. “Cologuard [is] fully covered by most insurance, but also, if you have to pay out pocket, it’s around $600. We plan to be less than that,” she told Reuters. Teal Health plans to begin rolling out the kits in June for patients aged 25 to 65.",

    "title": "Ex-model testifies in Harvey Weinstein retrial about alleged sexual assault",
    "article_text": "A former model has told aNew Yorkcourt that the disgraced movie mogulHarvey Weinsteinsexually assaulted her when she was 16, calling it the most “horrifying thing I ever experienced”. Kaja Sokola told jurors at Weinstein’s retrial that he put his hand inside her underwear and made her touch his genitals at his Manhattan apartment in 2002 when she was 16. Sokola testified that Weinstein had told her that actors had to be comfortable disrobing in the film business and directed her to undress, “so I should get used to it”. She testified that she took off her blouse and followed him into a bathroom because, she said, “I was 16 years old, and I was alone with a man for the first time, and I didn’t know what else to do. “I was scared. I was scared of him,” she said. “I’d never been in an intimate situation with another person like that.” Sokola described Weinstein’s eyes as appearing “black and scary” during the alleged assault and that he had afterwards told her to keep quiet, boasting he had made Hollywood careers and could help her acting dreams come true. Sokola, the second accuser to testify at the trial in Manhattan, said from the stand that four years later – in 2006 – the defendant lured her into a hotel room and forcibly performed oral sex on her. The Polish model said Weinstein invited her to see some movie scripts but instead pushed her on to a bed. “I kept saying: ‘Please don’t, please stop, I don’t want this,’” she told jurors. “But he didn’t listen.” Sokola testified that Weinstein, 73, pinned her to the bed with his body and removed her shoes, underwear and stockings. He then allegedly forced his mouth on to her vagina while he masturbated. “My soul was removed from me,” Sokola said. “It felt like I was dead.” At the end of the approximately 15-minute encounter, Weinstein allegedly said: “You see, that wasn’t so difficult.” Sokola’s 2006 alleged encounter forms a new accusation in Weinstein’s criminal retrial and the only alleged crime not included in his original trial in 2020 that was later thrown out by an appeals court on grounds that prosecutors had used “Molineux” witnesses, or testimony not related to the crimes as charged.. Weinstein’s lawyers sought to raise doubts about Sokola’s sexual assault allegations against him, noting that she did not mention a key claim for years, even in her own lawsuits. Sokola sued Weinstein several years ago over another allegation that was beyond the legal timeframe for potential criminal charges. Her lawsuits did not include anything about the alleged 2006 assault. Weinstein lawyer Mike Cibella pointed this out as he began questioning Sokola, suggesting she was financially motivated to make her latest allegations.Sokola, who’s embroiled in divorce proceedings, received about $3.5m in compensation from her lawsuits and from the Weinstein Co’s bankruptcy. Sokola said she had sued to gain financial independence from her estranged husband. “I was working at two jobs, and I was earning more money than he was,” she testified. Sign up toFirst Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Jurors have alreadyheard fromformer Project Runway production assistant Miriam Haley, 48, who testified that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in July 2006. Another accuser, Jessica Mann, is also set to take the stand in support of accusations that Weinstein raped her in 2013. The defendant is charged with one count of engaging in a criminal sex act in connection with Haley’s allegations and one count of third-degree rape in Mann’s case. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges and denies sexually assaulting anyone. Weinstein is already serving a 16-year sentence for a 2022 sexual-assault conviction in California. But that conviction, too, is being appealed on the same grounds that saw the firstNew Yorkcase overturned. He is being transported to the court daily from Bellevue hospital after his defense teamfiled an emergency petitionlast month seeking to transfer him from Rikers Island because he was suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia, diabetes mellitus and “extensive” coronary artery disease. Weinstein’s defence team has so far called for a mistrial on three separate occasions, each denied by the presiding judge, Curtis Farber. The defendant is not charged with first-degree rape and predatory sexual assault – claims that failed in 2020 – because of double-jeopardy protections. The case continues.

    "title": "Newark Mayor Ras Baraka arrested during ICE detention centre protest",
    "article_text": "Rights groups and Democratic officials have decried the arrest of the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, during a protest at an immigration detention centre. Mayor Ras Baraka had joined several lawmakers at the detention centre, called Delaney Hall, for a demonstration on Friday. For weeks, he has been among those protesting the recently opened 1,000-bed centre, which critics see as a key link in President Donald Trump’smass deportationefforts. Those in attendance said Baraka sought to enter the facility along with members of the United States Congress on Friday, but he was denied entry. A video reviewed by The Associated Press showed a federal official in a jacket with the logo for the Homeland Security Investigations unit telling Baraka he could not tour the facility because “you are not a congress member”. Baraka then left the secure area, rejoining protesters on the public side of the centre’s gate. Video showed him speaking through the gate to a man in a suit. The man said, “They’re talking about coming back to arrest you.” “I’m not on their property. They can’t come out on the street and arrest me,” Baraka replied. Moments later, several Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, some wearing face coverings, surrounded the mayor and others on the public side of the gate. Baraka was dragged back through the security gate in handcuffs, while protesters yelled, “Shame!” In a subsequent post on the social media platform X, Alina Habba, Trump’s former personal lawyer and acting US attorney for New Jersey, said Baraka had “committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings” to leave. “He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state,” Habbawrote. “He has been taken into custody. NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.” US Representative LaMonica McIver was also at the centre on Friday, along with Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman and Robert Menendez Jr, to conduct what they called an “oversight inspection”. In a post on X, McIver said Baraka “did nothing wrong” and had already left the facility at the time of his arrest. “This is unacceptable,” McIver said in the video. For its part, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security accused the lawmakers of “storming” the facility in a “bizarre political stunt”. Baraka has said the detention centre — located in Newark, not far from New York City — opened despite not having the proper local permits and approvals. He has launched a lawsuit to halt its operations. The GEO group, which runs the centre in coordination with ICE, has denied his claims. It entered into an agreement with the federal government in February to run the Delaney Hall facility, under a 15-year contract valued at $1bn. Local elected officials swiftly condemned the federal agents’ actions, with the state’s governor, Phil Murphy, writing on X that he was “outraged by the unjust arrest” of Baraka. Murphy called the mayor an “exemplary public servant who has always stood up for our most vulnerable mayors” and appealed for his release. The governor noted that New Jersey had previously passed a law banning private immigration detention centres in the state, a Democratic stronghold, although it was partially struck down by a federal court in 2023. An appeal is ongoing. Baraka, who is running in next month’s Democratic primary for governor, has been anoutspoken criticof the Trump administration’s immigration policies. He struck a defiant tone against the Trump administration in January, after ICE raided businesses in the city he leads. “Newark will not stand by idly while people are being unlawfully terrorised,” he said at the time.",

    "title": "World could be witnessing ‘another Nakba’ in Palestine, UN committee warns",
    "article_text": "The world could be witnessing “another Nakba”, or the expulsion of Palestinians, a United Nations special committee has warned. The committeesoundedthe alarm on Friday, accusing Israel of “ethnic cleansing” and saying it was inflicting “unimaginable suffering” on Palestinians. The comments come after Israelannounced a planearlier this week to expel hundreds of thousands of hungry Palestinians from the north of Gaza and confine them in six encampments. For Palestinians, any forced displacement evokes memories of the “Nakba“, or catastrophe – the mass displacement that accompanied Israel’s creation in 1948. “Israel continues to inflict unimaginable suffering on the people living under its occupation, whilst rapidly expanding confiscation of land as part of its wider colonial aspirations,” said the UN committee tasked with probing Israeli practices affecting Palestinian rights. “What we are witnessing could very well be another Nakba,” the committee added, after concluding an annual mission to Amman. “The goal of wider colonial expansion is clearly the priority of the government of Israel,” its report stated. “Security operations are used as a smokescreen for rapid land grabbing, mass displacement, dispossession, demolitions, forced evictions and ethnic cleansing, in order to replace the Palestinian communities with Jewish settlers.” The committee also noted Israel’s human rights violations against Palestinians. “According to testimonies, it is evident that the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including sexual violence, is a systematic practice of the Israeli army and security forces, and is widespread in Israeli prisons and military detention camps,” it said. “The methods read as a playbook of how to try to humiliate, derogate, and strike fear into the hearts of individuals.” The committee’s mission took place as Israel’s weeks-long totalblockade of aidto Gaza continues. “It is hard to imagine a world in which a government would implement such depraved policies to starve a population to death, whilst trucks of food are sitting only a few kilometres away,” the committee said. “Yet, this is the sick reality for those in Gaza.” The UN Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories was established by the UN General Assembly in December 1968. During the formation of Israel in 1948, approximately 760,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became known as “the Nakba”. The descendants of some 160,000 Palestinians who managed to remain in what became Israel presently make up about 20 percent of its population. The committee is currently composed of the Sri Lankan, Malaysian and Senegalese ambassadors to the UN in New York.",

    "title": "US reports second air traffic control outage at New Jersey airport",
    "article_text": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States has reported a second radar outage for the airport in Newark, New Jersey, in less than two weeks. The incident raises continuing questions about the state of air traffic control in the US, increasing the pressure on the administration of President Donald Trump to address aviation safety. On Friday, the FAA reported that, around 3:55am local time (07:55 GMT), a facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, lost its telecommunications signal for about 90 seconds, preventing it from monitoring communications and radar signals for the Newark Liberty International Airport. A recording reviewed by the news agency Reuters captured some of the frustration amid the outage. “FedEx 1989, I’m going to hand you off here. Our scopes just went black again,” a controller told the pilot for a shipping flight. “If you care about this, contact your airline and try to get some pressure for them to fix this stuff.” This was the second time a 90-second outage was reported for Newark, a major air terminal that serves metropolitan areas like New York City. On April 28, a similar incident occurred, resulting in hundreds of delays and dozens of diverted flights. Five air-traffic controllers also went on leave after the incident, using a federal law that allows them to take time off after traumatic incidents. In the wake of Friday’s incident, The Associated Press reported that delays and cancellations at Newark were also up, citing statistics from the website FlightAware.com. The White House briefly addressed the second outage at its daily news briefing with journalists, pledging upgrades in the coming months. “There was a glitch in the system this morning, especially at Newark airport,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. “That glitch was caused by the same telecoms and software issues that were raised last week. Everything went back online after the brief outage, and there was no operational impact.” Leavitt added that the FAA and the Department of Transportation would “address this technical issue tonight to prevent further outages”. While every second matters in aviation, industry insiders say air traffic controllers and pilots have training to handle outages, to minimise the dangers. “The system is wired to run really well when everything’s functioning. But the most important part is that it’s prepared to function when things go wrong,” Captain Dennis Tajer of the Allied Pilots Association told The Associated Press. “Even when it sounds frightening, know that the air traffic controllers and the pilots have training, and we go to that.” The latest outage, however, has heightened scrutiny on the Trump administration, which has seen several high-profile aviation mishaps since taking office in January. On January 29, nine days into Trump’s second term, amid-air collisiontook placeover the Potomac Rivernear Washington, DC, killing everyone on board both aircraft: an American Airlines passenger jet and a military Black Hawk helicopter. Trump initially suggested that diversity initiatives under his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, were to blame for the crash, though he offered no evidence to substantiate that claim. Later, in February, his administration faced criticism for cutting hundreds of FAA personnel, as part of its crackdown on alleged waste in the federal government. Critics, however, warned that air traffic control and related jobs were understaffed, raising the likelihood of mistakes and malfunctions. Some of the affected positions included airline safety inspectors and maintenance mechanics. US Congress member Josh Gottheimer, who represents a district in New Jersey, released a statement earlier this week calling for an increase in staffing at the FAA, framing the issue as a question of aviation safety. “I am demanding that the Trump Administration add more air traffic controllers to cover Newark Airport to immediately help reduce shortages — and pay all the workers accordingly,” Gottheimerwrote. “The bottom line is that this isn’t a partisan issue — it’s a matter of public safety. It’s about fixing a system that needs fixing.” Trump officials, meanwhile, have slammed past administrations for doing too little to update the existing air traffic control systems. Earlier this week,Transportation Secretary Sean Duffyannounced he would lead a modernisation of those systems, including the replacement of copper cables with fibre optics and replacing older radars and radios. “Building this new system is an economic and national security necessity, and the time to fix it is now,” Duffy said in his news release. But the project will likely require approval and funding from Congress, leaving its future up in the air.",

    "title": "Mexico is suing Google over ‘Gulf of America’ label, Sheinbaum says",
    "article_text": "Mexico has sued the technology company Google for adopting United States President Donald Trump’slabellingof the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America”. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the lawsuit on Friday, without providing further details. Mexico’s foreign relations ministry had previously sent letters to the tech giant asking it not to use “Gulf of America” to refer to waters within its territory. Currently, the Gulf of Mexicoappearsas the “Gulf of America” on Google Maps for users within the US. It appears as “Gulf of Mexico” for users outside of the US. On January 20, his first day in office, Trump signed anexecutive orderchanging the body of water’s name in all references by the federal government. A few weeks later, on February 9, he flew over the gulf and declared it to be “Gulf of America Day” in a separateproclamation. Critics have said the move is in line with Trump’s expansionist goals, which include threatening totake controlof the Panama Canal and Greenland, and pushing for Canada to become the “51st state”. The body of water in question, an oceanic basin cradled between the southern US and Mexico, hascarried the name“Gulf of Mexico” for more than 400 years. Mexico has argued that, if the US is to adopt the term “Gulf of America”, the new name should only apply to the part of the gulf that sits over the US continental shelf. That boundary generally aligns with the US-Mexico maritime border. In February, Cris Turner, Google’s vice president of government affairs and public policy, told Mexico it would not change its naming convention, according to a letter shared by Sheinbaum at the time. Turner said the company was following its “longstanding maps policies impartially and consistently across all regions”. Google, part of the Alphabet conglomerate, has said it updates its region names according to the US Geographic Names System. Since taking office, Trump has also moved to change federal documents referring to the tallest peak in North America as Denali, its traditional Alaskan name. He has reverted its name to Mount McKinley, a more recent name adopted by gold miners to honour a slain president. The controversy over the “Gulf of Mexico”, however, has galvanised politicians in Trump’s Republican Party. On Thursday, the US House of Representatives voted along party lines, 211 to 206, to formalise “Gulf of America” as the official name, with only one Republican joining the Democrats in opposition. The bill is likely to face steeper odds in the Senate, should it be taken up for a vote. The Mexico-Google standoff has not been the only tussle related to Trump’s renaming of the gulf. A month after taking office, the White House sought to block The Associated Press news agency from reporting from the Oval Office and on board Air Force One, in retaliation for the organisation’s insistence on referring to the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico. A federal judge ordered the White House last month to restore the agency’s full access to cover presidential events, citing First Amendment rights that bar the administration from punishing news outlets for the content of their speech.",

    "article_text": "Who:Barcelona vs Real MadridWhat:Spanish Copa del ReyWhere:Lluis Companys Olympic Stadium in Barcelona, SpainWhen:Sunday at 4:15pm local time (14:15 GMT) Follow Al Jazeera Sport’slive text and photo commentary stream. LaLiga leaders Barcelona will look to extend their lead over second-placed Real Madrid to seven points when the teams meet in the Spanish top flight on Sunday. With only four games to play of the domestic season in Spain, victory for Barca would put one hand on the title that Real won last season. It would also cap a season of dominance for the Catalan club over their fierce rivals. Al Jazeera looks through all the talking points and news before the final El Clasico of the season. Real Madrid’s season appeared disastrous a few weeks ago, but if Carlo Ancelotti’s side can finally beat rivals Barcelona in Sunday’s Clasico, their title defence will be resuscitated. A victory for Real would narrow the gap to one point with three games to play. Madrid were left licking their wounds after a Champions Leaguequarterfinal thrashing by Arsenal, and coach Ancelotti is poised to depart at the end of the season, but it could yet be with a major trophy in his hands. Barcelona’s European dream ended at the hands ofInter Milan on Tuesday, no doubt brightening spirits in the Spanish capital. With Barcelona’s quadruple dream crushed by Inter, should Madrid defend their title, they could even classify their season as a success. The Catalans have already securedthe Copa del ReyandSpanish Super Cup, both of which they won by beating Real Madrid in the final. Barcelona were4-0 winners at Real Madridin the first El Clasico of the LaLiga season in October. Robert Lewandowski put the visitors two up early in the second half at Santiago Bernabeu. Lamine Yamal and Raphinha completed the scoring. Combined with the two cup victories, Barcelona have netted 12 goals across the three games so far. Barca have conceded only four, with Hansi Flick’s side outplaying Madrid on each occasion. This FRONT 3... 🔥pic.twitter.com/TFsqju069J — LALIGA English (@LaLigaEN)May 9, 2025 “We will have a great opportunity, we have to prepare well – it’s an almost decisive match,” said Ancelotti. Reflecting on the Copa del Rey final, which went to extra time, Ancelotti added, “The last match was competitive, we were very close to winning and I don’t think we have to invent a lot of new things [tactically],” said Ancelotti. “We have to try and play a serious game, and we will do so with all the confidence in the world. “Despite all our problems, the fact we are here and we can fight in this match is something beautiful.” Last weekendagainst Celta VigoAncelotti also afforded Turkish 20-year-old Arda Guler a rare start, and he impressed in midfield, providing impetus which the retired Toni Kroos gave last season, as Madrid won a LaLiga and Champions League double. Guler also impressed as a substitute in the Copa final and Ancelotti may start him at the Olympic stadium this weekend. “At Madrid, you have to suck it up on the bench before you become an indisputable start in this team – Arda has the profile of a player who could be a starter at Madrid,” said Ancelotti. “He sucked it up on the bench, he didn’t get annoyed and he has evolved … he’s not the same Guler from last September.” A home defeat on Sunday would not be the death knell for their title bid but would ramp up the pressure on Flick’s young, relatively inexperienced charges. “[We] have to go on, we have five days to prepare and we want to win it,” said the German coach after the loss in Milan in one of the all-time classic Champions League semifinals. “[This defeat] must wake up the hunger to win the title, this is important for me.” Barcelona make the short trip to cross-city rivals Espanyol on Thursday before entertaining Villareal next Sunday in their final home fixture of the campaign. The season finale sees Barca head to Bilbao on May 25, to face Athletic Club, who were knocked out of the Europa League by Manchester United on Thursday. Real entertain Mallorca on Wednesday before travelling to Seville next Sunday. Their final game of the season is home to Real Sociedad. Barcelona defender Jules Kounde is absent with a hamstring injury on Thursday. Striker Robert Lewandowski returned to the bench against Inter following a leg injury. Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny will be challenged for a starting place by first-choice keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who is back after a long injury layoff. Predicted Barcelona XI:Szczesny; Eric, Cubarsi, Martinez, Martin; Pedri, de Jong; Yamal, Olmo, Raphinha; Lewandowski Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao have been ruled out for the remainder of the season and have been joined on the sidelines by, Eduardo Camavinga, Antonio Rudiger, Ferland Mendy and David Alaba. Brazilian forward Rodrygo, however, is set to return from illness. Predicted Real Madrid XI:Courtois; Vazquez, Tchouameni, Asencio, Garcia; Valverde, Modric; Rodrygo, Bellingham, Vinicius; Mbappe",

    "article_text": "At least 30 people were killed when gunmen attacked travellers in Nigeria’s southeastern Imo State, according to Amnesty International. The human rights NGO reported on Friday that more than 20 commuter vehicles and trucks were set ablaze during a “vicious attack” along the Okigwe-Owerri road the day before. The attackers are suspected of being members of the banned separatist group, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Amnesty said. “​​The attack … shows callous disregard for the sanctity of life. The gunmen blocked Okigwe-Owerri highway and areas of Umuna in Onuimo LGA unleashed violence in an utter show of impunity,” Amnesty wrote on X. “The Nigerian authorities must immediately and transparently investigate this attack and ensure that the actual perpetrators are brought to justice. International law requires the Nigerian government to promptly investigate unlawful killings to bring perpetrators to justice,” it added. Amnesty International strongly condemns the vicious attack on travelers yesterday 8 May 2025, along Okigwe-Owerri Road in Imo State, killing at least 30 people and burning over 20 commuter vehicles and trucks. — Amnesty International Nigeria (@AmnestyNigeria)May 9, 2025 Imo police spokesperson, Henry Okoye, confirmed that the attack took place in the early hours of Thursday, but declined to comment on the death toll. On Friday, Okoye told the Reuters news agency that one of the assailants had been killed by the police. According to a police statement, the gunmen, operating in three groups, blocked the highway at 04:00 GMT and shot sporadically. “A full-scale search and cordon operation is currently underway, with security operatives combing nearby forests and surrounding areas where the suspects are believed to be hiding,” the police said. Nigeria’s Premium Times also reported that the police commissioner of Imo State, Aboki Danjuma, led a joint tactical team of security operatives to the scene. According to Danjuma, the joint security team comprised personnel from Nigeria’s army, the police, and the State Security Service. The IPOB, which the Nigerian government has classed as an outlawed organisation, has been campaigning for the secession of southeastern Nigeria, where the majority of people belong to the Igbo ethnic group. Following the late 1960s civil war that engulfed the Biafra region, killing more than one million people, separatist groups have continued to push for an independent state from the southeast and in some parts of the south of Nigeria.",

    "title": "Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk ordered released from ICE detention",
    "article_text": "Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University doctoral student detained as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on pro-Palestine visa holders, has been ordered to be released from immigration custody. On Friday, Vermont-based US District Judge William Sessions ruled that Ozturk’s “detention cannot stand”. “The court finds that she does not pose a danger to the community, nor does she present a risk of flight. The court orders the government to release Ms Ozturk from custody immediately,” Sessions said. Lawyers for Ozturk, a Turkish citizen in the US on a student visa, had argued that the Trump administration’s efforts to detain and deport her violated her constitutional rights, including to free speech and due process. Sessions appeared to side with the legal team’s argument, saying Ozturk’s “continued detention potentially chills the speech of the millions and millions of individuals in this country who are not citizens”. Ozturk’s lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, said in a statement she was “relieved and ecstatic” about the judge’s order but that it came far too late. “When did speaking up against oppression become a crime? When did speaking up against genocide become something to be imprisoned for?” she said. The 30-year-old Ozturk had appeared at the Vermont hearing via video from a detention centre in Louisiana, wearing an orange jumpsuit and a hijab. During her testimony, she recounted beingsurrounded and detainedby plain-clothed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents near her student housing in Somerville, Massachusetts, on March 25. Surveillance video of that incident later spread online, sparking outrage. She said she suffered a series of asthma attacks, 12 in total, as she was being transferred to Louisiana. The first came at the airport in Atlanta, she said, and she did not have all of the medication she needed. “I was afraid, and I was crying,” she said. The doctoral student told the judge her studies related to community engagement in children in warzones. She was among dozens of student visa holders and permanent residents targeted by the Trump administration for pro-Palestine advocacy. The administration has relied onan obscure provisionof the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the secretary of state to deport someone deemed to “adversely affect US foreign policy interests”. Officials have broadly portrayed pro-Palestinian protests and other forms of advocacy as “anti-Semitic”, despite providing scant evidence in individual cases. Still, Ozturk’s detention has been notable given her relatively low public profile, with her only public advocacy coming in the form of an article she co-wrote with three other students for the campus newspaper. The piece criticised the university’s response to student-led calls for administrators to acknowledge “Palestinian genocide” and “disclose its investments and divest from companies” with links to Israel. Speaking at Friday’s hearings, Ozturk said Tufts would provide her housing if she is released, and her friends and lawyers would drive her to future court hearings. She added that she remained committed to finishing her PhD degree. The judge’s order on Friday came just over a week after Mohsen Mahdawi, a US permanent resident and pro-Palestine protest leader at Columbia University, wasreleasedfrom immigration detention by another federal judge in Vermont. On Thursday, Mahdawi, who still faces an ongoing deportation case,announcedthe creation of the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund, to help immigrants facing deportation hearings. Speaking to Al Jazeera’s Kristen Saloomey, Mahdawi recounted being detained by immigration officials as he attended a citizenship hearing in Vermont in April. He said ICE agents had sought to transfer him to the more conservative jurisdiction in Louisiana, as they had done with Ozturk andMahmoud Khalil, another Columbia University protest leader targeted for deportation. Mahdawi added that the move was meant to isolate him from his community and legal support. “They had the aeroplane ticket, commercial flight printed with my name on it, but I was lucky enough that we missed the flight by nine minutes,” Mahdawi said. That brief window, he explained, gave his lawyers time to intervene. They sought and received a temporary restraining order preventing Mahdawi from being transferred out of the state. Mahdawi credits remaining in Vermont with paving the way to his release. “I mean, if the plan worked out as they have laid it down, we would not be having this interview,” he said. Prior to Ozturk’s hearing on Friday, Judge Sessions hadorderedher to be transferred to Vermont no later than May 14, as that is where she was held at the time her lawyers filed an initial petition for her release. Sessions, however, decided to continue with her bail hearing even before Ozturk was physically moved. The Trump administration had previously appealed an earlier deadline for her transfer to Vermont, set for May 1. Ozturk has not been accused of any crime. The Trump administration has offered little justification for its decision to revoke Ozturk’s student visa, pointing only to the article she co-authored and claiming she was “creating a hostile environment for Jewish students”. The administration has broadly claimed that visa holders are not afforded the same constitutional rights protections as US citizens, a question that could eventually be decided by the Supreme Court. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt briefly weighed in on Friday’s decision during her daily news briefing, where she reiterated the administration’s position that such rulings are tantamount to judicial interference. “We’ve made quite clear that lower-level judges should not be dictating the foreign policy of the United States, and we absolutely believe that the president and the Department of Homeland Security are well within their legal rights to deport illegal immigrants,” she said. “It is a privilege, not a right, to come to this country on a visa,” she added.",

    "title": "‘I don’t have the cash to pay for these tariffs’: US small biz suffers",
    "article_text": "After working in the outdoor industry for three years at Smith, which makes helmets and goggles, Cassie Abel realised there were not many brands built exclusively with women in mind. In 2016, she founded Wild Rye, a rural Idaho-based outdoor apparel brand for women. Building her business was a labour of passion and included big risks, such as leveraging her house for capital. It was not until 2021 that she became profitable. Now, her business faces yet another existential threat: High tariffs will drive up her costs, and she’s unsure how long she can keep her business alive. Abel is expecting $700,000 worth of purchase orders arriving in July, which encompasses the brand’s full fall lineup, which she ordered in December from suppliers in China. She says Wild Rye, which imports twice a year, will now be subject to $1.2m in tariffs for its upcoming shipment. “I don’t have the cash to pay for these tariffs. These tariffs are due upon entering the country. I won’t have time to sell this product before the tariffs are done. We could be out of business in the next four months,” Abel said. Since taking office, United States President Donald Trumphas imposed a 145-percent tariffon China and 10 percent on all other countries. The president has claimed the tariffs incentivise businesses to bring manufacturing back stateside. But that has left hundreds of small businesses like Abel’s scrambling to find ways to manage the hefty fee. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a group of reporters at a White House briefing last week, “The goal here is to bring back the high-quality industrial jobs to the US. President Trump is interested in the jobs of the future, not the jobs of the past. You know, we don’t need to necessarily have a booming textile industry like where I grew up again, but we do want to have precision manufacturing and bring that back.” His comments put additional pressure on employers like Wild Rye. To weather the storm caused by the Trump administration’s tariffs, Abel has frozen hiring, paused salary increases for her 11 full-time employees, and stalled new product development. She said she will need to raise prices on her products for the fall, ranging from 10 to 20 percent. On April 29, she and hundreds of members of the outdoor apparel community met leaders in Washington to push for assistance. Abel said Democrats were unsure what they could do amid Republican control of the House of Representatives and Senate, while Republican leadership feared retribution if they went against the president. “I was hearing it [concern] from both sides of the aisle. There’s frustration, it’s like it’s hard to find a path forward. Everyone understands that small businesses are going to crumble, and everyone feels like there’s no playbook for this,” Abel told Al Jazeera. The US Chamber of Commerce has also pushed the White House to carve out exceptions for small businesses like Wild Rye, which the Trump administration quickly dismissed. Abel says she started as a made-in-USA brand, but that was not financially sustainable. “That almost tanked the business before we launched because the US simply doesn’t have the capability or capacity to produce technical apparel,” Abel said. Most textile products like clothes and shoes that Americans buy are not made in the US. The US imports about 97 percent of clothes, mostly from Asian countries including China, which has been hit hard by the 145-percent tariffs, but also from Vietnam and Bangladesh. But it’s not just the apparel industry facing this challenge. It’s the entire small business community – defined as a business with 500 employees or less – a portion of the economy that employs roughly 61.7 million Americans, representing 45.9 percent of the US workforce and accounts for 43.5 percent of the US gross domestic product (GDP). Thebroader economy has also alreadyfelt shockwaves from the tariffs that will impact small businesses. The US GDP fell in the first quarter, per the US Commerce Department, by 0.3 percent after a 2.4 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 2024. According to ADP, job growth stumbled to 62,000—a more immediate metric than the US Labor Department’s jobs report, which lags by a month and shows 177,000 jobs added. Consumer confidence hit a 13-year low, and consumers are pulling back spending amid fears of further rising costs — which, in turn, means fewer people could buy products ranging from outdoor apparel to single-origin teas and spices. In 2014, Chitra Agrawal founded Brooklyn Delhi, an Indian cuisine-inspired food brand in Brooklyn, New York, with her husband Ben Garthus. Over the last decade, they have created a range of products, including 14 different condiments and simmer sauces, that started as handmade and have since grown into a large-scale business distributing to major retailers like Whole Foods and Kroger, as well as meal kit services like HelloFresh and Blue Apron. Because hers is a specialty brand, sourcing certain ingredients from other parts of the world is not just part of the brand’s allure, it is also a necessity. “We are making these authentic Indian products that require ingredients that are just not grown or available at scale in the US. It kind of puts us in a tough place,” Agrawal told Al Jazeera. Agrawal said 65 percent to 70 percent of the ingredients she uses come from outside of the US, primarily from India, and a handful from Mexico and Sri Lanka, as well as glass from China. Like Agrawal, Anjali Bhargava faces a similar challenge. The founder of Anjali’s Cup, a brand that makes single-origin spices and teas from around the world, sources ginger from Vietnam, turmeric from Thailand, and tea from India, ingredients that, in her view, make the brand so special. In 2024, the United States was the largest importer of both ginger and several different varieties of tea, including black and green, according to Tridge, a global food sourcing data analytics firm. “I am going to have to pay the tariffs on those things if it comes down to it, if I want to continue making those products. [Not being able to make these products] is not negotiable for me,” Bhargava said. She says that in order to cut costs, she is trying to find domestic alternatives for aspects of her production, like packaging, a big expense. Pre-tariffs, she imported tins from China. Once her stock runs out, she may have to discontinue four to six of the 11 products she offers because she cannot afford the extra cost for imports. “Basically, to keep the business moving, I’m being forced to undertake a complete overhaul of my retail packaging [which can be produced stateside], which means redesigning, re-photographing, and that comes with a cost,” Bhargava added. She says she will need to move away from tins, which she imports from China and explore other kinds of packaging options like pouches. The unexpected one-time costs of $10,000 to $20,000 will eat into her already slim margins, Bhargava says. She is the only full-time employee, but hires freelancers and outsources to other businesses for tasks ranging from packaging to delivery. Unlike larger companies, it’s much harder for small businesses to absorb the tariffs. “We’ve seen that it’s hard for small businesses to balance those costs as they have very small margins. They are the ones who are going to get hit hardest,” said Alexis D’Amato, director of government affairs for Small Business Majority, an advocacy group for small businesses. “They’re bracing for impact on how they’re going to either eat these costs or pass them on to the consumer, which nobody wants to do,” D’Amato added. Raising prices in response to market pressures does not guarantee they will fall when costs decline. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions forced producers to increase prices. But even after costs eased, grocers kept prices high because consumers continued paying them — and no policy or market force compelled reductions. That burden weighs on Agrawal. “Once you make that change and say at one point, I want to roll back those price increases, there’s no guarantee that on the shelf, the prices will decrease. It’s very difficult when you’re working with grocery stores to get your prices to be lowered again. We have to really be very careful about this move. We’re still contemplating it,” said Brooklyn Delhi’s Agrawal. But these looming concerns have led consumers and businesses to import goods before tariffs kick in, to stock up on key items that may help them avoid raising prices, at least for some time. In the first quarter, US imports surged by 41.3 percent, including by entrepreneurs like Sean Mackowski, owner of Tallon Electric, a company that makes guitar pedals in Columbus, Ohio. “We did stock up a lot. I think everybody did their best to scramble, hoping that that will bridge the gap to this going away. But if we get to the end of that bridge, we’ll either need to find a different way or we’re going to start running out of stuff,” Mackowski told Al Jazeera.",

    "article_text": "Air raid sirens were heard in Israel as a missile was launched towards the territory by Yemen’s Houthis, who say they are retaliating against Israeli sites in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel’s military said it intercepted the projectile on Friday using its air defence systems. There were no reports of injuries or damage from the missile attack, according to a military statement. The incident came days after Oman said it mediated aceasefire dealbetween the United States andthe Houthis, with the Yemeni group saying the agreement did not include Israel. Houthi rebels fired a “hypersonic ballistic missile” towards Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv, while also claiming a drone attack “targeting a vital Israeli enemy target” in the same area, according to the group’s military spokesperson, Yahya Saree. Israeli media reported that air raid sirens were sounded in several areas across central Israel, with people receiving early warning mobile messages about the missile attack. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said that Israel would respond forcefully in Yemen and “wherever necessary”, describing the Houthi missiles as “Iranian”. “The Israeli defence minister has released some comments saying that Israel is going to strike back with full force,” said Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan. “But these comments aren’t really surprising because we’ve heard them from Israel Katz previously when the Houthis had launched any sort of ballistic missile towards Israel.” However, “this time it’s a little bit different because earlier in the week one of those missiles actually made impact … at quite a strategic location at the main airport inside of central Israel,” Salhut said. Friday’s missile sent thousands of people “running towards shelters and safe rooms”, she added. US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that his country wouldstop bombing Yemenas the Houthis had agreed to stop their attacks on US ships in the Red Sea. But the Houthis have continued to fire missiles and drones towards Israel, most of which the Israeli military says it has intercepted, without casualties or serious damage occurring. The Houthis have attacked numerous vessels in the Red Sea linked to Israel and its allies in what they state is an act of solidarity with Palestine. According to Israeli media, the Houthi group has launched 28 ballistic missiles and dozens of drones at Israel since March 18, when Israel resumed its genocidal war on Gaza. Israel has been waging a devastating war on the enclave since October 2023, killing more than 50,000 Palestinians, after a Hamas-led attack into southern Israel that month.",

    "title": "‘I will run right over you’: New FEMA head issues warning to Trump critics",
    "article_text": "The new head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the United States has warned his staff that he will not tolerate any resistance to President Donald Trump’s agenda for the organisation. Friday was the first full day of David Richardson’s leadership at FEMA, after the agency saw a shake-up at its helm earlier this week. But he began his tenure as head with a stark warning for the agency. “I — and I alone in FEMA — speak for FEMA. I’m here to carry out the president’s intent for FEMA,” he reportedly told staff in an agency-wide call. He predicted that 20 percent of the staff would oppose Trump’s vision for the FEMA, which he has pledged to dismantle. “Obfuscation, delay, undermining. If you’re one of those 20 percent of people and you think those tactics and techniques are going to help you, they will not, because I will run right over you,” Richardson said. “Don’t get in my way,” he added. “I know all the tricks.” FEMA is the agency charged with coordinating and carrying out the federal government’s response to natural disasters and other emergencies, ranging from hurricanes and flooding to domestic attacks. But it has long been criticised for lagging response times, inadequate resources and disorganisation, particularly during major disasters like2005’s Hurricane Katrina, which displaced tens of thousands of residents in Louisiana and killed more than 1,300 people. Trump has responded to such criticisms by pledging to do away with FEMA altogether and redistributing its functions to individual states. “ When there’s a problem with the state, I think that that problem should be taken care of by the state,” Trumpsaid in January. “That’s what we have states for. They take care of problems. And a governor can handle something very quickly, you know?” During his campaign for re-election in 2024, he also spread falsehoods about the agency, including that it had refused to offer relief to Republican residents in North Carolina, which had recently suffered widespread flooding from Hurricane Helene. Since taking office in January, Trump has followed through with his plans to restructure the federal government, reducing the funding and staff to independent entities like theUnited States Agency for International Development(USAID) and theConsumer Financial Protection Bureau(CFPB). Trump and his allies have framed the cuts as necessary to combat “fraud” and “waste” across the government, though he has not offered definitive proof of wrongdoing. At FEMA, an estimated 2,000 employees were terminated or accepted buyout offers to resign. A 2023 Government Accountability Office report indicated that FEMA only had 5,000 full-time staff members, as well as a group of reservists and emergency-response workers who could be called up to address a crisis. To become the administrator of FEMA requires undergoing a Senate confirmation hearing and a vote. But while those Senate hearings continue for high-level government positions, Trump has named interim leaders to govern the organisation in the meantime. Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL, served in that role since Trump started his second term. He had been a prominent critic of FEMA during the administration of former President Joe Biden. But his time as FEMA chief came to an abrupt halt earlier this week, in the wake of an appearance before an appropriations subcommittee in the House of Representatives. At Wednesday’s hearing, a Democratic Representative, Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, asked Hamilton about the idea that FEMA could be shuttered. Hamilton responded with measured opposition. “I do not believe it is in the best interest of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency,” he said. He added that it was ultimately not his decision to make and criticised FEMA as part of an “overextended federal bureaucracy”. “I’m not in a position to make decisions and impact outcomes on whether or not a determination such as consequential as that should be made. That is a conversation that should be had between the president of the United States and this governing body,” Hamilton told the committee. But the very next day, Hamilton was removed from his role as FEMA’s interim head and replaced by Richardson, a Marine veteran. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Hamilton’s removal was related to his testimony at the subcommittee hearing. “My understanding is that this individual testified saying something that was contrary to what the President believes and the goals of this administration in regards to FEMA policy,” Leavitt said. “And so, of course, we want to make sure that people in every position are advancing the administration’s goals.” Critics, including Representative DeLauro, blasted the switch-up as indicative of a White House that will not tolerate dissent, even when necessary. “The Trump administration must explain why [Hamilton] has been removed from this position,” DeLauro said in a statement. “Integrity and morality should not cost you your job.” Richardson, meanwhile, has proceeded to set a stricter tone for his tenure, with his fiery Friday phone call. He warned FEMA staff that any actions not “within our missions” would be considered a waste of taxpayer funds. “We’re going to find out how to do things better. We’re going to find out how to push things down to the states that should be done at state level. Also we’re going to find out how we can do more cost-sharing with the states,” he said. Trump has been criticised for denying requests for assistance, including from Republican-led states like Arkansas, which suffered tornadoes during the week of March 14, destroying neighbourhoods. Multiple deaths were reported. Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders — who worked as Trump’spress secretaryduring his first term — has written to the president to appeal his denial of aid. “Since 2023, Arkansas has experienced an unprecedented frequency of disasters, with four federally declared disasters and ten state-declared disasters. These overlapping events have severely strained the capacity of state and local agencies to respond and recover effectively,” Huckabee Sanders wrote. “Many Arkansans are still living in temporary conditions or repairing damages from previous events, only to be displaced or impacted once again. The state and its citizens are in dire need of assistance to recover, rebuild, and mitigate further loss.”",

    "title": "Who are the armed groups India accuses Pakistan of backing?",
    "article_text": "Tensions are higher betweenIndia and Pakistanthan they have been in decades as the two countries trade blame fordrone attackson each other’s territory over the past few days. At the heart of the dispute is what India claims is Pakistan’s support for armed separatist groups operating in Kashmir, aregion disputedbetween the two countries. An armed group calledThe Resistance Front (TRF)claimed responsibility for the Pahalgamattackin Indian-administered Kashmir last month in which 26 people were killed. India alleges that TRF is an offshoot of another Pakistan-based armed group, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and has blamed Pakistan for supporting such groups. Pakistan has denied this. It condemned the attack in April and called for an independent investigation. Here is more about who the armed groups are and the major attacks they’ve claimed or been blamed for. The TRF emerged in 2019 following the Indian government’s suspension ofArticle 370 of the Indian Constitution,stripping Indian-administered Kashmir of itssemi-autonomous status. However, the group was not widely known before the Pahalgam attack, which it took responsibility for in April via the Telegram messaging app, on which it said it was opposed to the granting of residency permits to “outsiders”. Since the repeal of Article 370, non-Kashmiris have been granted residency permits to settle in Indian-administered Kashmir. This has stoked fears that the Indian government is trying to change the demographics of Kashmir, whose population is nearly all Muslim. Unlike other armed rebel groups in Kashmir, the TRF does not have an Islamic name. However, the Indian government maintains that it is an offshoot of, or a front for, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-based armed group whose name means “Army of the Pure”. In 2020, TRF started claiming responsibility for minor attacks, including some targeted killings. TRF recruits included rebels from different splinter rebel groups. Indian security agents say they have arrested multiple TRF members since then. According to Indian government records, most armed fighters killed in gunfights in Kashmir were affiliated with the TRF in 2022. The LeT, which calls for the “liberation” of Indian-administered Kashmir, was founded around 1990 by Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, who is also known as Hafiz Saeed. In 2008, armed gunmen opened fire on civilians at several sites in Mumbai, India, killing 166 people.Ajmal Kasab, the only attacker captured alive, said the attackers were members of LeT. Saeed denied any involvement in that attack, however. Kasab was executed by India in 2012. India also blamed Pakistani intelligence agencies for the attack. While Pakistan conceded that the attack may have been partly planned on Pakistani soil, it maintained that its government and intelligence agencies were not involved. According to the United Nations, LeT was also involved in a 2001 attack on India’s parliament and a 2006 attack on Mumbai commuter trains that killed 189 people. On May 7, India launched missileattacks on several citiesin Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. One of these cities was Muridke in the Punjab province. India claims that Muridke was the location of the headquarters of the Jamat-ud-Dawa, a charity organisation that New Delhi insists is a front for the LeT. Last week, the Indian army claimed it had struck LeT’s Markaz Taiba camp inMuridke. The army also claimed Kasab had been trained at this camp. Pakistan says LeT has been banned, however. Following an attack on Indian-administered Kashmir’s Pulwama in 2019, Pakistan also reimposed a lapsed ban on Jamat-ud-Dawa. Saeed was arrested in 2019 and is in the custody of the Pakistani government, serving a 31-year prison sentence after being convicted in two “terror financing” cases. Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM), or “The Army of Muhammad”, was formed around 2000 by Masood Azhar, who had been released from Indian prison in 1999. Azhar, who had been arrested on “terrorism” charges, was released in exchange for 155 hostages being held by hijackers of an Indian Airlines plane. Azhar previously fought under the banner of a group called Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, which calls for Kashmir to be united with Pakistan, and has been linked toal-Qaeda. According to the UN Security Council, JeM has also had links with al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. Pakistan banned JeM in 2002 after the group, alongside LeT, was blamed for an attack on the Indian parliament in 2001. The British-born Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who was convicted of killing US journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002, was also a member of JeM. Pearl was the Wall Street Journal’s South Asia bureau chief. However, a 2011 report released by the Pearl Project at Georgetown University following its own investigation claimed that Pearl had not been murdered by Sheikh. The report instead alleged that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001 attacks, was responsible. In 2021, a panel of three judges at Pakistan’s Supreme Courtordered Sheikh’srelease. Despite the ban, Indian authorities claim the group continues to operate in Bahawalpur, in Pakistan’s Punjab province. On May 7, the Indian army claimed its strikes had also targeted the headquarters of JeM there. In 2019, JeM claimed a suicide bomb attack that killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers in Pulwama in Indian-administered Kashmir. Azhar has been arrested by Pakistani authorities twice, but was released and has never been charged. He has since disappeared from the public eye and his current whereabouts are not known. Hizbul-ul-Mujahideen (HuM), or “Party of Holy Fighters” was formed in 1989 by Kashmiri separatist leader Muhammad Ahsan Dar. The group emerged out of the 1988 protests in Kashmir against the Indian government. The group, also called Hizb, has become the largest Indigenous rebel group based in Indian-administered Kashmir. Rather than calling for independence, HuM calls for the whole of Kashmir to be allowed to accede to Pakistan. The group has a huge network of fighters in Shopian, Kulgam and Pulwama districts in the south of Indian-administered Kashmir. In 2016, the killing of popular HuM commander Burhan Wani triggered widespread protests in Indian-administered Kashmir, resulting in a crackdown by Indian security forces. The following year, theUS designated HuMas a “foreign terrorist organisation” and placed sanctions on the group. HuM leader Riyaz Naikoo spoke to Al Jazeera in 2018. “It is the nature of the occupying Indian state that has compelled us to resort to violent methods of resistance,” he said. When asked what the group’s demands were, Naikoo said: “Our demand is very simple – freedom. Freedom, for us, means the complete dismantling of India’s illegal occupation of Kashmir and all the structures that support it, be they military or economic.” He added that the group considers Pakistan an “ideological and moral friend” because “Pakistan is the only country which has consistently supported our cause and raised the concerns of Kashmiri freedom struggle at international forums”.",

    "title": "Church must bring light to world’s ‘dark nights’: Pope Leo at first mass",
    "article_text": "Pope Leo XIV has promised to make the Catholic Church a balm for the world’s “dark nights”, as he celebrated his first mass as pontiff less than 24 hours after being elected. Sixty-nine-year-oldLeo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost and the first American pope, delivered the Mass on Friday, flanked by cardinals in the Vatican City’s Sistine Chapel. The new head of the Catholic Church waselected by fellow cardinals on Thursday,following Pope Francis’s death, and has become the first US pontiff in the church’s 2,000-year history. Leo, who now leads the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics, acknowledged that the Christian faith is sometimes “considered absurd” and the preserve of “the weak and unintelligent”. “A lack of faith is often tragically accompanied by the loss of meaning in life, the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society,” he said at the mass, adorned in simple white and gold clothes. He also warned that Jesus cannot be “reduced to a kind of charismatic leader or superman”. “This is true not only among non-believers, but also among many baptised Christians, who thus end up living, at this level, in a state of practical atheism,” he said. The new pontiff said he would seek to serve as the “faithful administrator” for the Church as a whole. Leo will be formally installed as pope at a mass on May 18 and will preside over his first general audience on May 21, the Vatican said, with world and religious leaders invited to his formal launch of the papacy. Pope Francis’s inauguration in 2013 attracted a crowd of about 200,000 people. The new pope will also leave senior Vatican officials in their roles for the time being, giving him time to decide before making appointments, the Vatican said. The pope was elected at the end of atwo-day conclavethat wrapped up on Thursday evening when white smoke billowed from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel. Francis, who died last month at the age of 88, leaves Leo to inherit a number of major challenges, ranging from a budget shortfall to divisions about whether the Church should be more welcoming towards the LGBTQ community and divorcees, and should let women play a greater role in its affairs. Leo was born in Chicago but spent two decades as a missionary in Peru. Before his election, US cardinals were largely written off as papal contenders because of a widespread assumption that the global Church could not be run by a superpower pope. However, since Leo also holds Peruvian citizenship, it is understood that he has knowledge of both the West and the Global South.",

    "title": "Canadian unemployment rate hits six-month high amid US-imposed tariffs",
    "article_text": "Canada’s unemployment jumped to its highest level since November as United States President Donald Trump’simposed tariffsaffect the export-dependent economy. Statistics Canada showed a 0.2 percent increase for the month of April, bringing the country’s unemployment rate to 6.9 percent, according to its report released on Friday. The 6.9 figure matched November unemployment, which was an eight-year high outside of the pandemic era. The agency pointed to the effect tariffs imposed by the US had on the country’s manufacturing sector, which lost 31,000 jobs on a monthly basis.The wholesale, retail and trade sectorsaw 27,000 jobs cut. Employment in the public sector increased by 23,000 or up 0.5 percent in April, following three months of little change, especially due to increased temporary hiring for the federal election that took place on April 28. The average hourly wage growth of permanent employees, a metric closely watched by the Canadian central bank to gauge inflationary trends, was at 3.5 percent in April, unchanged since March. Overall, the employment number was largely flat with minimal gains of net 7,400 jobs in April, it said – slightly higher than analyst expectations at 6.8 percent. This was in contrast to a loss of 32,600 jobs the prior month. The employment rate, or the proportion of the working-age population that is employed, was at 60.8 percent in April, following a decline of 0.2 percentage points in March. This was a six-month low, the statistics agency said. The employment rate had been depressed for most of 2023 and 2024 as population growth outpaced employment gains. However, since February, population growth has not been very high but employment gains have slowed. “People who were unemployed continued to face more difficulties finding work in April than a year earlier,” StatsCan said, adding that among those who were unemployed in March, 61 percent remained unemployed in April – almost four percentage points higher than the same period last year. Trump’s tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminiumin March and automobiles in April, along with import duties on a broad range of products with various reductions and exemptions, have affected businesses and households. The Bank of Canada has warned that growth would take a major hit in the coming months as exports fall, prices increase, hiring drops and layoffs accelerate. It has said it will act decisively if the economy needs urgent support. “Overall, we are seeing a job market that was weak heading into the trade war, now looking like it could soon buckle. Today’s report supports the case for a Bank of Canada cut in June,” Ali Jaffery, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, told the Reuters news agency.",

    "title": "‘Mindless’ damage: Two convicted of cutting down historic Sycamore Gap tree",
    "article_text": "A British court has found two men guilty of cutting down the famous“Sycamore Gap”tree in what prosecutors called a “moronic mission”. Newcastle Crown Court found former friends Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, guilty of criminal damage on Friday for the 2023 felling of the tree at Sycamore Gap. The historic tree, estimated to be almost 200 years old, stood at the centre of a dip in the landscape of Hadrian’s Wall in northern England, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, making it a popular spot for photographers and even marriage proposals. It was also featured in the 1991 film, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. After about five hours of deliberation, the pair were convicted on two counts of criminal damage – to the sycamore and the wall, which was damaged when the tree fell on it. “We often hear references made to mindless acts of vandalism, but that term has never been more relevant than today,” Northumbria Police’s Kevin Waring said after the conviction. “At no point have the two men given an explanation for why they targeted the tree – and there never could be a justifiable one,” he added. On the night of September 27, 2023, the two men drove to the site and sliced through the trunk of the tree in “a matter of minutes”, prosecutor Richard Wright said. “Having completed their moronic mission, the pair got back into the Range Rover and travelled back towards Carlisle” where they lived, he added. Gale Gilchrist, from the Crown Prosecution Service North, said “in just under three minutes, Graham and Carruthers ended its [the tree’s] historic legacy in a deliberate and mindless act of destruction. “We hope our community can take some measure of comfort in seeing those responsible convicted today,” she added. The two men have been remanded in custody and will be sentenced on July 15. The National Trust conservation body said the felling of the tree had “shocked people around the country and overseas, demonstrating the powerful connection between people and our natural heritage”. Efforts are now under way to see if the historic tree can be regrown from its stump or seeds.",

    "title": "EU ministers back Ukrainian tribunal to try Russian officials",
    "article_text": "Kyiv’s European allies have endorsed the creation of a special tribunal to hold top Russian leaders, including President Vladimir Putin, to account for the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. European Union foreign ministers, who met in the Ukrainian city of Lviv on Friday, signed off on the tribunal, named the “Lviv statement”, to mark the conclusion of the technical work to draft the legal body. The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, told reporters there was no space for “impunity”. “Russia’s aggression cannot go unpunished and therefore establishing this tribunal is extremely important,” Kallas said. “This tribunal will ensure that those most responsible for the aggression against Ukraine are held accountable,” she added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said the tribunal was part of the continent’s moral duty to hold Russia accountable for the war. “A strong tribunal for the crime of aggression can – and must – make any potential aggressor think twice,” he said in a video address to the meeting. Meanwhile, Russia declined to respond to news of the tribunal. “We are not reacting to this,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday, according to the TASS state news agency. An EU official told the Reuters news agency that the tribunal would have to respect Putin and his officials’ immunity while in office, but a prosecutor could investigate and propose an indictment ready for when the immunity is dropped. Dutch Justice Minister David van Weel welcomed the move and told Reuters that the tribunal was a good step because it “fills a void that currently exists”. “Which is how can you prosecute the leadership for the crime of aggression against another country,” he said. While the tribunal could start operating this year, it is not the only legal instrument being used against Russia for its war on Ukraine. In 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Putin and other Russian officials for the forced deportation of children and attacks on Ukrainian energy sites. Elsewhere on Friday, France announced that it would begin tapping into income from frozen Russian assets to help maintain about 60 French-made Caesar howitzers delivered to Ukraine. France’s foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that using the funds will ensure the “continued maintenance of the Caesar cannons it has supplied to Ukraine to help resist Russian attacks”. “We want peace, and today the only obstacle to peace is in Moscow, parading around under the name of Vladimir Putin,” said Barrot, adding that pressure must be put on the Russian leader to agree to a ceasefire. In Lviv, the EU’s Kalas also pledged to disburse one billion euros ($1.1bn) from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets to Ukrainian arms companies. “We have just made available 1 billion euros for the Ukrainian defence industry so that Ukraine could better defend itself,” Kallas said. “This funding will directly support Ukrainian defence companies and secure additional military aid over the coming months, which are critical.” The West has frozen around $300bn of Russian central bank assets – most of which are located in Europe – over Moscow’s February 2022 invasion. Friday’s developments came as Putin told amilitary paradein front of key allies, including China’s Xi Jinping, that Russia would be victorious in Europe.",

    "title": "Syria’s Druze divided as sectarian tensions linger after violence",
    "article_text": "Instability has plagued Syria in the past two weeks afterfighting broke outin two of Damascus’s suburbs and a southern governorate, drawing in government forces and non-state armed factions. Using the unrest as a pretext,Israel also launched attackson several locations in Syria. The fighting and the Israeli attacks add to the difficulties faced by Syria’s new government – which only came to power after the fall of longtime dictatorBashar al-Assad–  as it attempts to rebuild Syria after nearly 14 years of war. The violence of that war has not fully subsided. Instead, the recent fighting has taken on a sectarian character, though locals also told Al Jazeera that some actors were motivated by power as they try to carve out spheres of influence in the new Syria. Therecent clashesbegan on April 28 in the town of Jaramana, on the outskirts of Damascus, before spreading to nearby Ashrafiyat Sahnaya and the southern governorate of Sweida, where many of the country’s Druze population live. All of the areas have significant Druze populations, and the violence began after attackers were incensed by a blasphemous audio recording criticising the Prophet Muhammad, attributed to a religious leader from the minority group. The religious leader denied the recording was in his voice, and an investigation by Syria’s Ministry of the Interior has concurred. But it mattered little, as fighting between local armed Druze groups and outsiders began. The violence was followed by several Israeli attacks, including one near Syria’s presidential palace in Damascus. Syria’s government called it a “dangerous escalation”. Israel’s military has struck Syria hundreds of times since the fall of al-Assad, while Syria has yet to retaliate and has indicated that it has been involved innon-direct talkswith Israel to calm the situation. Israel has attempted to portray its latest attacks in Syria as evidence that it is adefender of the Druze, many of whom live in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a joint statement with Defense Minister Israel Katz, saying the attack was “a clear message to the Syrian regime: We will not allow [Syrian] forces to deploy south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community.” But many officials in Syria’s Druze community have expressed an openness to working with the new authority in Damascus and denied Israel’s overtures that claim to protect them. Sources told Al Jazeera that these recent clashes have not altered that view on Israel. “Israel is protecting its own interests,” Ali Jarbou, a professor at Damascus University and a member of a prominent Druze family, told Al Jazeera. “They are not protecting anyone. Not the Druze or anyone else.” Experts have said Israel prefers to haveweak states on its borders, and is therefore attacking Syria to weaken the new government and prevent it from exercising its power over the whole country. Allying with regional minority groups may also appear attractive to some in Israel, although a similar strategy in the past, most notably in Lebanon during the 1975-1990 civil war, failed. But the Israeli government is also facing internal pressure to act from its own Druze community, the vast majority of whom are supportive of the Israeli state and serve in the Israeli army, despite being Arabic-speaking. The Druze community in the Middle East is split between Lebanon, Syria, Israel, and a small community in Jordan. They have played an influential role across these countries – in Syria, one of the leaders of the country’s independence was a famous Druze named Sultan al-Atrash. Syria’s Druze are mostly split between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Mount Hermon, Sweida (in an area called Jabal al-Druze, or Mountain of the Druze), and a couple of Damascus’s suburbs, while there is also a small community near Idlib. Syrians in the occupied Golan Heights live under Israeli authority but most have rejected offers of Israeli citizenship. They’ve also historically been able to keep ties to Syria, sometimes studying in Damascus or marrying across the border, according to Tobias Lang, director of the Austrian Centre for Peace, who has extensively studied the Druze community in the Levant. The Druze in Syria are, however, “very fragmented politically”, Lang said, due to years of life under the al-Assad dictatorship. “No distinct Druze leadership was allowed to emerge, and the traditional leadership lost much of its power to the Baathist regime,” he said, referring to theBaath party, which ruled Syria from 1963 to 2024. During the war in Syria, competing voices emerged within the Druze community. Some, like Hikmat al-Hijri, the top Druze religious figure in Syria, initially supported the al-Assad regime. Others, like Wahid al-Balous, founder of the Men of Dignity Movement, split off from the regime much earlier and refused to send local men to die in support of the government. Al-Balous was laterassassinatedin 2015. Opposition figures blamed the regime. In 2023, when antigovernment protests erupted in Sweida, al-Hijri finally turned against al-Assad and supported the local opposition. Al-Hijri has also been sharply critical of the new Syrian authorities since the outbreak of violence last month, calling the attacks against the Druze a “genocidal campaign”. “We no longer trust a group that calls itself a government, because the government doesn’t kill its own people through extremist gangs that are loyal to it, and after the massacre claims they are loose forces,” al-Hijri said. The Syrian government has denied any involvement in the attacks on the Druze, and has instead emphasised that its forces have sought to provide security and prevent any further sectarian attacks. Agreements struck between local actors and the new government at the start of this month have ended the fighting for now. But dozens of people had been killed, many civilians among them. In Jaramana, locals are still on high alert. “We’re scared of our neighbours,” a resident told Al Jazeera, requesting anonymity for fear of retaliation against them or their family. In the early days after the fall of al-Assad, places like Jaramana and Sweida were hesitant to work with the new Syrian government. Local leaders, some of whom are Druze notables, demanded a say in local governance and security matters. But members of the Druze community have now been working with the central authority in Damascus to calm tensions, resolve disputes, and negotiate security arrangements. Some of those agreements will see locals join the new government’s internal security force and police their own areas under the central government’s authority. Still, locals are on edge after the clashes and fear they could restart. Locals told Al Jazeera that some Syrians, particularly from minority sects like the Druze, have had their faith in the new central authority shaken. “Trust [in the new government] began to decrease after theevents on the coast,” Jarbou said, referring to attacks in early March on Alawite – another minority community – in the coastal region after government forces were attacked. Hundreds were killed, many of them civilians, and while the government quickly announced an investigation into the attacks, the violence provided evidence for those fearful of the new order in Syria. That is perhaps understandable after 14 years of war and more than five decades of brutal dictatorship. “In other words, we can say that the war hasn’t stopped,” Jarbou said, adding that a serious, participatory political solution is needed for the country. Should that not come to pass, the current pattern of clashes and increased communal tensions will only worsen. “Sedition is raging,” he said. “It’s not that we’re afraid of sedition. We’re in sedition now.”",

The game launches on most platforms on June 5th at midnight in Japan. byJay Peters The paid release ofDeltarune, Toby Fox’s episodicUndertalespinoff, will be available for most people at the same time the Nintendo Switch 2 launches in Japan, Fox says in theDeltarunenewsletter for May 2025.Deltarune’sfirst two chapters, released in2018and2021respectively, were free, but this new release, which adds chapters 3 and 4, will be a paid version that costs $24.99. How the release timing will work is a little confusing, but let me explain. For PS4, PS5, Steam, and the original Switch,Deltarunewill launch on June 5th at 12AM in Japan, which translates to June 4th at 11AM ET / 8AM PT for people in the US. The Nintendo Switch 2 version ofDeltarune, on the other hand, will launch at midnight local time in most regions on June 5th. This decision actually means that people in New Zealand or Australia who get a Switch 2 at midnight have a slight head start. “But, for convenience’s sake, we’re just going to ignore you guys and pretend that the game is not out… Meanwhile, don’t say anything about it please,” Fox says. Future updates toDeltarunewill be added for free, Fox said in a newsletter last month, and theSwitch 2 versionwill have a special room that takes advantage of theconsole’s mouse controls.

    "article_text": "‘We’re going to see more software created than ever before because of AI.’ Also: Meta tries to “level up” its AI org.﻿ ‘We’re going to see more software created than ever before because of AI.’ Also: Meta tries to “level up” its AI org.﻿ byAlex Heath If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Tech event season is in full swing. This week, Stripe and Figma gathered thousands of people in downtown San Francisco for their respective conferences. I caught up with Figma CEODylan Fieldafter his opening keynote at Config, where he announced the most significant product expansion in the company’s history. Below, you’ll find our chat about how he sees AI fitting into Figma after a rough start to integrating the technology last year, the new areas he’s targeting to grow the platform, and more. And keep reading for how Meta is turning up the heat on its AI team, my thoughts about this week’s OpenAI news, and more… These days, it seems like Figma has the entire creative software industry in its sights. On Wednesday, CEODylan Fieldwalked onstage in front of about 8,000 people at the Moscone Center in San Francisco toannounce four new products: a ChatGPT-like prototyping tool, a website builder and hosting platform, an AI-branded ad tool that’s similar to Canva, and an Adobe Illustrator competitor. Thelast time I interviewed Field, he was resetting Figma’s internal culture after its $20 billion sale to Adobe was blocked. When we caught up after his keynote this week, I wanted to hear about his approach to expanding Figma’s suite of products ahead of itsplanned IPO(the latter of which he refused to talk about), how his new approach to integrating AI differs fromlast year’s approach that got Figma in trouble, and how he sees the company’s new products stacking up against the competition. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity: Last year, when you started incorporating generative AI into Figma, there was consternation about it in the industry. It feels like the mood has shifted. Now, people are starting to accept the idea of AI in these creative products. Do you feel that shift? I think that people understand now what the models do, and that’s different from Config 2024, where we had a different approach that was not model-driven, and we didn’t feel it was meeting the mark. Models are useful, and I think that they come with trade-offs. We’re using Claude Sonnet 3.7 in the Make demo. Obviously, it’s modular. We can use other models, and will, in the future. The only thing that’s constant is change when it comes to model development. You cannot necessarily predict from these models what they’ll put out, and if it’ll be something that’s derivative or non-derivative. In your view, does this plug-and-play model approach you’re taking now move responsibility from you to the model provider? We do our best wherever possible to make attributions. For example, if you take a design that’s from the community, and we can detect that it came from the community, we put an attribution link in your code. At the same time, we cannot tell when the model has potentially remembered something. It’s not something we’ve even trained, right? So there’s only so far we can go here. That doesn’t mean that it’s not beneficial to the user. Do you worry about the model providers doing more of what Figma can do? How do you think about your place as an application in an AI world? Looking back at the last decade at Figma, the thing that’s been continually amazing to me is that we truly have been on this exponential curve of how much software is created. It’s basically going vertical. We’re going to see more software created than ever before because of AI. I really believe that design and craft are the differentiator that makes a product and a brand stand out. Can you vibe code or hack your way towards something that makes money? Absolutely. But is it going to be an enduring product? For that, if you have any level of competition, you need to have really good design, a point of view, a great user experience, and a great brand. If you think about all the context that humans have that a LLM does not, I don’t see it being the case that models will get you there all the way. How do you approach the way that Figma expands into new product areas? We see what people are doing in Figma already. Back in 2020, in pandemic times, people were treating Figma like a space to collaborate. We saw tons of brainstorming and ideation. We had to pull that out and make it its own surface because Figma Design is not optimized for brainstorming, ideation, whiteboarding, or diagramming. We saw that 5 percent of the files in Figma Design were slides, so we went and made Figma Slides. I think there’s a lot more inside of Figma, in terms of use cases, that need to be pulled out. Figma Make, which you just introduced, is very broad in what it can do. What’s the goal? We talk a lot about the process of going from idea to product, and that can involve all sorts of different steps. Make spans that whole process. Sometimes you have an idea in your head, and you’re like, “I want to prototype this. I want to get it out there, or I want to use it for myself to iterate and see if it does actually work.” With Figma Sites, are you aiming to compete with Squarespace and WordPress? How deep are you going into web hosting and all that entails? Right now, we’re hosting. You can set a custom domain. Sites have been made in Figma for a long time. You’d have to either go somewhere else to deploy them, or you could code it all up yourself from Figma. Obviously, we hope that Dev Mode can help with that, but if we can get to the point where you can just press the publish button, that seems infinitely better to me for a designer trying to get a site out into the world. I think that’s a pretty distinct use case from the Squarespaces of the world, where, similar to Canva, they are more targeted towards consumers and small businesses. Will you release a mobile app for Figma Buzz, your AI marketing tool? If you do, I could see it more directly competing with Canva. That’s not in our plans right now. I think we are right now focused on making sure Buzz is really high quality for what we’re trying to do on the web, and we can go from there. I have the utmost respect for Canva. The founders are credible. My conceptualization of Canva is more on the consumer and small business side. You’re trying to do something fast. Buzz is focused on brand assets. It’s an enterprise use case. Do you think tools like Buzz will replace digital advertising as it exists today? I think there’s a role for AI in generating marketing assets. In Buzz, you can generate images and you can write text. What I have not seen yet is a world where the models can generate content that a brand team would be really proud of. Maybe that’s coming, but it seems further away than you might expect.

You can also save on the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 and one of the best RPGs of the past year. byBrandon Widder If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Smartwatches have come along way since the first Apple Watch arrived on the scenemore than a decade ago. However, despite how ubiquitous they’ve become, they’re still nowhere near as discrete — or long-lasting — as a smart ring like theSamsung Galaxy Ring. Thankfully, if you’re looking to ditch the watch, Samsung’s first-gen smart ring is available with a $100 gift card atBest BuyandAmazon, where you can pick it up in a variety of sizes starting at $299.99 ($100 off), an all-time low. Samsung’s Galaxy Ring smart ring tracks activity, heart rate, data, sleep, and metrics like menstrual cycles. It doesn’t offer irregular heart rate notifications and sleep apnea detection features, but it’s a discreet tracker that looks chic and comes in black, silver, and gold. In many ways, the Android-only Galaxy Ring is more of an accessory for existing Samsung users than it is a standalone device. It’s not as a capable as theOura Ring 4, our No. 1 pick for thebest smart ring, though it does showcase excellent hardware and comes in wide ranges of sizes, from 5 to 15. Plus, unlike the Oura, the Galaxy Ring provides standard activity and sleep trackingwithoutrequiring you to pay a monthly fee. That’s a boon for anyone with subscription fatigue. In terms of basics, Samsung’s IP68 water-resistant ring can measure your blood oxygen level, skin temperature, heart rate, and track your steps and workouts. That being said, you’ll need a Galaxy phone to leverage all of Samsung’s ecosystem-centric tricks, including the ability to access insights about your quality of sleep and Samsung’s Energy Score feature, which attempts to quantify your fatigue levels. If you own aSamsung Galaxy Watch 7orUltra, you’ll even get several additional days of battery life, thanks in part to the way Samsung’s Health app prioritizes which device’s sensors to pull from. All that is to say that the Galaxy Ring remains best suited for existing Samsung users, rather than those tapped into other ecosystems.

The Supreme Court has not yet reversed its 1935 ruling on whether the president can actually do that. bySarah JeongandTina Nguyen On Friday, Donald Trump abruptly removed the three sitting Democrat appointees on the five-person U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission — the independent watchdog agency that issues recalls and regulates everyday products, including consumer electronics. With no apparent cause for removal, the firings violate existing Supreme Court precedent dating back to 1935, as did Trump’s removals of the Democratic commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) back in March. The firing comes in the wake of a draft budget proposal that would have eliminated the CSPC, whose commissioners are bipartisan by law and who serve five-year terms. The proposal would have instead rolled the commission’s regulatory powers into the Department of Health and Human Services, which is led by a political appointee — presently, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. The Washington Postreportedthat the firings came shortly after the three Democrats on the commission — Richard Trumka, Mary Boyle and Alexander Hoehn-Saric, all Biden appointees — voted to publish safety standards for small lithium-ion batteries used in electric bikes and electric scooters, with the two Republicans voting against it. The report specifically noted that these batteries have a record of catching on fire and “resulting in at least 39 fatalities and 181 injuries nationwide.” The following Thursday, two members of DOGE appeared at the CPSC’s offices. The next day, Trumka and Boyle received letters notifying them that they were fired. Hoehn-Saric did not receive a letter, butaccording toThe Hill,he and his staff found themselves locked out of the building. All three members released statements saying that they planned to appeal their firings to the courts and that Trump had acted illegally. The three members received support from Consumer Reports,which stated in a press releasethat the firings were “an appalling and lawless attack on the independence of our country’s product safety watchdog.” Rather than state a cause for removal, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt once again reiterated the White House’s position that the president “has the right to fire people within the executive branch.” In March, the president fired the Democrats serving on the Federal Trade Commission,another independent agency, in contravention of the longstanding Supreme Court precedent,Humphrey’s Executor, which limits presidential power to remove officers at independent agencies — like the FTC — that have authority delegated to them from the legislative branch. The White House has consistently asserted that the president has the power to fire anyone under him, and Trump’s Department of Justice has announcedits intention to overturnHumphrey’s Executorat the Supreme Court. The new Republican chair of the FTC has also publicly backed this interpretation of the Constitution.Fired FTC commissioners Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoyahave sincesued the administration. The Supreme Court haspreviously signaleda willingness to overturn its own precedent in favor of expanding executive power, but the FTC case has not yet reached the court.Humphrey’s Executorremains the law of the land for now, though that could very well change in the near future. But that only makes it all the more baffling as to why the president is, once again, illegally firing commissioners of independent agencies.

    "article_text": "﻿The agency will reportedly use facial recognition technology to match all travelers’ photos to their passports or other travel documents. ﻿The agency will reportedly use facial recognition technology to match all travelers’ photos to their passports or other travel documents. byGaby Del Valle Customs and Border Protection (CBP) plans on photographing every single person who leaves the US by car, an agency spokespersontoldWired. The agency says it will start using facial recognition technology at official border crossings to match all outbound travelers’ faces to their passports, visas, or other travel documents, though there’s no public timeline for when this will happen. “Although we are still working on how we would handle outbound vehicle lanes, we will ultimately expand to this area,” CBP spokesperson Jessica Turner toldWired. It’s an expansion of the agency’s current practice of photographing travelers as they enter the country and matching those photos with “all documented photos, i.e., passports, visas, green cards, etc,” the agency has on record. CBP has been working on ways totrack people as they leave the USfor over a decade. After two years of lab tests, CBP experimented with collecting travelers’ biometrics at airports in 2016. That year, the agency partnered with Delta Air Lines to photograph passengers boarding a Tokyo-bound flight at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The agency’s collection of outgoing travelers’ biometric data has expanded since then. CBPcurrently uses“biometric facial comparison technology” to process travelers exiting the US at 57 airports, including Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta, Los Angeles International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York — some of the busiest airports in the country. Theairport panopticoncontinues to expand. “We found that facial recognition was intuitive for people. Everybody knows how to stand in front of a camera and have his or her photo taken,” John Wagner, the deputy assistant commissioner of CBP’s office of field operations, said inan agency article promoting CBP’s biometric technologies. “Not so with iris scans and fingerprints. Every time a traveler does the process wrong, someone has to instruct him or her the right way to do it.” Collecting passengers’ fingerprints may be less intuitive than taking their pictures, but CBP does that, too. Agents stationed at airports across the country use a handheld device called Biometric Exit Mobile to take certain travelers’ fingerprints before they board their flights. Those fingerprints are then run against law enforcement databases. If CBP’s role is to process people for entry into the US, why track people on the way out?Wirednotes that biometric databases could be used to monitor self-deportations. Having realized that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) lacks the resources to arrest, detain, and deport each and every one of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US, President Donald Trump is encouraging undocumented immigrants to leave the US on their own,offering people $1,000 if they leave the country voluntarily. But CBP was devising ways to collect travelers’ photos, fingerprints, and other biometric data long before Trump took office. The agency says it collects this data to run people’s biometrics against law enforcement databases, therefore ensuring that people with criminal records are removed from the US. The agency’s promotional article touting its biometric technologies includes a “success story” involving a Polish couple who had “criminal histories with multiple identities” caught leaving the US under false names. SinceDHS’s formation in the wake of the September 11th attacks, immigration enforcement has blurred the lines between criminal enforcement and national security. Every international traveler is a potential criminal or terrorist, justifying mass surveillance. Trump didn’t invent this playbook. But his mass deportation agenda is getting a helpful boost from decades of bipartisan turbocharging of the surveillance state.

    "article_text": "The man who hopes to become Sonos’ next permanent CEO talks about the app, the now-canceled video player, subscriptions, Google, and more. The man who hopes to become Sonos’ next permanent CEO talks about the app, the now-canceled video player, subscriptions, Google, and more. byChris Welch It’s my final day atThe Vergeand Vox Media after over 13 years. And as luck should have it, I was able to wrap up my tenure here by interviewing Tom Conrad, the interim CEO of Sonos. I’ve covered this company more extensively than any other, and as our readers know, Sonos has been through the ringer over the last year — in a mess of its own making, to be clear. But over the last several months, Conrad, a Sonos board member since 2017, has kept the company laser-focused on a turnaround effort with frequent app improvements and bug fixes. With successful stints at Pandora, Snap, and elsewhere, Conrad has deep software roots. (Yes, he was also the chief product officer at Quibi.) So on Friday, I threw my most pressing questions at the man who clearly hopes to become thepermanentCEO of Sonos. We covered some of what I know Sonos’ Reddit community is likely curious about and other topics that seemed timely, and I came away encouraged about the company’s odds of getting back on track. The below interview is lightly edited for length and clarity. Tom Conrad, it’s great to finally meet. This week, you announced that theSymfonisk partnership with Ikea is no more. Talk about what led to that choice. You seem pretty keyed into the Sonos community, so I’m sure you saw some of the disappointed reactions. These speakers were great. And Sonos doesn’t have a $99 speaker in its lineup, which Ikea offered, and that seems important. What led to that decision in your mind? You know, we put that partnership together eight years ago. And honestly, it’s been on sort of a slow trajectory to its end for years. One of the big things that I’ve done in my first 116 days is to try to catalog all of the things that the company is doing and to prioritize and to focus us on doing an appropriate number of things exceptionally well. I think every great company has to have that kind of focus. There are a number of things that we’ll be focused on going forward and a handful of things that we won’t. And to be honest, I think the wind down of the Ikea partnership was relatively easy to contemplate because, while on paper the price points that you’re talking about and so forth make a lot of sense, in practice, the scale of that business was quite small. Do you see Sonos filling that gap in the future in regards to unique form factors? Or do you think this is it as far aslampandpicture frame speakersgo? What I’m focused on is delivering high value, differentiated products. And so you take something likethe Era 100, which is just like, clearly the best in class sort of speaker that you can buy in that price category. And since I arrived, webrought the price of that downfrom $249 to $199, which we think is really a magic spot for delivering something that’s completely differentiated in the market, has tons of value that builds over time, and is a great gateway into the platform. We also have Roam, which is often discounted down to $139 or less, as another way to come into the Sonos experience. Obviously we have to talk aboutthe app situation. It’s been one year. You were on the board for the whole time. I’ve talked to many people who were like, “They knew. They knew and they shipped it anyway.” So what measures are in place now where anyone at the company can say, “Hey, there’s a problem here. We need to pause.” What have you learned? Let’s see. Let’s talk about what we knew just briefly. I think that there were three or four kind of things that were problematic about the launch of the new version of the platform. The first couple, I would call them the mistakes that we knew we were making. We knew that there were some features that we were gonna roll out in incremental — what we intended to be fast-follow releases. Add the alarm clock, add snooze, do better with accessibility. And the company made a… made a decision to launch and to sort of do that incrementally over time. “We should’ve had a mechanism to roll back.” Second thing is, anytime you make a set of user experience changes, you know that there’s going to be some fraction of your audience that doesn’t like them. And this is like a universal truth of software, and I think the company, because we’d done a bunch of work in the usability setting, was convinced that — oftentimes companies convince themselves of this — that it was for the greater good and we would sort of get through to the other side. I think the third mistake was one that we just didn’t understand. And that was that, obviously, in the real world, the product had material performance and reliability issues. Just to be completely concrete about it, if the company had known, we never would have shipped it. No reasonable team would have shipped it. You can critique us for not knowing, but it’s not like we intentionally launched understanding we would have the in-the-field performance issues we did. And the last thing is, we should’ve had a mechanism to roll back. And for a variety of reasons, it took us a while to figure out the depth of the problem, and by the time that time had passed, we couldn’t. We have spent a year righting the ship. And we made good progress, I think, by the end of last year — and I think we’ve made really dramatic progress in the last 120 days. How so? What’s changed? One of the things is the work that we’ve done to reorganize the team and to put exactly the right people and capacity and focus on, not just the app codebase, but also the whole platform (player software, the cloud) has allowed us to unlock some of the more lingering, esoteric issues that remained. So the release that’s making its way to our customers right now — new version of the apps, new version of the player software — is beginning to get at some of those lingering issues, which I’d put into two categories. There’s a category of issues that are particularly tied to the Play:1 and Play:3, which are 13- and 11-year-old architectures at this point. It’s sort of amazing to think that the iPhone in market when the Play:3 launched was the iPhone 4. Its halo feature was it had a selfie cam for the first time. So a lot has changed in tech since we shipped the Play:3, but fully a third of our households still have players from that generation that they love and they want to work, and we’re doing the hard work today of making sure that they have a great experience. This release that’s launching right now dramatically improves on the experience that they’ll have. In fact, quantitatively the experience is better than it was on those devices four years ago. So, far before the app itself. But we’ve got a bead on another set of enhancements that’s gonna take us even further over the spring and summer. And then the second category of lingering issues is… I talk to a lot of people on social. I talk to a lot of people who show up in my inbox. And their issues today, truly, I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say, 100 percent of the time come down to one of two things: an older player or some kind of esoteric networking reality in their home. Unfortunately, they often report (rightly), “My network’s great. I have no problem with anything else. It’s just Sonos.” And the the root cause there — and I don’t want to suggest this isn’t our problem to solve — but the root cause there is the only infrastructure in their home that wants to talk on their local network at very low latency in a sort of mesh is Sonos. Everything else is like point-to-point to the internet. Your Apple TV, it goes to the internet and gets something back. Even your Nest thermostats. They don’t talk to each other. They talk to the internet, you know? They talk to the cloud and get their settings and all that. But Sonos, because it’s this like, real-time experience that needs to keep you know, music synchronized to the millisecond, needs volume latency that’s real time… all of your devices are kind of constantly talking to one another and staying synchronized on the local network. “These are problems that maybe 1 percent of our households have. But 1 percent of households is 150,000 people, and apparently they’re all on Reddit.“ And that means that if… what’s a good example? You’re a Comcast customer. You’ve got Comcast Wi-Fi. You don’t like your Comcast Wi-Fi that much. You go to Best Buy and you buy a bunch of Eeros and you bring them home and you set them up. And in the process of setting them up, you give them the same SSID as your old network, but you don’t turn off the Wi-Fi on your old network. Now you have two networks, and the same name, and the same password. Things power bounce, and cycle and get updates and all the rest of it. And half your Sonos speakers come up on your old network and half come up on the new network. They can’t talk to each other at all. The app is on one of the two networks; it can only see half of them. It seems completely chaotic because of that, the real solve there is to turn Wi-Fi off in your Comcast router. And look, part of the promise and magic of Sonos is that our customers shouldn’t have to be network administrators. But some of the problems that we see commonly today come down to issues that we need to help them troubleshoot on their local network. We have a bunch of things in progress today that will put the power back in our customers’ hands to sort of understand what’s going on in their network in a more sophisticated way. I don’t mean to overstate this. These are problems that maybe 1 percent of our households have. But 1 percent of households is 150,000 people, [laughs] and apparently they’re all on Reddit. One casualty, so to speak, of all this wasthe Sonos Ace headphones. They arrived at the worst possible time alongside the overhauled app that blew up and fell apart. Sales early on were not great. Have you seen signs of that turning around? How do you save the Ace? Because they are really good headphones, but they just kind of got sidelined by this whole situation. I’m really committed to Ace. I think it’s a fantastic product, and thank you for the compliment. Out of the gate, for us to deliver battery life, transparency, noise canceling, and comfort that we did relative to the competition, I’m really proud of. I think you’re right that the cloud of the app missteps impacted Ace. I’m excited about continuing to innovate in that space both through hardware and software. I think there’s a lot we can do with software experiences to further differentiate Ace from other things in the market. In time, we’re gonna get back on our footing with respect to the software quality. At the highest level, it’s not that complicated. I want the same thing that you want, Chris: I just want it to work. You launch the app, it quickly gives you access to your content, you start something playing back, and you’re done! I have no ambition for people to spend their life in the Sonos app fidgeting with esoteric failures. And all of that’s within our grasp — increasingly so. We’re getting back to that, and then we can get back to the business of creating these innovative, differentiated experiences. Speaking of software, let’s talk about paywalls and subscriptions. That’s one topic that your customer base is very antsy about. I’ve heard that a few years ago, Sonos came very close to putting advanced features behind a paywall. How does Tom Conrad feel about subscriptions? Do you promise to keep all the core Sonos functions free? I think you’d be hard-pressed to find existence proof that in hardware land, customers respond well to… theheated seats in my BMW require a monthly subscription. Or, the poor Logitech CEO who justspeculated in your publication that maybe there’ll be a subscription mouse someday. And somewhere, right this second, they’re still getting taken apart in a Reddit thread about that. “We’re not going to put grouping behind a paywall.” So while it’s certainly true that Sonos continues to deliver new, incremental value to customers over time — sometimes a decade after they had a financial transaction with us — I think it’s kind of the life we’ve chosen, Chris. That’s not to say that it’s impossible that we wouldn’t have some kind of ongoing financial relationship with our customers. But, we’re not going to put grouping behind a paywall. That’s all I wanted to hear, basically. So, I’m not sure how much you want to talk about a product that, uh, didn’t technically existand then theoretically got canceled. But there was obviously a ton of speculation about video for a while with Sonos. Pinewood. So, I’d imagine that was canceled because you want to focus on the app for now. But how do you feel about video in 2025? Is that still somewhere you see Sonos going in the future, or is it a case where, for as long as you can see, top-tier audio products are the focus? I mean, you’re right, that I don’t really want to talk about hypothetical products that may or may not have been canceled. You’re also right to say that part of the leadership perspective I brought to the company is this idea that we need to be focused on things that we can be really exceptional and differentiated at. Insofar as things that we are not focused on anymore, it’s really through that lens of prioritization. And I think that’s really helped the company. People inside Sonos care deeply about our customers. It’s a little hard to see that in a year where we stumbled so badly. But the toll of letting our customers down the way we did last year was really palpable in the company when I had my first day 116 days ago or whatever it was. Part of what I think added to the despair was this sense that they were struggling to understand “what are our priorities? How are we going to get all this done? How can I be confident that I’m showing up every day contributing to something that matters?” It’s not an exaggeration to say that there were dozens of initiatives and programs fractionally invested in when I came in the door. And one of the things I did right away was to inventory that work and prioritize it against a set of strategic perspectives of where we could be really differentiated in the world and take it down to a smaller number. And so now, we’re working on, it’s literally 11 sort of lanes of execution, which isn’t to say 11 products. Sort of 11 themes if you like, with well understood, dedicated teams to each. Each responsible for their own sort of prioritization and perspective about where to take that avenue. In addition to making great progress on restoring performance and reliability for our customers, I think it’s this renewed sense of focus that’s brought the company to a renewed sense of optimism and energy. I’m not sure if you know any Sonos employees. But if you did, I hope that you’re hearing from them that we’ve turned a bit of a corner in that regard. I wouldn’t say, you used one word that I’ll correct. I wouldn’t say that the changes we made were so we could focus on the app so much. We certainly have a bunch of exciting, innovative hardware expressions of Sonos that we continue to work on. But it is the case that… I think there’s this funny kind of debate of “is Sonos a hardware company or is Sonos a software company?” Almost as if those are the only choices. I think, truly, we are a platform company. In fact, we might be in our customers’ homes, truly, the third compute platform. They have a personal computer, they have a phone, and then they have a mesh of Sonos compute that we can do things with. And as a platform company, there is a really important software component. And I think in a way, if you look at the last six or seven years, we entered portables and we entered headphones and we entered the professional sort of space with software expressions, we weren’t as focused as we might have been on the platform-ness of Sonos. So finding a way to make our software platform a first-class citizen inside of Sonos is a big part of what I’m doing here. Sonos customers are super adamant about wanting to make their own surround sound speaker configurations. That was apparently going to be part of the appeal of said product that may or may not have been canceled. It seems like you’re dropping some teases on Reddit about some new stuff coming soon. Can you talk about that? What’s to come as far as letting people take more control over their system and use whatever speaker for whatever purpose they want? I certainly think it’s a really interesting lane of innovation and sound expression in home theater. If you talk to Giles Martin, our sound experience architect, he will tell you that the best theater experiences… he says they’re like a mullet, where there’s like a lot that happens kind of behind you and and what happens in front of you is a more focused expression. And so, while the sort of very traditional view of home theater is some satellites on either side on the left and the right and some stuff behind you, that can be a little bit of a trap about this idea of putting too much in front of you on the left and the right. And so we’re really focused, yes, on listening to the kind of feedback that you get in places like Reddit about traditional 5.1 expression. But we also want to do it in a way that really does add to the sound experience and not just the psychology of that cohort. So, stay tuned. Fair enough. Let’s talk about Google. You’re still in court cases with them. Do you want to fix that relationship? Do you see them as a valuable partner when it comes to voice and eventually AI? How do you see that playing out in the coming months and years? You know, we continue to work through that complicated relationship. I don’t know that I have a lot to say there. We do have some cases that are pending and getting ready to go into their next phase. I would love to find… I would love to see them express energy that they want to come out the other side of this. But it’s sort of up to them. What’re you most excited about over your next 100 days? You want to be the next permanent CEO, is what I’ve gathered. I do. I do. The board has a fairly immense responsibility here to run a thoughtful process and make sure they find the best person in the world to be the next CEO of Sonos. And so I’m just kind of letting that process play out. I know they have a slate of remarkable candidates, and in the end, I hope that it’s me. But what I most hope for is that they find truly the best person in the world to do the job. I do think that one difference between an interim CEO and a permanent CEO is, an interim CEO’s mandate is mostly to focus on the short and medium term. You know, getting the team aligned to execute with clarity and purpose for the next, call it 18 months or two years. I think, on the day that the board asks me to be the permanent CEO, it will be fun to be able to unlock my perspective on where we go in the next five and 10 years. I’ve got a bunch of big ideas about that, but they’re a little bit on the shelf behind me for the moment until I get the go-ahead. Last question. This is my last interview atThe Verge, so thank you for the time. You said this week that for the balance of 2025, software is going to be your focus. But let’s teasesomethinghere. Is Sonos done with hardware for 2025? Sonos is done with hardware for fiscal 25, which runs through the end of the third calendar quarter. I’ll just say this: we had a chance to talk to the company about the software and hardware roadmap for the next 18 months recently, and the word that came back to me from the company is, it’s the most excited they’ve felt about Sonos in years. So while I can’t wait for the moment where we can begin to express that longer-term vision that I was hinting at, I’m also really excited about what we’re going to do for our customers over the course of the next 18 months or so.

    "title": "15 states sue over Trump's move to fast-track oil and gas projects",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 9, 2025 / 5:34 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Over a dozen largely Democratic states are suing President Trump's administration over his efforts to fast-track energy projects, saying the administrationis bypassing environmental protection laws. Mr. Trump issued anexecutive orderdeclaring a \"national energy emergency\" on the first day of his presidency — part of Mr. Trump'spush to expandU.S. oil and gas production. The order urges oil and gas expansion through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allows the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity. Those kinds of steps are supposed to be reserved for actual emergencies, such as projects needed in the aftermath of disasters like hurricanes, flooding or major oil spills, the attorneys general wrote in the lawsuit filed in Washington state Friday. But now, the 15plaintiff states allege, agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Interior are bypassing required reviews under federal laws like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. The states argue an improper permitting process \"will result in significant and irreparable harm to state natural and historic resources and the people and biota that rely on those resources for drinking, farming, recreating, and habitat.\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers pushed back on the lawsuit in a statement to CBS News. \"The President of the United States has the authority to determine what is a national emergency, not state attorneys or the courts. President Trump recognizes that unleashing American energy is crucial to both our economic and national security,\" Rogers wrote. The attorneys general who are suing the government said they believe reliable and affordable electricity is of critical importance to the nation, but energy production is already at an all-time high. \"The Executive Order is unlawful, and its commands that federal agencies disregard the law and in many cases their own regulations to fast-track extensive categories of activities will result in damage to waters, wetlands, critical habitat, historic and cultural resources, endangered species, and the people and wildlife that rely on these precious resources,\" they wrote in the lawsuit. \"The shortcuts inherent in rushing through emergency processes fundamentally undermine the rights of States,\" the attorneys general said, noting that the federal Clean Water Act grants states the right to protect water quality within their own borders. They want a federal judge to declare the executive order unlawful and bar the agencies from pursuing emergency permitting for non-emergency projects. \"Just another unlawful directive from the President, this time acting well beyond the scope of his emergency powers,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said in a statement announcing the suit. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Chinese exports plunge as U.S. retailers cancel orders over tariffs",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 9, 2025 / 5:16 PM EDT/ CBS News Chinese exports to the U.S. plunged in April, as steep tariffs on China make it too costly for many U.S.-based retailers to import goods from the country. President Trump ratcheted up his trade war with Beijing in April, hiking tariffs on Chinese goods to up to 145%. China retaliated with 125% levies on Americans goods. As a result, shipments of goods from China to the U.S. in April dropped 21% compared with the same period one year earlier,datareleased Friday from China's General Administration of Customs shows. Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by the same amount, according to the April data, demonstrating how Mr. Trump's tariffs are already upending trade patterns. On Friday, Mr. Trump said in a post on his social media site Truth Social that the levies on China could come down to 80%.The lower rate \"seems right,\"wrote the president, ahead of U.S.-Chinatrade negotiationsset to kick off this weekend in Switzerland. While lower than the 145% tariffs currently in place, 80% levies would still make importing goods from China prohibitively expensive for many U.S.-based businesses. Many consumers, meanwhile, are unlikely to affordprice hikesfrom steep tariffs at a time when they are alreadysqueezed financially. Some business owners say they are skipping orders they would normally have already placed with Chinese factories, as they wait and see where tariff rates on China and other countries settle. Mr. Trump in April announced a bevy of country-specific tariffs, which he later placed on hold — with the exception of those on China — for90 days. A 10% tariff in place on all imports to the U.S. remains in effect. Businesses say the 10% baseline tax is a challenge, but far easier to absorb than duties over 100%. April's shakeup in the flow of goods around the world comes as many retailers rethink their supply chains, and some take steps toreduce their reliance on China, with steep levies in place. Meanwhile, Chinese imports from the U.S. dropped more than 13% compared with April 2024. Beijing could bring down its 125% retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods, if trade negotiations between the two countries progress this weekend. UBS analysts expect U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to settle at around 34%, \"as a more constructive tone and the start of high-level talks in Switzerland suggest both sides are open to deescalation and further negotiation,\" said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer of global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a research note. Capital Economics' China economist Zichun Huang added that U.S. tariffs inflict minimal harm to China, as exports to other countries in Asia offset the decline in shipments to the U.S. Megan Cerullo is a New York-based reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics.

    "title": "Why the U.S-U.K. trade deal may not be as good as it sounds",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 9, 2025 / 5:13 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump on Thursday hailed his newtrade pact with the U.K.as a \"maxed out deal\" that will serve as a template for agreements with other nations. But some experts are taking a dimmer view, noting that the U.K. agreement suggests high tariffs are set to remain in place for the long term. Although the deal with Britain offers some concessions, a 10% tariffremains in place on U.K. imports. Mr. Trump unveiled that baseline levy, which serves more broadly as a minimum import tax on other nations, as part of his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" announcement. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Friday that the president is \"committed to the 10% baseline tariff, not just for the United Kingdom, but for his trade negotiations with all other countries as well.\" While a 10% tariff rate is lower than some import duties Mr. Trump imposed onother nations last month, ranging from a high of 145% for China to 11% for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it's still far higher than the effective tariff rate of 3% prior to the second Trump administration,accordingto the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a nonpartisan policy think tank. Paring Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs to 10% could offer some relief for U.S. businesses and consumers facing higher costs. But it still represents a major headwind for importers, which pay the duties on goods and then pass on all or most of the cost to consumers, economists say. \"Even with a slow rollout of trade deals over the coming months, you're still going to have an effective average tariff rate that is going to be in the double-digit range,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What that means for businesses is that they're simply going to be paying more for the same goods that they have been importing, and they're going to be raising prices onto customers that have much less ability to withstand ongoing price increases.\" That, in turn, could cause Americans to tighten their wallets, a serious risk given that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 cents of every $1 in economic activity. Businesses that are stressed by tariffs could slow hiring, leading to a pullback in household income growth, Daco said. The deal with Britain is \"a modest improvement over what we had yesterday, but — with most U.S. tariffs still in place and very limited new U.K. liberalization — remains worse than the pre-Trump status quo,\" Scott Lincicome, Cato Institute vice president of economics, said in an email. The economic stakes for U.S. trade talks are high, with economists raising thechances of a recessiondue to fallout from Mr. Trump's trade war. The stock market tumbled andU.S. Treasury prices slidin the days immediately following the president's April 2 tariff announcement, underlining investor concerns that a trade war could torpedo economic growth. Stocks closedmodestly higheron Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the newtrade agreementwith the U.K. While Wall Street has largely rebounded since then on growing investor optimism that the Trump administration will soon strike new trade deals, many Americans are souring on Mr. Trump's policies. In arecent CBS News poll, 53% of those surveyed said they believe the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only 41% approved of the Trump administration's tariffs. Even as the U.S. tries to negotiate additional trade agreements, businesses continue to face significant risks, economists note. These stem from the ongoing uncertainty over the ultimate level and duration of tariffs, making it hard for companies who depend on trade to make plans on spending, hiring and their supply chains. \"Even if this tariff is lower, this fundamental anxiety related to uncertainty and unpredictability\" remains,\" said Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"If this is not resolved or addressed, then I think it'll be difficult for consumers, investors and business to fully recover.\" Even so, some experts note that the Trump administration's efforts to strike new trade deals could provide some relief to investors and businesses, as long as there's growing clarity about where the tariff policies could settle. \"Now, at least the wheels are in motion relative to discussions with a variety of countries, with the deal between the United States and U.K. as perhaps indicative of the fact that there could be tariff and trade-related de-escalation — even without a fully drawn out trade agreement,\" noted Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Capital Management. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration is \"focused on the big countries,\" although he added that negotiations could drag out. \"The president doesn't want to go fast,\" Lutnick said. \"He wants to do the kind of deal we did today, where we said, 'Look, this is just a win for America,' and we figured out how to make it a win for them.\" The U.K. is a fairly modest trading partner for the U.S., representing about $65 billion in annual imports, or less than one-tenth of annual imports from China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators this weekend in Switzerland, and Mr. Trump signaled that he's open to lowering tariffs on the nation's goods from its current 145% level. \"80% Tariff on China seems right!\" the presidentwroteFriday morning. But that might not be enough to cushion the U.S. from the headwinds of higher tariffs, according to experts. \"Even if we were to see a continuation of the universal 10% tariff applied and some rollback of higher levels, or in the case of China, 145%, we're still talking about a tariff rate that is the highest since World War II,\" Luschini said. \"And so it's going to have an impact at some form.\" Aimee Picchi is the associate managing editor for CBS MoneyWatch, where she covers business and personal finance.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 9, 2025 / 1:52 PM EDT/ CBS News The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Friday it has approved the use of three color additives from natural sources for manufacturers to safely use in food. The move comes amid growing concerns about thehealth effects of food dyes, which has led to action at state and national levels. Last month, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.called on companiestophase out all petroleum-based dyesby the end of next year. Earlier this year, aWest Virginia lawannounced it's plan to ban seven artificial food dyes — one of the most comprehensive statewide bans of its kind. The food dye industry has denied any safety concerns with artificial dyes. The International Association of Color Manufacturers previously said in a statement that artificial dyes are \"essential for consistency, visual appeal, and consumer trust in food products.\" In anews release, Kennedy called the latest natural food color approvals \"a major step to Make America Healthy Again,\" a nod to his\"MAHA\" slogan and movement. \"For too long, our food system has relied on synthetic, petroleum-based dyes that offer no nutritional value and pose unnecessary health risks,\" he said. \"We're removing these dyes and approving safe, natural alternatives to protect families and support healthier choices.\" While the administration's goal is to replace petroleum-based dyes with natural alternatives in the U.S. food supply, the FDA has stopped short of an outright ban. Instead, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told reporters last month that the agency will be accelerating the review and approval of some new natural color additives. Here are the latest \"natural\" color additive options, which includes one new approval and two existing approvals that have been expanded: Galdieria extract blue is a blue color derived from a species of microalgaeGaldieria sulphuraria,theFDA said, adding it can be mixed with \"authorized food-grade carriers and antioxidants\" to stabilize the color. The color has been approved for use in a variety of beverages, including fruit and vegetable juices, fruit and dairy-based smoothies, flavored milks, yogurt drinks as well as milk-based meal replacements. Galdieria extract blue has also been approved for use in certain foods, including breakfast cereal coatings, hard and soft candy, chewing gum, flavored frostings, ice cream, frozen dairy desserts, frozen fruits, water ices, popsicles, gelatin desserts and puddings and custards, as well as dairy and non-dairy creamers and whipped toppings. Butterfly pea flower extract, another blue dye that can be used to to achieve purples and greens, was already approved for use in several foods ranging from soft drinks to chewing gum. It is produced through water extraction of butterfly pea plants' dried flower petals. The latest approval expanded its use to cereals, crackers, snack mixes, pretzels and chips. Calcium phosphate, which the FDA actually describes as a \"synthetically prepared powder,\" is a white color approved for use in ready-to-eat chicken products, white candy melts, doughnut sugar and sugar for coated candies. The compound was already listed by the agency as \"generally recognized as safe\" for use as a nutrient or ingredient in food. Alexander  Tincontributed to this report.

    "title": "FedEx board member selected as next USPS postmaster general",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 9, 2025 / 12:03 PM EDT/ AP David Steiner, a former CEO of the nation's largest waste management company who currently serves on the FedEx board of directors, is poised to take over control of the U.S. Postal Service, becoming the nation's 76th postmaster general. The announcement of Steiner's appointment, which drew immediate concerns from postal unions over possible efforts to privatize the USPS, was made Friday by Amber McReynolds, chairperson of the USPS' Board of Governors, during a meeting of the independent group that oversees the service. \"We anticipate that Mr. Steiner will join the organization in July, assuming his successful completion of the ethics and security clearance processes that are currently underway,\" McReynolds said. Friday's announcement by the the Board of Governors comes as President Trump and his adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have raised the idea of privatizing the nearly 250-year-old Postal Service, which has faced financial challenges amid a changing mail mix and other issues. The choice of Steiner has been seen by the postal unions as a harbinger for possible privatization of some or all of the venerable quasi-public institution, which is largely self-funded and has a mission to serve every address in the country — nearly 167 million residences, businesses and post office boxes. Postal unions have held protests throughout the country over potential privatization, job cuts and possibly ending the universal service obligation. Brian L. Renfroe, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said Steiner is not just any executive from the private sector but someone who sits on the board of one of the Postal Service's top competitors. \"His selection isn't just a conflict of interest — it's an aggressive step toward handing America's mail system over to corporate interests,\" Renfroe said in a statement. \"Private shippers have been waiting to get USPS out of parcel delivery for years. Steiner's selection is an open invitation to do just that.\" Renfroe's union represents 205,000 active city letter carriers and around 90,000 retirees. Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents more than 220,000 USPS employees and retirees, likened the appointment of Steiner to a fox guarding a hen house. \"FedEx has a very different agenda than the public postal service. And they're a major competitor of the United States Postal Service,\" he said. \"I'm not talking about any attributes of an individual, but to me, that's the last type of person you will put in charge of the public institution as the anchor of the mailing package industry in the country.\" Steiner, who will leave the FedEx board, said in a written statement that he admires the public service mission of the USPS and called it \"an incredible honor to be asked to lead the world's greatest postal organization.\" \"I believe strongly in maintaining its role as an independent establishment of the executive branch,\" said Steiner, who served as CEO of Waste Management Inc. from 2004 through October 2016. In a written statement, McReynolds called Steiner \"the right person to lead the Postal Service at this time to ensure this magnificent and historic organization thrives into the future.\" \"Dave is a highly regarded leader and executive with tremendous vision, experience and skill that can be applied to the long-term mission and business needs of the Postal Service,\" she added. \"Our Board looks forward to working with Dave as he takes on the core mandates of providing universal and excellent service for the American public and doing so in a financially sustainable manner.\" The Postal Service is in the midst of a 10-year modernization and cost-cutting plan that began in 2021 under PostmasterLouis DeJoy, who resigned in March. The plan is an attempt to stop losses at the agency, which has a budget of about $78 billion a year and is mostly self-funded, including through stamps and packages. Known as \"Deliver for America,\" the initiative has received markedly mixed reviews. While postal officials contend it has led to major efficiency improvements, some members of Congress have criticized it for leading to mail delays, unsustainable postage increases and declines in business. Besides privatization, there's also been talk of possibly moving the USPS under the control of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The choice of Steiner was first reported by The Washington Post. © 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 9, 2025 / 12:01 PM EDT/ AP Trump administrationfunding cutsand a loss of federal workers who help support wildland firefighting continues to make planning for the upcomingwildfire seasona challenge, according to forest and fire officials in Washington state and Oregon. The biggest issue they're facing is a lack of communication from the federal government as the West faces \"a pretty significant wildland fire season,\" Washington State Forester George Geissler said Thursday during a press conference hosted by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. \"This is the time when we make certain that we have the aviation we need, when we have the personnel we need and that all of our systems check out and are ready to go when the alarm bell rings,\" he said. \"Without knowing what our partners are doing or not having a clear understanding of what actions are being taken, we struggle with missing the third leg of the stool that we have.\" The Forest Service workforce was cut in February duringElon Musk's push to reduce federal spendingas part of the Department of Government Efficiency, known asDOGE. At least 1,000 National Park Service workers were let go. A court order to rehire fired workers, along with a public outcry brought many workers back to their jobs, but Murray and fire officials say it wasn't enough. Plus, the lost of experienced, trained workers set the process back. \"We're hearing that don't worry, we are going to hire frontline people,\" Murray said. \"You just let a whole bunch of frontline people go.\" A spokesperson with the Department of Interior, which oversees National Parks and other public lands, said \"funding is not in jeopardy.\" They're supporting firefighting efforts by increasing pay for federal and tribal wildland firefighters across the U.S. The administration has refused to release the exact number of fired and rehired workers, but numbers are coming in from individual forests, she said. \"I've heard of at least 35 people at Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, 46 at Okanagan-Wenatchee, 21 at Colville, 15 at Gifford-Pinchot, and more at the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, Olympic National Forest and Methow Valley,\" she said. \"Here's the thing, nearly every single Forest Service employee supports fire operations in some capacity.\" Fire Chief Leonard Johnson, with the McLane Black Fire Department in Washington state, said they may line up aviation support and heavy equipment, but it takes trained firefighters to put the fires out. \"We have a high reliance on that workforce out there,\" he said. \"Not only at the local level, at the state level, but at the federal level to make our wildfire season successful to deal with those large fires. People are the critical component in all of this.\" Merkley said Trump's budget proposal cuts forest and watershed management programs that improve forest conditions, eliminates a collaborative forest landscape restoration program and slashes 2,000 National Forest positions, on top of the thousands who left through early retirement, buyouts and layoffs. Most of those workers may not have the title \"firefighter\" but they all hold Red Cards - which shows they have special training to provide essential frontline support to firefighting crews, Murray said. \"In fact, around three quarters of forest service workers are trained in wild land firefighting,\" she said. \"They provide crucial surge capacity when a crisis strikes.\" Trail maintenance crews ensure the paths are clear for firefighting personnel and equipment, Murray said. Biologists conduct testing to make decisions about prescribed burns and fuel reduction planning. \"We are here today to pull the fire alarm, and we're gonna set off some sirens,\" she said. \"We're going to keep focused on this, and we are gonna keep pushing back. There is just too much at stake to do anything less.\" © 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

    "title": "White House is 'actively looking at' suspending due process for migrants, top adviser says",
    "article_text": "Top Trump adviser Stephen Miller told reporters Friday that the administration is “looking at” ways to enddue process protectionsfor unauthorized immigrants who are in the country. “The Constitution is clear, and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended at a time of invasion. So I would say that’s an action we’re actively looking at,” Miller said in the White House driveway. “A lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not,” Miller said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on whether he was referring to a specific group of people who've entered the country illegally, or all the people who have. It also did not comment on what he meant by the courts doing “the right thing.” In his remarks, Miller maintained that the courts don't have jurisdiction in immigration cases. “The courts aren’t just at war with the executive branch; the courts are at war, these radical rogue judges, with the legislative branch as well too. So all of that will inform the choices the president ultimately makes,” he said. President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced frustration about constitutional due process protections slowing down his efforts at mass deportations. “I was elected to get them the hell out of here, and the courts are holding me from doing it,” he said in an interview with Kristen Welker that aired Sunday on NBC News' “Meet the Press.” Welker pointed out theFifth Amendmentof the U.S. Constitution says “no person” shall be “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law” and that theSupreme Court has long recognizedthat noncitizens have certain basic rights, but Trump complained that those protections take too much time. “I don’t know. It seems — it might say that, but if you’re talking about that, then we’d have to have a million or 2 million or 3 million trials,” he said, adding that some of the people the administration wants to deport are “murderers” and “drug dealers.” Welker then asked if he needs to uphold the Constitution. “I don’t know,” Trump replied. “I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.” Aclause in the Constitutionsays due process protections can be suspended during an invasion: “The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" Trump claimed the U.S. was being invaded back in March, when he invoked the rarely used Alien Enemies Act to send alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to a prison in El Salvador. The proclamation said the gang “is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.” Three federal judges in different states have found the gang's criminal activities aren't tantamount to an invasion. The Supreme Court has not weighed in on the invasion issue, but held in a ruling last month that the people the government wanted to deport areentitled to due process. “AEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,”the ordersaid. Inan essayfor the National Constitution Center, attorney Neal Katyal and then judge - and now Supreme Court justice - Amy Coney Barrett wrote that, \"A suspension is temporary, but the power it confers is extraordinary. When a suspension is in effect, the president, typically acting through subordinates, can imprison people indefinitely without any judicial check.\" The writ of habeas corpus, according to that essay, has been suspended four times before, including throughout the country during the Civil War. The last time was in Hawaii after the attack on Pearl Harbor.",

    "article_text": "Police in Worcester, Massachusetts, held a young girl's face to the ground as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained her mother on Thursday, video shows. The footage, captured byTelemundo Nueva Inglaterra, shows an ICE agent and police officer chasing after the girl, before three more officers surround her and the ICE agent backs away. The four police officers then bring the girl to the ground, with at least one grabbing her legs and forcing her to lose her balance, the video shows. Two women, one of whom is holding a newborn baby, then can be seen trying to help the girl. The teenage girl is screaming throughout the entirety of the incident, the video shows. The mother-daughter pair, another relative and a newborn baby were about to get into a vehicle when they were intercepted by ICE agents,neighbors told NBC Boston. The neighbors said the girl held to the ground was 16-years-old. It is unclear what the immigration statuses are of the individuals involved in the incident. ICE did not immediately return a request for comment on the incident. In Massachusetts, state law generally prevents local police from assisting ICE with immigration enforcement. The Worcester Police Department defended their conduct in a lengthy statement on Thursday. Officers were dispatched to the scene \"for a report of  federal agent who was surrounded by a large group of about twenty-five people,\" the department said. It added that officers also received a call from an individual \"saying that ICE officers were on scene and refusing to show a warrant to the crowd.\" Police said that when they arrived, they witnessed a \"chaotic scene,\" with federal agents placing a woman under arrest and trying to leave with her in a vehicle. \"The crowd was unruly, and several people were putting their hands on federal agents and Worcester officers in an attempt to keep the vehicle and the arrestee from leaving,\" the police said. \"Worcester officers attempted to deescalate the situation and keep everyone safe.\" Police said that as the vehicle tried to pull away with the detained woman, a juvenile girl holding a newborn baby stood in front of the car. \"As the vehicle moved away, she ran after the vehicle and kicked the passenger’s side of it,\" police said. \"It appeared that she was going to run in front of the moving vehicle, and officers took her into custody.\" Police said the juvenile girl was later charged with reckless endangerment of a child, disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. They added that another woman was arrested for pushing officers and throwing an unknown liquid substance on them as they tried to arrest the girl. The woman, who police identified as 38-year-old Ashley Spring, was charged with assault and battery of a police officer, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, disorderly conduct and interfering with a police officer, according to police. Spring did not immediately return a request for comment. Worcester Mayor Joseph M. Petty said in a statement on Thursday night that he was \"deeply disturbed\" by the incident. \"Simply put, we cannot have this happen in our community,\" he said. Petty added that his office was not notified by ICE about the detainment and that he asked the city manager for a full report about the incident.",

    "article_text": "A girl recovering from a rare brain tumor celebrated her 11th birthday Sunday, hundreds of miles away from everything she's known — her friends at school, her community at church, her home. She's one offour U.S. citizen children who were sent to Mexicofrom Texas three months ago when immigration authoritiesdeported their undocumented parents. Fearing for their safety after the mixed-immigration-status family was taken to an area in Mexico that's been known for kidnapping U.S. citizens, they haven't given up on being able to return to the U.S. — primarily to continue the girl's medical treatment. On Friday morning, the family is traveling to Monterrey to meet with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. They hope  that sharing their immigration plight motivates legislators to advocate for their return under humanitarian parole, according to a family representative. “Pressure from the public about the deportation of vulnerable United States citizen children really is effective, and members of Congress are answering that call,” Rochelle Garza, president ofthe Texas CivilRights Project, the legal advocacy and litigation organization representing the family, told NBC News on Thursday. Democratic Reps. Adriano Espaillat of New York and Sylvia Garcia and Joaquin Castro of Texas are set to meet with the family, according to a spokesperson from the Texas Civil Rights Project. “It’s important that the public continue paying attention to this but also continue engaging and encouraging members of Congress to take action,” Garza said. Thegirl’s motherfirst told NBC Newsabout thefamily’s ordealin March. The case got the attention of several other congressional lawmakers, including Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Alex Padilla of California as well as Rep. Al Green, D-Texas. Since then,five other similar cases, includinga mother who was deported to Honduraslast month with her two U.S. citizen children, one of which is a4-year-old boy with Stage 4 cancer, have become public. “It would not surprise me if this were much more systemic than what we are currently seeing,” Garza said. The mother previously told NBC News that on Feb. 3 the family was  driving from the Rio Grande Valley, Texas, area where they lived to Houston, where their daughter’s specialist doctors are based, for an emergency medical checkup. On the way there,they stopped at a stateside immigration checkpoint, one they have passed through multiple times. The parents were equipped with letters from their doctors and lawyers to show the officers at the checkpoint. But immigration authorities arrested the parents after they were unable to show legal immigration documentation. According to their attorney, Daniel Woodward, other than lacking “valid immigration status in the U.S.,” the parents have “no criminal history.” He added the parents were in the process of obtainingT visas, a temporary immigration benefit for victims of human trafficking. Five of their children, ages 15, 13, 11, 8 and 6 — four of whom are U.S. citizens — were with them when they were arrested. The parents and the children were taken to a detention facility, where they spent 24 hours before they were placed in a van and dropped on the Mexico side of a Texas bridge on Feb. 4. NBC News is not publishing the family members’ names for safety reasons. Attorneys for the family fileda complaintwith the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in March requestinga probe into abuses they say the family faced in U.S. detention. In the filing, they also requested immigration authorities grant humanitarian parole to the undocumented parents, the girl and one of her siblings. But that DHS office, which protected the civil rights of both immigrants and U.S. citizens,was dismantledshortly after the attorneys filed the complaint — forcing them to refile it with the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services. They have not yet received a response. A DHS spokesperson previously told NBC News that reports of the family’s situation are “inaccurate” and declined to speak on the specifics of the case, citing privacy reasons. They said in a statement that when “someone is givenexpedited removal ordersand chooses to disregard them, they will face the consequences.” In response toa similar but separate caseinvolving the removal of U.S. citizen children in connection with their mother’s deportation, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Thursday: “The narrative that DHS is deporting American children is false and irresponsible reporting,” adding that immigration authorities ask mothers if they wish to be removed with their children or if they want the children to be placed in the safe custody of someone the parent designates. McLaughlin added that undocumented parents can “take control of their departure” by using the CBP Home app, theTrump administration’s self-deportation app. Speaking from Mexico in March, the mother of the 11-year-old said ina video message in Spanish provided to NBC Newsthat she and her husband, when they were detained, “faced the worst decision, an impossible one, to be permanently separated from our children or to be deported together.” When undocumented parents of U.S.-born children are picked up by immigration authorities, they face the risk of losing custody of their children. Withoutpower-of-attorney documents or guardianshipsoutlining who will take care of the children left behind, the children can go into the U.S. foster care system, making it harder for parents to regain custody of their children in the future. Just after her birthday, the girl had her first medical checkup in Monterrey this week. Denisse Molina, a humanitarian outreach coordinator at the Texas Civil Rights Project, said it took her “two exhausting days, countless phone calls, and being bounced between hospital departments” to secure a medical appointment and schedule an MRI for the girl. “No one—especially a child in need — should have to fight this hard just to access essential care,” Molina told NBC News in a statement Thursday. While this temporary solution is bringing the family some relief, regular medical checkups are critical, according to the child's mother and the family's advocates. The child was diagnosed withthe brain tumor last yearand underwent surgery to remove it, the mother said after learning of the diagnosis through translators. But Woodward said that since contacting the girl’s doctors and obtaining her medical records in the family’s pursuit to obtain humanitarian parole, she found out the cause of the tumor was an “unnamed ‘novel’ condition.” Few medical specialists can effectively monitor these kinds of cases; the girl's U.S. doctors are among those with the necessary expertise. The girl needs scans and checkups every three months, her doctors told the Texas Civil Rights Project. The surgery that saved the girl’s life last year left her with some lasting side effects. The swelling on her brain is still not fully gone, her mother said in March, causing difficulties with speech and mobility of the right side of her body. Before the family was removed from the U.S., the girl was routinely checking in with doctors monitoring her recovery, attending rehabilitation therapy sessions and taking medication to prevent convulsions. In Mexico, the family has been able to enroll four of their children in school while they get ready to apply for humanitarian parole later this month at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. According to theUSCIS website, applicants may demonstrate urgency by establishing a reason to be in the U.S. that calls for immediate action, including critical medical treatment, or the need to visit, assist or support a relative who is ill. “Our hope is that members of Congress will learn about this particular case and support our request for humanitarian parole for the family,” Garza said.",

    "title": "The U.S. now has two world leaders. They could not be more different.",
    "article_text": "VATICAN CITY — The U.S. now has twotop-level leaderson the global stage — and there is evidence to suggestPope Leo XIVwill cut a stark contrast with President Donald Trump. TheChicago-born pontiff, 69, is known as a humble moderate who used his first papal words to urge building “bridges.” Seen as aspiritual successor to the late Pope Francis, Leo was echoing his predecessor’s refrain of building “bridges not walls” — a themeFrancis used to openly criticizethe Trump administration. As Cardinal Robert Prevost, Leo also criticized both Trump and Vice President JD Vanceon social media. As recently as February, he shared a headline saying that Vance, who is Catholic, was “wrong” to suggest Christians should prioritize loving their countrymen over foreigners. And like Francis, Leo has expressed deep sympathy for migrants, the poor and those affected by the climate crisis. He has shared the late pope’s support for appointingwomen to senior Vatican roles— and his resistance against going all-out in support of female ordination. And he has similarly advocated for an inclusive church that reaches out to other faiths and cultures. On the other hand, he has not followed Francis’ relative support for LGBTQ+ communities, lamenting in 2012 how TV shows “benignly and sympathetically portrayed” same-sex couples, according toa report by The Arlington Catholic Heraldat the time. The lock-in secrecy of the conclave means we don’t know why the 133 cardinal electors voted for Leo by at least a two-thirds majority. And scholars are divided about how the decision should be interpreted. For Steven Millies, a professor of public theology at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, it’s an unambiguous repudiation of the Trump administration. “The cardinals took a side: This new pope will stand against this 21st-century variety of authoritarianism we see getting underway in the U.S. and in too manyother parts of the globe,” Millies told NBC News. “To choose an American while a second Trump administration isdeporting,disappearing[people] anddisruptingto such an alarming extent, again, is a message.” Asked for comment about these criticisms, the White House directed NBC News toward a social media post in which Trump said it was a “great honor” to have an American pope and that he looked forward to meeting him, and one from Vance saying he was “sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the church.” Millies likens the cardinals’ choice to the conclave of 1978, when they selected a Polish pontiff in John Paul II, “from behind the Iron Curtain,” he said. “The cardinals were taking a side — they aimed a new pope at the Soviet Union.” Others are less sure about the conclave’s intentions. “Either they’ve chosen an American because they think it sends a message that he stands up to Donald Trump and offers an alternative vision of American leadership, or they’ve chosen him despite the fact that he’s American,” said Miles Pattenden, a historian of the Catholic Church at Britain’s University of Oxford. “It would seem to me to be rather sensational if they picked him just because he was American and could stand up to President Trump,” he added, if nothing else because Trump’s term is brief compared with a potential papal lifetime. Whatever the cardinals’ reasoning, they have elected a pope whose personality is night and day to Trump’s brusque persona. Leo is “a quietly confident person, not a flashy personality,” Bishop Robert Barron of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota, told NBC’s “Nightly News” on Thursday. These are qualities that few, including Trump’s most ardent supporters, would attribute to the president. Even the new pope’s name carries hints he may oppose Trump’s worldview. The last pontiff to take this name was Pope Leo XIII, who in his 25-year papacy, from 1878 to 1903, advocated for social justice and workers rights against the nascent forces of capitalism. “The pope is not going to agree with anything Trump is saying,” said Bill Ciotti, 63, from Boston, who before he retired was responsible for planning liturgy at his church. Ciotti was staying in Rome, a 10-minute walk from the Vatican, with his friend Bill Champlin, a priest at St. Leo Parish in Leominster, Massachusetts. When they saw white smoke billowing on TV while eating dinner, they got up and ran to St. Peter’s Square. “He’s already criticized Trump and Vance, so I think it’s going to be a major clash,” Ciotti said Friday. Politically, Leo is “not going to be real far left and he’s not going to be real far right,” his brother John Prevost said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. But he is widely seen as continuing the program that Francis started, which was disliked by many conservative U.S. Catholics. “I do think one of the dark horses, and unfortunately one of the most progressive, is Cardinal Prevost,” former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who is Catholic and strongly opposed Francis’ platform, said before Leo was elected. “I think it’s pretty shocking given the contempt in which they hold the American church.” He added that “my understanding is Prevost is one of the closest to Francis ideologically.” Ultimately, believers and nonbelievers alike will have to wait and see how the Trump-Leo era plays out. “Our God is a God of surprises,” said Cesar Jaramillo, 35, a canon lawyer from Paterson, New Jersey, who has lived in Rome for eight years. “The foresight that the Holy Spirit has shown in allowing Leo the opportunity to lead during a very turbulent time, that is a good sign.”",

    "title": "The Windy City celebrates 'Da Pope'",
    "article_text": "DOLTON, Ill. — The newest Roman Catholic shrine in America has three bedrooms, two baths, a finished basement and used to be the home of newly elected Pope Leo XIV. A day after the Vatican shocked the world by electing Robert Francis Prevost, a Chicago-born cardinal who spent most of his career in Peru, to be the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church, pilgrims have started trickling to the brick bungalow on East 141st Place in suburban Dolton to see where he grew up. Bob and Susan Castagna drove over from St. John, Indiana, to see the pope's old home. “I grew up in a house like this,” Bob Castagna, 77, a lawyer who has worked for the church and is originally from New York, said as he looked at the bungalow. “This fills my heart with joy.” “It's a magnet,” said Susan Castagna, 76, who said she grew up in Oregon. “We just want to come someplace that is close to the person who is so close to Jesus, so close to God.” Marilyn Awong, who lives in Dolton, also described the house as a “magnet” and said the current owner even allowed her to look inside. She said he confided that his wife was pregnant and carrying a boy. She said she suggested he consider naming him Leo. “It’s really awesome to know this house is in Dolton,” Awong said. “It’s really positive for the village.” Donna Sagna, who lives next to the home, set up a speaker with solemn Italian prayer music to welcome pilgrims into a place that has newly become sacred for Catholics around the world. \"My idea is to support the people that come in the community to connect with God in some kind of way,\" Sagna said. She credits the power of her prayers for why \"I was pulled into being close to the pope.\" Sagna and Awong said that for a community fighting to overcome high crimes rates and recover froma political scandal involving local officials,having this connection to the pope brings them hope. \"It used to be violent over here, even in the pope's house. But we prayed and we prayed and you know, it's better now. It's better now,\" said Sagna, who also put a cross outside the pope's house with the faces of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Michael Brown and five other Black people whose killings rocked the nation and sparked national debates over police brutality and racial injustice. \"I'm honored that I'm able to be a testament. I can tell everybody about my prayer life and how great God is,\" Sagna added. Watching all the unfolding devotion was Louis Prevost, one of Leo’s older brothers, who told NBC News on Thursday that he was still “almost speechless.” “It’s just mind-blowing that my brother was elected pope,” he said. “We’ve kind of always known he was special. We used to tease him about being pope when he was 6 years old.” John Prevost, the pope's other older brother, said he jokingly told his kid brother to watch the movie “Conclave” so he would know how to behave. “I wanted to take his mind off of it, laugh about something, because this is now an awesome responsibility,” he said. Back in the '60s, the future pope and his family attended St. Mary of the Assumption Parish on 137th Street, which was then a busy church and school that straddled the Chicago-Dolton border. Now it's a collection of abandoned buildings — physical reminders of the challenges Leo faces to revive a church that has been hit hard by the sexual abuse scandals and has beenlosing active worshippersfor decades in the U.S. Leo was born on the South Side of Chicago and the Windy City media was quick to celebrate their 69-year-old native son, and do so in Chicagoese. “DA POPE” blared the headline of the Chicago Sun-Times, the tabloid of record in this sprawling city of nearly 2.7 million people on Lake Michigan. Meanwhile, famed Chicago street food purveyor Portillo's introduced a new Italian beef sandwich to honor the new pope. DubbedThe Leo, it features “the holy trinity of peppers—sweet, hot, or a combo.”",

    "title": "Leo XIV is the first Augustinian friar to become pope",
    "article_text": "The election of an American as pope is being recognized as ahistoric choice, butChicago-born missionary Robert Prevostrepresents another notable departure from pontiffs of the past. Prevost, 69, is the first Augustinian friar to become pope, theVatican News reported. \"The fact that the pope is from the Augustinian order is the most surprising thing for me,\" Charles Gillespie, an assistant professor of Catholic Studies at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut, said Friday. \"It's extraordinary, and it's been rare for a reason.\" Prevost, who took the name Leo XIV after being elected Thursday to guide the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, had assumed several leadership roles within the CatholicOrder of St. Augustine. The order, formed in the 13th century and based on the writings of Augustine of Hippo, a theologian who lived in modern-day Algeria, is smaller compared to other religious communities within the church. It has about 2,800 members in 47 countries, and sponsors just two universities within the United States: Villanova near Philadelphia, which Prevost attended, and Merrimack College in Massachusetts. Friars of the Augustinian order typically stand out in hooded black habits made of wool. Rather than being cloistered in a monastery, they live a mendicant lifestyle, in which they go out into the community and rely on charitable kindness, Gillespie said. “They place a real, prayerful emphasis on the heart, and the beauty in the world as it connects with God,” he added. An Augustinian friars’ purpose is to serve with humility within their communities. Until Leo, it was unlikely that a member would be called on to leave the order and take on a larger responsibility in the upper echelons of the Catholic Church, much less become pope, Gillespie said. The largest male Catholic order is the Jesuits, withabout 16,000 membersworldwide and more than two dozen higher education institutions in the U.S. Notably, Prevost's predecessor,Francis, was the first Jesuit— and first from Latin America — to become pope. Historically, popes have not been associated with any specific religious order, but instead have been former priests who've ascended the church's hierarchy from diocesan seminaries and parishes. Before Francis, the last pope from a religious order was Gregory XVI, a Benedictine Camaldolese monk who was pope from 1831 to 1846, according toAmerica magazine, a Jesuit publication. \"I cannot help but reflect on what his Augustinian papacy will mean to our University community and our world,\" the Rev. Peter Donohue, president of Villanova,said in a statement. \"Known for his humility, gentle spirit, prudence and warmth, Pope Leo XIV's leadership offers an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to our educational mission.\" In 1977, the year that he graduated from Villanova, Prevost joined the Order of St. Augustine. He would go on to be ordained as a priest in 1982 and then sent to an Augustinian mission in Peru in 1985. Upon returning to his hometown, Chicago, in 1999, Prevost was promoted within the order's ranks until Francis elevated him as a bishop in Peru in 2015, and eventuallyrising to a cardinal in 2023. One of his last jobs before becoming pope was in Rome, running the office that helps decide who will be appointed a bishop. Martin Luther, who in the 16th-century would reject Catholicism and become central to the Protestant Reformation, was a former Augustinian friar. Gillespie said given Pope Leo's background, he is certain to follow in Francis' footsteps when it comes to being a moral voice focused on unity, humanity and understanding social issues. \"With Augustinians, there's going to be a real sense that our political involvements and spiritual commitments can't be in separate lanes,\" he said. \"They're about responding to the world, how we organize our social lives, and knowing it's centered out of God's love.\"",

    "title": "Pope Leo XIV's 'godly' path from Chicago to the Vatican",
    "article_text": "For centuries, the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church were largely Italians until a cardinal from Poland was elected pope in 1978 and then succeeded by a German and an Argentine. Now, for the first time,the pope's an Americanwho has taken the name Leo XIV. And he's from the South Side of Chicago, home of the beleagueredWhite Sox, the Daley political dynasty and, until they decamped for Washington and eventually the White House, Michelle and Barack Obama. The new pope, who has spent much of his career ministering in Peru and leading the Vatican’s powerful office of bishops, was born Robert Francis Prevost on Sept. 14, 1955, at what was then called Mercy Hospital, at the corner of South Prairie Avenue and 34th Street. But while Prevost made his debut in Chicago, his parents and two older brothers were already living just south of the sprawling city in a working-class suburb called Dolton. Home was a tidy brick house the Prevosts bought new in 1949 on East 141st Place. Prevost's father, Louis Prevost, served in the Navy during World War II and worked as a superintendent of schools in the south suburbs of Chicago. The future pope's mother, Mildred Martinez Prevost, was a librarian with a master's degree in education and two sisters who were nuns. But the focus of the family was St. Mary of the Assumption Parish on 137th Street, which was then a busy church and school that straddled the Chicago/Dolton border. It was there that the Prevost family regularly attended Mass, which back then was still in Latin. And it was there that his classmates realized that Robert was already practicing what he would one day be preaching. “We used to pray with our hands, you know, our fingers pointing to heaven, and after a while you get tired of doing that, and you just want to fold them over,” former classmate Marianne Angarola, 69, toldthe Chicago Sun-Times. “Robert Prevost never folded his hands over. He was just godly. Not in an in-your-face way. It was part of his aura, like he was hand-selected, and he embraced it. And he wasn’t weird. He was nice.” While most of the boys from St. Mary's went on to local Catholic high schools like Mendel College Prep, Prevost left home and attended St. Augustine Seminary High School, a boarding school in Holland, Michigan, that was run by priests from the Order of St. Augustine. Upon graduating, he headed east to Villanova University in Pennsylvania, a private Catholic college, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in math in 1977. By then, he had found his calling, and in 1978 he officially joined the Order of St. Augustine. Four years later, in June 1982, Prevost was ordained a priest after having studied theology at Catholic Theological Union of Chicago. Then he was off to Rome, where he earned a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical College of St. Thomas Aquinas in 1987. He returned to Chicago, but only briefly, before he was dispatched in 1985 to Peru, where he served the order as a missionary and taught canon law in the diocesan seminary in the city of Trujillo for 10 years. By 1999, Prevost was back in Chicago and appointed leader of the Augustinian order's Midwestern region, which he oversaw until 2010. Part of his turf included Providence Catholic High School in New Lenox, and it was during his tenure that allegations surfaced that the school’s president, the Rev. Richard McGrath, had abused at least one student and kept child pornography images on his phone. The Sun-Timesreported last Junethat the Augustinians paid a $2  million settlement to the abused student and that Prevost never explained why he did not remove McGrath from his post. By 2014, Prevost was back in Peru after Pope Francis appointed him apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Chiclayo and later the bishop of Chiclayo. But in Peru, he was once again accused of failing to investigate and punish a priest accused of sexually abusing three sisters from 2007 to 2015. The Diocese of Chiclayo denied a cover-up, and Prevost has never been personally accused of abusing members of his flock. The allegations also did not derail his rise through the ranks. Francis promoted him to archbishop in January 2023 and made him a cardinal a year later. In public statements, Prevost often echoed Francis with calls for “reaching out to the poor, to the neediest, to those on the margins.” But while Francispromoted greater acceptance ofLGBTQ people, Prevost in a 2012 took a less tolerant tone in an address to a group of bishops, complaining that Western culture was fostering \"sympathy for beliefs and practices that are at odds with the gospel,\"The New York Timesreported. Meanwhile, Prevost's other job running the office that helps decide who will be appointed a bishop made him a contender for the top job at the Vatican, which he landed Thursday. Speaking in Spanish and Italian, but not in English, Pope Leo stood on the balcony overlooking his cheering flock and thanked the pope who blazed the path for him. He also laid out a vision of the future that Francis would most likely have applauded. “We can be a missionary church, a church that builds bridges, that is always open to receive everyone — just like in this square, to welcome everyone, in charity, dialogue and love,” he said.",

    "title": "An isolated John Fetterman clashes with colleagues and staff as he skips his Senate duties",
    "article_text": "In the run-up to the vote to confirm Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., knew her party had a problem — and its name wasJohn Fetterman. Fetterman, the Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, was open to confirmingPresident Donald Trump’s embattled pick, according to two people familiar with his thinking. Murray wanted to speak with her colleague one-on-one. So she reached out to set up a time. But Fetterman refused, as the two people familiar with the episode told NBC News. “He figured that she wanted to yell at him about it,” one person familiar with the senator’s thinking said. That Fetterman wouldn’t even talk to one of the most senior members of his party — someone who is well-respected in the caucus and, like Fetterman, has a reputation for being a straight shooter — was emblematic of the way Fetterman has operated in the Senate. This article is based on interviews with 18former Fetterman staffers, Pennsylvania officials and congressional lawmakers and staffers, many of whom said the senator is increasingly isolated and absent from official business, both in Washington and his home state. His behavior has received renewed scrutinyafter a recent New York magazine articledetailing concerns about his mental health from one of his closest former aides, as well as some frustration from Democrats that Fetterman is not on the same page as many other members of the party when it comes to standing up to Trump and his agenda. The crux of the article focused on a May 2024 letter from Fetterman’s former chief of staff, Adam Jentleson, addressed to Dr. David Williamson, the senator’s neuropsychiatrist at Walter Reed Medical Center, where Fetterman spent six weeks in 2023 to treat clinical depression. In that letter, which NBC News obtained, Jentleson expressed worry that if his boss “stays on his current trajectory he won’t be with us for much longer.” “We do not know if he is taking his meds and his behavior frequently suggests he is not,” Jentleson wrote. “We often see the kind of warning signs we discussed: conspiratorial thinking; megalomania (for example, he claims to be the most knowledgeable source on Israel and Gaza around but his sources are just what he reads in the news — he declines most briefings and never reads memos); high highs and low lows; long, rambling, repetitive and self-centered monologues; lying in ways that are painfully, awkwardly obvious to everyone in the room, such as swearing up and down that he didn’t say something everyone heard him say a few minutes prior.” A Fetterman spokesperson emphasized that the senator has no intention of resigning and has been transparent about his health, whether related to his stroke or hospitalization at Walter Reed. \"People in his circle and people who talk to him privately know this is John Fetterman,\" the spokesperson said. \"He is not an extrovert. This is how he functions. He does care about Pennsylvania, he keeps a busy schedule, he’s meeting with people all the time. For the most part, he votes along party lines and has good relationships with his colleagues.\" \"There are expectations of a stereotypical politician that he has never once expressed that he was going to try to be,\" this person added. \"People knew he was breaking from tradition and they elected him for that reason.\" On Tuesday,Fetterman saidthat the New York magazine article was built on “one source” with “a couple anonymous sources,” describing it as a “hit piece from a very left publication.” Fetterman added Friday to NBC News that the article \"decided to platform a grudge fashioned by best friends and disgruntled staffers unwilling to put their names on it.\" \"My actual doctors and my family affirmed that I’m in good health,\" he said. In response to Fetterman’s earlier pushback, Jentleson said on Tuesday, “I stand by what I said and hope he gets the help he needs.” The incident with Murray wasn’t the only recent run-in with a colleague. As he was leaving the cloak room after ultimately voting against Hegseth’s nomination, he bumped into Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. Shaheen, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wanted to discuss a Republican bill designed to punish the International Criminal Court for issuing arrest warrants to Israeli officials. Two sources familiar with the exchange said Fetterman was “rude and dismissive” to her. He also suggested to her that he’d be more inclined to help her if she put him on the committee — something she didn’t have the power to do. Fetterman ended up being the only Democrat to support the Republican bill, which did not pass. Murray and Shaheen’s offices declined to comment. \"Senator Fetterman has lots of conversations with his colleagues, on both sides, and he doesn’t comment on those discussions,\" a Fetterman spokesperson said. \"He highly respects and values Vice Chair Murray and Ranking Member Shaheen and considers them great colleagues and leaders.\" Fetterman never had a warm and fuzzy reputation. As mayor of Braddock — a downtrodden once thriving steel town just outside of Pittsburgh— and then lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania, Fetterman became known for his straight-talking style, fearless social media persona and unconventional image for a Democratic politician. Fetterman won election to the Senate in 2022. But his race was beset by challenges — chiefly, a debilitating stroke that kept the Democratic nominee off the trail for months. Still, Fetterman and his team were able to connect with voters. They ran an intensive social media campaign to portray Fetterman as an authentic Pennsylvanian against the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, who had only limited ties to the state and is now a health official in the Trump administration. But those familiar with Fetterman say he has often neglected the duties of his job since being elected, rarely making appearances for noncampaign events in his home state, regularly missing committee hearings, bill mark-ups and votes. In the past year — from April 2024 to this March — Fetterman missed 77 of 381 votes,according to GovTrack. That put him in the 90th to the 99th percentile among all senators in terms of total votes missed during each three-month stretch of the calendar in that time. Of senators who served the entirety of the 118th Congress, only Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and then-Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio,missed more votes than Fetterman— and both were either running for president or on Trump’s ticket as his running mate. Of course, many of those missed votes included the six-week stretch when Fetterman was hospitalized. Fetterman also rarely attends hearings or business meetings for the three committees on which he’s a member. In just this year alone, Fetterman skipped 25 of the 26 hearings or business meetings the Senate Commerce Committee held, with the first hearing he attended being on Thursday, after the New York magazine article was published. He missed all nine of the hearings and business meetings the Senate Homeland Security Committee has held this year, and skipped all 11 times the Senate Agriculture Committee has met in 2025. Among the meetings he missed were confirmation hearings for key Trump nominees like Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. Fetterman has also voted by proxy — meaning the ranking member of the committee announced his vote because he was absent — for every vote all three committees have taken this year on pieces of legislation, nominations or organizing resolutions. In a comment for this article, Fetterman did not address missing so many committee hearings but said of votes last year: \"Everything in 2024 was about the election.\" \"I spent months traveling Pennsylvania to help keep Democrats in the White House,\" he said, adding that so far this year he has \"made roughly 90% of the votes\" while the ones he has missed \"were overwhelmingly procedural, my vote was never determinative and limited to travel days.\" On his lack of in-state events, a spokesperson said this year's Senate schedule \"has given few opportunities for extensive travel in the state since January.\" He's also sought time to spend with his family. \"In the coming spring and summer months when the Senate is in recess, there will be more opportunities for in-state events,\" this person said. That hasn't been enough for some in the state. In March, Cumberland County Democratic Chair Matt Roan called for Fetterman to resignin an op-edthat blasted the senator for having “refused to hold town hall meetings in Pennsylvania to hear from his constituents.” “Enough is enough,” Roan wrote, adding, “He seems disinterested in serving in this important position.” Additionally, a House Democratic lawmaker from Pennsylvania who spoke with NBC News on Thursday said they have had no interactions with Fetterman in recent months. “I haven’t seen him this year in person,” the lawmaker said. “My staff reaches out on bills and such.” They added that Democrat Bob Casey, who lost re-election to the Senate in 2024, was “a much, much more active partner.” According to the Philadelphia Inquirer,Fetterman has appeared publicly just oncein the state this year, at the Pennsylvania Farm Show in January. Fetterman hasn’t been known to glad-hand or build relationships with many of his fellow members. Even among the Keystone State’s congressional delegation, where members frequently need to coordinate on issues like infrastructure projects and natural disasters, Fetterman has been absent. “The entire delegation has talked on Signal about how he’s just so weird, never ever returned phone calls from any of us (nor did his former chief),” said a participant in the Pennsylvania delegation’s Signal group. “Pretty sure he couldn’t identify most of us out of a line-up.” The opinion wasn’t unanimous, though. “My team and I have a good working relationship with the Senator and his team,” Rep. Chris Deluzio, D-Pa., who represents a district near Fetterman’s home, said in a statement. “That’s important across the PA delegation and can help us get stuff done for our region.” Still, some who spoke with NBC News worried whether Fetterman is having cognitive struggles that may be exacerbating his isolation. The House Democratic lawmaker from Pennsylvania expressed concern over the New York magazine article, saying that if there’s an issue, it “needs to be addressed and can be addressed.” “He successfully did that once before and he should,” this person said, pointing to 2023, when Fettermanchecked himself into Walter Reed National Military Medical Centerfor mental health treatment. “It’s not like he was ever the warmest, most fluid speaker in the world. So you’re starting with someone who’s got an atypical personality.” But Jentleson said he saw a decline in the strength of Fetterman’s relationships after that episode. In his May 2024 letter, he said the senator “is on his phone constantly and spends more time scrolling and coming up with tweets than any other activity.” “He is isolated and has damaged his personal relationships,” he added. “In the fall, he had started to build relationships with other senators, but that has fallen off a cliff. He comes up with reasons why they are all out to get him or secretly hate him, and will launch into endless tirades about why they are all terrible and he is the only sane person.” Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., however, said he had dinner with Fetterman and Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., two weeks ago. He saidFetterman “was doing pretty well”and described him as “a special talent in our party” who “has a way of speaking to everyday folks that really connects.” “Now, he went through an incredible health event, and it takes ongoing care,” Welch told NBC News. “I have no knowledge of it, but you don’t have to know much to know that that’s an ongoing challenge, and I want to be there to support him as much as I possibly can.” After his stroke, Fetterman received praise from across the political spectrum for openly sharing his struggles and destigmatizing them. “People hear all their lives about ‘I can’t get out of bed,’ and you really can’t understand what that really means,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press” in December 2023. “You can’t get out of bed until it happens to you. And it did.” But the vibe around Fetterman has shifted as an increasing staff exodus trailed him since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack in Israel. Fetterman has vociferously defended Israel’s conduct in Gaza in the months since, becoming one of its stalwart defenders in Congress and alienating much of the left-wing support base that championed him in his 2022 primary. At the same time, while being a consistent Democratic vote, he has moved rightward in some of his rhetoric and approach. He was the only Democrat to visit Trump at Mar-a-Lago during the transition and voted in favor of a number of his Cabinet choices, including Attorney General Pam Bondi. When Democrats released a resolution in January to condemn Trump’s pardons of supporters who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, Fetterman, who later signed onto the resolution, described it as a “performance art” vote. “I don’t know if it was a communication breakdown or because I wasn’t aware of it, or they were sandbagging me, but I love it,” Fetterman said sarcastically of the resolution. “I do. We need more performance art votes, because that’s really been very helpful before the election.” In an interview with NBC News shortly after Trump’s win in November, Fetterman said Democrats needed to stop “freaking out” over everything Trump does. His favorability numbers tell the story.In an Economist/YouGov surveyreleased this week, with a margin of error of +/- 3.2 percentage points, Fetterman’s favorability stands at 34% with voters who backed former Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. With Trump voters, it’s 39%. Voters who hold unfavorable views are flipped, with 39% of Harris voters and 34% of Trump voters viewing Fetterman unfavorably. As for his openness to confirming Hegseth, who facedan allegation of sexual assault that he denied, Fetterman’s view was framed around a disdain for “cancel culture,” according to one person familiar with his thinking. Among a few rationales he floated, the senator repeatedly questioned why Democrats were willing to accept former President Bill Clinton — who has faced allegations of sexual misconduct — and Jay-Z,who faced allegations of sexual assaultat the time, this person said. (Jay-Zsued his accuser in Marchfor allegedly falsifying her claims after she dropped a lawsuit against him.) “He went on some rants about that,” this person said. Asked about his consideration of Hegseth, Fetterman emphasized that his vote on the nominee \"was NO.\" \"Considering a vote is a feature of a senator, not a bug,\" he told NBC News. A spokesperson added that Fetterman \"expects his staff to disagree with him on things.\" \"That’s normal,\" this person said. \"But airing grievances publicly hurts the staff and puts their work in jeopardy.\" Some have defended Fetterman in recent days — including on the political right. Salena Zito, a conservative journalist based in Pennsylvania who interviewed Fetterman and Sen. Dave McCormick, R-Pa.,together in February,tweetedthat after spending time with him then and reading the New York magazine story, “My only conclusion to come to is that someone is looking for redemption for having worked for him because he wasn’t left enough and they are trying to destroy him.” Three Republican senators —McCormick, along withChuck Grassleyof Iowa andTom Cottonof Arkansas — tweeted support for Fetterman Friday. “It’s time to put politics aside and stop these vicious, personal attacks against Senator Fetterman, his wife, and his health,” McCormick wrote. “While we have many differences, we are both committed to working together to achieve results for the people of Pennsylvania and make their lives better.” Cotton said Fetterman was a \"decent and genuine guy\" and claimed the \"radical left is smearing him with dishonest, vicious attacks because he’s pro-Israel and they only want reliable anti-Israel politicians.\" Publicly, members of Congress who have weighed in have stood by Fetterman, and no one has called for him to resign. Privately, both detractors and allies don’t think he will step down anytime soon. One House Democrat from Pennsylvania said they know Fetterman well and have spent time in his office, never seeing anything odd. This person believes he is fit to serve. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was among those who voiced support for Fetterman. “He’s doing a good job, and he’s a good legislator,” Schumer said. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro,who has had a volatile relationshipwith Fetterman, offered only brief remarks Thursday on the senator. “I’ll just say this: I think the best judge of Sen. Fetterman’s health is Sen. Fetterman and his family, andI’ll leave it to them to discuss that,” Shapiro said, per the Philadelphia Inquirer. A former Fetterman staffer said the question of whether Fetterman should continue to serve should come down to whether he is doing his job. “Are you meeting with constituents?” this person said. “How are those meetings going? What’s your schedule like? Are you missing lots of votes? Are you in committee hearings? Are you for these Trump nominees? Are you doing things in the state? Are you visible? Are you accessible? You run down the list, and the answer to those things is like, ‘no.’” “I think it’s connected to his mental health,” the former staffer continued. “He’s so isolated and very clearly so miserable being in Washington, D.C. The job feels like an imposition to him, and he’s not doing it. Pennsylvania doesn’t have two senators right now.”",

    "title": "U.S. spy agencies told to gather intelligence on Greenland",
    "article_text": "U.S. officials have ordered spy agencies to ramp up efforts to gather intelligence on Greenland, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter, in a sign President Donald Trump apparentlyremains focused on acquiringthe island. The directive was first reported byThe Wall Street Journal. The move has drawn objections from Denmark, a NATO ally which rules the semi-autonomous island. Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, has said he will summon the American ambassador over the report. “It worries me greatly because we do not spy on friends,” Rasmussen said, according to the Ritzau news agency. The Office of the Director of Intelligence sent out a directive last week to intelligence agencies to gather information on Greenland’s independence political movement, perceptions about U.S. interest in the island’s resources and to identify people who back Washington’s goals for the Arctic island, the sources said. The directive came in the form of a “collection emphasis message, ” which sets priorities for intelligence efforts, the sources said. James Hewitt, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said in an email: “We don’t comment on matters of intelligence. However, the President has been very clear that the U.S. is concerned about the security of Greenland and the Arctic.” The director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, alleged in a statement that government officials were trying to undercut Trump by leaking classified information. “The Wall Street Journal should be ashamed of aiding deep state actors who seek to undermine the President by politicizing and leaking classified information,” the statement said. “They are breaking the law and undermining our nation’s security and democracy. Those who leak classified information will be found and held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.” Gabbard added: “I have referred three illegal leaks to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, and we are investigating nearly a dozen more.” It was unclear why the administration was turning to espionage to glean information on a U.S. ally that could likely be obtained by diplomats or open-source research, said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former career CIA officer. “This seems to be something that could be handled by diplomatic and State Department channels,” he said. “Why would you waste precious intelligence resources on this?” In an interview last weekend with NBC News’ Kristen Welker, Trumprefusedto rule out seizing the territory by force. “I don’t say I’m going to do it, but I don’t rule out anything,”Trump said. “We need Greenland very badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we’ll take care of, and we’ll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.” In a speech to a joint session of Congress in March, Trump said: “One way or the other, we’re going to get it.” A Januarypollcommissioned by the Danish newspaper Berlingske and Greenlandic daily Sermitsiaq showed 85% of Greenlanders do not want their island to become a part of the United States. The U.S. military has a base in northwestern Greenland, which is part of a ballistic missile early-warning system. Greenland has taken on increasing strategic importance as global warming has sparked a competition in the Arctic among the world’s powers. And Greenland’s rare earth minerals, uranium and iron are of increasing global interest as climate change could make those natural resources more accessible.",

    "title": "Trooper fired over Karen Read investigation handled case with 'honor and integrity,' his supervisor says",
    "article_text": "The conduct of a former Massachusetts state trooperwho was fired over his handlingof the Karen Read murder investigation took centerstage at her retrial this week as defense lawyers spent hours grilling the ex-officer’s supervisor. Massachusetts State Police Sgt. Yuri Bukhenikacknowledged that he wasalsodisciplinedover misconduct allegations linked to Michael Proctor, the case agent who managed the investigation into the death of Boston police officer John O’Keefe.  But the supervisor testified that the former trooper handled the probe with “honor and integrity.” “I believe human beings all have biases,” Bukhenik said in a courtroom southeast of Boston. “Especially in this case, they did not affect the outcome of the investigation.” Proctor, who was fired after Read’s defense team raised allegations of misconduct at her widely watched first trial, has not testified at her retrial. It is not clear if he will. Read, 45, is charged with second-degree murder, motor vehicle manslaughter while driving under the influence and leaving the scene of a collision causing death. The first trial, which spanned nine weeks and five days of jury deliberations,ended when the panel could not reach a unanimous verdict. This week marked the third in her retrial. Prosecutors have alleged that Read was furious over her deteriorating relationship when she drunkenly backed her Lexus SUV into O’Keefe, her boyfriend of two years, and left him for dead outside the suburban home of a now-retired Boston police sergeant, Brian Albert. O’Keefe, 46, was found unresponsive in Albert’s yard shortly after 6 a.m.  Jan. 29, 2022. He was later pronounced dead. The medical examiner attributed his cause of death to hypothermia and blunt force trauma to the head. Read has asserted her innocence. Her lawyers have claimed that she is the victim of a conspiracy — O’Keefe was likely beaten inside Albert’s home, bitten by the family’s German Shepherd and dragged outside, they have said — and a cover-up that sought to frame her in his death. The defense lawyers have accused Proctor of manipulating evidence and conducting a biased investigation.He was dishonorably discharged in Marchafter a review by state police officials found that he violated agency rules when he sent derogatory messages about Read to friends, family and others, and when he shared sensitive and confidential details about the case with non-law enforcement personnel. At trial, Proctor acknowledged that his comments were \"unprofessional\" and \"dehumanized\" Read, but he said they did not affect the integrity of the investigation into O'Keefe's death. Proctor has not commented on his termination, but his family said the decision to fire him “unfairly exploits and scapegoats one of their own, a trooper with a 12-year unblemished record.” Bukhenik was among those who Proctor texted. While searching Read's phone seven months after O’Keefe’s death, Proctor texted a group thread about one of Read's lawyers, David Yannetti, and  refered to Read with offensive language and said: \"No nudes so far.\" In other messages that did not include Bukhenik, Proctor said he hoped Read died by suicide and he made disparaging comments about her medical condition. Read was diagnosed with Chron's disease. Bukhenik testified that he was working on an airport traffic detail when the message arrived on his Apple watch. Though Bukhenik responded with a thumbs-up emoji, he said, he did not look at the messages at the time. Bukhenik was later disciplined over the accuracy of Proctor's performance evaluation, he testified, and for failing to adequately supervise him. He lost five vacation days, he said, and remains a homicide investigator with the Massachusetts State Police. Under questioning from defense lawyer Alan Jackson, Bukhenik said that while Proctor managed the investigation, he did not believe the former trooper played a major role because he was only one of several troopers assigned to the case and was not responsible for 51 percent or more of the work. Asked if he believed Proctor's involvement in the case tainted the investigation, Bukhenik said he did not. \"The investigation was done with honor and integrity and the evidence pointed in one direction,\" he said.",

    "title": "TikToker Kayla Malec receives outpouring of support after announcing result of domestic assault case",
    "article_text": "A popular influencer who has been open about her abusive relationship with her ex-boyfriend received an outpouring of support online this week after he pleaded guilty in court. Kayla Malec, who has 16.6 million followers on TikTok and almost 1.8 subscribers on YouTube,first publicly detailed abuse allegations against Evan Johnsonin April, uploading a series of emotional, raw videos about their nine-month relationship. The videos, which at times included pictures and videos of injuries she said she sustained from Johnson, generated a sympathetic reaction from many of her followers, who praised her for her vulnerability. Malec’s story became the latest saga to captivate people online, as some of her followers began to spread misinformation and condemn another creator who they said appeared to be associated with Johnson. Johnson was charged by officials in Sumner County, Tennessee, with domestic assault on April 7, according to Sumner County Courthouse records obtained by NBC News. On Wednesday, Malecshared “justice was served,”as she posted videos of herself outside of a courthouse. “I’m like really happy right now, I’m going to probably start sobbing,” she said in hervideo,“ ... but I won. I won!” Johnson pleaded guilty to a domestic assault charge on Wednesday, and was also ordered to have no contact with Malec, according to court documents. Johnson was also ordered to not operate TikTok, YouTube or Facebook accounts in his name. He also pleaded guilty to a probation violation for a DUI, according to court documents. A court representative said that Johnson is in custody. Representatives for Malec and Johnson did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. In the lead-up to the court hearing this week, Malec documented her emotions in videos on TikTok, saying she’s experienced anxiety and PTSD after coming forward. “This is the most depressed I’ve ever been in my life,” she said in avideo last month. “... I know it will get better and I know the healing process takes a long time. And there are days when I feel really good and there are days when I wake up ... and I don’t want to get out of bed for the rest of the day.” She said she’s continued to post to help others who have faced similar situations. “The one thing that’s keeping my head up and getting me out of bed is knowing that I’m doing this for a reason and that I’m doing this to help ya’ll,” she said. Malec’s celebratory videos collectively received about 20 million likes, as fellow popular influencers — including Haylee Kalil, Jacob Sartorius and Jess DiTirro — commented congratulating her on the verdict. Singer Kesha, who previously brought abuse allegations against her former producer Dr. Luke, also commented. (Dr. Luke, who has not been charged with a crime, has denied all of Kesha’s allegations. In 2023,the two reached a settlementin his defamation suit over her allegation that he raped her. “I’m so proud of you,” Kesha wrote on Malec’s video. “A win for one is a win for all of us.” If you or someone you know is facing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence hotline for help at (800) 799-SAFE (7233), or go towww.thehotline.orgfor more. States often have domestic violence hotlines as well.",

    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, we examine John Fetterman’s place in the Senate, where the Pennsylvania Democrat is increasingly on an island. Plus, Kristen Welker previews her interview with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on this Sunday’s “Meet the Press.” Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Allan Smith, Sahil Kapur, Scott Wong and Frank Thorp Vhave a deeply reported story out this afternoonon Sen. John Feterman, D-Pa., based on interviews with 18 former staffers, Pennsylvania officials, and congressional lawmakers and staffers, many of whom said the senator is increasingly isolated and absent from official business, both in Washington and his home state. Fetterman’s behavior has received renewed scrutinyafter a recent New York magazine articledetailing concerns about his mental health from one of his closest former aides, as well as some frustration from Democrats that Fetterman is not on the same page as many other members of the party when it comes to standing up to Trump and his agenda. Here are some of the key lines from the story: Read more from the team → As Americans gear up for a summer of busy travel plans, the cascade of news about issues at Newark Liberty International Airport has given many pause. Some radar screens serving the airportblacked out for 90 seconds early Friday, days after reports that air traffic controllerstemporarily lost communicationwith an aircraft. And there’s been a series of delays out of one of the nation’s busiest airports. That’s why I spoke to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy for this Sunday’s episode of “Meet the Press,” to ask him the questions that are on Americans’ minds right now about aircraft safety and transportation infrastructure. The bottom line: Duffy told me he feels safe flying in and out of Newark, and that America’s airspace is the “safest.” But there’s no silver bullet to fixing the infrastructure concerns. While Duffy said that a Newark-specific fix should be completed by the end of the summer,the air traffic modernization planreleased on Thursday will take three years to complete. “This is a system that’s, what — 25 at best, sometimes 50 years old. The Congress and the country haven’t paid attention to it, right? They expect it to work. And so now I think the — the lights are blinking, the sirens are turning, and they’re saying, ‘Listen, we have to fix this,’” Duffy told me. Don’t miss more from Duffy this Sunday, as well as exclusive interviews with Sens. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. Thanks to everyone who emailed us! This week’s question comes from Frank Mona III: “Will someone become the standard bearer for the Democrats nationally (and if so, who?) or do you think it will continue to be a group of governors, congressional and senatorial leaders all with overlapping messages?” To answer this, we turned to national political reporterBen Kamisar. Here’s his response: Historically, unless a political party has a president in the White House or a presidential nominee, it doesn’t usually have a single standard-bearer. That’s because without that sort of unifying force, there’s not typically a one-size-fits-all approach to leading a national political party. Instead, there are groups of politicians who attempt to grab the mantle of different wings of the party. In recent years on the Democratic side, it’s been people like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who have captured the energy on the left, and people like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer who have spoken for the party’s establishment. That’s why we’re seeing the whole group of potential 2028 presidential hopefuls on the Democratic sidetrying to carve out different lanes, instead of looking to be the singular standard-bearer. And that dynamic won’t change until the presidential nominating contest kicks into high gear in a few years. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

    "title": "Cities aiming to thwart immigrant detention centers wield a secret weapon: local laws",
    "article_text": "By Zane Irwin William Rogers worked as a correctional officer at CoreCivic from 2016 to 2020. He's a vocal critic of the plan to reopen the facility as an immigrant detention center.Zane Irwin/Kansas News Servicehide caption Former corrections officer William Rogers still remembers the exact spot in 2018 where an inmate slashed his head open with a metal lunch tray. \"When he hit me in the back of the head, I mean it hurt. But I didn't know it was split open, right? Because at that point you're just going to fight,\" he said. Chronic understaffing and mismanagement at a now-closed private prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, made instances like this common, Rogers said. Memories of preventable overdoses, suicides, stabbings, medical neglect and overcrowded cells still haunt him. CoreCivic, the prison's owner and one of the country's largest private corrections companies, said in a statement that allegations of dangerous conditions in the past reflect isolated incidents during a limited timeframe. The facility has sat vacantsince 2021, when then-President Joe Biden signed an executive order phasing out private prison contracts with the federal government. But that could soon change. With arenewed federal pushto expand immigration detention, CoreCivic plans to reopen the facility to hold up to 1,000 migrants. William Rogers carries evidence with him of alleged mismanagement and dangerous conditions at the Leavenworth Detention Center owned by CoreCivic.Zane Irwin/Kansas News Servicehide caption Private prison companies are indispensable to federal immigration authorities, who aimto double detention capacity to 100,000 beds. To that end, lawmakers in Congress are mulling aspending proposalthat would provide $175 billion to the Department of Homeland Security over five years, a65% percent increasein the agency's budget. Now Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, issending out calls for new contractswith private corrections companies, in many cases to use dormant detention centers. But many of these facilities had a history of serious issues. TheEtowah County Detention Center in Alabamaclosed due tounsanitary conditionsfor inmates. ICE is also eyeing FCI Dublin in the Bay Area, wherereports of rampant sexual abusegave the facility the grim moniker of \"the rape club.\" Where proposals to reopen troubled prisons have surfaced, protests and legal challenges have followed. Local and state lawsuits are disrupting ICE's plan to reopen theDelaney Hall facility in New Jerseythrough a contract with another major private prison company, the GEO Group. On Friday, federal officialsarrested Newark Mayor Ras J. Barakaoutside the ICE facility during a protest. U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Alina Habbawrote on social mediathat Baraka \"committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the ICE detention center in Newark\" and that no one is above the law. The city of Newark is suing GEO group over access and inspection rights. Baraka has held multiple protests outside the facility's gates, making no secret that his opposition goes beyond concerns about city regulations. \"Regardless of the process, an immigrant detention center is not welcomed here,\" he said in aFebruary statement. \"ICE's stated intention to round up 'criminals' is a thin veil that does not conceal their scheme to violate people's rights, desecrate the Constitution, and disassemble our democracy,\" Baraka said. A similar standoff is unfolding in Kansas. The city of Leavenworth argues that CoreCivic needs to follow a two-month long formal process, with multiple opportunities for public input, before it can reopen the former prison. CoreCivic insists those rules don't apply because, even though the last inmates left the facility in 2021, it never closed. Several speakers at a Leavenworth City Commission meeting in March opposed CoreCivic's decision not to request a special use permit, saying it was a way to evade public scrutiny. The commission then approved a resolution requiring that the private prison operator obtain permission before reopening a facility in the city.Zane Irwin/Kansas News Servicehide caption With a hearing scheduled in the coming weeks, It's unclear who will win in court. Nevertheless, the company is moving ahead with hiring and construction. Laws that target immigration detention specifically, like one in New Jersey, are difficult to make stick. But Professor David S. Rubenstein at Washburn University in Topeka said smaller local governments have used their authority to mount serious challenges to ICE and its contractors. \"The zoning objections are not directed at immigration detention specifically, they're just being utilized as a way to throw some sand in the gears,\" he said. For immigrant rights advocates and former prison employees, concerns about the pace of ICE's detention expansion plans extend far beyond possible violations of local laws. Immigration attorneys have said they're already hearing increasedreports of overcrowding and inhumane conditionsin ICE detention centers and field offices. Detainees — many of whom lack criminal records — have gone days without food, water and bathroom access, sometimes on crowded buses when ICE can't find other places to put them, they say. \"These are types of conditions that are going to be allowed to flourish without proper oversight, with this rush to mass detention,\" said Eunice Cho, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. These reports, coupled with the prospect of what some deem infamous facilities reopening, bring back traumatic memories for inmates and staff. Marcia Levering, a veteran and former CoreCivic employee who suffered debilitating injuries in an attack at the Leavenworth facility, drove three hours from Nebraska to protest the prison's reopening as an immigration detention center.Zane Irwin/Kansas News Servicehide caption Marcia Levering's voice shook as she spoke about her experience working for CoreCivic during a Leavenworth City Commission meeting in March. She stood at a lectern with the support of a cane and a close friend standing silently beside her. \"Unit 4 accidentally buzzed open the wrong door, again because we were understaffed, allowing an inmate to come out and throw boiling water in my face,\" she said. Before any fellow corrections officers responded, Levering said the inmate stabbed her four times while she was on the ground. A blow to the ear left one side of her face paralyzed. Four years and 16 surgeries later, Levering said she's still in recovery. Despite her injuries, she drove three hours from her home in Lincoln, Nebraska, to give her remarks. Levering said CoreCivic's refusal to go through the normal permission process in Leavenworth is emblematic of the profit-driven dynamic that altered the course of her life. \"CoreCivic took shortcuts and still wants to take shortcuts today by using a backdoor process to reopen,\" she said.

    "title": "Why this U.S. ambassador cried at a press conference — and is being called a hero",
    "article_text": "By Gabrielle Emanuel Michael Gonzales, U.S. ambassador to Zambia, at the Thursday press conference when he announced a cut of $50 million in aid for medications and medical supplies to the country. After 29 minutes, he was wiping away tears: \"I've cried over this because I know that it's not going to be senior officials or the senior people ... who are going to hurt. I know it's going to be the poor family in rural Zambia whose baby gets malaria and they won't have access to antimalarials.\"U.S. Embassy Zambiahide caption The U.S. ambassador to Zambia —Michael Gonzales— began his Thursdaypress conferenceon a somber note. After 29 minutes, he was wiping away tears. His distress goes back to a discovery made in late 2021: Medications and medical supplies donated to Zambia by the U.S. were being stolen. After 13 months of demanding change and 33 meetings with senior members of the Zambian government, he said he had no choice but to cut $50 million in aid for medications and medical supplies. \"I view this as a heart-wrenching worst-case scenario,\" he said at the press conference. \"I've lost sleep over this. I've cried over this because I know that it's not going to be senior officials or the senior people who are getting rich from this, who are going to hurt. I know it's going to be the poor family in rural Zambia whose baby gets malaria and they won't have access to antimalarials. It breaks my heart.\" \"But,\" he continued, \"I also have a duty to the American people, to the American taxpayer, to safeguard and ensure the good use of these resources.\" Between 2021 and 2023, Gonzales said, his team at the embassy sent \"buyers\" to visit more than 2,000 pharmacies in every province and district in Zambia. They focused on stores that sold the same type of medications being donated by the U.S. and others like the Global Fund and the Zambian government. They found that 95% of those pharmacies were selling stolen drugs. And 45% of these pharmacies were selling products the U.S. \"had provided to Zambia for free for Zambians in need.\" \"The scope, the frequency, the patterns of the theft leave me with zero doubt that this is an organized criminal endeavor that includes fairly senior people,\" Gonzales said. Annually, the U.S. provides roughly $600 million in aid to Zambia, with $450 million going to health-related efforts. That includes $128 million for medicines and medical supplies. The results of such investments have been impressive, Gonzales said proudly: 98% of HIV-positive people in Zambia know their status, and 99% are on HIV medication that suppresses the virus. Roughly 11% of Zambians have HIV. \"Today, millions of Zambians are living longer, healthier lives because of this assistance,\" he said. At the press conference, Gonzales said he was alarmed by the theft — and frustrated by the Zambian government's lack of action. On April 3, 2024, Gonzales said, he and his team of investigators met with \"very senior\" government officials to discuss the findings of their operation. They also offered to supply U.S. experts in supply chain management and law enforcement to help stop the thefts and bring the culprits to justice. There was \"minimal action,\" Gonzales said, noting that \"only a few midlevel officials\" were arrested. He described repeated efforts to get the Zambian government to stop the theft and hold the culprits accountable before making the decision to cut the amount of aid provided for medications. This cut in aid is entirely distinct from the Trump administration's sweeping changes to foreign assistance, said Gonzales, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden and sworn in as ambassador to Zambia in August 2022. In the first few weeks of his term, President Trumpdismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, which led to additional and significantmedication disruptions in Zambiaand elsewhere. Gonzales said the $50 million in support for medications would not stop flowing at the end of the year, giving the current Zambian government time to procure medications in the hope of avoiding shortages. That approach to cutting aid is noteworthy, saidDr. Paul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"What stands out in this case is that, unlike the recent massive funding cuts from the U.S. administration to global health – which have been abrupt, severe and not targeted to minimize harm – the U.S. Ambassador to Zambia noted that they are allowing Zambia time to develop alternatives to mitigate disruptions to health services,\" he wrote in an email to NPR, calling the period between now and January 2026 \"a critical window\" for any efforts to seek alternative funding. But that won't be an easy task for the government, said Spiegel, given that countries in Europe have also slashed aid budgets recently. \"If they are unable to [secure alternative funds], the consequences to these cuts for treating malaria, tuberculosis and HIV will be dire – and people will die,\" he said. After the Gonzales announcement, the Zambian minister of health — Elijah Muchima — released astatement, saying \"the Zambian Government wishes to reaffirm its commitment to resolving this unfortunate issue.\" Muchima acknowledged the theft of medication is a long-standing issue in the country, saying it predates the current administration, which came to power following the 2021 election. He outlined steps the government has taken thus far, including the creation of a Joint National Drug Task force and a digital system to track medications. He also said several senior members of the Zambia Medicines & Medical Supplies Agency or ZAMMSA were suspended or removed from their positions, including thedirector general in February 2025. Muchima said that \"all the suspects will go through the entire legal process.\" Spiegel said that theft of medical supplies is \"not uncommon, especially in countries with weaker health systems and inadequate oversight mechanisms.\" He said there have been similar cases in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. Indeed, drug theft and resale is a global problem that has been reported in the U.S. as well. News of the stolen medications and the $50 million cut in U.S. aid reverberated around Zambia.Chris Zumani Zimba, a Zambian political scientist affiliated with the University of Central Africa, said there were two simultaneous reactions. On the one hand, he said, many were deeply grateful to the U.S. ambassador and America. \"In the eyes of many Zambians today, the United States government is being seen as a hero government. It is the [U.S.] government that is exposing gross and grand corruption and looting in the [Zambian] public health sector,\" said Zimba, who was an adviser to the previous Zambian administration. \"Zambian people are looking to the American government as a political savior and a political redeemer.\" On the other hand, he said, there is a sense of fear about what lies ahead. The news that the U.S. is cutting $50 million in health aid \"was received as if it was a declaration of a household funeral in many parts of Zambia, because it is going to be a health crisis,\" said Zimba. More than half of Zambians live below the international poverty line, and Zimba said that those most in need of help will suffer the greatest from the aid cut. Echoing the words of Ambassador Gonzales, he said, \"It's just heartbreaking.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Librarian of Congress firing is latest move in upheaval of U.S. cultural institutions",
    "article_text": "Andrew Limbong As the Librarian of Congress, Hayden was tasked with digitizing the library's massive collection.Al Drago/Getty Imageshide caption By firing the Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden on Thursday night, President Trump continued his remaking of American cultural institutions. Hayden was the first woman and the first African American to hold the post. She was also the first person in the job to be term-limited. Her time was set to expire next year. \"There were quite concerning things that she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Friday. NPR has reached out to Hayden for comment. The Library of Congress does a lot of things. It's the main research arm of the U.S. Congress. It houses the U.S. Copyright Office. It organizes the National Book Festival every year (which, full disclosure, has hosted NPR journalists). But it also houses a giant trove of books, films, recordings, manuscripts, newspapers, and more, making it one of the largest libraries in the world. When Hayden first got the job in 2016, her main task was bringing the Library of Congress into the 21st century and digitizing the collection. It was a pretty big job, considering the Government Accountability Office had justpublished a report in 2015with the headline: \"Strong Leadership Needed to Address Serious Information Technology Management Weaknesses.\" By most accounts, Hayden's work in strengthening the Library's digital infrastructure has been a success. At a hearing of the House Administration committee Tuesday, Republican Congressman Bryan Steilpraised Hayden and her staff, saying they \"dedicate a lot of time and service to the country and the Library of Congress, and their work should be commended.\" While libraries in general have become fought-over turf in the broader culture wars, the Library of Congress has mostly stayed out of those controversies. Beside checking in on the process of digitization, the other topic of discussion in this week's hearing was theremodeling its of the Library's main reading room. Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, have criticized the firing. Also this week, a number of senior staff at the National Endowment for the Arts left their posts.In a letter published by the literary magazine N+1, four members of the NEA's literary arts staff announced their departures. \"While we don't know specifically how the work of the agency will change, we know the remaining staff will do their best to support you,\" the letter read. President Trump had previously proposed eliminating the NEA. Over the weekend,arts groups across the countrygot an email saying their grants from the National Endowment for the Arts had been canceled. It read, \"The NEA is updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation's rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the President.\" This has since left arts groups – across the country scrambling for funding. And on Wednesday,CNN reported thata number of performers in the upcoming production ofLes Misérablesat the Kennedy Center are planning on boycotting when President Trump sees the show on June 11. Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Centerwas an early show of force.He fired Deborah Rutter,who served as president of the performing arts center for a decade, and installed Richard Grenell as its interim president. Trump also placed himself as chair of the board. A number of artists who were slated to perform cancelled their appearances in response. This is just a portion of Trump's changes to arts institutions since he took office in January. He's also attempted to cut staff at theNational Endowment for the Humanities, and theInstitute of Museum and Library Services. Meghan Sullivan edited this story.

    "article_text": "Andrea Hsu President Trump and his adviser Elon Musk speak to the press on March 11 in Washington, D.C.Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's sweeping overhaul of the federal government. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, a Clinton appointee, came after a hearing Friday ina lawsuitfiled by a coalition of labor unions, nonprofits and local governments. The plaintiffs argue in their complaint that President Trump's efforts to \"radically restructure and dismantle the federal government\" without any authorization from Congress violate the Constitution. Illston agreed with the plaintiffs, asserting in the hearing that Supreme Court precedent makes clear that while the president does have the authority to seek changes at agencies, he must do so in lawful ways. \"[T]o make large-scale overhauls of federal agencies,\" she wrote inher rulingFriday evening, \"any president must enlist the help of his co-equal branch and partner, the Congress.\" Illston issued a temporary restraining order pausing further implementation of Trump'sFeb. 11 executive orderdirecting agencies to begin major reorganizations, as well as subsequent memos from his administration instructing agencies how to comply. Her order applies to 20 federal agencies, including the Departments of State, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Government Efficiency. Her order explicitly pauses the implementation of any existing reduction-in-force (RIF) notices, delaying while her order is in effect final separation for any employees who have received such notices. The order also pauses the issuance of any future RIF notices and the placement of additional employees on administrative leave. The order is in effect for 14 days, through May 23. Temporary restraining orders cannot be appealed, but the government is expected to appeal any injunction the judge could issue later on. During Friday's hearing, Illston said a temporary restraining order was necessary \"to protect the power of the legislative branch.\" She noted that in his first term, Trump did in fact seek Congress' approval for similar restructuring plans. \"He could have done that here, but he didn't,\" Illston said. The case is just the latest in a string of court battles testing the limits of Trump's executive authority. In court filings, his administration has argued that he has \"inherent authority\" to exercise control over those executing the nation's laws. In court on Friday, the Trump administration's lawyer, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Eric Hamilton, argued the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order was inappropriate given how much time has lapsed since Trump first signed the executive order to reshape the government. \"Plaintiffs are not entitled to any TRO because they waited far too long to bring this motion and any 'emergency' is thus entirely of their own making,\" he and other attorneys wrote in an earlier court filing. The plaintiffs' attorneys have argued that only now have they been able to ascertain what agencies are doing to carry out Trump's directives, given the secrecy with which his administration has been operating. \"They're trying to insulate from judicial review an unlawful set of instructions by not making public how they're being implemented,\" plaintiffs' lawyer Danielle Leonard told the court on Friday. As part of her ruling, Illston ordered the Trump administration to provide the court and the plaintiffs with the restructuring plans submitted by the agencies named as defendants in the case, as well as such plans already approved by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management, by Tuesday, May 13. Another argument Hamilton raised was one the government has cited in numerous other cases involving federal employees: that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case. Instead, matters involving personnel issues within the federal government must be brought to the bodies Congress created to hear such complaints, he said. Illston appeared unpersuaded by that argument, questioning Hamilton over whether the matter at hand — a radical overhaul of the entire government — was one Congress intended to go through those administrative channels. The plaintiffs in the case, including the American Federation of Government Employees and several of its local branches, the American Public Health Association and the cities of Chicago, Baltimore and San Francisco, had sought relief as agencies had already begun mass layoffs. Already, the plaintiffs' lawyers argued, agenciesincluding the Departments of Health and Human Servicesand Veterans Affairs are executing plans \"not based on their own independent analysis or reasoned decision-making\" but instead in accordance with the president's executive order and accompanying instructions from Elon Musk's DOGE team, the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management and Budget. The Trump administration has defended the executive order, arguing it merely provides direction in very broad terms, while making clear any actions taken must be \"consistent with applicable law.\" \"This type of directive is a straightforward way for a President to exercise his undoubted authority to require a subordinate agency to determine what the law allows and then take whatever action is legally available to promote the President's priorities,\" the government's attorneys wrote in court filings. In court, Leonard said the government's take was not an accurate description of the executive order. \"This is a mandatory order instructing agencies to begin RIFs now and to do so in the manner the president is directing,\" she said. Judge Illston's 14-day temporary restraining order applies to the following agencies: Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "USDA, DOGE demand states hand over personal data about food stamp recipients",
    "article_text": "By Jude Joffe-Block , Stephen Fowler People shop in a supermarket in New York City on Feb. 20, 2025.Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The Department of Agriculture is demanding states hand over personal data of food assistance recipients — including Social Security numbers, addresses and, in at least one state, citizenship status, according to emails shared with NPR by an official who was not allowed to speak publicly. The sweeping and unprecedented request comes as the Trump administration ramps up the collection and consolidation of Americans' sensitive data, and as that data has been used tomake misleading claimsabout people in the U.S. illegallyaccessing public benefitsand committing fraud, and tobuild a greater capacityto deport them. The emails obtained by NPR also show the nationwide directive regarding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, follows a request by federal auditors for information that included citizenship data but not other data typically used to verify financial eligibility for the program. In 2024,SNAP served an average of 42 million peopleeach month, according to the Department of Agriculture,at a cost of $100 billion. Only some categories of lawfully present noncitizens are eligible to receive SNAP benefits, and those without legal status can never qualify. However,a noncitizen parent without legal status may applyfor the assistance on behalf of their children who are U.S. citizens. The latest data demands are \"absolutely alarming,\" and \"reckless\" and likely violate the Privacy Act and other statutes, said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center. He and other advocates warn the data could be used to enable deportation and mass surveillance efforts and would do little to addressimproper payments. \"It is an unprecedented extension of the administration's campaign to consolidate personal data,\" Davisson said. SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is a federal program. Each state administers the program and enrolls participants based on eligibility determined by Congress. While the USDA and its Office of Inspector General can audit state SNAP programs, participants' personal data typically remains under the state's control. In March, the USDA's Office of Inspector General notified California, Florida, New York and Texas of inspections of their SNAP programs to see if the states were improperly using administrative funds to pay out benefits, the emails show. That ultimately led to a request for detailed sensitive data — including citizenship status and addresses — of all SNAP participants in the previous year from at least one of the states. A sign outside of a grocery store welcomes those on food assistance in a  Brooklyn neighborhood that has a large immigrant and elderly population on Oct. 16, 2023 in New York City.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide caption An April 2 update the state received from the OIG's office added a new objective: performing analytics on participant data to \"evaluate its quality and integrity.\" Yet the watchdog ultimately declined to request participants' employment status or income — which are key for determining financial eligibility for food assistance and detecting possible fraud. Instead, the request prioritized other data fields, including name, date of birth, address, contact information, Social Security number, citizenship status and information about household members, the emails show. At an initial joint video conference, the states learned the inspections had been requested by Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, according to an official who attended the meeting but was not authorized to discuss the matter. Trumpfired existing inspectors generalacross the federal government when he took office, including at the USDA where a new permanent leader of the office has yet to be confirmed. Earlier this week, the USDA escalated its quest for data further. In aMay 6 letterto all states, an adviser for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services said the federal agency would be seeking personally identifiable information for SNAP applicants and recipients, including, but not limited to, \"names, dates of birth, personal addresses used, and Social Security numbers\" going back to Jan. 1, 2020. USDA did not answer NPR's questions about the full extent of personal data it was requesting. The letter said USDA is asking private contractors that process SNAP payments for states to turn over that data, and will use it to \"ensure program integrity, including by verifying the eligibility of benefit recipients.\" The directive comes as Republican lawmakers in Congressare proposing deep cuts to the food assistance programthat would reduce the number of people who participate in it. The May 6 letter cited President Donald Trump'sMarch 20 executive order, \"Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos,\" which calls on agencies to ensure the federal government \"has unfettered access to comprehensive data from all state programs that receive federal funding \"including from \"third-party databases\" in order to identify fraud and overpayments. The ad hoc Department of Government Efficiency team, or DOGE, has beenaccessing sensitive data across the federal governmentin recent months and has been using allegations of wasteful and fraudulent spending tojustify dismantling government agencies. Neither DOGE nor the White House responded to NPR's requests for comment. Fidelity Information Services, a vendor used by some states to process electronic bank transfer transactions for SNAP programs, told its state partners the day before USDA's letter to states that the agency and its DOGE team contacted them in connection to the executive order, and that \"no proprietary, confidential, or personally identifiable information\" was shared, according to emails obtained by NPR. A customer shops for eggs at a  grocery store on March 12, 2025 in Chicago.Scott Olson/Getty Imageshide caption \"FIS values its close working relationship with both USDA and its state partners and is committed to supporting efforts to improve program efficiency and reduce fraud,\" reads a statement the company provided to NPR. \"As agreed with the USDA and in compliance with federal regulation, FIS has notified States of the USDA's request and is working with both to determine the most efficient manner to respond with the requested information.\" Wired, theWashington PostandCNNhave reported that DOGE is also combining sensitive data from across agencies, including Social Security Administration, Department of Homeland Security and the Internal Revenue Service, to create a data tool that can help the federal government track and arrest immigrants they want to remove. More thana dozen federal lawsuitsallege DOGE staffers have beenillegally granted permissionto view databases with personal and financial information the government maintains, and multiple federal judgeshave expressed concernabout what information DOGE has accessed and why. Late last month, DHS announced a DOGE-led overhaul of itsSystematic Alien Verification Entitlements (SAVE) database, making the system free for state and local governments to use and promising a \"single, reliable source for verifying non-citizen status nationwide.\" Davisson, the privacy attorney, said the SNAP data being requested could be used to make exaggerated allegations of fraud, and that combining the information with other DOGE-obtained data could be used for immigration enforcement efforts. \"What they're building is a surveillance weapon and it can be put to all sorts of adverse uses in the future,\" said Davisson. NPR asked the USDA if the agency would be following protocols outlined in the Privacy Act, such as publishing a privacy assessment and System of Records Notice for the new dataset. An unnamed spokesperson using a USDA press email account told NPR the agency's general counsel is determining whether that is required. \"All personally identifiable information will comply with all privacy laws and regulations and will follow responsible data handling requirements,\" the email said. After Trump issued an executive order in February aimed at ensuring immigrants without legal status are not receiving federal benefits, Agriculture Secretary Rollins made combatting alleged mispayments to ineligible immigrants a focus. \"The days in which taxpayer dollars are used to subsidize illegal immigration are over,\" Rollins said in aFebruary press release. In fiscal year 2023about 11% of SNAP benefits distributedwere considered improper over- or underpayments.Still, even fewer — about 1% of those — were attributed to state-level issues related to determining citizenship eligibility,according to USDA's own data. Most of the improper payments in 2022 were due to unintentional mistakes by state workers or households, rather than intentional fraud,according to an analysisof the data by the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Only 50% of eligible noncitizens (which includes refugees and green card holders) and 59% of eligible children living with noncitizen adults participated in SNAP in 2022, according to aUSDA report. Overall, advocates said participation among those who are entitled to receive this benefitis low due to fearsthat it may have a negative impact on immigration proceedings. A sign alerting customers about SNAP food stamps benefits is displayed in a Brooklyn grocery store on Dec. 5, 2019 in New York City.Scott Heins/Getty Imageshide caption Even though immigrants without legal status are not eligible to receive SNAP or other federal benefits, SNAP data does include the names and addresses of people who could be subject to deportation now or in the future, or who share a household with people who could be. Some legal immigrantswho receive SNAP benefitsmay lose their legal status in the future given that the administration istrying toreverse Biden-era immigration programs that granted hundreds of thousands of people the ability to live and work in the U.S. For years, advocates and state agencies have tried to reassure immigrant families that it is safe for them to sign up for assistance if they met the eligibility requirements. \"People seeking services need to know that their information will be used only to administer the program — and won't put them or their family members at risk,\" said Tanya Broder, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center. \"But the federal government's demand for 'unfettered' access to sensitive data across multiple agencies, and its aggressive pursuit of immigrants, raise serious privacy concerns and the potential that information will be weaponized against people who would go hungry without assistance.\" Onan FAQ pageto sign up for food assistance from California, the site currently says the state will not report applicants' immigration status to authorities and information is used only to determine eligibility. \"Authorities cannot use this information to deport you unless there is a criminal violation,\" the state website says. New York'swebsite says: \"Applying for or receiving SNAP will not affect your ability to remain in the United States.\" Advocates NPR spoke with said it is important for SNAP participants to understand that it is not yet known at this point how states will handle the USDA's pending data requests. Esther Reyes with Protecting Immigrant Families, a coalition of 700 groups across the country that help eligible immigrants access services, is urging states to check with their congressional delegations about whether the data requests are legal before responding. As for people who may feel fearful about enrolling in SNAP given concerns over data, Reyes said, \"We really encourage families and communities to talk to enrollment workers and the people that they trust before acting on that fear.\" NPR's Ximena Bustillo contributed reporting.

    "title": "When doctors describe your brain scan as a “starry sky,” it’s not good",
    "article_text": "TB is the deadliest infection in the world—but it doesn't often look like this. A starry sky can be stunning—even inside a hospital emergency room. But instead of celestial bodies sparkling in the night, doctors in South Korea were gazing at bright brain lesions punctuating a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The resulting pattern, called a \"starry sky,\" meant that their 57-year-old patient had a dangerous form of tuberculosis. The doctorsreport the casein this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The man had previously been treated for the infection in his lungs but came into the hospital's emergency department after two weeks of unexplained headaches, neck pain, and tingling in his right hand. The MRI and Computed-Tomography (CT) scans clearly revealed the problem: rare nodules and lesions, called tuberculomas, speckling his lungs and central nervous system, including both cerebral hemispheres, the basal ganglia deep inside the brain, the cerebellum at the back of the brain, the brain stem, and the upper spinal cord. The condition, called CNS tuberculoma, is a relatively rare manifestation of tuberculosis, which typically infects the lungs but can invade any part of the body. It's unclear exactly how tuberculomas form, but evidence suggests that the bacteria that cause tuberculosis—Mycobacterium tuberculosis—can spread around the body via the blood.M. tuberculosiscan get past the blood-brain barrier, possibly by hiding inside a type of white blood cell called a macrophage, in a \"Trojan horse\" mechanism or by breaking through the barrier.Tuberculomas are thought to formwhen bacteria and macrophages clump together into masses that may contain calcifications or cheese-like dead tissue called caseum. With the tuberculomas visualized, the doctors worked to diagnose the man's condition. Generally, the CNS tuberculosis can be notoriously difficult to diagnose, given thatM. tuberculosisare slow-growing and stealthy and can produce generic symptoms. The man's cerebrospinal fluid, for instance, was negative for the bacteria. But a sputum sample was positive. Tuberculomas are often seen amid tuberculosis infections that have not been adequately treated. That seems to be the case for the patient here, who had been previously treated for tuberculosis. Sometimes patients with tuberculomas also have tubercular meningitis, brain inflammation from the infection. Fortunately, the man did not develop this even more serious manifestation of the disease. With an intensive course of anti-tuberculosis antibiotics and an anti-inflammatory drug, the man's symptoms gradually began to ease. After a month, he was feeling better. After 18 months, his symptoms had completely resolved, and a repeat MRI of his head was normal. Tuberculosis isthe leading infectious disease killer globally. In 2023, the bacteria infected 10.8 million people and killed 1.25 million.

    "title": "New Lego-building AI creates models that actually stand up in real life",
    "article_text": "Carnegie Mellon \"LegoGPT\" system uses physics checks to ensure models don't collapse. On Thursday, researchers at Carnegie Mellon UniversityunveiledLegoGPT, an AI model that creates physically stable Lego structures from text prompts. The new system not only designs Lego models that match text descriptions (prompts) but also ensures they can be built brick by brick in the real world, either by hand or with robotic assistance. \"To achieve this, we construct a large-scale, physically stable dataset of LEGO designs, along with their associated captions,\" the researchers wrote in their paper, which waspostedon arXiv, \"and train an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction.\" This trained model generates Lego designs that match text prompts like \"a streamlined, elongated vessel\" or \"a classic-style car with a prominent front grille.\" The resulting designs are simple, using just a few brick types to create primitive shapes—but they stand up. As one Ars Technica staffer joked this morning upon seeing the research, \"It builds Legolike it's 1974.\" In the paper titled \"Generating Physically Stable and Buildable Lego Designs from Text,\" the research team led byAva Punexplained that many existing 3D generation models focus on making diverse objects with detailed geometry, but these digital designs often can't be physically made. \"Without proper support, parts of the design can collapse, float, or remain disconnected,\" they wrote. Unlike previous attempts at autonomous Lego modeling, LegoGPT reportedly produces step-by-step instructions for building Lego creations that don't fall apart. You cansee demosof the system in action on the project's website. To build LegoGPT, the Carnegie Mellon team repurposed the technology behind large language models (LLMs), similar to the kind that run ChatGPT, for \"next-brick prediction\" instead of next-word prediction. To do so, the team fine-tunedLLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct, an instruction-following language model from Meta. The team then augmented the brick-predicting model with a separate software tool that can verify physical stability using mathematical models that simulate gravity and structural forces. To train the model, the team assembled a new dataset called \"StableText2Lego,\" which contained over 47,000 stable Lego structures paired with descriptive captions generated by a separate AI model, OpenAI's GPT-4o. Each structure underwent physics analysis to ensure it could be built in the real world. LegoGPT works by first generating a sequence of precisely placed Lego bricks. For each new brick in the sequence, the system makes sure it doesn't collide with existing bricks and that it fits within the building space. After completing a design, it uses the aforementioned mathematical models to verify that the model can stand upright without falling apart. If parts would collapse in real life, the system identifies the first unstable brick and backtracks, removing it and all subsequent bricks before trying a different approach. This \"physics-aware rollback\" method proved essential to the team's approach. Without it, only 24 percent of designs remained standing, compared to 98.8 percent with the full system. The researchers also expanded the system's abilities by adding texture and color options. For example, using an appearance prompt like \"Electric guitar in metallic purple,\" LegoGPT can generate a guitar model, with bricks assigned a purple color. To prove their designs worked in real life, the researchers had robots assemble the AI-created Lego models. They used a dual-robot arm system with force sensors to pick up and place bricks according to the AI-generated instructions. Human testers also built some of the designs by hand, showing that the AI creates genuinely buildable models. \"Our experiments show that LegoGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing Lego designs that align closely with the input text prompts,\" the team noted in its paper. When tested against other AI systems for 3D creation, LegoGPT stands out through its focus on structural integrity. The team tested against several alternatives, includingLLaMA-Meshand other 3D generation models, and found its approach produced the highest percentage of stable structures. Still, there are some limitations. The current version of LegoGPT only works within a 20×20×20 building space and uses a mere eight standard brick types. \"Our method currently supports a fixed set of commonly used Lego bricks,\" the team acknowledged. \"In future work, we plan to expand the brick library to include a broader range of dimensions and brick types, such as slopes and tiles.\" The researchers also hope to scale up their training dataset to include more objects than the 21 categories currently available. Meanwhile, others can literally build on their work—the researchers released their dataset, code, and models on theirproject websiteandGitHub.

    "title": "Wearables firm’s endless free hardware upgrades were too good to be true",
    "article_text": "Customers accuse Whoop of baiting and switching as it adjusts its business model. Fitness tracker company Whoop has upset some long-time customers by ending an upgrade system that promised free hardware upgrades to anyone who had a subscription with the company for at least six months. Whoop makes fitness tracker bracelets that let users access things like sleep tracking, menstrual tracking, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) via a subscription companion app. Since the first Whoop wearable came out in 2015, the Boston-based company’s business has been built on subscriptions. Whoop has traditionally lured customers in by giving its hardware away for “free” to Whoop app subscribers. Further, customers who subscribed to the Whoop app for at least six months got access to free hardware upgrades. “Instead of purchasing new hardware every time an updated model is produced, WHOOP members receive the next-generation device for free after having been a member for six months or more,” said a webpage on Whoop’s website that is no longer active but was accessible as recently as March 28, as reported byThe Vergeand confirmed viathe Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. On Thursday, Whoop announced a new fitness tracker, the Whoop 5.0. But unlike with previous hardware releases, long-time Whoop subscribers aren't automatically entitled to the wearable. If a current subscriber wants toupgrade to a Whoop 5.0, they have to pay a fee of $49 or $79, depending on whether their Whoop 5.0 has ECG sensors, or pay for an annual subscription upfront. Whoop subscriptions start at $199 per year. Current customers can also get a \"free\" hardware upgrade if they subscribed to or renewed a Whoop membership within the past 30 days, a Whoop representative confirmed viaReddit. Some customers have expressed frustration with the changes. One Reddit user, for example,wrote: Whoop published content which most certainly was to influence and convince people to buy the product, that clearly stated there was free upgrades. This has been removed as if it never happened. … You can’t sell a subscription product making future promises, make a bunch of sales, and then take away those advertised benefits. When reached for a comment, a Whoop spokesperson told Ars Technica that promises of free upgrades only pertained to previous launches. Still, another Reddit user accused Whoop of performing a“bait and switch,”and a thirdsaid, “Just spent my first week with Whoop 4.0 and see all that has hit today. Looks like I’ll be returning and already walking away from the company.” The statement shared by Whoop's representative added: With the launch of the WHOOP 5.0, we’ve worked to make WHOOP more accessible to more people and are now offering three tiers of membership, including our lowest price point ever with WHOOP One at $199. The WHOOP 4.0 will also continue to be supported, with members receiving new features available on our Peak membership. Whoop’sabout-faceis anincreasingly commonstory as companies that launched during the initial Internet of Things (IoT) craze get a clearer idea of what they need to do tostay in business. In addition to changing its approach to upgrades, Whoop previously stopped selling monthly subscriptions to new customers. Its new devices, meanwhile, have more advanced features, including ECG capabilities and longer battery life claims, that likely add to associated costs. Wearables are a relatively new type of gadget, and some firms, like Whoop, are still trying to figure out the best way to make money with them. That may mean going to market differently than a decade ago. Whoop customers will have to decide if the company’s offerings are worth dealing with the updated strategy and potential future changes.

    "title": "Google’s search antitrust trial is wrapping up—here’s what we learned",
    "article_text": "Google and the DOJ have had their say; now it's in the judge's hands. Last year, United States District Court Judge Amit Mehtaruled that Google violated antitrust lawby illegally maintaining a monopoly in search. Now, Google and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have had their say in the remedy phase of the trial, which wraps up today. It will determine the consequences for Google's actions, potentially changing the landscape for search as we rocket into the AI era, whether we like it or not. The remedy trial featured over 20 witnesses, including representatives from some of the most important technology firms in the world. Their statements about the past, present, and future of search moved markets, but what does the testimony mean for Google? One of the DOJ's proposed remedies is toforce Google to divest Chromeand the open source Chromium project. Google has been adamant both in and out of the courtroom that it is the only company that can properly run Chrome. It says selling Chrome would negatively impact privacy and security because Google's technology is deeply embedded in the browser. And regardless, Google Chrome would be too expensive for anyone to buy. Unfortunately for Google, it may have underestimated the avarice of its rivals. The DOJ called witnesses from Perplexity, OpenAI, and Yahoo—all of them said their firms were interested in buying Chrome. Yahoo's Brian Provost noted that the company is currently working on a browser that supports the company's search efforts. Provost said that it would take 6–9 months just to get a working prototype, but buying Chrome would be much faster. He suggested Yahoo's search share could rise from the low single digits to double digits almost immediately with Chrome. Credit:\n\n          \n          Aurich Lawson Meanwhile, OpenAI is burning money on generative AI, but Nick Turley, product manager for ChatGPT, said the company was prepared to buy Chrome if the opportunity arises. Like Yahoo, OpenAI has explored designing its own browser, but acquiring Chrome would instantly give it 3.5 billion users. If OpenAI got its hands on Chrome, Turley predicted an \"AI-first\" experience. On the surface, the DOJ's proposal to force a Chrome sale seems like an odd remedy for a search monopoly. However, the testimony made the point rather well. Search and browsers are inextricably linked—putting a different search engine in the Chrome address bar could give the new owner a major boost. Also at issue in the trial are themassive paymentsGoogle makes to companies like Apple and Mozilla for search placement, as well as restrictions on search and app pre-loads on Android phones. The government says these deals are anti-competitive because they lock rivals out of so many distribution mechanisms. Google pays Apple and Mozilla billions of dollars per year to remain the default search engine in their browsers. Apple's Eddie Cue admitted he's been losing sleep worrying about the possibility of losing that revenue. Meanwhile, Mozilla CFO Eric Muhlheim explained that losing the Google deal could spell the end of Firefox. He testified that Mozilla would have to make deep cuts across the company, which could lead to a \"downward spiral\" that dooms the browser. Google's goal here is to show that forcing it to drop these deals could actually reduce consumer choice, which does nothing to level the playing field, as the DOJ hopes to do. Google's preferred remedy is to simply have less exclusivity in its search deals across both browsers and phones. While Google certainly doesn't want to lose Chrome, there may be a more fundamental threat to its business in the DOJ's remedies. The DOJ argued that Google's illegal monopoly has given it an insurmountable technology lead, but a collection of data remedies could address that. Under the DOJ proposal, Google would have to license some of its core search technology, including the search index and ranking algorithm. Google CEO Sundar Pichai gave testimony at the trial and cited these data remedies as no better than aspinoff of Google search. Google's previous statements have referred to this derisively as \"white labeling\" Google search. Pichai claimed these remedies could force Google to reevaluate the amount it spends on research going forward, slowing progress in search for it and all the theoretical licensees. Currently, there is no official API for syndicating Google's search results. There are scrapers that aim to offer that service, but that's a gray area, to say the least. Google has even rejected lucrative deals to share its index. Turley noted in his testimony that OpenAI approached Google to license the index for ChatGPT, but Google decided the deal could harm its search dominance, which was more important than a short-term payday. Initially, the DOJ wanted to force Google to stop investing in AI firms, fearing its influence could reduce competition as it gained control or acquired these startups. The government has backed away from this remedy, but AI is still core to the search trial. That seemed to surprise Judge Mehta. During Pichai's testimony, Mehta remarked that the status of AI had shifted considerably since the liability phase of the trial in 2023. \"The consistent testimony from the witnesses was that the integration of AI and search or the impact of AI on search was years away,\" Mehta said. Things are very different now, Mehta noted, with multiple competitors to Google in AI search. This may actually help Google's case. Throughout the trial, Google has sought to paint search as a rapidly changing market where its lead is no longer guaranteed. Google's legal team pointed to the meteoric rise of ChatGPT, which has become an alternative to traditional search for many people. On the other hand, Google doesn't want to look too meek and ineffectual in the age of AI. Apple's Eddie Cue testified toward the end of the trial and claimed that rival traditional search providers like DuckDuckGo don't pose a real threat to Google, but AI does. According to Cue, search volume in Safari was down for the first time in April, which he attributed to people using AI services instead. Google saw its stock price drop on the news, forcing it toissue a statementdenying Cue's assessment. It says searches in Safari and other products are still growing. With the arguments made, Google's team will have to sweat it out this summer while Mehta decides on remedies. A decision is expected in August of this year, but that won't be the end of it. Google is still hoping to overturn the original verdict. After the remedies are decided, it's going to appeal and ask for a pause on the implementation of remedies. So it could be a while before anything changes for Google. In the midst of all that, Google is still pursuing an appeal of theGoogle Play casebrought by Epic Games, as well as thead tech casethat it lost a few weeks ago. That remedy trial will begin in September. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Linux kernel is leaving 486 CPUs behind, only 18 years after the last one made",
    "article_text": "Linus Torvalds sees \"zero real reason for anybody to waste one second\" on them. Intel's i486 was the first \"computer number\" I ever really understood. Sure, my elementary school computer lab had both the Apple IIGS and Apple IIc, and one of them was slightly more useful, for reasons unexplained to me. But soon after my father brought home his office's discarded Gateway desktop with a 486DX 33 MHz inside, I was catapulted into my first Intel sorting scheme. I learned there was an x86 before this one (i386), and there were models with different trailing numbers (16–100 MHz) and \"DX\" levels. This was my first grasp of what hardware I was actually using and what could improve inside it. More than 36 years after the release of the 486 and 18 years afterIntel stopped making them, leaders of the Linux kernel believe the project can improve itself by leaving i486 support behind. Ingo Molnar,quoting Linus Torvaldsregarding \"zero real reason for anybody to waste one second\" on 486 support, submitted a patch series to the 6.15 kernel that updates its minimum support features. Those requirements now include TSC (Time Stamp Counter) and CX8 (i.e., \"fixed\"CMPXCH8B, its ownwhole thing), features that the 486 lacks (as do some early non-Pentium 586 processors). It's not the first time Torvalds has suggested dropping support for 32-bit processors and relieving kernel developers from implementing archaic emulation and work-around solutions. \"We got rid of i386 support back in 2012. Maybe it's time to get rid of i486 support in 2022,\"Torvalds wrote in October 2022. Failing major changes to the 6.15 kernel, which will likely arrivelate this month, i486 support will be dropped. Where does that leave people running a 486 system for whatever reason? They can run older versions of the Linux kernel andLinux distributions. They might find recommendations for teensy distros likeMenuetOS,KolibriOS, andVisopsys, but all three of those require at least a Pentium. They can runFreeDOS. They might get away with the OS/2 descendantArcaOS. There are some who havemodified Windows XP to run on 486 processors, and hopefully, they will not connect those devices to the Internet. Really, though, if you're dedicated enough to running a 486 system in 2025, you're probably resourceful enough to find copies of the software meant for that system.

    "title": "Trump kills broadband grants, calls digital equity program “racist and illegal”",
    "article_text": "Trump move also takes grants away from veterans and people with disabilities. President Donald Trump said he is killing a broadband grant program that was authorized by Congress, claiming that the Digital Equity Act of 2021 is racist and unconstitutional. \"I have spoken with my wonderful Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, and we agree that the Biden/Harris so-called 'Digital Equity Act' is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL. No more woke handouts based on race! The Digital Equity Program is a RACIST and ILLEGAL $2.5 BILLION DOLLAR giveaway. I am ending this IMMEDIATELY, and saving Taxpayers BILLIONS OF DOLLARS!\" Trump wrote in a Truth Socialpostyesterday. The Digital Equity Act provided $2.75 billion for three grant programs. As a National Telecommunications and Information Administrationwebpagesays, the grants \"aim to ensure that all people and communities have the skills, technology, and capacity needed to reap the full benefits of our digital economy.\" Thedigital equity law, approved as part of theInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, allows for grants benefitting a wide range of Americans who lack reliable and affordable Internet access. The law covers low-income households, people who are at least 60 years old, people incarcerated in state or local prisons and jails, veterans, people with disabilities, people with language barriers, people who live in rural areas, and people who are members of a racial or ethnic minority group. \"President Trump's move to end the Digital Equity Act is blatantly unconstitutional,\" consumer advocacy group Public Knowledgesaid. While Trump is \"labeling efforts to address racial inequity as discriminatory themselves,\" his action \"will also severely impact his voter base of white Americans who live in rural areas in red states, including veterans and the elderly,\" the group said. Some states alreadyreceived fundinglast year. If Trump cancels grants that haven't yet been distributed, it will likely result in lawsuits against the administration. The law allows funding to be used in a variety of ways, including \"to make available equipment, instrumentation, networking capability, hardware and software, or digital network technology for broadband services to covered populations at low or no cost,\" and \"to construct, upgrade, expend, or operate new or existing public access computing centers for covered populations through community anchor institutions.\" It can also cover training programs for using technology and workforce development programs. Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.), author of the Digital Equity Act,saidthe law is \"about making sure seniors can get online and equipping every student in every classroom with the tools they need to succeed, whether that's a hotspot to take home or a laptop.\" Murray said the law gives \"maximal flexibility to cities, states, and Tribes so every local community can decide for themselves how they invest Digital Equity dollars.\" Murray called it \"absolutely insane\" that the grants \"will be illegally blocked because the President doesn't like the word equity.\" \"Republicans will have to explain to their constituents why this Republican administration doesn't believe their local library should get funding to help seniors navigate telehealth options or why middle schoolers in rural districts shouldn't get laptops,\" Murray said. The National Digital Inclusion Alliance (NDIA), which was helping its members access the federal funding,slammed Trumpfor claiming that the program is unconstitutional. \"Is it unconstitutional for a grandmother to learn how to protect herself from online scams?\" asked NDIA Executive Director Angela Siefer. \"Is it unconstitutional for a veteran to access a telehealth appointment? Is it unconstitutional for a child to finish homework at home? Is it unconstitutional for a job-seeker to apply for work online?\" Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) hasclaimedthe Biden administration's implementation of the Digital Equity Act is \"impermissible race-based discrimination under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\" The grant program is one of several targeted by Republicans since Trump's inauguration. The Senate yesterdayapproved a Cruz proposalto kill a different program that would distribute Wi-Fi hotspots to schoolchildren. A House version of the Cruz measure is still pending. The biggest federal broadband program of all is a $42.45 billion deployment fund that will distribute money to ISPs. The Trump administration isn't trying to kill that program but ischanging the rulesand delaying the distribution of grants. While the Biden administration set it up so that ISPs building fiber networks would have the best chance to obtain grants, the Trump administration is adopting a \"tech-neutral\" approach that will benefit fixed wireless providers and satellite operators such as Starlink.

    "article_text": "One participant is reportedly facing criminal charges in juvenile court. Schools across the US are warning parents about an Internet trend that has students purposefully trying to damage their school-issued Chromebooks so that they start smoking or catch fire. Various school districts, including some inColorado,New Jersey,North Carolina, andWashington, have sent letters to parents warning about the trend that’s largely taken off on TikTok. Per reports from school districts and videos that Ars Technica has reviewed online, the so-called Chromebook Challenge includes students sticking things into Chromebook ports to short-circuit the system. Students are using various easily accessible items to do this, including writing utensils, paper clips, gum wrappers, and pushpins. The Chromebook challenge has caused chaos for US schools, leading to laptop fires that haveforced school evacuations,early dismissals, and the summoning of first responders. Schools are also warning that damage to school property can result in disciplinary action and, in some states, legal action. In Plainville, Connecticut, a middle schooler allegedly “intentionally stuck scissors into a laptop, causing smoke to emit from it,” Superintendent Brian Reas told local news stationWFSB. The incident reportedly led to one student going to the hospital due to smoke inhalation and is suspected to be connected to the viral trend. “Although the investigation is ongoing, the student involved will be referred to juvenile court to face criminal charges,” Reas said. Recently, TikTok banned the search term “Chromebook Challenge,\" Ars confirmed. Searching for the term brings up a message that reads: Your safety mattersSome online challenges can be dangerous, disturbing, or even fabricated. Learn how to recognize harmful challenges so you can protect your health and well-being. The message includes a link toa pagetelling users how to “assess challenges” on the platform. TikTok hassaidthat the Chromebook Challenge is on other social media platforms as well. Google didn’t respond to Ars Technica’s request for comment. This isn’t the first dangerous Internet sensation closely associated with TikTok. In 2022, for example, TikTok helped catapult the Kia Challenge, which led to uprisings in Kia and Hyundai thefts, as well as a$200 million class-action lawsuit settlementfrom the car manufacturers. There was also theBlackout Challenge, where people tried to choke themselves until they lost consciousness, and theFire Challenge, where people poured flammable liquids on themselves and then set the liquids on fire. Parents and psychiatrists have been trying to wrap their heads around how some of the more dangerous Internet trends take off, especially among kids. A viewpoint published by a pair of University of Tennessee Health Science Center at Memphis psychiatrists in JAMA Psychiatry in Novemberhighlighted the complexitiesof trying to decipher if children who participate in such risky TikTok trends are looking to hurt themselves.

    "title": "Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky sentenced to 12 years for “unbank yourself” scam",
    "article_text": "Some victims lost everything to the Celsius Network's fraud. Alex Mashinsky—the disgraced founder of the Celsius Network cryptocurrency bank who deceived hundreds of thousands into losing billions with the catchy slogan \"unbank yourself\"—was sentenced to 12 years in prison on Thursday. In December, Mashinsky pleaded guilty to securities fraud and commodities fraud. Federal prosecutors slammed him for reaping $48 million in profits while causing billions in investor losses by artificially inflating the value of his network's token, Cel. The Department of Justice and dozens of victims urged the court to order a maximum sentence of 20 years, while Mashinsky hoped the court would agree that he had shown remorse and should only serve one year and one day, Reutersreported. Mashinsky's downfall started in 2022, when the Celsius Networksuddenly stopped allowing withdrawals, claiming that \"extreme market conditions\" were to blame, a shady move that caused some customers to question the crypto bank's financial health. One month later, the bank filed for bankruptcy, exposing a $1.19 billion deficit in its balance sheets and still holding onto customers' funds while scoffing at supposed \"misinformation\" that their money would be lost. In 2023, the Federal Trade Commissionreacheda $4.7 billion settlement permanently banning Celsius from handling assets after finding that it squandered billions in user deposits with an \"old-fashioned swindle\" that tricked \"consumers into transferring cryptocurrency onto the platform by falsely promising that deposits would be safe and always available.\" As the case dragged on, Mashinsky and his family appeared unremorseful, victims said, even while facing threats of violence and significant public shaming. Some victims accused Mashinsky of lying to their faces and pushing them to continue depositing funds even when the end was near and he knew that the money would be lost. Invictim statementssent to US District Judge John Koeltl, customers accused Mashinsky of weaponizing his family-man brand to scam many naïve investors out of their life savings. Some suicides were reported, victims said, and elderly victims were among the most vulnerable, with many becoming homeless after retirement funds were drained. Among the victims was Rien Vanmarcke, who confessed to feeling haunted by guilt after convincing his aging mother to invest in Celsius and losing the majority of their savings. And \"Mashinsky's cruelty didn't end with the collapse,\" Vanmarcke wrote. \"His family mocked victims with 'unbankrupt yourself' merchandise funded by stolen savings, while flaunting luxury lifestyles online.\" Other victims also described feeling palpable shame, even if they felt their road to recovery wasn't as bad as others.

    "title": "Don’t look now, but a confirmed gamer is leading the Catholic Church",
    "article_text": "Prevost playedWordleandWords with Friendsbefore leaving for the conclave. Yesterday's naming of Chicago native Robert Prevost as Pope Leo XIV—the first American-born leader of the Catholic church—has already led toplentyofjokesandmemesabout his potential interactions with various bits of American pop culture. And that cultural exposure apparently extends to some casual video games, making Leo XIV our first confirmed gamer pope. Speaking to NBC5 ChicagoThursday, papal sibling John Prevost confirmed that the soon-to-be-pope played a couple of games just before flying to the papal conclave earlier this week. \"First we doWordle, because this is a regular thing,\" Prevost said. \"Then we doWords with Friends. It's something to keep his mind off life in the real world...\" OK, so the pope's love of casual word games doesn't exactly put him in the same category of people who arespeedrunningDoomslaughter maps. But it's still striking to realize that the 69-year-old pontiff is among the reported44 percent of American Baby Boomer men who play video games regularlyand the15 percent of Americans aged 55 and overwho have playedWordlespecifically. In the recent past, papal interest in video games has usually taken the form of official statements decrying their potential for harm. Pope Francis, for instance,warned in a 2016 speechthat young people should avoid spending excessive time on \"a sofa that promises us hours of comfort so we can escape to the world of video games and spend all kinds of time in front of a computer screen.\" And in 2007, Pope Benedict XVIspecifically called outvideo games \"which in the name of entertainment exalt violence and portray anti-social behavior or the trivialization of human sexuality.\" On the other hand, in 2000, Pope John Paul II reportedly went out of his way to praise the Pokémon franchise as \"full of inventive imagination\" and for its \"ties of intense friendship\" on a Vatican-run TV station. As the first pope from the Baby Boomer generation, Leo XIV may be more likely than his predecessors to see video games less as a new technology and more as just another longstanding part of the cultural landscape—he was just 20 years old when the home version ofPongbecame a sensation across the US, for instance. The new pope is in the same generational bucket asa rising class of (relatively) young US politicianswho are also increasingly likely to have encountered video games in their younger days. That includesreported Dreamcast addict and Minnesota Governor Tim Walzand Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whosaid she played games likeSuper Mario 64at her cousin's house. While Leo XIV is the first pope who we know played video games, he's not the first one to haveowneda video game. In a 2016 moment thatbecame an almost instant meme, streamer MatPat inexplicablygifted Pope Francis a Steam key for quirky indie RPGUndertaleduringa papal meeting with various popular YouTube stars. The game \"represents an evolution for gamers and what they expect from the games that they play,\" MatPat said at the time, adding that it's \"important to let the world know that this community is about more than monster-hunting and level grinding.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Trump cuts tariff on UK cars; American carmakers not happy about it",
    "article_text": "The UK is allowed to export 100,000 cars a year to the US at the lower rate. The British car industry got a big break from US President Donald Trump yesterday afternoon. Trump and UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer have agreed toa bilateral trade agreementthat cuts tariffs on a range of imports from the UK, including pharmaceuticals, aluminum and steel, and cars. Now, the first 100,000 cars that come to the US from the UK will only be subject to a 10 percent tariff rather than the 27.5 percent they have been under sincethe start of this trade war in April. \"The car industry is vital to the UK’s economic prosperity, sustaining 250,000 jobs,\" said Jaguar Land Rover CEO Adrian Mardell. \"We warmly welcome this deal which secures greater certainty for our sector and the communities it supports. We would like to thank the UK and US Governments for agreeing this deal at pace and look forward to continued engagement over the coming months,\" Mardell said. As it turns out, 100,000 is almost as many cars as the UK exported to the US last year—about 102,000 last year. Not every car that wears a British brand's name is made there, but Aston Martin, Bentley, Jaguar Land Rover, McLaren, Mini, and Rolls-Royce all manufacture cars in the UK. Butaccording to Automotive News Europe, car imports from the UK have increased by 39 percent since 2022, and it's quite possible that those imports will exceed the new quota this year. Not everyone is as pleased as the UK car industry, however. The big three in Detroit—Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis—are upset that mostly luxury cars from Britain get a break while they have no relief on the cars they build abroad for sale here in the US. \"We are disappointed that the administration prioritized the UK ahead of our North American partners. Under this deal, it will now be cheaper to import a UK vehicle with very little US content than a USMCA compliant vehicle from Mexico or Canada that is half American parts. This hurts American automakers, suppliers, and auto workers,\" said former Missouri Governor Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Ford, GM, and Stellantis. Worse yet, American automakers fear this is just the start of things to come. \"We hope this preferential access for UK vehicles over North American ones does not set a precedent for future negotiations with Asian and European competitors,\" Blunt said.

    "title": "Doom: The Dark Ages review: Shields up!",
    "article_text": "Prepare to add a more defensive stance to the usual dodge-and-shoot gameplay loop. Developer:id SoftwarePublisher: Bethesda SoftworksPlatform: Windows (reviewed), PS5, Xbox Series X/SRelease Date:May 14, 2025ESRB Rating:M for MaturePrice: $70Links:Amazon|Steam|Official Website For decades now, you could count on there being a certain rhythm to a Doom game. Fromthe ’90s originalsto theseries’ resurrectioninrecent years, the Doom games have always been about using constant, zippy motion to dodge through a sea of relatively slow-moving bullets, maintaining your distance while firing back at encroaching hordes of varied monsters. The specific guns and movement options you could call on might change from game to game, but the basic rhythm of that dodge-and-shoot gameplay never has. Just a few minutes in,Doom: The Dark Agesthrows out that traditionalDoomrhythm almost completely. The introduction of a crucial shield adds a whole suite of new verbs to the Doom vocabulary; in addition to running, dodging, and shooting, you’ll now be blocking, parrying, and stunning enemies for counterattacks. In previous Doom games, standing still for any length of time often led to instant death. InThe Dark Ages, standing your ground to absorb and/or deflect incoming enemy attacks is practically required at many points. Duringa preview event earlier this year, the game’s developers likened this change to the difference between flying a fighter jet and piloting a tank. That’s a pretty apt metaphor, and it's not exactly an unwelcome change for a series that might be in need of a shake-up. But it only works if you go in ready to play like a tank and not like the fighter jet that has been synonymous with Doom for decades. Don’t get me wrong,The Dark Agesstill features its fair share of the Doom series’ standard position-based Boomer Shooter action. The game includes the usual stockpile of varied weapons—from short-range shotguns to long-range semi-automatics to high-damage explosives with dangerous blowback—and doles them out slowly enough that major new options are still being introduced well into the back half of the game. But the shooting side has simplified a bit sinceDoom Eternal. Gone are the secondary weapon modes, grenades, chainsaws, and flamethrowers that made enemy encounters a complicated weapon and ammo juggling act. Gone too are the enemies that practically forced you to use a specific weapon to exploit their One True Weakness; I got by for most ofThe Dark Agesby leaning on my favored plasma rifle, with occasional switches to a charged steel ball-and-chain launcher for heavily armored enemies. In their place is the shield, which gives you ample (but not unlimited) ability to simply deflect enemy attacks damage-free. You can also throw the shield for a ranged attack that’s useful for blowing up frequent phalanxes of shielded enemies or freezing larger unarmored enemies in place for a safe, punishing barrage. But the shield’s most important role comes when you stand face to face with a particularly punishing demon, waiting for a flash of green to appear on the screen. When that color appears, it’s your signal that the associated projectile and/or incoming melee attack can be parried by raising your shield just before it lands. A successful parry knocks that attack back entirely, returning projectiles to their source and/or temporarily deflecting the encroaching enemy themselves. A well-timed, powerful parry is often the only reasonable option for attacks that are otherwise too quick or overwhelming to dodge effectively. The overall effect ends up feeling a bit likeDoomby way ofMike Tyson’s Punch-Out!!Instead of dancing around a sea of hazards and looking for an opening, you’ll often find yourself just standing still for a few seconds, waiting to knock back a flash of green so you can have the opportunity to unleash your own counterattack. Various shield sigils introduced late in the game encourage this kind of conservative turtling strategy even more by adding powerful bonus effects to each successful parry. The window for executing a successful parry is pretty generous, and the dramatic temporal slowdown and sound effects make each one feel like an impactful moment. But they start to feel less impactful as the game goes on, and battles often devolve into vast seas of incoming green flashes. There were countless moments in myDark Agesplaythrough where I found myself more or less pinned down by a deluge of green attacks, frantically clicking the right mouse button four or five times in quick succession to parry off threats from a variety of angles. In between these parries, the game seems to go out of its way to encourage a more fast-paced, aggressive style of play. A targeted shield slam move lets you leap quickly across great distances to get up close and personal with enemy demons, at which point you can use one of a variety of melee weapons for some extremely satisfying, crunchy close quarters beatdowns (though these melee attacks are limited by their own slowly recharging ammo system). You might absorb some damage in the process of going in for these aggressive close-up attacks, but don’t worry—defeated enemies tend to drop heaps of health, armor, and ammo, depending on the specific way they were killed. I’d often find myself dancing on the edge of critically low health after an especially aggressive move, only to recover just in time by finishing off a major demon. Doubling back for a shield slam on a far-off “fodder” enemy can also be an effective strategy for quickly escaping a sticky situation and grabbing some health in the process. The back-and-forth tug between these aggressive encroachments and the more conservative parry-based turtling makes for some exciting moment-to-moment gameplay, with enough variety in the enemy mix to never feel too stale. Effectively managing your movement and attack options in any given firefight feels complex enough to be engaging without ever tipping into overwhelming, as well. Even so, working throughDoom: The Dark Ages, there was a part of me that missed the more free-form, three-dimensional acrobatics ofDoom Eternal’s double jumps and air dashes. Compared to the almost balletic, improvisational movement in that game, playingThe Dark Agestoo often felt like it devolved into something akin to a simple rhythm game; simply wait for each green “note” to reach the bottom of the screen, then hit the button to activate your counterattack. In between chapters,Doom: The Dark Agesbreaks things up with some extremely ponderous cutscenes featuring a number of religious and political factions, both demon and human, jockeying for position and control in an interdimensional war. This mostly involves a lot of tedious standing around discussing the Heart of Argent (a McGuffin that’s supposed to grant the bearer the power of a god) and debating how, where, and when to deploy the Slayer (that’s you) as a weapon. I watched these cutscenes out of a sense of professional obligation, but I tuned out at points and thus had trouble following the internecine intrigue that seemed to develop between factions whose motivations and backgrounds never seemed to be sufficiently explained or delineated. Most players who aren’t reviewing the game should feel comfortable skipping these scenes and getting back to the action as quickly as possible. The levels themselves are all dripping with the usual mix of Hellish symbology and red-and-black gore, with mood lighting so dark that it can be hard to see a wall right in front of your face. Design-wise, the chapters seem to alternate betweenDoom’s usual system of twisty enemy-filled corridors and more wide-open outdoor levels. The latter are punctuated by a number of large, open areas where huge groups of demons simply teleport in as soon as you set foot in the pre-set engagement zone. These battle arenas might have a few inclines or spires to mix things up, but for the most part, they all feel depressingly similar and bland after a while. If you’ve stood your ground in one canyon, you’ve stood your ground in them all. Each level is also absolutely crawling with secret collectibles hidden in various nooks and crannies, which often tease you with a glimpse through a hole in some impassable wall or rock formation. Studying the map screen for a minute more often than not reveals the general double-back path you’ll need to follow to find the hidden entrance behind these walls, even as finding the precise path can involve solving some simple puzzles or examining your surroundings for one particularly well-hidden bit that will allow you to advance. After all the enemies were cleared in one particularly vast open level, I spent a good half hour picking through every corner of the map until I tracked down the hidden pathways leading to every stray piece of gold and collectible trinket. It was fine as a change of pace—and lucrative in terms of upgrading my weapons and shield for later fights—but it felt kind of lonely and quiet compared to the more action-packed battles. Speaking of changes of pace, by far the worst parts ofDoom: The Dark Agescome when the game insists on interrupting the usual parry-and-shoot gameplay to put you in some sort of vehicle. This includes multiple sections where your quick-moving hero is replaced with a lumbering 30-foot-tall mech, which slouches pitifully down straight corridors toward encounters with equally large demons. These mech battles play out as the world’s dullest fistfights, where you simply wail on the attack buttons while occasionally tapping the dodge button to step away from some incredibly slow and telegraphed counterattacks. I found myself counting the minutes until these extremely boring interludes were over. The sections where your Slayer rides a dragon for some reason are ever-so-slightly more interesting, if only because the intuitive, fast-paced flight controls can be a tad more exciting. Unfortunately, these sections don’t give you any thrilling dogfights or complex obstacle courses to take advantage of these controls, topping out instead in a few simplistic chase sequences where you take literally no incoming fire. Between those semi-engaging chase sequences is a seemingly endless parade of showdowns with stationary turrets. These require your dragon to hover frustratingly still in mid-air, waiting patiently for an incoming energy attack to dodge, which in turn somehow powers up your gun enough to take out the turret in a counterattack. How anyone thought thatthiswas the most engaging use of a seemingly competent third-person flight-combat system is utterly baffling. Those too-frequent interludes aside,Doom: The Dark Agesis a more-than-suitable attempt to shake up theDoomformula with a completely new style of gameplay. While the more conservative, parry-based shield system takes some getting used to—and may require adjusting some of your long-standing Doom muscle memory in the process—it's ultimately a welcome and engaging way to add new types of interaction to the long-running franchise.

    "title": "Europe launches program to lure scientists away from the US",
    "article_text": "EU will spend over $500 million to recruit researchers and scientists. The European Commission has launched a new initiative to attract researchers and scientists to theEuropean Union—especially those from the United States. The Choose Europe for Science program, backed with more than half a billion dollars, is designed to offer an alternative to researchers who have beenforced to seek new opportunitiesfollowingcuts in scientific fundingimposed byPresident Donald Trump’sadministration. The program will invest €500 million ($568 million) between 2025 and 2027 to recruit specialists in various fields of knowledge to come and work in Europe. The initiative also includes a target for member states to allocate 3 percent of their GDP to R&D projects by 2030. “The role of science in today’s world is questioned,” warned Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in astatementon Tuesday. “What a gigantic miscalculation. I believe that science holds the key to our future here in Europe. Without it, we simply cannot address today’s global challenges—from health to new tech, from climate to oceans.” The plan, originally proposed by the French government, also proposes creating long-term “super grants” for outstanding researchers, to provide them with financial stability; these would last for seven years. The program also plans to double the amount of financial support available this year for those who decide to move to the European Union. “Europe will always choose science,” said Von der Leyen. “Europe has everything that is needed for science to thrive: We have the stable and sustained investment; we have the infrastructure; we have the commitment to open and collaborative science, we have a social market economy that delivers access to good schools, education, and health care for all.” However, she acknowledged that scientists in the EU still face more complex bureaucracy compared to other regions of the world. “We know that the path from fundamental research to business and to market is not straightforward or fast enough here in Europe,” she said. In this regard, she announced that the bloc will introduce a new European Research Area Act, to enshrine in law the right for knowledge and data to move freely within the bloc and so strengthen research freedom. According to figures from the European Commission, 2 million researchers are currently working on the continent, which represents a quarter of the global total. Von der Leyen also highlighted that the EU manages the largest international research program: Horizon Europe, with an annual budget of more than €95 billion. This funding has supported 33 Nobel Prize winners over the past four decades. “We want Europe to be a leader in priority technologies from AI to quantum, from space, semiconductors, and microelectronics to digital health, genomics, and biotechnology. We want scientists, researchers, academics and highly skilled workers to choose Europe,” Von der Leyen concluded. President Trump’sproposed budgetfor the 2026 fiscal year outlines deep cuts to US scientific agencies. If enacted, it would see the National Science Foundation budget cut by 56 percent, while the budget for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) would fall by roughly 40 percent. This would follow the large number of funding withdrawals and stop-work orders that have already been made since Trump’s inauguration in January. In March, the US government canceled more than 200 federal grants for research onHIV. It also reduced NIH funding forCovid-related studies, and imposed a $400F million cut in funding to Columbia University, in retaliation for pro-Palestinian protests on its campus amid the conflict with Israel. In April, an NIH facility tasked with studyingEbolaand other infectious diseases wasordered to stop research. These decisions, together with concerns about future funding cuts, have led to an exodus of researchers from the United States, with scientists now seeking to continue their careers outside of the country. Ananalysis published inNature foundthat 75 percent of American scientists surveyed were considering leaving the country. Meanwhile,data from Nature Careers, a global scientific employment platform, reveals that between January and March of this year, American professionals sent 32 percent more applications to foreign institutions compared to the same period in 2024. Furthermore, the number of American users exploring opportunities outside the country increased by 35 percent. At the same time, international interest in working in the United States has declined significantly. During the first quarter of the year, applications from scientists from Canada, China, and Europe to US research centersfellby 13 percent, 39 percent, and 41 percent, respectively. Against this backdrop, European institutions have intensified their efforts to attract US talent. Aix-Marseille University, in France, recently launchedA Safe Place for Science, a program aimed at hosting US researchers dismissed, censored, or limited by Trump’s policies. This project is backed with an investment of approximately €15 million. Along the same lines, the Max Planck Society in Germany has announced the creation of theMax Planck Transatlantic Program, whose purpose is to establish joint research centers with US institutions. “Outstanding investigators who have to leave the US, we will consider for director positions,” the society’s director Patrick Cramer said in a speech discussing the program. Juan Cruz Cigudosa, Spain’s secretary of state for science, innovation, and universities, has stressed that Spain is also actively involved in attracting global scientific talent, and is prioritizing areas such as quantum biotechnology, artificial intelligence, advanced materials, and semiconductors, as well as anything that strengthens the country’s technological sovereignty. To achieve this, the government of Pedro Sánchez has strengthened existing programs. The ATRAE program—which aims to entice established researchers into bringing their work to Spain—has been reinforced with €45 million to recruit scientists who are leaders in strategic fields, with a special focus on US experts who feel “looked down upon.” This program is offering additional funding of €200,000 euros per project to those selected from the United States. Similarly, the Ramón y Cajal program—created 25 years ago to further the careers of young scientists—has increased its funding by 150 percent since 2018, allowing for 500 researchers to be funded per year, of which 30 percent are foreigners. “We are going to intensify efforts to attract talent from the United States. We want them to come to do the best science possible, free of ideological restrictions. Scientific and technological knowledge make us a better country, because it generates shared prosperity and a vision of the future,” said Cigudosa in a statement to the Spanish international news agency EFE after the announcement of the Choose Europe for Science program.

    "title": "A star has been destroyed by a wandering supermassive black hole",
    "article_text": "Second supermassive black hole is a long way from the galaxy's core. Back in 2024, a system set up to identify objects that suddenly brighten found something unusual. Unfortunately, the automated system that was supposed to identify it couldn't figure out what it was looking at. Now, about a year later, we know it's the first tidal disruption event—meaning a star being ripped apart by a supermassive black hole—identified at visual wavelengths. It's also a rather unusual one, in that the supermassive black hole in question does not reside at the center of its galaxy. Instead, there's an even more massive object there, which is feeding on matter at the same time. The object, now called AT2024tvd, was identified by theZwicky Transient Facility, which is set up to scan the entire northern sky over a period of just two days, after which it repeats the process. Combined with software that scans the data for changes, these repeated exposures allow the system to identify objects that suddenly brighten (or, potentially, anything that suddenly goes dark). Among the events it can identify are tidal disruption events, where a star gets spaghettified by the enormous gravity of a supermassive black hole. Normally, supermassive black holes live at the center of galaxies. So, the software that does the scanning will only flag something as a potential tidal disruption event if it coincides with the presence of a previous light source at the same location. And that wasn't the case with AT2024tvd, which appeared to be over 2,500 light-years from the center of the galaxy. As a result, the software didn't flag it as a potential tidal disruption event; people didn't figure out what it was until they looked more closely at it. Fortunately, researchers were able to arrange for follow-up observations at wavelengths ranging from X-rays to radio waves. At least two of the observatories—the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Array radiotelescopes—could resolve both the object that brightened suddenly (meaning AT2024tvd) and a bright spot at the center of the galaxy, which appears to correspond to the supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center. The fact that it's bright indicates that it's presently feeding on matter. All of the observations indicated that AT2024tvd is a tidal disruption event. For example, it maintained a high temperature throughout the observations, unlike a supernova, which tends to cool down over time. There were also fewer high-energy X-rays than one would expect from a supernova. The UV spectrum also looked like previously identified tidal disruption events, with the signature of elements like carbon and nitrogen that don't require a supernova to be produced. That makes this the fourth tidal disruption event we've identified that's the product of a supermassive black hole not located at the center of the galaxy. It's also the first that was initially identified at visible wavelengths. This raises two questions: why are there two supermassive black holes here, and why is one of them not in the center of the galaxy? The first is relatively easy to answer. It appears that large galaxies are the product of galaxy mergers, essentially built by combining multiple smaller galaxies. Each of these small galaxies would come into the merger with its own black hole. In most cases, these newly arrived supermassive black holes would end up at the center of the galaxy and eventually merge with the central supermassive black hole. But note the phrasing there: \"in most cases\" and \"eventually.\" Even in the cases where a merger takes place, the process is slow, potentially taking millions or even billions of years. As a result, a large galaxy might have as many as 100 extremely large black holes wandering about, with about 10 of them having masses of over 106times that of the Sun. And the galaxy that AT2024tvd resides in is very large. One consequence of all these black holes wandering about is that not all of them will end up merging. If two of them approach the central black hole at the same time, then it's possible for gravitational interactions to eject the smallest of them at nearly the velocity needed to escape the galaxy entirely. As a result, for millions of years afterwards, these supermassive black holes may be found at quite a distance from the galaxy's core. At the moment, it's not possible to tell which of these explanations accounts for AT2024tvd's location. The galaxy it's in doesn't seem to have undergone a recent merger, but there is the potential for this to be a straggler from a far-earlier merger. It's notable that all of the galaxies where we've seen an off-center tidal disruption event are very large. The paper that describes AT2024tvd suggests this is no accident: larger galaxies mean more mergers in the past, and thus more supermassive black holes floating around the interior. They also suggest that off-center events will be the only ones we see in large galaxies. That's because larger galaxies will have larger supermassive black holes at their center. And, once a supermassive black hole gets big enough, its event horizon is so far out that stars can pass through it before they get disrupted, and all the energetic release would take placeinsidethe black hole. Presumably, if you were close enough to see this happen, the star would just fade out of existence. The arXiv. Abstract number:2502.17661(About the arXiv).

Stratolaunch used the same Talon-A vehicle for both flights, demonstrating its reusability, a characteristic that sets it apart from competitors. Zachary Krevor, Stratolaunch's president and CEO, said his team aims to ramp up to monthly flights by the end of the year. A 21st century X-15... This is the first time anyone in the United States has flown a reusable hypersonic rocket plane since the last flight of the X-15,the iconic rocket-powered aircraftthat pushed the envelope of high-altitude, high-speed flight 60 years ago. Like the Talon-A, the X-15 released from a carrier jet and ignited a rocket engine to soar into the uppermost layers of the atmosphere. But the X-15 had a pilot in command, while the Talon-A flies on autopilot. Stratolaunch is one of several companies participating in a US military program to test parts and technologies for use on future hypersonic weapons.\"Why the autonomous flight matters is because hypersonic systems are now pushing the envelope in terms of maneuvering capability, maneuvering beyond what can be done by the human body,\" Krevor said. New details about another recent hypersonic test.A hypersonic missile test on April 25 validated the launch mechanism for the US Navy Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapon program, the Defense Department said on May 2. The CPS missile, the Navy's name for what the US Army calls the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida,Aviation Week & Space Technology reports. While the Army and Navy versions use the same hypersonic glide vehicle and missile, they use different launch mechanisms. Last year, the Army tested its version of the hypersonic missile launcher. Now, the Navy has validated the cold-gas launch mechanism it will install on guided missile destroyers. Deploying soon... \"The cold-gas approach allows the Navy to eject the missile from the platform and achieve a safe distance above the ship prior to first stage ignition,\" said Vice Adm Johnny R. Wolfe Jr., director of the Navy's Strategic Systems Programs, which is the lead designer of the common hypersonic missile. The Army plans to field its Long Range Hypersonic Weapon—also called \"Dark Eagle\"—with a combat unit later this year, while the Navy's version won't be ready for testing at sea until 2027 or 2028. Both missiles are designed for conventional (non-nuclear) strikes. The Army's Dark Eagle will be the US military's first operational hypersonic weapon. Sentinel needs new silos.The Air Force will have to dig entirely new nuclear missile silos for the LGM-35A Sentinel, creating another complication for a troubled program that is already facing future cost and schedule overruns,Defense News reports. The Air Force originally hoped the existing silos that have housed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles could be adapted to launch Sentinel missiles, which would be more efficient than digging entirely new silos. But a test project at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California showed that approach would be fraught with further problems and cause the program to run even further behind and over budget, the service said. Rising costs... Sentinel, developed by Northrop Grumman, will replace the Air Force's fleet of Minuteman III ICBMs, which entered service in 1970, as the land-based leg of the military's nuclear triad. Sentinel was originally expected to cost $77.7 billion, but projected future costs ran so severely over budget that in January 2024, the program triggered a review process known as a critical Nunn-McCurdy breach. After that review, the Pentagon last year concluded Sentinel was too critical to national security to abandon, but ordered the Air Force to restructure it to bring its costs under control. Additional studies of the program are highlighting more potential problems. Gilmour says it (hopefully) will wait no more.The Australian launch startup Gilmour Space Technologies has been given approval by Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority for the debut launch of its Eris orbital rocket,InnovationAus.com reports. There is still one final regulatory hurdle, a final sign-off from the Australian Space Agency. If that happens in the next few days, Gilmour's launch window will open May 15. The company has announced tentative launch schedules before, only to be thwarted by technical issues, regulatory hangups, or bad weather. Most recently, Gilmour got within six days of its targeted launch date in March before regulatory queries and the impact of a tropical cyclone forced a delay. Stand by for history... The launch of Gilmour's three-stage Eris rocket will be historic. If successful, the 82-foot-tall (25-meter) rocket will be Australia's first homegrown orbital launcher. Eris is capable of hauling cargos up to 672 pounds (305 kilograms) to orbit, according to Gilmour. The company has dispatched a small team from its Gold Coast headquarters to the launch site in Queensland, on Australia's northeastern coast, to perform testing on the vehicle after it remained dormant for weeks.(Submitted by trainticket) Fresh insights into one of SpaceX's worst days.When a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on its launch pad nearly nine years ago, SpaceX officials initially struggled to explain how it could have happened. The lack of a concrete explanation for the failure led SpaceX engineers to pursue hundreds of theories. One was the possibility that an outside \"sniper\" had shot the rocket. This theory appealed to SpaceX founder Elon Musk. A building leased by SpaceX's main competitor in launch, United Launch Alliance, lay just a mile away from the Falcon 9 launch pad, and a video around the time of the explosion indicated a flash on its roof.Ars has now obtained a lettersent to SpaceX by the Federal Aviation Administration more than a month after the explosion, indicating the matter was elevated to the FBI. The bureau looked into it, and what did they find? Nothing, apparently. Investigation terminated... \"The FBI has informed us that based upon a thorough and coordinated review by the appropriate Federal criminal and security investigative authorities, there were no indications to suggest that sabotage or any other criminal activity played a role in the September 1 Falcon 9 explosion,\" an FAA official wrote in the letter to SpaceX. Ultimately, engineers determined the explosion was caused by the sudden failure of a high-pressure helium tank on the Falcon 9's upper stage. Eric Schmidt's motivations become clearer.In the nearly two months since former Google chief executive Eric Schmidtacquired Relativity Space, the billionaire has not said much publicly about his plans for the launch company. However, his intentions for Relativity are becoming increasingly clear: He wants to have the capability to launch a significant amount of computing infrastructure into space,Ars reports. During a congressional hearing last month, Schmidt discussed the need for more electricity to power data centers that will facilitate the computing needs for AI development and applications. How big this crisis is... \"People are planning 10 gigawatt data centers,\" Schmidt said at the hearing. \"Gives you a sense of how big this crisis is.\" In an exchange with my colleague Eric Berger on X, Schmidt seemed to confirm he bought Relativity Space as a means to support the development of data centers in space. Such data centers, ideally, would be powered by solar panels and be able to radiate heat into the vacuum of space. Relativity's Terran R rocket, still in development, is well-sized to play a role in launching the infrastructure for data centers in space. But several big questions remain: How big would these data centers be? Where would they go within an increasingly cluttered low-Earth orbit? Could space-based solar power meet their energy needs? Can all of this heat be radiated away efficiently in space? Economically, would any of this make sense? Rocket Lab, meet Rocket Cargo.Rocket Lab’s next-generation Neutron rocket has been selected for an experimental US Air Force mission to test rapid, global, cargo-delivery capabilities, a milestone for the company as it pushes further into the national security launch market,Space News reports. The mission, slated for no earlier than 2026, will fall under the Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) \"Rocket Cargo\" program, which explores how commercial launch vehicles might one day deliver materiel to any point on Earth within hours—a vision akin to airlift logistics via spaceflight. A new mission for Neutron... Peter Beck, Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, said the Rocket Cargo contract from AFRL represents an \"experimental phase\" of the program. \"It'll be interesting to see if that turns into a full requirement for an operational capability,\" he said Thursday. Neutron is expected to carry a payload that will reenter Earth’s atmosphere, demonstrating the rocket’s ability to safely transport and deploy cargo. SpaceX's Starship, with roughly 10 times more payload lift capacity than Neutron, is also on contract with AFRL for demonstrations for the Rocket Cargo program. Meanwhile, Beck said Neutron remains on schedule for its inaugural launch from Wallops Island, Virginia, later this year. Trump calls for canceling the Space Launch System.The Trump administration released its \"skinny\" budget proposal earlier this week. Overall, NASA is asked to take a 25 percent cut in its budget, from about $25 billion to $18.8 billion. There are also significant changes proposed in NASA's biggest-ticket exploration programs. The budget would cancel the Lunar Gateway that NASA has started developing and end the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft after two more flights, Artemis II and Artemis III,Ars reports. A statement from the White House calls the SLS rocket \"grossly expensive\" with projected costs of $4 billion per launch. If not SLS, then what? ...\"The budget funds a program to replace SLS and Orion flights to the Moon with more cost-effective commercial systems that would support more ambitious subsequent lunar missions,\" the Trump administration wrote. There are no further details about those commercial systems. NASA has contracted with SpaceX and Blue Origin to develop reusable landers for the Moon, and both of these systems include vehicles to move from Earth orbit to the Moon. In the budget proposal, the White House sets a priority for a human expedition to Mars to follow the Artemis program's lunar landing. FAA unlocks SpaceX launch cadence.Although we are still waiting for SpaceX to signal when it will fly the Starship rocket again, the company got some good news from the Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday,Ars reports. After a lengthy review, the federal agency agreed to allow SpaceX to substantially increase the number of annual launches from its Starbase launch site in South Texas. Previously, the company was limited to five launches, but now it will be able to conduct up to 25 Starship launches and landings during a calendar year. Waiting for clearance ...Although the new finding permits SpaceX to significantly increase its flight rate from South Texas, the company still has work to do before it can fly Starship again. The company's engineers are still working to get the massive rocket back to flight after its eighth mission broke apart off the coast of Florida on March 6. This was the second time, in two consecutive missions, that the Starship upper stage failed during its initial phase of flight. After two consecutive failures, there will be a lot riding on the next test flight of Starship. It will also be the first time the company attempts to fly a first stage of the rocket for a second time.According to some sources, if additional testing of this upper stage goes well, Starship could launch as early as May 19. This date is also supported by a notice to mariners, but it should be taken as notional rather than something to be confident in. SpaceX adds to its dominion.Elon Musk’s wish to create his own city has come true,the Texas Tribune reports. On Saturday, voters living around SpaceX’s Starship rocket testing and launch facility in South Texas approved a measure to incorporate the area as a new city. Unofficial results later Saturday night showed the election was a landslide: 212 voted in favor; 6 opposed. After the county certifies the results, the new city will be official. Elections have consequences ...Only 283 people, those who live within the boundaries of the proposed city, were eligible to vote in the election. ATexas Newsroomanalysis of the voter rolls showed two-thirds of them either work for SpaceX or had already indicated their support. The three unopposed people who ran to lead the city also have ties to SpaceX. It’s unclear if Musk, whose primary residence is at Starbase, cast a ballot. The vote clears the way for Musk to try to capture more control over the nearby public beach, which must be closed for launches.

    "title": "People on Ozempic Are Drinking Way Less",
    "article_text": "Ozempic and similar drugs aren’t just for weight loss, more and more research is finding. New data is the latest to show that GLP-1 medications help lower people’s alcohol consumption, too. Scientists in Ireland and Saudi Arabia conducted the study, which involved around 200 patients who were prescribed GLP-1 drugs to manage their obesity. They found that people not only lost weight on the drugs, they also tended to reduce their alcohol intakeâby up to two-thirds for those who drank the most beforehand. The findings strengthen the case for GLP-1s as an addiction treatment, the researchers say. Semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and similar GLP-1 drugs arefar more effectiveat helping people lose weight than diet and exercise alone. But some scientists have also begun to notice that these drugs may help reduce people’s cravings for things besides food, including potentially harmful drugs like opioids, cocaine, and alcohol.Earlystudieshavestarted to support these anecdotal observations as well. Weight Loss Drug Users Are Giving Up Their Vices This new study was prospective, meaning the researchers proactively tracked how people’s alcohol use changed after starting GLP-1 therapy (many past similar studies were retrospective, which only look back in time). The study participants were real-life patients prescribed either semaglutide or liraglutide (an older GLP-1 drug) for weight loss. The participants reported their level of alcohol use before starting the drug, then were asked to come back for follow-up visits three and six months later. Overall, 188 people returned for at least one follow-up visit. And people who drank alcohol reported drinking less on average after starting a GLP-1 drug. This reduction was especially apparent in those who drank the most to begin with: high consumers (defined as drinking over 11 drinks a week) reported a 68% reduction in their alcohol use, from around 23 drinks a week on average to 8 drinks weekly. That level of reduction is comparable to the effectiveness of existing treatments for alcohol use disorder, the study researchers note. “Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in alcohol intake among patients treated with GLP-1 RAs,” they wrote in their paper, which is set to bepresentedthis weekend at the annual European Congress on Obesity. The findings were alsopublishedearlier this year in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism. The study does have limitations, such as a lack of a control group and a relatively small sample size. There is also still some mystery as how exactly these drugs could affect drug cravings, though it’s suspected that GLP-1 receptors in the brain regulate our response to rewarding and potentially addictive stimuli like alcohol. But the evidence is mounting for GLP-1s having another life as a treatment for substance use disorders. Semaglutide Shows Major Promise for Treating Serious Liver Disease The authors note that there was a weak positive correlation between the amount of weight someone lost and how much less alcohol they consumedâa connection that makes sense, given how rich in calories alcoholic drinks tend to be. So at the very least, these drugs might serve a dual function for people struggling with their weight and their drinking habits at the same time, the authors say. “These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for GLP-1 RAs in managing co-occurring obesity and alcohol use,” the researchers wrote. Ultimately, it will take randomized and controlled clinical trials to truly know whether semaglutide can become a reliable front-line option for substance use disorders, some of which arealready underway. alcoholGLP-1OzempicSemaglutide Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present. Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox. Semaglutide and similar GLP-1 drugs are poised to become frontline treatments for a severe form of liver disease. New research finds that ER visits related to semaglutide use might be on the rise. Even the solid proposals set out by the Trump administration are being undermined by its actions taken elsewhere. A recent survey reveals the foods that people are less likely to eat once they start taking GLP-1 medications like Ozempic. A new review of clinical trial data finds evidence that GLP-1 drugs can meaningfully reduce dementia risk in people with type 2 diabetes. Stanford Medicine researchers have identified a promising, naturally occurring molecule that could help people lose weightâwithout the nauseating symptoms now commonly seen with GLP-1 drugs.

    "title": "Jony Ive Can’t Save Us From the iPhone Addiction He Helped Create",
    "article_text": "The legendary former Apple designer Jony Ive has a few regrets. The man helped bring us the iPhone, which in turn was the advent of the smartphone and social media revolution. Now Ive isworking with OpenAIâthe company that sparked todayâs AI fixationâto design some kind of AI-centric hardware that he says will help him atone for societyâs lingering screen fixation. In aninterviewwith Stripe CEO Patrick Collison published Thursday, Ive responded to a question about the ill nature of todayâs smartphone-obsessed world. He specifically cited social media as a greater societal ill, though he stopped short of getting into specifics of whatâs truly wrong with the apps (other than the obvious examples of extreme polarization and mass distribution of falsehoods and propaganda). Ive worked at Apple for 27 years beforedeparting from his roleas Chief Design Officer in 2019. His biggest successes included the original iMac, though he was hand in hand with Steve Jobs helping bring us the iPod and later the iPhone. âSome of the products I was very involved with, I think there were some unintended consequences that were far from pleasant.â Ive said. âMy issue is even though there was no intention, I think there was still some responsibility, and that weighs on me.â We still donât know much aboutIveâs company LoveFromand his prospective AI-centric device. Heâs working alongside fellow designer Marc Newson and has backing from several big-name investors. And still, itâs hard not to remain skeptical. We went down the AI gadget rabbit hole last year with a slew of devices meant toâin some wayâreplace our smartphones. The biggest flop of them all was theHumane Ai Pin. The device could access an AI chatbot with an internet connection, but its AI mostly failed to perform tasks that the typical smartphone could handle better. The company latersold all its assets to HP. There are plenty of other examples of projects that missed the mark, such as theRabbit R1which promised a similar level of AI fidelity and now exists more as a smart, though perfunctory bright orange AI toy. âWhat I find encouraging about AI is that itâs very rare to have a discussion around AI and there not to be appropriate concerns about safety,â Ive told Collison. There is a considerable amount of skepticism surrounding generative AI, not only in its impact on society but also in whether it can do everything that big tech firmsâincluding Ive’s buddies at OpenAIâpromise it can. There are signs that AIâs progress with current training processesis slowing downdue to a lack of new data to feed it. Despite this, AI has already damaged several institutions of modern society.New York Magazinereleased a report this week showing that students are using generative AI chatbots to write essays en masse. Some users are smart enough to put typos in their copy or run their essays through multiple chatbots to fool their teachers or professors. And thatâs before you get to the implications of AIâs impact on copyright and the job security of people in many creative professions. Iveâs next product has to do more than give people access to yet another chatbot. If the Humane AI Pin proved anything, itâs that Appleâs design for a smartphone has staying power, as much as Ive might regret it. As an aside, if Ive dislikes the route social media has taken society, the former Apple lead should ask OpenAI CEO Sam Altman about the supposedsocial media platform he’s reportedly building.

    "article_text": "Cassian Andor’s purpose as a messenger, as foretold by the Force healer, comes into play in one pivotal moment in this week’sAndor. AsGhorman falls, the bellhop that assisted him earlier in the season, Thela (Stefon Crepon), delivers “Rebellions are built on hope” as a core moment for him to carry and share It totallygives new meaning to its canonwhen Cassian says it inRogue One: A Star Wars Storyto Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), and it came about thanks to show creator Tony Gilroy’s son. In an interview withEntertainment Weekly,the showrunner said that when it was said inRogue One, he assumed it was just already a thing in theStar Warslore. “My son is a bigStar Warsfan, and he often comes to the house and busts my balls at the computer about how little I know,” Gilroy admitted. “One day he’s there at the house and he’s goofballing on me, and he’s like, ‘Well, who’s going to introduce ‘rebellions are built on hope?”” He continued, “And I go, ‘What do you mean?’ … He goes, ‘Well, inRogue One, Diego [Luna, who plays Andor] says it. And [Felicity Jones’ character] Jyn repeats it.’ And I go, ‘Well, isn’t that from somewhere?’ He goes, ‘No, man, what are you talking about? You better figure that out.'” Which meant the master scribe of thisStar Warsera had to think quickly, so he gave it to Thela with the Ghorman backdrop fully solidifying its purpose. “The hotel clerk is such a groovy little character,” he said, and quipped about the Easter egg moment, “it definitely comes from my son busting me on not having it in earlier [scripts].

    "article_text": "It might be seen as irony that technology is the undoing ofBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch, given thatBlack Mirrorstories tend to focus on the dangers of relying on technology. Though the2018 special episode, which allowed viewers toplot their own journeyswith the help of an on-screen pop-up menu,initially survivedÂNetflix’s purge of its interactive content, the time has now come to say good-bye. Varietyreports thatBandersnatchwill be leaving the streamer May 12, so if you want a last hurrah with aspiring video game creator Stefan Butler (Fionn Whitehead), you’d better make some time this weekend for it. Netflix’s other lingering interactive special,Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs the Reverend, will also be removed at the same time. Bandersnatch‘s departure from Netflix comes not long after the streamer debutedBlack Mirror‘s seventh season, so it’s not a mark against the series as a whole. Rather, the streamer is continuing its pivot away from what was once a big push into interactive programming. AsGizmodo notedin November 2024, andthe Vergefirst reported, Netflix is focusing its technological explorations on games rather than narrative shows. To that end, a new game arrived to tie in with the newBlack Mirrorseason:Thronglets, which replicates the terrifying, ever-needy, constantly expanding online ecosystem introduced in the episode “Plaything.” And, speaking of the newBlack Mirrorseason, if you get lonesome forBandersnatch, a couple of its charactersâincluding Will Poulter’s eccentric and unstable game designer Colin Ritmanâpop up in “Plaything” as well.

    "title": "Who Was Syril Karn?",
    "article_text": "“Who are you?” is the question that haunts Syril Karn for his entire life. From the moment we met him, prim and proper security uniform modified to be just so, a sense of purpose in a vast and uncaring universe has been at the core of understanding what makes Syril tick. The journey that took him across the galaxy reached a climactic moment inAndor‘s penultimate arc this week, and raised that haunting question once more. But the answer is more complicated than mere villain inÂAndor‘s narrative, doubting or otherwise. Because even as the hero of his own story, the man we know Syril to be,until the very end, is shaped less by himself and more by the systems and structures that made a tool of him. This doesn’t excuse Syril of being responsible for what he abets by the end of his story on Ghorman, of course. No matter how much he doubts by the time of the massacre unfolding around him what he’s helped bring about, he still made the choice to be an agent of Imperial interests, both willing soldier and dutiful boyfriend. In not getting the chance to see the light, but to instead face one last ignominy, being so thrown by the villain he built up in his head as Cassian Andor, staring at him blankly and asking that dreaded questionâwho are youâthat he fails to either take the shot he’s waited years to take or notice the kill shot being lined up on himself is fitting punishment for those choices, after all. But the question is left as unanswered to us as it was to Cassian and Syril alike. Who was Syril Karn? He was whoever anyoneneeded him to be. As long as it meant recognition, as long as it meant service, and in many ways, as long as it meant love. As misguided as he might have been, one thing that is repeatedly shown to us throughout Syril’s arc is that he does at the very least try to do what he thinks is right. It’s presented to us as an almost comically annoying trait when we first meet him, but we’re introduced to Syril as a corporate security officer unwilling to sweep the death of two of his colleagues under the rug, in the name of doing things not just for justice, but by the book he was given. It comes up again and again in his journey, this desire to do the right thing being tied into and twisted by what is, ultimately, an similar desire that breeds subservience to authority, regardless of that authority’s scruples. When we meet Syril’s mother Eedy in that brilliant, intoxicatingly characterful moment of her slapping him across the face before giving him a hug, we’re immediately told the kind of environment Syril grew up in. An absent father, and a mother similarly obsessed with status and hierarchy as he would come to be, created an environment primed for Syril to seek approval and validation outside of his family, regardless of the source. Perhaps, if Syril had been born 50 years earlier, that desire could’ve forged him into model citizen of the Galactic Republicâimperfect in its own ways, but still a structure that would’ve satiated his yearning for order in the chaos of the universe, a satisfaction with regulation and servitude, and moulded him a long a different line of thought. But instead, Syril came of age in the Republic’s twilight, and was an impressionable young adult at the exact moment an authoritarian regime like the Empire and its corporate system cousins needed exactly that. That’s how you get the low-level security officer who surreptitiously modifies his uniform, in the hopes of recognition. It’s how you get the same officer willing to overcommit a dozen men to a murder investigation, in spit of pressure to do otherwise, forever changing the course of his life. It’s how, when that investigation blows up in his face, you get Syril simultaneously committing to a life of bureaucracy while also practically throwing himself into the arms of the ISB, a level of even higher authority. Young men like Syrilâseeking order and the warmth of recognition, of a kind of love, in equal measureâare perfect forStar Wars‘ Imperial structure, because they make for willing sculptures, to be shaped into tools and into weapons as the structure so desires: the Empire runs on evil, but that evil is aided and abetted, and normalized across a galaxy, by a generation of Syrils Karn. The blurred line between love and recognition in this structure becomes even further blurred inÂAndor‘s second season, as the unlikely,compellingly off-putting romancebetween Syril and Dedra flourishes alongside the latter’s use of him as an eager field agent. At last, Syril seemingly has everything he wants: getting to play the dutiful Imperial citizen helping out in any way he can, while also getting the literal love of that regime through loving Dedra. But as much as the Empire craves people like Syril to use up in its engines, it similarly craves pushing them further and further as its desire for power and control becomes more brazen with confidence. So when Dedra and the Empire alike push that need, that yearning in Syril, to the limit on Ghorman, there was no other way he could break thanÂbadly. His physical abuse of Dedra when he finds out how much she knew about the Empire’s plans for the Ghor is horrific, but it’s a response born out of the thing the Empire made Syril into, a violent response to the betrayal of his subservienceâof his love of Dedra and his love of the structure she representsâthat dictates itself through violence. And it’s all that that sets the stage for his final act. Syril’s final encounter with Cassian is afascinating foil to his firstall those years ago on Ferrix, a question of identity at gunpoint. On Ferrix, it was Cassian aiming the gun, uncaring of who exactly it was that it was pointed at. He needed information that Syril had; whoever he was or turned out to be was inconsequential, and not even worth the blaster bolt Luthen growled at Cassian to put in him. Who Syril Karn was was not a question worth asking in that moment. Five years later, amid the chaos of the Ghorman massacreâa slaughter Syril abetted as he yearned to have an answer to that question, to have purposeâit’s only fitting that Cassian finally asks it. In doing so, Syril is broken one last time: the answer he thought he had built up over those years had just been ripped away from him, the love he thought he’d had as empty as the institution he had given his life to. All that could be left, really, was the silence as the blaster bolt seared through his head. Used up and abandoned, in his final moments Syril Karn was nothingâanother victim of the Empire on a day filled with them. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "That Viral Video About a Woman Hooking Up With the Pope Is Fake",
    "article_text": "Have you seen the video that appears to show a who’s woman shocked to learn the man she hooked up with many years ago just became the pope? The claim is that Chicago-born Robert Prevost, who was elected pope on Thursday and took the name Leo XIV, supposedly had a tryst in his youth with this woman who can’t believe it. But the video is fake. Completely, totally fake. The viral video appears to show a woman talking to two people on her computer, one of whom is supposed to be her mom. “My mom’s situationship is the pope of the Catholic church,” the video’s creator can be heard saying as she laughs. “My mom hooked up with the pope.” The text on the screen claims this sexual encounter happened when her “mom” was 19 years old, something that would seem plausible if it were made by real people out in the world. After all, Prevost didn’t take his solemn vows until he was 26 years old, according to theNew York Times. The problem is that this video was made by a comedian who often makes fake claims in order to go viral. WE LITERALLY JUST DID THE âIâM SO HUNGRY I COULD EAT BOB PREVOSTâ PRANK AND NOW HEâS THE LITERAL POPE. ALSO ALL OF THIS IS âALLEGEDâ (my dad told me to add that lol)#pope#conclave#popeleoxiv#popeleo#situationship#family#funny â¬ original sound – Louisa Melcher The creator, Louisa Melcher, frequently makes videos attached to recent news events, claiming to be at the center of them. For example, she made a video aboutfalling off the stageduring Usher’s Super Bowl halftime show, something peoplethought they sawon TV. Or another about falling off a boat during the Summer Olympics in 2024, which showed her with aneck brace. Sometimes, Melcher won’t necessarily peg her performance to something in the news and appears to create absurd situations out of whole cloth, like when he’s claimed her sister’s fiancÃ© said her name during theirwedding vowsor claimed an influencer had used abad photoof her in a poll judging her attractiveness. In another video, she claims to take the books out ofLittle Free Librariesaround her neighborhood and resells them on Amazon. Who knew my little free book hack would be so controversial ð This is just what works for me. Take it or leave it folks!#littlefreelibrary#booktok#book#bookworm#library#amazon#amazonreseller#hacks â¬ original sound – Louisa Melcher Melcher seems to have really figured out how to hack the social media environment in a way that gets her videos to go viral through rage-bait, and she’s been doing it for years. The astounding part is that the internet is apparently big enough that she can keep making these ridiculous claims, and people don’t recognize her as a comedian. Sometimes, news outlets will even take her viral videos atface valueand run with her claims as reality. And the comments in her videos make it clear that while some people know by now she’s making jokes, a lot of people think she’s serious. “i have a little free library outside my house and if an amazon reseller came and took all the books i would literally cry,” one comment on Melcher’s video reads. “this is so mean.” The video claiming to show her “mom” being shocked about the pope has over 1.4 million views onInstagramand over 5.6 million onTikTokat the time of this writing. But it’s spreading quickly enough on Friday that it looks like it will really explode in popularity over the weekend. But it’s staged. Nothing about it can be trusted. Melcher’s video about the new pope is funny, but it would be much funnier if it were real. If you’re seeing this one in your feed, we’re sad to report it’s completely fake. fake videosFakesLouisa MelcherPopePope Leo XIVviral videos Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "Jane Schoenbrun’s 2021 feature debut,We’re All Going to the World’s Fair, signaled the arrival of a filmmaker with a unique visionânot to mention the ability to fascinate and freak out viewers in new and disturbing ways. That continued with 2024’sI Saw the TV Glow,one of the year’s most adventurous filmsboth stylistically and narratively. So naturally, we’re on board for whatever Schoenbrun is up to nextâand their new movie sounds like it will not disappoint. The Hollywood Reporterbrings the exciting news ofTeenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasmastarring Hannah Einbinder(Hacks)and Gillian Anderson. Schoenbrun describes it as “my best attempt at the âsleepover classicâ: an insane yet cozy midnight odyssey that beckons to unsuspecting viewers from the horror section at the local video store.” In. Sold. 100%. We also love that Schoenbrun says “I make movies I wish existed when I was a kid” and promises thatTeenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasmawill unleash “a plague-like flood of blood, guts, and various other fluids to rain down on us all.” Mubi, which had a huge hit with another body fluid-filled movie last year(The Substance), will be distributing Schoenbrun’s latest in North America and beyond. Just about the only thing we don’t like about this news is that THR doesn’t note a release window.

    "article_text": "San Francisco’s widely relied upon public transportation system, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), went down early Friday morning due to a âcomputer networking problem,âaccording to city officials. The outage brought the entire system to a halt at around 5:00 am local time, forcing commuters to quickly find an alternative travel plan. BART officialsannouncedthat service had been restored across the entire system around 9:30 am local time, though a spokesperson for the agencytold The San Francisco Standard, âRiders should expect residual major delays as we ramp back up.” The system’s shutdown, while temporary, caused a considerable number of logistical issues for riders.According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the transit system averaged about 175,000 riders on weekdays during the month of March. With BART out of order, riders were forced to shift their commute to buses, ride shares, and other alternatives. Some of those options are cost-prohibitiveâSan Franciscoranked in the top 10for most expensive cities for ride sharing. TheChronicle spoke to one personwho opted to wait for the trains to start running again rather than take a Lyft that would have cost $70 to get to his destination. To accommodate the travelers stranded by BART, the San Francisco Municipal Railway offered additional buses and extra trains on some lines. The San Francisco Bay Ferry also used larger boats to make room for more riders,per the Chronicle. The cause of the outage is still unclear, but a spokesperson for BART did furtherexplain what happened to the SF Standard: “BART was unable to properly power up our train control system, which prevented us from safely operating trains,â the spokesperson said.According to the Chronicle, BART Chief Communications Officer Alicia Trost said the issue occurred after overnight maintenance work, but did not say that was specifically the cause. Instead, she said there were âa lot of different reasonsâ that could cause the issue. She did rule out the possibility that it was a cyber attack that knocked the system out. Outages have gotten rarer in recent years for BART, according to the agency’s own data, butdelays have remained a major problem. The transport system hasundergonecost-cutting measures, as well, which has led to some issues going unaddressed and a hiring freeze being put in place, though the city has spent onincreasing police presenceon the transit system and new methods for cracking down on unpaid fares.

    "title": "I Can’t Wait for The Last of Us to Do the Game’s Best Scene",
    "article_text": "With three episodes ofThe Last of Usseason two remaining, we know it’s coming.The best scene in eitherLast of Usgame, in my opinion. And we know it’s coming both becauseit’s in the trailerand because adaptingThe Last of Us Part IIwithout this scenewould be the ultimate disservice. If you’ve played the game, surely, you know what we’re talking about. If you haven’t, and don’t know what the scene is, maybe stop reading here. I’m not going to ruin it with a bunch of details but not knowing exactly how it plays out will make things that much more rewarding. We’re talking, of course, about Ellie’s birthday gift, a flashback the show’s trailer teased way back in March.ÂI even wrote about it almost five years agowhen the game first came out because it was so hugely impactful for me. And, if you go back to that article, I go over the beat by beat of it in the game. Again, I won’t spoil it here, just in case. To finally get to see it adapted in live action, though, is somehow even more exciting. First, that’s because Pedro Pascal’s Joel will have to come back for it. As good as this season has been, not having Pascal in every episode has surely been disappointing for some. Second, we’ve now spent years creating bonds with his version of Joel as well as Bella Ramsey’s version of Ellie, so the scene should play even better than the game. There’s also the anticipation of seeing how co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin bring it to life. How closely will the scene match the game? How far will the visuals go? What will Bella Ramsey’s reactions be to it? How about Joel’s? And, of course, there’s the question of whether TV audiences will fall as in love with the moment as gamers did. Now, here is probably a good time to pull back the curtain. AsI stated in my review ofThe Last of Usseason two, I’ve already seen the whole season. So, I know when this is coming and what it’s like. And while I can’t specifically answer those questions, I can sayâI wrote this, didn’t I? I’m still here, waiting in anticipation. That’s probably a good sign.

    "article_text": "NASA’s VIPER is designed to search for water ice around the Moon’s south pole. But instead of exploring the lunar terrain, the fully assembled four-wheeled robot is in storage at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. After canceling its VIPER mission last year, NASA is still searching for alternatives to launch its lunar rover, and the agency just took another step backward in making it happen. NASA canceled asolicitation for partnership proposalsit had sent out earlier this year, calling on the private sector to take over its VIPER mission. This week, the agencyannouncedÂ it would explore alternative options to deliver its lunar rover to the Moon. “We appreciate the efforts of those who proposed to the Lunar Volatiles Science Partnership Announcement for Partnership Proposals call,” Nicky Fox, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said in a statement. “We look forward to accomplishing future volatiles science with VIPER as we continue NASAâs Moon to Mars exploration efforts.” VIPER, or Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, was originally scheduled to launch in 2023. The launch date was first pushed back to 2024 and later to 2025 due to additional schedule and supply chain delays. In July 2024, thespace agency decided to cancel the mission altogether, stating that it threatens to disrupt other commercial payload missions to the Moon. At first, NASA’s plan was to disassemble the VIPER rover and use its parts for future missions. The decision, however, sparked outrage from the science community over the loss of the lunar explorer. In response, NASA abruptly put together a call for the private sector to take over its robot and send it to the Moon. Space startups, such as Intuitive Machines, stepped up to put together a plan to respond to NASAâs request for information. It’s unclear why NASA has reversed earlier decision to pursue a private partnership to send VIPER to the Moon. NASA has already spent $450 million developing its VIPER mission, and the agency declared that it wouldn’t spend any more money on getting the rover to land on the lunar surface. Without the help of the private sector, NASA’s alternatives for VIPER, at no additional cost from its own pocket, seem rather limited. “The agency will announce a new strategy for VIPER in the future,” NASA wrote in its statement.

    "title": "This X-Files Episode Is Still One of the Scariest Office Horror Stories",
    "article_text": "Late inThe X-Files‘ fifth seasonâjust a few weeks before the firstX-Filesfeature film hit theatersâviewers were plunged into theterrifyingmadness of “Folie Ã  Deux.” A weary Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) trudges to Chicago to check out the latest “monster of the week,” but his head snaps back into the game when he realizes the monster in question just might be targeting him next. Before it flips its approach to put Mulder in its crosshairs, “Folie Ã  Deux”âdirected byX-Filesregular Kim Manners, and written by futureBreaking BadandBetter Call Saulcreator Vince Gilliganâintroduces us to Gary Lambert (Caprica‘s Brian Markinson), a rather ordinary guy working a soul-sucking telemarking job for a vinyl siding company. The calls cycle constantly as Gary reads from a precise script and endures nagging instructions to “dial and smile,” all the better to hook new customers. It’s dull and stressful but not exactly toxicâuntil Gary senses an alarming presence lurking in the office: a giant insect-like creature, masquerading as his boss and turning his co-workers into remote-controlled zombies. It scares him enough to audio-tape a warning about a monster stalking VinylRight employees, which is why the FBI’s resident spooky kids Mulder and Scully (Gillian Anderson) get handed the case. But there’s tension in the FBI office too. Mulder and his own boss, FBI Assistant Director Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), are enduring a surly patch in their relationshipânot for the first or last time. Mulder’s annoyed the Bureau sees him as “monster boy” (to be fair, there’s a solid reason for that), and tells Scully he can handle this “jerk-off assignment” by himself. But once he flounces off to Chicago, he realizes there’s more to this case than he realized, and he does actually need her help. Meanwhile, Gary’s reaching his breaking point as he observes his co-workers systematically transforming into dead-eyed automatons. It’s all the paranoia ofInvasion of the Body Snatchers, down to Gary being the only person who realizes what’s going on. Even the audience can’t tell if what Gary sees is real or the result of a very troubled mind… until Gary takes the entire office hostage, including a visiting Mulder. In the chaos Mulder realizes he canalsosee that Gary’s boss is, in fact, actually a giant insect hellbent on assembling an army of human drones. There’s a certain amount of metaphor at play here, as Garyâwho ends up being shot to death in the standoff after killing an “infected” co-workerârails against a creature who “wants to take away who we are and control us.” It could be a supernatural menace; it could be capitalism. Actual human telemarketers have been largely replaced by robo-calls these days, but in 1998 when the episode aired, everyone still had a land line and generally picked up when the phone rang. In a room crammed with cubicles full of people all reading the same pitch over and over, you can see how “dead-eyed automatons” isn’t too far of a leap. But this isThe X-Files, so something eerie always has to creep in. Even Mulder is skeptical about Gary’s claims at first, but any doubts evaporate once he catches a glimpse of the monster himself. “I saw it too,” he confesses to Scully. She wonders if it’s perhaps a folie Ã  deux, meaning that Mulder was so affected by the experience of being held hostage that he’s now sharing Gary’s delusions. But Mulder’s inclined to point to a larger conspiracy. Maybe Gary’s boss, the otherwise unmemorable Greg Pincus (John Apicella), is actually a manifestation of evil capable of using camouflaging mind tricks to conceal its presence? Turns out there’s some history to back up this admittedly wild-sounding notion. Gary’s audio warning to VinylRight evoked the phrase “hiding in the light,” something that’s popped up in similar X-Files from the past. With some digging, Mulder realizes Pincus has a geographical connection to many of the past incidents. True to form, Scully doesn’t immediately agree with Mulder; what’s more, she’s not keen on the idea of legitimizing Gary’s crazy-guy talk, especially since he murdered a guy on the way out. But Mulder is unusually sincere here. He even begs Scully to believe him, since she’s his “one in five billion”âthe rare person who actually understands where he’s coming from. But it takes an irregular autopsy for Scully to realize that Mulder is right, and something extremely weird is indeed happening. Along with this, an increasingly furious Skinner wonders if this will be the case that finally sees Mulder booted from the FBI into a padded roomâand Mulder does end up strapped down to a hospital bed at one point, frantically shrieking at the nurse to set him free so he can protect himself from the zombie-creating critter. By season five,X-Filesfans had come to appreciate Mulder’s extremely open-minded way of looking at the unexplained. But it’s not that far-fetched to imagine that after years of not being believed, and years of witnessing some of the most bizarre discoveries in the history of the FBI, his own mental health would suffer. Maybe even start to crack? It takes Scully’s intervention to admit that while she can’t explain exactly what happened, there’s enough concrete evidence surrounding the case to confirm that Mulder hasn’t gone full cuckoo. Skinner admits “I’m at a bit of a loss here,” but despite his frustration with Mulderâwhich spirals into a physical fight at one point in the episodeâhe’s fair enough to accept Scully’s judgment as rational and reasonable. At the end of the story, with a still-perplexed Scully suggesting maybe she and Mulder are the ones experiencing the folie Ã  deux, we see a new call center, packed with anxious employees trying to “dial and smile” without losing their minds. Except, of course, there’s a classicX-Filesbutton to push, as one very unlucky man suddenly catches sight of what looks like a giant, freaky insect scuttling around the office.

    "title": "Radar Screens Go Dark at Newark Airport (Again)",
    "article_text": "Radar screens that monitor Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey went completely black for about 90 seconds early Friday morning, according to a new report fromABC News. The outage comes after an identical problem last week when air traffic control screens for the same airport went dark for about 60-90 seconds. The radar outage for Newark on Friday happened at 3:55 a.m., the FAA told Gizmodo over email. Air traffic control for Newark is handled in Philadelphia, where the actual screen outage occurred. “There was a telecommunications outage that impacted communications and radar display at Philadelphia TRACON Area C, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport airspace,” the FAA said in a statement. A private plane was reportedly told to stay at or above 3,000 feet during the incident to avoid any possible collisions, according to ABC. Newark has been plagued with problems recently, including delays and terrifying outages. When screens went black onApril 28the scene was so harrowing that at least half a dozen air traffic controllers have requested mental health support. Their “trauma leave” will allow them to take a break from work for up to45 days. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy held apress conferenceon Thursday, warning that air traffic control systems need to be upgraded. And he recognized that Newark was a bad case, just a day before this morning’s outage. “If we don’t actually accomplish the mission that we’re announcing today, you will see Newarks, not just in Newark, you’ll see Newarks in other parts of the country because it’s an aging system,” Duffy said on Thursday. Duffy’s press conference was extremely odd and opened with the Transportation Secretary calling President Donald Trump, putting him on speakerphone, and holding the phone up to the microphone. Duffy said he wants to build six new air traffic control centers and replace old equipment, noting that his systems still use copper wire rather than “We use radar from the 1970s. Some of them are from the ’80s, but most of them are from the ’70s,” Duffy stressed. Duffy noted that there has been “decades of neglect” to America’s air traffic infrastructure, with a “patchwork of fixes” and “partial funding.” And while that’s true, it costs real money to upgrade entire systems, something the former reality TV show host didn’t provide specifics about, only noting it will cost “billions.” Duffy will need to ask Congress for money to invest in air traffic control systems, something that might be difficult in a political landscape where Republicans only want to cut funding for essential services. Duffy himself was in Congress as a representative from Wisconsin during those “decades of neglect,” and at least seemed to accept some of the blame with a smirk on his face. “You can blame me for that, I was in Congress as well.” Turns out, it’s a lot easier to obstruct funding of important infrastructure for America than to rally spending on it. So we’ll see if Duffy and his buddy Trump can get some serious money allocated. airportsInfrastructureNewarksean duffy Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "These Rare Fork-Nosed Dogs Could Help Solve a Genetic Mystery in Humans",
    "article_text": "A rare breed of hunting dogs known for its forked nose, the Turkish Pointer, might just help scientists better understand why human babies are sometimes born with facial clefts. In a recent study, researchers say they’ve found the genetic mutation that causes these dogs to develop their characteristic split nose. They argue that similar mutations might also explain some cases of cleft lip and palate in humans. An international research team conducted the study, including scientists from the National Institutes of Health in the U.S. and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. They analyzed the genetics of some 2,000 dogs, eventually discovering several new gene variants linked to a dog’s facial structure and size. One of these variants was found in the Turkish Pointer, also known as the Catalburun. How Genes Drive Your Dog’s Lovable and Wacky Behavior The mutation concerns the gene PDFGRA. The researchers say that the gene seems to help connect the two halves of the face and mouth during embryonic development, with the unique variant in Turkish Pointers explaining their split-nose appearance. âThis indicates that the gene might be involved in some cases of human orofacial clefts,â said study researcher Peter Savolainen, a canine geneticist at KTH, in astatementfrom the institute. âWhile there are several genetic and environmental reasons behind orofacial clefts in humans, this study offers a clue to another factor.â The team’s findings werepublishedearlier this March in the journal Genome Research. Facial clefts, which can involve the lips and/or palate, are thought to occur in one out of every 700 births. If untreated, the condition can hamper a person’s feeding and speaking and raise the risk of ear infections. These days, thankfully, it can usually be repaired very successfully with surgery. Most cases of facial clefts have no clear cause, though factors like smoking, diabetes, and the use of certain medications during pregnancy seem to increase the risk. Most Dog Breeds Are Super Inbred, Study Finds As their name suggests, Turkish Pointers have primarily been bred in select parts of Turkey. They’re said to be incredibly good sniffers, but they’re also rare, with only a few hundred specimens thought to be living today (the breed isn’t even officially recognized by any kennel club). Their tiny population numbers do raise the risk of genetic disease, though this is an issue withpurebred dogs in general. But these dogs and other rare breeds also make it easier for scientists to isolate genes and mutations relevant to human health, the authors say. âStudying the very inbred dog breeds is an excellent tool for finding the genetic reason for many morphologic traits and diseases in humans,â Savolainen said. âIn humans there is just too much genetic variation, making it hard to identify exactly which genetic mutation causes a specific disease.” DogsGenetics Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "We checked so you don't have to. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. World of Warcraft senior game director Ion Hazzikostasannounced last weekthat Blizzard Entertainment will cut off access to the live combat log and auras for add-ons in the game, after incorporating new features to replace the most popular mods. I interviewed Hazzikostas for an hour about the broadcast to identify in detail what would be affected by the changes. Using that information and the broadcast itself, I took a look at the 15 most popular mods in Warcraft, as identified by total downloads for the retail game atCurseforge, and the 15most popular WeakAurasfor the current raid and dungeons (mini-mods running on the WeakAuras platform). I describe how each will be affected below. Did we miss something? Let us know in the comments! Six of the 15 most popular mods will be DOA, with a seventh requiring major changes. Most of the top WeakAuras will be gone, with just two (and possibly a third) that remain standing. Most of DBM's functionality would be disabled without access to the combat log and combat auras. Hazzikostas indicated that some of the most popular features of the DBM mod, including audio cues and boss ability timelines, would be built into the WoW. Raider.io pulls information about raid and dungeon achievements from the web and displays them in game. It is not combat-dependent. When Hazzikostas said during the broadcast that the most popular add-on currently is a damage meter, this is likely the one he meant. He said that interrupts, avoidable damage and other features of Details would be built into an in-game damage meter. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This is the add-on that allows mini-mods to run in game with relative ease. While WeakAuras itself will be mostly unaffected by the changes (except its templates, drop-down lists and some of its option screens), many of its mods will be hit. See that list below. A competitor of DBM, BigWigs will suffer the same fate. As an auction house buying and selling mod, Auctionator doesn't use combat hooks. Bagnon merely changes how your bags and their contents are displayed. Hazzikostas says that cosmetic and UI add-ons won't be affected by the shift. This rival of Details will also be on the firing line. This mod uses relative stat importance for your character (as calculated by Simulationcraft) to predict what items would be upgrades. It does not rely on combat information. BigWigs, but for dungeons. This'll be gone after the changes. This mod flags the player when a rare monster is spotted. Because it doesn't rely on combat log effects or character auras, it may keep on functioning. This mod blares an obnoxious noise when players stand in something damaging—a feature the game itself sorely needs. (Currently the game changes the edges of the screen when you're standing in bad, but that effect fades in to avoid flash-banging players.) Hazzikostas mentioned this functionality as something that WoW would build in. This mod provides a better display of world quests in the game. It will not be affected. This popular tool allows you to plan routes through Mythic Plus difficulty dungeons and gives you additional information about the abilities, health, etc. for the mobs along the way. It shouldn't be affected, since it doesn't reflect live combat information. The information used to populate it could conceivably be affected, but it seems unlikely. The core functionality of HealBot, a popular healing add-on, doesn't actually require combat information to run. It shows a modified version of the game's player frames, and allows healers to click on the frames to cast healing spells. Some more-advanced functionality (showing incoming heals, or showing dispellable debuffs on the player) will cease to function and require changes. WeakAuras were literally built to interact with combat auras and logs, so many are affected or eliminated by this proposed change. It's hard to track the exact number of downloads for WeakAuras, because they're often just copied and pasted with an import string of text, or shared between players in-game. We made our best guesses based on a compilation of several lists of downloads fromwago.io, the most popular site for their distribution. This WeakAura package provides information to players killing bosses in the Liberation of Undermine raid. Virtually all of its functions require live combat logs or auras. A competing package with similar functionality. A similar package from Team Liquid, the guild first in the world to clear the raid. Another package of the same type. A WeakAura that automatically puts a symbol on the nameplate of caster-style mobs in dungeons as that group is engaged in combat. Requires live combat access to function. Blizzard has said that it plans to improve and customize enemy nameplates. This WA adds functionality to the display of the current Mythic+ dungeons in game, so that players who have defeated them on a high level and earned the right to teleport to them can do so right from the dungeon display list. It does not depend on combat auras or logs. This package added the cooldowns of big spells to enemies' nameplates, so that you could see when they were likely to cast those abilities next. Relies on combat logs to run. This package and ones like it provided on-screen interpretation of big events coming, abilities being cast by important enemies, and the like. Much like the BigWigs or Deadly BossMods add-ons listed above, virtually all of its functionality requires these hooks. A similar pack to the one above. This WA interprets the amount of trash mob groups that people have to fight to make the overall count for a Mythic Plus difficulty dungeon and checks to see where the player is, informing the group whether additional enemies need to be killed before leaving the area. Relies on combat information. This extremely handy WA created cast bars for every enemy in a dungeon group, showing how soon their ability would finish casting and who it was targeting. Very useful for planning interrupts and other control abilities. It relies on the combat log and auras. This WA puts up a warning when an enemy from a pack is targeting the player's character, along with how long the player has before that ability hits. It uses combat information. This WA put the percent that a monster counts for in the total needed to complete a Mythic Plus difficulty dungeon on its nameplate. As long as nameplate customization is allowed and WeakAuras can read the player's target, this WA should still work. Allows party members to put the code !keys in chat to see links to other group members' Mythic Plus dungeon keys. Does not require combat information This WA makes party members' frames glow when they are afflicted with a debuff that your character can dispel. Relies on combat information. Hazzikostas said in the broadcast that these changes will be a long time in coming; in our interview, he confirmed that no changes to mod or WeakAura access will happen in patches 11.1.7 or 11.2. Heather Newman has reported on games for more than 25 years, with an internationally syndicated column and stories in dozens of magazines. In World of Warcraft, her Mythic Plus dungeon team was No. 1 in all-star points in North America for a number of weeks for slightly cheesy reasons. She scored one measly point against Jonathan “Fatal1ty” Wendel in Unreal Tournament and was, exceedingly briefly, top 50 world in Halo.

    "title": "Randy Pitchford asks fans to 'play the game first' before judging Borderlands 4's new minimap-free HUD",
    "article_text": "There's no minimap in Borderlands 4, the Gearbox CEO confirmed: \"We want you to play the game and not play the map.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Borderlands fans noticed that instead of the minimap introduced in Borderlands 2, the recentBorderlands 4 gameplay deep divefeatures a compass bar that points toward objectives. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford confirmed that the minimap is gone during a PAX East panel on Friday, and asked fans to hold judgement until they've played the game. The map talk starts at about 28 minutes into the video embedded above. Borderlands 4takes place on a new planet, Kairos, and boasts the biggest map the Borderlands series has seen \"by far,\" according to Pitchford. \"There's no load times, just, you see something anywhere on the screen, a mile away, up in the sky, you will be able to get there,\" said the CEO, echoingTodd Howard's famous lineabout seeing mountains in Skyrim and walking up them. (Although I've never quite understood why that promise came to signify exaggerated claims, because you could in fact explore Skyrim's mountains.) \"We made a big freaking world,\" Pitchford said regarding the decision not to include a minimap. \"And a lot of the things you do can be local space, but a lot of the things you do or want to do are out there [in the larger world], and a local space map is not a good way to navigate when you're thinking about objectives and opportunities—several at the same time that might be miles away—and a compass really helps us do that.\" Pitchford also said that 2D minimaps can be confusing in multilevel environments, and \"you're going to have more verticality in Borderlands 4 than you've ever seen before in a Borderlands game, by far.\" The compass uses little arrows to indicate when a target is above or below you, and the hope is that this is better for spatial awareness. \"We want you to play the game and not play the map,\" said Pitchford. \"So we made a commitment, and we put all of that investment into this compass system, and you still have the big map. It's one click away. And we put more cool stuff in there than we've ever done before. We even have, like, an AI-driven kind of navigation system that will give you a GPS on the big map to show you the line of where you can go.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. We'll also have a new robot companion, Echo-4, as well as other tools that help with navigation, he said, ending the segment by asking fans to trust Gearbox on the issue for now. \"Look, we're open to thinking about things in the future,\" he said, \"but play the game first and understand the choices we've made, and I think you'll see and understand when you realize how big this world is and how playing the game in the world is better than playing the map.\" The panel also included new details on Borderlands 4's vault hunters, guns, and new movement abilities, as well as the expected energetic hype-building from Pitchford. Gearbox recently announced a slightly earlier release date for Borderlands 4 than was previously set—it'll be out this year on September 12—and Pitchford reiterated during the panel that the date change reflects the studio's confidence in the game. \"We're on offense, you guys,\" he said. \"Sometimes we're like, white-knuckling to the landing, you know? And we've got a lot of work to do. We're working our asses off. But the momentum is insane. The velocity is insane.

    "title": "Nearly 200 Overwatch developers at Blizzard form a new union: The Overwatch Gamemakers Guild",
    "article_text": "The Communications Workers of America says Microsoft has already recognized the union. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nearly 200 Overwatch developers atActivisionBlizzard have formed a new union under the Communications Workers of America called The Overwatch Gamemakers Guild—CWA, \"a wall-to-wall unit that includes game developers across all disciplines, including design, production, engineering, art, sound, and quality assurance.\" Theannouncementof the new union followed confirmation from a neutral arbitrator that an \"overwhelming majority\" of employees had either signed a union authorization card or indicated support for unionization online. The CWA says Microsoft has recognized the union. \"After a long history of layoffs, crunch, and subpar working conditions in the global videogame industry, my coworkers and I are thrilled to be joining the broader union effort to organize our industry for the better, which has been long overdue,\" senior test analyst II and organizing committee member Foster Elmendorf said. \"Workers organizing themselves and striving for better conditions as a group allows us to present initiatives that would not only improve our workplace but videogames overall.\" There has indeed been a big push toward unionization in recent years, and Microsoft has earned some credit in years past for not actively opposing such efforts: In 2022, for instance, the CWA trumpeted a \"ground-breakinglabor neutrality agreement\" with Microsoft over unionization at Activision Blizzard, which at that time was not officially a part of Microsoft, and in 2023 it ran apro-union adin the Washington Post that was endorsed by the CWA. The following year, World of Warcraft senior producer Samuel Cooper gave credit to Microsoft for helping to facilitate theunionization of WoW devs. Microsoft isn't the only beneficiary of game industry unionization efforts. One major move occurred in March, when the CWA announcedUnited Videogame Workers—CWA, an industry-wide, \"direct-join organization\" that's open to developers regardless of where they work (as long as it's in North America) or whether their individual workplace is already organized. Much of the drive to unionize arises from the absolutely brutal layoffs of2023and2024, which saw tens of thousands of people in the industry put out of work. Speaking toKotaku, Blizzard test analyst Simon Hedrick said \"the biggest issue was the layoffs at the beginning of 2024,\" when Microsoftcut 1,900 jobsat Activision Blizzard and Xbox. \"People were gone out of nowhere and there was nothing we could do about it,\" Hedrick said. \"What I want to protect most here is the people.\" Overwatch UI artist Sadie Boyd, who was previously with Arkane Austin before Microsoft closed the studio, expressed similar sentiments onX. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Not only do I get to work alongside an incredibly talented team, but also with some of the most thoughtful and kindhearted people I've ever encountered,\" she wrote. \"It's because of their nature that we unionize—to protect them.\" The bloom might be starting to come off Microsoft's seemingly pro-union rose a little bit: In April 2025, members of the ZeniMax Workers United-CWA union voted \"overwhelmingly\" to authorize union leadership tocall for a strikeif contract negotiations, which have been underway for nearly two years, continue to fail to make meaningful headway. Nonetheless, the Communications Workers of America says more than 2,600 people at Microsoft studios have joined CWA-affiliated unions since the labor neutrality agreement was reached, enabling them to \"collectively push for workplace improvements like layoff protections, job security, wage increases, limits to outsourcing, and remote work protections.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

    "title": "Death Stranding 2 sounds like everything I hoped it'd be",
    "article_text": "Kojima let the press play an unbelievable 30 hours of Death Stranding 2. Here's what they think. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It should speak to an already stacked year for games that we're just over a month away from Death Stranding 2, and yet it feels like this major PlayStation (timed) exclusive is flying under the radar. Maybe that has more to do with the divisive response to Kojima's first apocalyptic mailman simulator—Death Stranding was the sort of game you either kinda hated or totally clicked with (and gave aGame of the Year award). I was among the latter, sinking hundreds of hours into road projects and harrowing box rescues across multiple playthroughs, so I'm relieved to hear Death Stranding 2 is shaping up nicely. That's according to a handful of outlets that attended a four-day \"Death Stranding boot camp,\" as several writers referred to it, at Kojima Productions HQ. Attendees played an unbelievable30 hoursof Death Stranding 2, which shatters the record for longest preview build I've ever heard of. If there is such a thing as too much preview access, Kojima is knocking at its door. There's also a bunch of new gameplay to comb over, but it looks like nobody got to share their own capture, so all previews utilize the same 5-10 minutes of Sony-supplied footage. Below you'll find my big takeaways after combing over a handful of videos and writeups, as well as a handy roundup of everyone's coverage to go enjoy yourself. We don't know when Death Stranding 2 will come to PC, but I hope it's quicker than Sony's frequent year-or-two-later turnaround. Video Words If you chopped up all these previews and fed them to a word cloud, \"Metal Gear\" would probably be the biggest bubble. That's because everyone was surprised to discover how many more stealth and combat options Death Stranding 2 supports. There are bandit camps spread throughout the sequel's maps, as well as more missions that ask you to infiltrate them. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Were this the first game, the prospect of forced stealth encounters would sound like a real drag, but it looks like Sam's dynamic with these bandits is different from the package-stealing MULEs of America. In the gameplay clips shared, it appears enemy camps no longer have those cargo-detecting tripwires that would instantly reveal Sam's location. By all accounts, DS2's bandit camps are closer to Metal Gear Solid 5 bases: Compounds that can be approached from any direction, reward scouting, and accommodate aggressive or passive playstyles. That's really encouraging, as is the word that the little stop motion puppet on Sam's hip can scout the area like an Assassin's Creed eagle. My number one complaint about the original Death Stranding (besides its terribly paced story) was its small variety of goals. I love delivering packages, but I'm even more excited to take off Sam's backpack (another new feature) for some Solid Snake-y side gigs. As far as I know, Kojima Productions hasn't mentioned this before yesterday's wave of previews. We'd only heard that Death Stranding 2 goes to Mexico, but apparently, the majority of the story takes place in Australia. Not that the location of Death Stranding's maps truly matters—Kojima's rendition of the United States looked way more Nordic than American, and as Australian YouTuber SkillUp noted in his hands-on, Kojima's gone ahead and plopped a snow-capped mountain in the center of his arid homeland. So there's definitely a Mexico and Australia map—maybe there's a third? I'm mixed on this one. One of the more thrilling (and sometimes frustrating) moments of the first Death Stranding was holding Sam's breath as he snuck by invisible BTs. Are you too close? Should you stop moving completely to get a quick glimpse? Is it time to just run? I doubt I'll be asking myself those questions in Death Stranding 2, if our brief look at BTs is anything to go by. BTs are no longer invisible, now shaded blue, which multiple previewers noted made the beach ghosts much easier to deal with. Also there's a blood boomerang, because Australia. Improved pacing came up a lot. I didn't have a problem with the first game's lackadaisical opening hours, but it's true that Death Stranding's best qualities don't bloom until you get to that second map and gain access to vehicles and road building. It sounds like DS2 ramps up much quicker to that point, with Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale saying he was accepting his first delivery by the 20-minute mark.

Good news for lovers and sand, spice, and/or worms:Dune: Awakening'sbeta weekend, which started today and will run until May 12, is now open to anyone who preordered the survival MMO. It's also mildly perplexing news because, y'know... why weren't players who preordered the $50 game on Steam automatically included in the beta weekend in the first place? \"Everyone who has pre-ordered Dune: Awakening can now also access the Beta Weekend!\"Funcom announcedon social media a few hours after the beta went live. \"We heard your feedback on this. If you already own or decide to pre-order any of the editions this weekend, you should now also see a Beta Weekend product in your Steam library.\" There were different ways to obtain one of the \"tens of thousands\" of Dune: Awakening beta keys Funcom released in the run-up to the weekend, but I found it a little strange that preorderers weren't guaranteed one. Even people who shelled out for the game ahead of launch had to hope for some luck in a giveaway to play this weekend, even though beta access is a pretty common reward for buying in advance. Whatever the reasoning, Funcom eventually figured out it wasn't a great idea to deny its biggest fans access to the weekend beta and have set things right. Of course, the turnaround raisesanotherissue: a lot of people who preordered Dune: Awakening and wound up with a beta key through a giveaway have already claimed it—which is a bit of a waste because that giveaway key could have gone to a player whohadn'tpreordered. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This isn't a huge disaster or anything, but it does feel unnecessarily sloppy, especially since just yesterday Funcom said \"This is not our first rodeo\" when it comes to launching MMOs and survival games.

    "article_text": "The Smallest Church in Saint-Saëns. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In a surprise appearance alongside UK indie band and Disco Elysium composersSea Power, voice actor and musicianMikee W. Goodmandonned the green jacket and flared trousers of Disco Elysium protagonist Harry Du Bois to belt out a rendition of \"The Smallest Church in Saint-Saëns.\" The melancholy song is the subject of Disco's memorable andmuch-loved karaoke sidequest. An audience video shared by Goodman onTikTokcaptured the beginning of his guest performance, where he dropped into the guttural register of the Ancient Reptilian Brian⁠—one of many facets of protagonist Du Bois' fractured psyche that speaks to him throughout the game, and one of eight characters voiced by Goodman in Disco Elysium's original release. Goodman would later reprise his role one more time in the show, reciting the Ancient Reptilian Brian's iconic opening lines to Disco as a spoken word intro to one of Sea Power's songs. In addition to videogame work, Goodman has been a longtime member of influential djent metal bandSikTh, and has done similar spoken word performances as part of his music in the past. This time, though, he characterized it as more of a theatrical performance, trying to sell the persona of Harry Du Bois rather than just himself as a performer: \"I just thought to myself man, do you know what? This is my first on stage acting performance, because even though I'm just singing a song, actually it's theatrical.\" For the Harry Du Bois cosplay, Goodman brought a pair of his own discotheque-ready flares to match the ones in the game, a screen-accurate Horrific Necktie (another character voiced by Goodman), and also borrowed an official Atelier ZA/UM green jacket from the studio to look the part. In Disco itself, \"The Smallest Church in Saint-Saëns\" is a depression/break-up favorite of Harry Du Bois. A side quest to perform it at a karaoke night can result in either a successful performance, where Du Bois sings in Goodman's Ancient Reptilian Brain voice, or a \"failure\" where Harry falls into the sickly, scratchy falsetto of the Limbic System⁠—also supplied by Goodman. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"The Smallest Church in Saint-Saëns\" is actually a cheeky, francophone twist on a pre-existing Sea Power song, \"The Smallest Church in Sussex,\" which I've been told by Sea Power guitarist Martin Noble is a real place you can visit. In addition to fresh compositions for the game, other tracks in Disco are similar riffs on older Sea Power tunes: Compare \"Instrument of Surrender\" to the track \"Red Rock Riviera\" released in 2013. In addition to SikTh and his work as a voice actor/director, Goodman has a new single, \"Hermits Under Blankets\" out with his project,The Sad Season.

Season 1 capped off with Hank heading New Vegas-ward, and there's been asteady stream of production leaksbubbling to the surface between seasons showing recognizablelandmarks from the Mojave. Some of that New Vegas excitement is a bit more tentative, however—if not maladaptive. Some fans were driven into a frenzy overperceived timeline discrepancies in season 1that were taken as an indication that Bethesda was paving over New Vegas lore. Todd Howard even had toissue a placating decree, saying on an April 2024 Kinda Funny podcast that \"New Vegas is a very, very important game to us.\" Just how deep season 2 will dig into the New Vegas lorebooks remains to be seen, though. Will we see a Yes Man? Did the Bright Brotherhood ever make it to space? Is the show brave enough to open theJoshua Grahamcan of worms? Whatever happens, I'm sure the cast will have to fight plenty of geckos. It wouldn't be authentic otherwise. As for when season 2 might air, we can only speculate. If it follows a similar production timeline to the first season, which was released just over a year after wrapping filming in March 2023, we might expect Fallout season 2 sometime in mid-2026. That's only guesswork until any official announcement, of course. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "As Fortnite gears up for an App Store relaunch, Epic is cranking up its Rewards program to encourage people to use its payment system instead of Apple's",
    "article_text": "Gamers who use Epic's payment system for purchases in Fortnite, Rocket League, or Among Us will earn 20% back in Epic Rewards. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As Fortnite slowly grinds its way back to iOS devices in the US, Epic Games is offering players a deal: Make purchases in Fortnite—or Rocket League or Fall Guys—using Epic's payment system and you'll get back 20% of what you spend in Epic Rewards. That's a big boost over the usual 5% offering on Epic Games Store purchases, and it's simple math, as Epic demonstrated with this handy-dandy image: When, for instance, you spend $23 on 2,800 V-Bucks, you can get $4.60 back in Epic Rewards, or you can get nothing. The 20% rewards offer applies on all platforms, and yes, it's permanent. \"Competition is a wonderful thing!\" Epic boss Tim Sweeney enthused. Theannouncementof the new Epic Rewards offering comes basically side-by-side with Epic's announcement that it's \"submitted Fortnite to Apple for review so we can launch on the App Store in the US.\" So, how did we get here? Fortnite's imminent return to the App Store follows just a week after Epic'smajor courtroom victory over Applein a legal battle that began all the way back in 2020. While Apple mostly came out on top in that dispute, Epic did score one big win when the courts ruled that Apple could not stop iOS app developers from directing users to their own payment processor outside of the app, rather than Apple's. This is potentially very advantageous for developers, because using an external payment processor for purchases would enable them to escape Apple's stiff 30% fee—so it's not really shocking that Apple's compliance with that ruling wasn't exactly enthusiastic. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Epic took exception to Apple's ongoing reluctance to comply with court orders in a meaningful way, which is what eventually led to this most recent ruling, which included a statement—from the judge, mind, not from Epic—that Apple \"continued its anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream.\" With Apple suitably chastised, Epic is swinging for the fences. The day after the ruling, Epic announced plans for \"webshops\" on the Epic Games Store that will enable developers to offer out-of-app purchases \"as a more cost-effective alternative to in-app purchases, where Apple, Google, and others charge exorbitant fees.\" To encourage people to use those webshops, any purchases made through them will also earn 5% back in Epic Rewards—not as high a percentage as its offering on its own games, but again, a whole lot better than nothing. Even if you don't care about Fortnite or mobile gaming in general, you're not being left empty-handed: Epic is also offering 20% rewards on other Epic Games Store purchases—including games from other companies, not just Epic's own stuff—until August 31, also on all platforms. So if you were planning on buying something from the Epic Games Store, or maybe just pondering the possibility, now would be a good time. The Epic Store purchase option for iOS devices is slated to go live alongside Fortnite's return to the App Store in the US (it returned to the App Store in Europe in 2024), which Epic obviously expects to happen very soon.

    "title": "Co-founder of crypto platform Celsius, which went bust with a billion-dollar hole in its finances, sentenced to 12 years in federal prison for 'orchestrating one of the biggest frauds in the crypto industry'",
    "article_text": "Alex Mashinsky was known for characterising traditional banks as untrustworthy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Alex Mashinsky, the co-founder of the failed crypto lending platform Celsius, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison (via Wired). Federal Judge John Koeltl handed down the sentence after a long hearing in Manhattan that heard from Mashinsky's victims as well as the defendant. The Department of Justice (DOJ) charged Mashinsky with seven counts of fraud in July 2023. Mashinsky initially denied the charges, before pleading guilty to two counts of commodities fraud and securities fraud. The plea deal saw Mashinsky admit lying to Celsius customers about how the business operated and their funds would be invested, as well as manipulating the price of a proprietary crypto coin for personal benefit. Mashinsky also had to forfeit $48 million to the DOJ. \"Alexander Mashinsky orchestrated one of the biggest frauds in the crypto industry,\" said US Attorney Damian Williams in a statement at the time of the guilty plea. \"Today's convictions reflect this Office's commitment to holding fraudsters like Mashinsky accountable for their crimes.\" Celsius was founded in 2017 as acryptocurrencylending platform and at one point boasted over $25 billion in customer assets (or so it claimed). Users could deposit crypto with Celsius with the promise of high-yield returns, or take out a cash loan secured against their crypto holdings, and the marketing was all about this being a trendy new alternative to traditional banks. Mashinsky characterised traditional banks as untrustworthy by, among other things, regularly wearing t-shirts with the logo \"Banks Are Not Your Friends\" and, yes, you're allowed to laugh. Much like other crypto barons, such asDo Kwon and his \"Lunatics\", Mashinsky was the focal point for the company and had a devoted following of fans who he called \"Celsians.\" When the Terra stablecoin and linked token Luna collapsed in May 2022, it caused an industry-wide downturn and enormous losses for Celsius (though prosecutors argue it wasn't in financially good health anyway). The company went bust in July 2022 with court filings showinga $1.2 billion black hole in its finances, attracting the attention of both the DOJ and Vermont state regulators. The state regulator noted particularly the \"losses suffered by retail investors; for example, middle-class, unaccredited investors who may have invested entire college funds or retirement accounts with Celsius.\" Celsius' bankruptcy filing froze more than $4.7 billion in customer funds, of which approximately 60% have been recovered, but only partially as cash. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Mashinsky's sentencing is probably the most interesting element of the case, inasmuch as he could've faced 30 years but a plea deal should have seen that number come down significantly. Instead Mashinsky's defence argued that he should only be sentenced to a single year in prison, citing his guilty pleas, military service in Israel, childhood deprivations, and the wider crypto market's contribution to Celsius' downfall. \"This case is not about an arrogant, greedy swindler who thought he could get away with stealing people’s hard-earned money to satisfy his own hedonistic pleasures,\" said a court filing from Mashinsky's lawyers. \"Those are post-hoc, shallow and dehumanizing tropes that do not apply here.\" For its part the DOJ sought 20 years, arguing that despite his guilty plea Mashinsky had shown no contrition, and knew he was defrauding customers. The prosecution filing says: \"His crimes were not the product of negligence, naivete, or bad luck. They were the result of deliberate, calculated decisions to lie, deceive, and steal in pursuit of personal fortune. He has abandoned all pretense of acknowledging his sustained wrongdoing […] This profound lack of remorse underscores the continuing danger he poses.\" So the question for the judge very much went to Mashinsky's character: is this guy someone who got in over his head, and lied to try and save the business? Or someone who set out to defraud people, deceived them about the nature of the business they were investing in, and walked off with millions? Prosecutors unsurprisingly drew the comparison with Sam Bankman-Fried,sentenced to 25 years in prisonfor his leading role in the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. The defence argued the two cases were \"nothing alike\" and that, unlike Bankman-Fried, Mashinsky had not been accused of embezzlement or stealing customer funds (though he did withdraw $10 million from Celsius in May 2022 as everything went wrong). The judge decided that Mashinsky's conduct warranted much more than one year and, while not giving the prosecution what it wanted, sentenced him to 12 years in federal prison. Mashinsky is 59 years old and will serve at least 85% of that time, even if granted early release for good behaviour. It brings the curtain down on what had been a long and successful tech career. As recently as 2022 the Wall Street Journal described Mashinsky as \"a brash, confident serial entrepreneur with a constant stream of big ideas\", and he'd previously founded legitimate companies like VoiceSmart, GroundLink, Q-Wireless, and was briefly CEO of router company Novatel (now Mifi). 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "title": "Publisher who resurrected lost pirate game Captain Blood says it's 'a 3 or 4' by today's standards, but that's half the fun: 'All its charms, all its flaws, all the vibes are from that era'",
    "article_text": "Don't bother with the rose-colored glasses. This is 2011, note for note. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Captain Blood's trailer looks like it should be buffering in 240p on Mediafire with a Ventrilo window next to it. Captain Blood itself looks like it should live in a generic Blockbuster case on a DVD so abused it makes my Xbox 360 disc drive howl in agony. Among the detritus of Steam's New & Noteworthy page, this game is the equivalent of a perfectly preserved T. Rex mandible—if dinosaurs were contemporary to Halo 3, anyway. Despite being released this week, Captain Blood looks every bit the relic of 2000s development hell it is. This isn't lost on anyone behind the game, which began development in 2003 and almost released (but didn't) on the seventh generation of consoles. Unlike most retro revivals, this isn't a detailed touch-up or reimagining of a storied classic; it's a canned game taken to the finish line exactly as it might have released in 2011 or so. Oleg Klapovskiy, co-founder of the game's publisher, SNEG, says the release is an act of preservation above all else. It got some tweaks and bug fixes to ensure its playability, but in all other respects, it's a relic. You know that kind of Xbox 360-era experience... It's exactly a weekend long, it gives you a certain level of joy and you move on \"We're having fun looking at how people assess it,\" Klapovskiy said. \"Our goal was to bring it as close to the original as possible. We are not game designers; it's not our game, we were not working on it from the very beginning. There was a team of creative minds that had the vision for it.\" \"If you assess the game by modern standards, I think I would put it at a very low score. I would say, three? Four? But again, that's not a game from 2025 … Obviously, it has all its charm, all its flaws, and all the vibes are from that era. If you assess it as a game from that time, I would assess it as a 7.5/10 game. It's all a matter of taste, how [you] approach it.\" That's not to say the game has no niche. Its most obvious inspiration is the original God of War, which released a year before Captain Blood restarted development (for the second time) in 2006. But these days, it's probably closer to the horde of games God of War inspired: clunky cult hits like Darksiders and Dante's Inferno. Artem Shchuiko, who co-founded SNEG with Klapovskiy after the two worked together at GOG for several years and shared a passion for games preservation, said Blood's faults should evoke a certain fondness, warts and all. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"You know that kind of Xbox 360-, PS3-era experience. You get the overhyped game, you know based on the trailers that it's not gonna be amazing, but then you play it and it's exactly a weekend long … it gives you a certain level of joy and you move on. That's kind of the nostalgic part of this game,\" Shchuiko said. \"The goal was not to make a 10/10. The goal was to get it shipped and release it.\" Shchuiko added that while some recent games likeEvil Westhave been compared favorably to the janky action games of those days, \"it's one thing to pretend to be from the 360 era, to be inspired … it's another thing to be exactly a game of that era.\" While plenty of games go for a nostalgia hit, Shchuiko said most publishers would balk at the idea of bringing back a bygone era's low points as well as its high points. \"This game would cost a crazy amount of money today to be made, and it will not find its market, most likely. It's the kind of game which cannot be made today. That makes it even more interesting. You're getting something which you're kind of not supposed to be getting based on the modern realities of the market.\" The easy part of resurrecting a canned game like Captain Blood turned out to be obtaining the rights. While it wasn't trivial, Klapovskiy said it was \"one of the easiest\" experiences SNEG has had so far securing rights to release an old game. A nearly complete build had already leaked online, so getting the old codebase together wasn't a struggle either. The entire original development team from Akella, now going by Seawolf Studio, was on board too—though the choice not to modernize or add features to the game, to fulfill the vision they couldn't 15 years ago, saw some dissent. \"Even today I got a message from one of the guys from the original team … he's like, 'Hey, what if we give you money to make a sequel?' I'm like, 'Guys, you don't even know if there's any interest in this game but you're proposing money?' Like what the hell is this,\" Klapovskiy said. \"There were quite a few people coming to us and [offering investment money]. We were like, 'Guys, we're not about investors' money, it's a passion project. It's fun and passion.'\" That's not to say the team wasn't excited to finally see the game release. Many of those developers had jobs at other game studios now, some working on huge games like Roblox, and worked on Captain Blood as they were available. Shchuiko said that any passion for games preservation is felt twofold by developers with a game under their belt which never saw the light of day. Once it became evident they had the opportunity to provide some closure, he said it felt like a responsibility. \"One thing you can universally notice is some deeply hidden burden of something that never got shipped or released; I think they carried it with them to a certain extent,\" he said. \"I think it was very quickly and evidently an important thing to ship it and we got nothing but support in this regard.\" The SNEG co-founders said they aren't certain what the future will look like for Seawolf or Captain Blood, but Shchuiko pointed out that a lot of treasured games from the past started as messy tributes and rough proofs of concept; and though Captain Blood might not not blow players away, the heart and labor put into it is why it's worth preserving. \"Think about the franchises which we all know now, they're all making gazillions of dollars. When they were making the first game, it was at first a clunky iteration. Think about Assassin's Creed, you name it, and [Captain Blood] has this feeling. They clearly were inspired by God of War, they clearly were playing modern stuff back then and they just wanted to make their own … but they didn't have enough experience, so they got this. All good stories usually start with developers having this first clunky, but promising, game.\" Klapovskiy added that if it's a good time, that's all that matters. \"I think that if you watch the trailers, you can see that we're trying to make fun even out of ourselves here. We'll be super proud if people who play it, stream it, write about it, have a smile while playing it … that's what our industry's about. It's about entertaining.\" You can findCaptain Blood on Steam, where it currently enjoying a small but \"very positive\" reception. Justin first became enamored with PC gaming when World of Warcraft and Neverwinter Nights 2 rewired his brain as a wide-eyed kid. As time has passed, he's amassed a hefty backlog of retro shooters, CRPGs, and janky '90s esoterica. Whether he's extolling the virtues of Shenmue or troubleshooting some fiddly old MMO, it's hard to get his mind off games with more ambition than scruples. When he's not at his keyboard, he's probably birdwatching or daydreaming about a glorious comeback for real-time with pause combat. Any day now...

    "title": "Europa Universalis 5's unusual, year-long reveal was a lesson Paradox learned from Imperator's mixed reception: 'I wanted to do it a little bit earlier, but marketing people tend to get panicky when you start talking'",
    "article_text": "Paradox Tinto released a whopping 62 dev diaries before officially revealing EU5. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It was pretty obvious, right from thefirst dev diarypublished on February 24, 2024 that Paradox Tinto was working onEuropa Universalis 5. The studio had been set up to maintain 2013's Europa Universalis 4, and was headed by EU director Johan Andersson. Everything it showed us from Project Caesar screamed Europa Universalis 5. And Andersson had been extremely eager to get started. \"I wanted to make a new game,\" he told me earlier this year, in Tinto's unassuming suburban office, located in Sitges, Spain. \"I'd learned so much from Imperator, and the post-launch there and figuring out what I want to do when I'm doing the next game. I'd been trying out ideas in my head and then realised, OK, I can make an EU sequel. We need to make an EU sequel.\" Imperator: Rome sold well at launch and received a lot of glowing reviews, including from me. In myImperator: Romereview, I gave it 92%, calling it \"Huge, inventive and the reason I'm sleep deprived.\" It was a game of diminishing returns, though, and Paradox's perfectionist fanbase wasn't as impressed. Player reviews, then, were less favourable, and while Andersson and his team have managed to turn things around (recent Steam reviews are \"Very Positive\"), it's probably never going to garner the kind of love that Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis receives. But Imperator was important stepping stone—one that led Paradox Tinto to EU5. There are two major things Andersson learned from designing and refining Imperator, which he's now applying to EU5. \"Less board game things, is one thing,\" he said. This is why the concept of 'mana' has been largely tossed out. You've got resources, of course, and lots of numbers to reflect things like your nation's stability, but it's mostly moved away from the more abstract concepts of power. People—pops, estates, soldiers, advisors, cabinet ministers—take centre stage. Dynamic, sometimes confounding, this human element serves as both the expression of your power and the thing you're trying to control. I can make an EU sequel. We need to make an EU sequel. But there's another thing that's proved to be even more critical, and why we've spent the last year being able to read detailed, insightful explanations of EU5's systems in unexpectedly granular detail, long before Paradox even confirmed what game it was making. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"The most important [lesson] is: involve the community more and listen more to the community,\" he said. \"We did a lot of quantitative and qualitative user research at the start, like checking what they wanted by doing big surveys, then doing interviews with part of the community and figuring out what they wanted. That aligned pretty much with the vision I had of a deeper, economical game and more peace time activities.\" If Andersson had it his way, the reveal would have happened a bit sooner, in fact. \"I wanted to do it a little bit earlier, but marketing people tend to get panicky when you start talking.\" This also explains why, despite how obvious it was that Paradox Tinto was working on EU5, the team couldn't quite go so far as to confirm that. And this isn't lip service. Each dev diary has generated so much feedback, and the team has been quick to respond and, in a bunch of cases, make swift changes. There have been some occasions where Andersson would reveal a mechanic, and then a week or two later tell the community that it's already been changed based on their response. One example is the change in the relationship between pops, the people living in your provinces, and the estates, which are broader groups of people who can influence the nation. \"We used to have an estate to pop direct connection,\" Andersson said. \"We only had four estates and five pop types. It was like one-to-one links. Now we have multiple adaptive estates because of community feedback. We also have more variation in pop types with, like, labourers and soldiers and tribesmen. So it makes them a more fluid and more natural mechanic.\" As I said in myEuropa Universalis 5 preview, it does come across as an uncompromising game—one that feels like it benefits from a strong vision. But it's simultaneously a game that's being developed specifically for Paradox's community of hardcore grand strategy enthusiasts, and their influence on it is already obvious. Fraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person. With over a decade of experience, he's been around the block a few times, serving as a freelancer, news editor and prolific reviewer. Strategy games have been a 30-year-long obsession, from tiny RTSs to sprawling political sims, and he never turns down the chance to rave about Total War or Crusader Kings. He's also been known to set up shop in the latest MMO and likes to wind down with an endlessly deep, systemic RPG. These days, when he's not editing, he can usually be found writing features that are 1,000 words too long or talking about his dog.

    "article_text": "Whaddaya mean it wasn't already in the Hall of Fame? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. My first thought upon learning that Quake had been inducted into the World Videogame Hall of Fame was that it was very weird Quake wasn't already in the World Videogame Hall of Fame. I mean, you've had Halo in there since 2017, and not Quake? What?What are we even doing here?It's the sort of thing that has the potential to start fistfights in sketchy sports bars—or heated arguments on social media, at least. But never mind, it's all water under the bridge now, as Quake was one of four HoF inductees for 2025. \"Quake was a first person shooter built with the mouse in mind,\" its newly-mintedHall of Fame pagestates, and it might seem weird now but that was actually kind of a big deal back in the days when a lot of us were still playing exclusively with the keyboard. Quake was indeed a huge technical leap over Doom, its groundbreaking predecessor (which, for the record, isalready in the Hall), but it wasn't just the move to real-time 3D that made Quake such an influential game: Extensive mod support gave Quake life far beyond that of most videogames, its server-client architecture revolutionized online gaming, and it laid the foundation for esports as we know them today. \"Not only this, but Quake’s code is a literal legacy,\" the Hall of Fame wrote. \"TheQuake Engine Family Tree, as it is called, has dozens of branches interconnecting different IPs with Quake through its legacy code–franchises. Represented among these are Heretic, Hexen, Doom, Call of Duty, and many more. \"Quake has been influential in nearly every category a game can be influential in, but of few games can it be said that its bones—its code—continues to be present in modern games, more than twenty-five years after its release.\" Quake co-creator John Romero was pretty happy about the whole thing, saying it was a \"huge honor\" to be inducted: Quake was joined in the World Videogame Hall of Fame class of 2025 by the 1981 arcade standupDefender(man, I pumped a lot of quarters into that one), the N64 shooterGoldenEye 007, and the virtual petTamagotchi.

    "title": "Sure, man: The $200 deluxe edition of the Gex Trilogy remaster includes a 3-foot inflatable Gex and box art from legendary illustrator Yoshitaka Amano",
    "article_text": "I've never felt so alive. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. For better or worse, society must soon reckon with Gex once more. As we reported withno small amount of trepidationin 2023, Limited Run Games is releasing Gex Trilogy, a remaster collection of all three adventures of the anthropoid lizard that Crystal Dynamics first inflicted on the human consciousness in 1995. And yesterday, Limited Run revealed theGex Trilogy Tail Time Edition, a $200 fever dream of Gex idolatry including not one, but two separate physical instantiations of Gex that you can place in your real, human home. If you didn't spend a lot of time staring at videogame rental store selections in the late 90s and early 2000s, you might not be familiar with Gex. The gist is that he's a lizard, but also a guy, and kind of a secret agent, except he can go into a sort of TV dimension and dress up as Sherlock Holmes or whatever. His first game was a side-scroller, but the sequels entered Gex into the honored pantheon of 3D character platformer protagonists—except maybe not quite as honored as his peers, considering how long it's taken for a remaster. Voiced by Dana Gould, Gex was a product of a simpler time when you could spin three games out of a comedian pretending to be a reptile pretending to be pop culture characters. If Gex's long absence seemed an injustice to you, you can now make up for it with $200 of prime Gex memorabilia like trading cards, a pin, a 7-inch Gex statue, and a 3-foot-tall inflatable Gex doll. Do these works not please you? My favorite inclusion in the bunch is the collector's edition's exclusive box art, illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano, whose gorgeously surreal art style helped define the visual identity of Final Fantasy through concept designs and commissioned illustrations. And now he's done a Gex. He's got a sword. It's incredible. If that's not enough to tempt you, here's the full rundown of everything that's included in the Gex Trilogy Tail Time Edition: There's also a $75 classic edition with just the game, retro box, steelbook, and a \"soundtrack selection,\" but that doesn't even includeonephysical Gex. To me, that's an insult, but your standards may differ. Amano's Gex masterwork is additionally available as a$50 posteror $301000-piece puzzle, if you just want to appreciate it on its own. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Gex Trilogy will launch onSteamon June 16, but the preorders of its various physical collections and accoutrement have estimated shipping dates ranging from October to next March.

    "article_text": "Half a billion views and counting. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Last week Rockstar announced a major delay to Grand Theft Auto 6, and earlier this week softened the blow by releasing the game's second trailer. It's an incredible spectacle that shows a game more ambitious than anything I've seen before andpacked with detail. Thereal stars are all the wildlife(andbeer bottles). Rockstar now says that this trailer is the biggest video launch of all time, which is a rather fluffy phrase but it offers some impressive stats to back it up. Since the trailer was released on Tuesday it has received over 475 million views across all platforms, a number that's now doubtless even higher. The YouTube version alone is currently sitting at just under 95 million views. The game's first trailer, released in 2023, saw 93 million views over the same time period after release, though that one for whatever reason was also a YouTube exclusive (and broke viewership records, even if itcouldn't quite outperform BTS). The Hollywood Reportercompares the 475 million number to some major movie releases: Deadpool & Wolverine's trailer got 365 million views in its first day, and The Fantastic Four: First Steps had more than 200 million. One more stat. The trailer features several tracks but the main song is Hot Together by The Pointer Sisters, something of a deep cut from a band best-known for tracks like I'm So Excited, and Spotify says streams of this song subsequently increased by *checks notes* 182,000%. \"Grand Theft Auto cuts through popular culture like almost nothing else,\" said Spotify’s Sulinna Ong. \"Music has been synonymous with the series since the very beginning, so it's great to see fans both new and established connecting with an iconic track in this way.\" GTA 6 is now due for release on May 26, 2026, though when we'll see it on PC is anyone's guess: the same year would be lovely, but Rockstar's past form suggests a2027 release wouldn't be out of the question(or even god forbid 2028).

    "title": "Mafia: The Old Country system requirements have been revealed, and Unreal Engine 5 continues to be the thorn in your budget build's side",
    "article_text": "Old Country, new rig. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Unreal Engine 5, with its fancy Lumen illumination and reflections feature, is a bit of a stunner in the right environment, but its continued prevalence might suggest cheaper rigs are due for an upgrade, if Mafia: The Old Country system requirements are anything to go off. Just yesterday,Mafia: The Old Country's release datewas announced (August 8), and now, one day later, theSteam pagehas unveiled its system requirements. They are more or less what you might expect from a modern big-budget Unreal Engine 5 game, especially one in a franchise that has historically looked great for its time. However, the recommended RAM seems a tad high. Not only does it suggest a minimum of 16 GB of RAM just to play it, but the recommended specs sit at 32 GB of RAM. Notably, the minimum specs will get you the Medium graphics preset at 1080p. Alongside the 16 GB of RAM to run it on minimum, you need anAMD Ryzen 7 2700X,Intel Core i7 9700K, or better. Then, for the GPU, you will need anAMD Radeon RX 5700 XTor anNvidia RTX 2070. Minimum Recommended OS Windows 10/11 Windows 10/11 Processor AMD Ryzen 7 2700X / Intel Core i7 9700K AMD Ryzen 7 5800X / Intel Core i7 12700K Memory 16 GB 32 GB Graphics AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / Nvidia RTX 2070 AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT / Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti DirectX Version 12 Version 12 Storage 55 GB 55 GB Extra notes SSD required, Medium graphics preset at 1080p SSD required, High graphics preset at 1440p These are all mid-range parts from before 2020, so if you haven't yet put in an RTX card, you might want to do so with the onslaught of Unreal Engine 5 games coming down the pipeline.Doom: The Dark Agesis about to launch, and despiteperforming well, it needs a similarly beefy set of specs. If you want to run Mafia: The Old Country on High preset at 1440p (what's recommended), you will need anAMD Ryzen 7 5800X, Intel Core i7 12700K processor or better. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As well as this, you will need a rather large 32 GB of RAM, alongside anAMD Radeon RX 6950 XT,Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti, or better. A rig that can run Mafia: The Old Country on recommended specs is still a rather beefy one, and probably not due for an upgrade for a little while. The choice to put the Medium graphics preset as the minimum recommendations is likely a sign of the heavy lifting required to get Unreal Engine 5 working in this game in the first place. The RTX 2060 is a 6 GB card, whereas the RTX 2070 is 8 GB, and Hangar 13 likely doesn't want to go below that threshold. The 2070's 8 GB of RAM is likely the minimum that can get this game working, so players might as well run it on Medium. At 55 GB, it's a fairly big game, but not monstrously so. However, an SSD being required, rather than recommended, is a telling sign of how far recommended specs have come. If you plan on playing Mafia: The Old Country when it launches in August, you'll need a fairly competent machine to run its UE 5 world. If previous Mafia games are anything to go off, I'm expecting it to at least look like it's worth all that power.

Pope Leo XIV has managed to achieve a monumental first, being the first American Pope, but he's also arguably the first gamer Pope, with a love forWordleand Words With Friends, so I'll let you decide which one you think is more impressive. In an interview withNBC, Pope Leo XIV's brother, John Prevost, discussed talking with his brother before he went into the Conclave, and what kind of activities the pair did together. \"First, we do Wordle, because this is a regular thing, OK,\" Prevost says. \"Then we do Words With Friends. It's something to keep his mind off life in the real world.\" It's neat to find out that our current Pope plays Wordle. I'm just here wondering if he ever usesour hints page. There's no shame in that. But it's also not very surprising, considering the hold Wordle had over everyone when itfirst releasedback in 2022. The creator of Wordle, Josh Wardle, has also previously discussed how the entire reason he made this game was to create something fun for someone he loved:\"I'm building this game for my partner.\" \"Don't try to make Wordle,\" Wardle said at the time. \"Make the thing that you're passionate about that is meaningful to you. And then everything else will follow from that.\" Wardle no longer actually owns Wordle, as hesold it off to The New York Timesa few years ago. But I have no doubt that he must be feeling some kind of way knowing that a game he originally made for his partner and friends is now being played by the Pope. Prevost didn't just stick to games while chatting with his brother. He also asked the new Pope whether he'd finished watching Conclave in order to prepare for his possible election, and hilariously, he'd apparently just finished watching it. Life imitates art. \"I wanted to take his mind off of it,\" Prevost continues. \"You know, laugh about something, because this is now an awesome responsibility.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "A year later and over six months since the last patch, Intel is STILL releasing updates to fix instability problems with its 13th and 14th Gen Raptor Lake CPUs",
    "article_text": "These bugs refuse to be squashed... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A couple of weeks ago I reported the surprising news that Intel's elderly and bug-infested 13th and 14th Gen Raptor Lake CPUs arestill selling in numbers. Now it turns out Intel is also still working at completely fixing all the problems those chips have had since launch. The results are anew microcode updatewhich comes over six months since the last patch was released in September. To say this story has been running on and on is an acute understatement. Back in September, we moaned that, \"one might have thought all the Intel stability issue malarkey was behind us,\" what with previous patches in June and August last year which aimed to solve the problems having been and gone. But here we are in May 2025 and Intel has yet another patch for the well publicisedstability issues that plagued 13th and 14th Gen Raptor Lake CPUs. The new microcode fix—dubbed 0x12F and not to be confused with the 0x125, 0x129 and 0x12B patches that came before it—\"further improves system conditions that can potentially contribute to Vmin Shift Instability on Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop-powered systems.\" Intel is at pains to point out that this new microcode does not imply a change in its analysis of the actual cause of the problems. \"The release of the 0x12F microcode does not alter the root cause determination for the Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processor Vmin Shift Instability issue,\" Intel says. You can readIntel's detailed explanation here. But the short version is that multiple factors were causing the chips to run excess voltage and power levels. Exactly what changes Intel has made with the latest patch aren't clear. It's frankly pretty remarkable that Intel is still releasing patches for this bug, well over year after the problem first emerged. On the one hand, it's reassuring that Intel is still putting resources into older products, but on the other, you really might have thought it would have fixed the problem with earlier patches. Indeed, the fact that Intel is still working away at the problem implies that there may never be a \"total fix\" for Raptor Lake's woes. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. On a somewhat tangential note, almost as surprising as the idea that Intel is still chipping away at these processors is the revelation that it does serious internal testing at a resolution of 1,280 by 1,024 pixels. In therelease notes for this latest patch, Intel details that resolution for its Cinebench R23.200, Speedometer 3, WebXPRT4 (v3.73), and Crossmark testing. If I remember correctly, the last time I used that res. was around 2004, when a 19-inch flat panel was the latest thing and many PC gamers might still be using 1,280 by 1,024 on a CRT. But here's Intel, right at the bleeding edge in 2025, doing testing at 1,280 by 1,024. Interesting, eh?

    "title": "'It was eye-opening': How a WoW documentary inspired Muscular Dystrophy UK's Liam Quinn to raise money and build community in the haven of videogames",
    "article_text": "Game On. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I had the pleasure of attending a Netflix event around the WoW documentary The Remarkable Life of Ibelin last year—one that was attended byfolks from Muscular Dystrophy UK, a charity that helps fund research into the kinds of muscle-wasting conditions that impact not just Ibelin's late player, Mats Steen, but many disabled gamers the world over. Steen's journey, as told through the documentary, has already helped raise$2 million in conjunction with Blizzard. But it's also inspiredMuscular Dystrophy UKto walk a similar path, using videogames as a means to not only raise money for those with muscle wasting conditions, but also empower them to take part in the fundraising themselves. I sat down with Liam Quinn, corporate partnerships officer at Muscular Dystrophy UK, who I met at that initial event. Quinn has Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) type three—but he's also a World of Warcraft player, who met his wife Ana after flaming someone during a dungeon queue like a proper MMO patriot. As he told me last year: \"Ana was tanking, so I was like, 'would you like to stay in the group and we can carry on going?'\" And the rest is history. That entire experience—the documentary and the event, not the terrible dungeon run—was transformative for Quinn's efforts to help bring the community of videogames to more people with conditions like his: \"The plan was to try and do something in person that could bring our community of people living with muscle weakening and wasting conditions together over this sort of shared hobby. Which obviously the Life of Ibelin shone a spotlight on.\" However, the documentary changed things: \"I think it was eye opening for a lot of our community. I don't want to speak for everybody, but maybe some didn't realize that everyone was playing games, and everyone was enjoying them for the same reasons. It was a very shared experience among the community.\" Through Ibelin, Mats Steen was able to live a rich and transformed life—and for Quinn, who similarly found his wife playing videogames, that resonated with him. Still, he laments that not a lot of people with muscle wasting conditions (and other disabilities, too) are able to find community in online spaces. Similar to Steen, who struggled to tell his guild he had Duchenne's, Quinn had a moment where he briefly considered hiding the truth from Ana. \"I think it's hard to reach out and find a community that has that shared experience. And I think part of what we want to achieve with Game On at MDUK, is to signpost that community. So they don't have to think: Do I reveal this to my close peers? … You can know that this community is out there and existing. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"It shouldn't be on people in our community to constantly have to chase that themselves. That's where we come in. And hopefully we can facilitate that for them by providing the platform of Game On, definitely.\" Game On is, simply put, an initiative built to help enable fundraisers and foster online community spaces for those with muscular dystrophy conditions to support each other.Getting in touch with Muscular Dystrophy UKwill let them set you up to help do a fundraiser either on your channel, or theirs. Their first proper event, which took place at Play New Meta in Islington, was a great proof of concept for the whole endeavour. \"There were a few cancellations—there were some weather and cancellations—but it didn't matter,\" he explains, saying that they still managed to get over a hundred people watching the livestream alone. Maybe a humble number by internet streamer superstar standards, but when it comes to any fundraiser, especially one angled to fostering a community? It's a great start. Quinn is glad that those cancellations were able to attend digitally, since mobility is naturally an issue for people like him—and with the internet's instant connectivity, it's something gaming uniquely can provide: \"Someone's capacity to involve themselves might be greatly improved by their ability to be within their home comforts and in a setting that they're familiar with, and doing something that is an enjoyment and a hobby for them.\" Quinn brings upStephen Wallaceas a great example of someone whose gaming efforts have helped the charity before. Wallace, also known as 06wallst on Twitch, \"had a close friend who had the condition, and he's now used the platform of Game On via his platform on Twitch\". Wallace alone has raised over £2,500 for the charity while working with them. \"In terms of what an individual can do with Game On to amplify awareness … Yeah, it's a standout for me.\" In terms of other things people can do to help, Quinn says the biggest hurdle by far is letting folks know these spaces and communitiesexistfor them. \"It really is to signpost it,\" he says, \"and highlight that it's a possibility, that it's there for them … if they don't know it's there, they can't take part in it.\" There's making sure you're listening to each individual person's own access means, Quinn says, but it really does come down to making sure you \"invite people, reach out, and extend that olive branch.\" As for the future of Game On, while there's not an event lined up just yet, Quin'll be at TwitchCon in Rotterdam later this month with \"tote bags, goodies, and there for a chat with anybody who may have a friend with the condition … we'll be around, we'll be live-streaming as much as we can on theMDUK Twitch page.\" Quinn says they're also planning to launch a podcast around a week before TwitchCon. \"Anyone can get involved,\" Quinn emphasises. \"Anyone who wants to raise money by holding a monopoly night, a chess tournament at a local, if they want to stream on their Twitch page and play World of Tanks or do a run-through of FF7, whatever they want to do, sign up for Game On and we can support you.\" As for what Quinn wants out of the endeavour, \"All I can do is hope that they get any percentage of the satisfaction that I've had from what games have given me, and the enjoyment that I've had and the life I've created for myself from them … any amount of that other people are able to experience, I think, would be a success.\" You cansign up for Game On here.

    "article_text": "Demaking a remaster, kind of. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you are anything like me, there's a good chance that your TikTok is currently exploding with clips, tips, and guides in the wake of the launch ofThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. Perhaps my favourite little digital nugget to come out of my scrolling is one account dedicated to showing off new games through the retro screen of a CRT TV. User, CRT Dream, posted their \"Oblivion on a CRT\" video this week, and it shows off part of the joy of using a CRT well. There are a few major reasons people still love CRTs. The first, because it's nostalgic, is definitely part of the vibe that CRT Dream is trying toconjurehere. Showing the TV in low light, with candles, and a copy of Morrowind on the original Xbox certainly evokes that vibe, but so too does the sound. Dark Fantasy Song Ambient Mix Slowed (Dorian Concept Hide CS01), yes that is the song's full title, is often used alongside retro dark fantasy stills, and anunfortunate amount of AI-generated art. However, there are, if not practical then at least reasonable, reasons to hang on to that blocky old TV your parents haven't mustered the will to throw out.Modern gaming on a CRTgives you vibrant, clear colors, deep blacks, and great whites. It is also very responsive. Just look at the video and tell me it doesn't add to the fantasy set up by Oblivion's grimey prison walls or high castles. CRT TVs smooth edges in a way that works well for retro games that otherwise look overly sharp on LCDs. Putting the technical reasons aside, it just has a look and feel that is distinct, and this is why some retro purists would never let their old NES touch anything else. CRT TVs do have a pretty low resolution across the board, and this means a modern TV will look better in a technical sense, but those using CRT TVS aren't doing it to get the highest, most cutting-edge resolutions. CRT Dream is less about playing retro games and more about playing new games in a retro way. Scrolling through their TikTok, you can see Oblivion Remastered,Bloodborne, and they even watched the trailer for TheDuskbloodson it. WatchingBioshock Infinite playing on a CRTwith Higher by Creed playing the background sort of sounds like my nightmares, but there's something about watching it through the TikTok of a passionate fan that just makes me say 'Hell Yeah'. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This dedication to the bit is charming in the most geeky way. To get some of these games running on a CRT TV, not only do you need an adapter to go from HDMI or Display Port to VGA adapter, but you sometimes need togo into game filesto get the game running on the 4:3 resolution necessary for the TV.

    "article_text": "Here comes a new challenger. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Overwatch 2has been on a roll when it comes to all the collaborations that it's had over the last couple of years. What started as an uncommon occurrence has quickly escalated into a frequent event, with the latest crossover bringing Street Fighter 6 into the mix. Earlier today,Overwatch 2 announcedthat several of its own heroes will be getting Street Fighter 6-themed skins. There's Juno as Chun Li, Zenyatta as Dhalsim, Soldier: 76 as Guile, Winston as Blanka, Hanzo as Ryu, Kiriko as Juri, Widowmaker as Cammy, and Sigma as M.Bison. Here comes a new challenger! 🕹️💪Dominate the battlefield as your favorite fighters when Overwatch 2 x Street Fighter 6 arrives on May 20 💥 pic.twitter.com/hQDBxLMroZMay 9, 2025 The collab trailer shows off each one of these skins as all the characters involved fight one another, giving hints to how their abilities may be tweaked in-game to match the character. At one point, Hanzo shouts \"Hadoken!\" while firing off the iconic move. I'm guessing he may call this out when he ults in-game, and his Dragonstrike will also be changed to fit the vibe. Overwatch 2 collabs have been getting better as time goes on, with more than just new skins introduced. Increasingly detailed sound and particle effects have been added to elevate the crossover. Like the wind rushing by Orisa when she emotes with her Avatar: The Last Airbender Appa skin, or the Firenation theme tune playing when Genji ults with his Zuko skin equipped. My guess is that we'll also get some similarly-cool effects this time around, too. There have been a couple of weird collabs, too, though. The main one that springs to mind is an oddPorsche collabthat happened a year ago. It only involved D.Va and Pharah but the skins still looked rather odd. While it may be a pretty stacked collab, there are still some players who are upset that their favourite heroes didn't make the cut. Doomfist, Sojourn, and Tracer are names I've seen thrown around that players think would work well with the SF6 roster. While I love to see Juno and Soldier 76 involved, I have to admit that Doomfist would've been a really great fit for this—he already punches people, c'mon. But who am I to complain when we just got a Juno x Chun Li skin? I'm just counting my blessings. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "How to play Dune: Awakening multiplayer",
    "article_text": "Apes together, strong. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Surviving the harsh wastes of Arrakis is much less intimidating with friends, butDune: Awakeningmultiplayerisn't the easiest thing to set up thanks to some awkward menus. With a much more linear opening than most survival sandboxes, there are also a few kinks to iron out if you're looking to play with others. Below, I'll go over how you actually group up and play with friends so you can survive the dunes together. As you'd expect from a survival game, there are lots of deep systems and precious materials to find, which you don't want yoinked by other players, so I'll also explain how to change player permissions. To play with friends, all you need to do is: You can accept other players' friend invites by pressing Enter when the prompt appears (before the timer expires) or through the social menu. If you're having trouble joining or finding each other, make sure you're playing on the same server. You can also manage your party from the \"players\" tab in the social menu. Here, you can invite more players, kick them, leave the party, and manage the permissions and ranks of individual members. Once you've formed a party with another player, they'll be marked on your map, and you can meet up. You can do pretty much everything with another player, from building bases and exploring and riding on the same sandbike provided you have the second seat module installed. It's worth noting that it's technically possible to bypass much of the intended progression by playing with other players. You could join a late-game player and be handed a sandbike or an ornithopter for free, or given high-end resources. I even tested heading into the second region of the map before I had officially unlocked it, which triggered a story cutscene ahead of time but didn't skip the pre-requisite quests. One thing I recommend doing right away is managing the permissions of party members and friends. By promoting and demoting players, you can control who can access what. You can head into the social menu to tweak the rank of individual players, but you'll also need to change the access level of items (like chests), which is done by interacting with them and going to the \"general settings\" tab. By default, players will be made associates, which prevents them from adding or removing players, and more importantly, interacting with most features of base building. For example, associates can't open containers or access vehicles (unless you go out of your way to lower the access level to associates). It's even possible to trap someone inside a building if you restrict access to the door. This is great if you're playing with a random person that you don't particularly trust, but you probably don't want this if you're teaming up with your bestie. On the other hand, promoting people to co-owners lets them add and remove players and interact with base items. In other words, you can share your home and items like a proper team should. Importantly, even co-owners can't promote or demote players (including themselves), so you won't find your base usurped entirely. Here are the three roles, and what each one can do: Permissions Owner Co-Owner Associate View ownership menu Yes Yes Yes Add players to the group Yes Yes No Remove players from the group Yes Yes No Promote or demote players in the group Yes No No General access to your base, including doors, chests, and machines Yes Yes Yes Place deployables within your base range Yes Yes Yes Base building management Yes Yes No Move or demolish the sub-fief console Yes No No You can trade with players by holding the interact key while looking at them, and selecting the trade option, represented by two arrows. Here, you can offer any item for your inventory, including high-end resources that the other player might not have access to yet. Both players must accept the trade before it will go through, so you can't be cheated out of your prized possessions. Trading was very buggy for me, with trades frequently failing to actually go through despite us both agreeing. If this happens to you, you'll just have to try again and hope it works next time. Otherwise, you can also just drop items on the floor, which can be picked up by anyone. Obviously, it's much easier to effectively back out of a deal and \"steal\" items dropped this way, so be careful who you're trading with if you're dropping items like this. As it stands during the closed beta,Dune: Awakening doesn't have crossplay, nor will it be available at launch on PC. While the game will be on Xbox and PS5, it doesn't launch on consoles until a later, unspecified time. Developer Funcom is yet to confirm whether Dune: Awakening will eventually support crossplay, though I'd be surprised if it didn't when the console versions eventually arrive. Surviving Arakkis is much more fun with friends, after all. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "AMD's upcoming RX 9060 XT GPU listed on Amazon for a depressing $449 for the 8 GB version and $529 for the 16 GB option",
    "article_text": "A hard pass at these prices. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AMD's upcoming Radeon RX 9060 XT is meant to be about accessible gaming performance when it arrives,probably within a few weeks. But if a couple of listings thatcurrently appear on Amazon(viaVideocardz) are anything to go by, we may have to adjust expectations. The 8 GB variant of the GPU is listed for $449, with the 16 GB option at $519. Ouch. Both of the cards are XFX-branded 'OC' GPUs. So, they may have MSRPs well above whatever AMD chooses as a base price for the RX 9060 XT twins—though as XFX \"Swift\" models, they are not from XFX's very highest tier of AIB cards. And, of course, MSRPs are only very loosely related to real-world pricing when it comes to graphics cards these days. Despite all that, these prices still look awfully unappealing. By way of example,Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB, which is probably the closest existing competitor for the new AMD GPU, has an MSRP of $429. The 8 GB 5060 Ti is MSRP'ed at $379. Real-world pricing is a little higher at roughly$420 for the 5060 Ti 8 GBand$480 for the 16 GB card. But that's still below these XFX RX 9060 XT listings, which hardly fits AMD's broader sales pitch for Radeon GPUs of late, that'scentred around value and bang for buck. The prices are also painfully unappealing in the context of AMD's own Radeon RX 9070 and9070 XT boards. While the RX 9060 XT hasn't been officially announced, its specifications are fairly certain to be exactly one half of the 9070 XT and thus 2,048 stream processors and a 128-bit memory bus to the 4,096 processors and 256-bit bus of the 9070 XT. Lest you have forgotten, the 9070 XT is MSRP'ed at $599, withthe vanilla 9070 at $549. So, the idea you'd want to pay over $500 for half the GPU simply doesn't scan. The catch is that the 9070 XT tends to go for well over MSRP, and that's if you can get it at all. Newegg, by way of example,lists 9070 XTs from about $660. But the cheapest actually in stock is upfor a ridiculous $899. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Of course, US pricing is particularly bad right now. In the UK you can grab a9070 XT for £660 easily enough. Above MSRP, to be sure, but not nearly as bad. Arguably more of a problem is the fact that you cangrab an Nvidia RTX 5070 in the US for just over $600 in the USandjust over £500 in the UK. OK, you're only getting 12GB of VRAM with the 5070. But it's a fundamentally more powerful GPU and also offers Nvidia's industry-leading feature set, superior path tracing performance and all that stuff. Anyway, we'll obviously have to wait and see where the new AMD GPUs land in terms of both MSRP and real-world pricing when they arrive,probably at Computex starting 20 May. But these Amazon listings hardly bode well. For the record, the Amazon listings mention a June 5 release date. So, that's probably a relevant marker in terms of actual retail availability.

FromSoftwarefinally showed off what one of the newElden Ring: NightreignNight Bosses is going to look like in the heat of battle, and it looks every bit as chaotic as the frenzied flame and painful as the golden order. \"Behold, the first live gameplay for Libra, Creature of Night,\"Bandai Namco USsays with a video from PAX East. The clip shows three players taking on Libra after what looks like a couple of days; just look at the size of the players' health bars. BEHOLD! The first live gameplay for Libra: Creature of Night!Catch ELDEN RING #NIGHTREIGN at @PAX East pic.twitter.com/D895VWzcDrMay 8, 2025 Nightreign's runthroughs are purposefully pretty short. At the start, you pick one of eight final bosses to battle, but before you take them on, you need to survive two \"days\" in Nightreign. This will let you level up your attributes, collect loot, and just practice fighting as a team of three. You start out on the outskirts of a different version of Limgrave and work your way to the centre, fighting bosses and grunts along the way. Once you get to the centre, or if you get to the centre, I should say, there'll be a random boss waiting to fight you. Only after you defeat them can you go on to the next day. But Libra isn't a final boss, it's just an end-of-day foe. I sayjustas if it doesn't look absolutely terrifying and won't be decently hard to take down. Libra combines incantations that are similar to the frenzied flame and the golden order with swift melee attacks. It can conjure an orb that'll shoot beams of light out of it and a glyph that'll emit rapid light projectiles. It also uses large area of effect fire spells that inflict madness. Elden Ring Ranni quest: Follow the witchElden Ring Blaidd quest: Wolf man watchElden Ring Nepheli quest: Warrior womanElden Ring Fia quest: Cold comfortElden Ring volcano manor quest: Get Mt. Gelmir You don't really get a good look at it in this video, but if you manage to dodge a melee attack from Libra, then it'll open the boss up to a counterattack, so you'd better practice your rolling. The video just looks tiringly chaotic, flames are raining from the sky, people are yelling, all the players keep nearly getting one shot, and this boss is taking an offensively small amount of damage after each hit. I'm sure Libra is going to be one of my favourites. These are some of the other bosses that we know will make an appearance in Nightreign: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But there should be tons of other bosses either making an appearance at the end of the day or just randomly throughout runthroughs. When I played in theclosed network test, I encountered the Godskin Noble as soon as I landed, andMorgott randomly appeared so many timesI felt like he had become a part of our crew. I must admit, though, while the Demi-Human Queen and Demi-Human Swordmaster were irritating enough to fight against with three strangers, Libra looks like it'll start a lot of arguments and probably lead to plenty of rage quits.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Doom: The Dark Ages is indulgent and deliciously violent, but surprisingly safe. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. What is itThe latest FPS from the makers of Doom, Quake, and Wolfenstein.Release DateMay 15, 2025Expect to Pay$70/£60Developerid SoftwarePublisherMicrosoftReviewed onRTX 2080 Super, Intel Core i9 9900KS, 32GB RAMMultiplayerNoSteam DeckUntestedLinkOfficial site In a time when the FPS campaign is so vanishingly rare that the only helping of big-budget shooting we can rely on each year is from Call of Duty, it'd be easy for id Software to kick up its feet and decide \"more Doom\" is good enough. Honestly, it'd be good enough for me. But that'd be dereliction of id's duty to the genre it created. To id, a new Doom is an opportunity to demolish a perfectly good sand castle and start fresh.Doom: The Dark Agesis the trilogy's sharpest zag yet—recasting the Slayer from a meaty fighter jet, ducking and dashing past the hordes of Hell, to a stalwart tank, smashing shield-first into the action. The transition is successful, but not without major sacrifice. This is Doom at its most indulgent and deliciously violent, but it's also dumbed down and undeniably the easiest of the trilogy. Maps are uncharacteristically barren, secrets abnormally obvious, and puzzles so simple that they hardly fit the description. Viewed through the lens of loud feedback that insisted Doom Eternal was too complicated, The Dark Ages is an overcorrection. The Dark Ages turns back the clock to our favorite demon smasher's salad days as a pawn of the Makyrs (those floating tentacle guys from the previous games) in a war against Hell. He's the same Slayer as ever, still feral and focused in his distaste for demons, now sporting a tasteful beast pelt to let us know we're in olden times. But in a decision that proves profoundly shortsighted, the Makyrs keep him locked up in a spaceship with a shock collar. You can imagine how that goes. We got Sentinels, battle tanks, mechs, dragons, and a surprising density of cutscenes for Doom. This time, it's not just detached robot voices telling the Slayer what to kill next. Instead, we see the main players in his orbit, King Novik of Argent D'Nur vs. Prince Ahzrak of Hell, facing off between bouts of bloodshed. Characters and plot have as much nuance as professional wrestling, setting the stage for the campaign's next set piece—a grand siege, ancestral forge, the belly of a demon taller than a downtown highrise—without ever getting bogged down by proper nouns. It's appropriately uncomplicated. The Slayer's otherworldly determination and general freakishness are amplified by his proximity to normal, communicative humans. They treat him like an unknowable demigod, inherently dangerous but effective when pointed in the direction of hellspawn. I loved the dynamic, partly because id is paying off years of mythbuilding, but also because this Slayer adopts the role of a deranged Master Chief, more or less following orders as long as he agrees with the mission. The Dark Age's rebooted gun ballet revolves around the Shield Saw. Permanently bound to right-click, the shield blocks all damage from the front and sends green projectiles back to their senders. It's a singular change that ripples through every facet of The Dark Ages, anchoring the Slayer to the ground in exchange for survivability. Our Nick's been running the rule overDoom: The Dark Ages' PC performancefor the past week or so, across a wide selection of systems; young and old, high-end and low, desktop and laptop. And it's performing pretty well whatever rig you might have. I cannot sing the praises of the Shield Saw loud enough: Shrugging off the blows of lesser demons and nailing the timing on parries is empowering from minute one, elevating Doom's brutality and giving the player permission to run toward the biggest threats instead of playing keep-away. In fact, the only move resembling Eternal's air dash is a shield dash that instantly closes the distance on large demons and obliterates fodder on contact. An early upgrade gives the shield its chainsaw teeth, turning it into a throwable that either stuns or slices straight through demons. The shield slots into Doom's deadly dance like it was always there. It's elegant, useful, aggressive… and unfortunately also one-note. Once you can throw it around, the shield is done evolving, my tactics were locked in for the campaign's duration. What The Dark Ages gains with its shield, it loses with its guns. Relinquishing right-click to block means guns no longer have dedicated secondary fire modes—they're still upgradable, but now focused on passive boosts to reload speed, fire rate, or damage. Besides a few bright spots, like a Shredder upgrade that let me shoot at my thrown shield to ricochet stakes toward surrounding enemies, my weapons never improved in ways that encouraged me to alter my game plan. Bland guns are a symptom of The Dark Ages' larger streamlining problems. For example: I'd been glancing at this greyed-out screen of upgrades called Shield Runes for hours, anticipating some sort of blue Gravity Gun-level twist that'd take my shield antics to the next level. When I got my first Shield Rune halfway through the game, I was disappointed to find that they're essentially gun upgrades for the shield—damage-dealing attacks automatically triggered by successful parries, and I could only have one equipped. Neat, but since they're just something that happens when I parry an attack (something I was already doing whenever possible), it's just more DPS on the pile. What worked in hour one of The Dark Ages—spamming my shotguns, shield dashing away from danger, and deflecting anything colored green—worked in hour 17, and that's a huge bummer. As much as it pains me to admit, The Dark Ages' thematic stand-ins for ballistic guns just aren't as fun to shoot. The Ballista replacement launches stakes that hit hard but have an oddly short range, the Shredder is just a Heavy Cannon that sounds like a nail gun, and those guns that hurl bits of skull are all bark and no bite. The lone exception to this rule is the Chainshot—a monstrous back-half arrival that launches wrecking balls, caving in skulls before reeling back into the gun like a sinful yo-yo. Thankfully id didn't mess with its two shotguns, the rocket launcher, or the plasma rifle, all of which sound and look better than ever. Bland guns are a symptom of The Dark Ages' larger streamlining problems. The role of any individual gun is murky at best because all demons are vulnerable to almost all weapons, and most don't pose a significant threat. Every boss fight and high-tier enemy is designed around creating openings by parrying with the shield. This is a quietly huge shift because in both previous Dooms of this series, enemies had clear-cut resistances and weaknesses that, here, are replaced by throwing the shield at armor to destroy it. The Slayer's constant vulnerability previously meant his arsenalwashis shield. It was about working quickly and efficiently to kill demons faster than they can kill you. It was crucial to survey the battlefield and make decisions about which weapons to conserve for tougher targets. The only way out was through. In The Dark Ages, the solution to every problem is in your left hand: Block it, shoot it, and you're done. It doesn't help that ammo is completely irrelevant, too. In a truly baffling change, the chainsaw is gone, and now all you gotta do for endless piles of ammo is punch (E) the nearest grunt. Glory kills get a similar treatment: They're mostly gone, with larger demons getting some gruesome new animations while the majority of executions settle for brief slo-mo punches that pop health items. Hear that? It's the sound of Doom's signature health/ammo/shield resource economy evaporating. The last two Dooms set the bar absurdly high, and being in their shadows still makes The Dark Ages one of the best singleplayer FPSes around. I get the sense that The Dark Ages' heavy mechanical pruning is in service of making it the most accessible, instantly enjoyable Doom for the most people. If that's the case, then mission accomplished. It's still Doom, so it's still very fun. The last two set the bar absurdly high, and being in their shadows still makes The Dark Ages one of the best singleplayer FPSes around. I suspect its throttled pace will make The Dark Ages the most comfortable of the series to play with a controller. Customizable difficulty will help, too: A long list of toggles and sliders let me tune everything from projectile speeds and parry windows to exact damage values. That's a win for everybody. I did have more fun after increasing enemy aggression, tightening the parry window, and experimenting with higher projectile speeds, but at some point, I had to accept I was fishing for complexity that wasn't there. The Dark Ages' levels are especially simplistic next to the mazes and jungle gyms of the last two games. Presumably to accommodate all the slow-moving projectiles and the Slayer's wimpy new jump, most maps are massive, flat, and devoid of hazards—like id took Doom 2016's winding corridors and pressed them into a pancake. I like that they're more friendly to backtracking than ever, with areas spoking off a central platform, but a few of the larger maps had me sprinting across empty deserts way too often. Secrets are still scattered literally everywhere, but the majority of them are so obviously placed and announced by the map that I rarely felt like I was discovering something. It's another area where Eternal had more to offer: Those ultra-hard, opt-in challenge rooms? Gone. Now puzzles just give you an extra life or more gold to buy upgrades. At least those platforming sections that a lot of folks hated (but I loved) demanded a quick reflex test to get to the side goodies. I should mention the mech and dragon stuff that's all over the trailers. They're cool little moments of punching demons in a big robot and dogfighting with hellships sprinkled throughout the 22-level campaign, but they're so brief, easy, and detached from the main action that they didn't stick in my head. An unnecessary, but welcome change of scenery. If it sounds like I'm just asking for Doom Eternal 2, I promise I'm not. The Dark Ages is fun in totally different ways than its predecessors, and I love that, but its peaks are lower. After rolling credits, I went back to Doom (2016) and Eternal to confirm the gut feeling. id has done a lot of subtraction with not a lot of addition, and I reckon this is the first Doom that I won't replay. Doom is a series I associate with taking big swings, but The Dark Ages is safe. Doom: The Dark Ages is indulgent and deliciously violent, but surprisingly safe.

    "article_text": "Though once path tracing makes an appearance, all bets will probably be off. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Doom has been around so long—32 years and counting—that you'd be forgiven for thinking that developers id Software must have produced hundreds of entries for the franchise on PC. The shocking truth is there have just been five, if one ignores all the third-party versions, expansion stuff and rejigged editions. And it's been five years since the last one,Doom Eternal, graced our gaming rigs. Well, it's back again and Doom: The Dark Ages is the first Doom game to be fully ray traced, all the time. If that's got you worried about performance or the necessity for blurry upscalers and wonky frame generation, then let me allay those fears now—Doom: The Dark Ages runs pretty well across a decent range of PC configurations, though the entry requirements are a little on the steep side.First of all, you need a GPU with dedicated ray tracing hardware. For AMD users, that means an RX 6000-series graphics card or newer. In the case of Intel, both generations of the Arc range will do, and for Nvidia fans, any RTX card will cut the mustard. Well, not quiteanycard because Doom: The Dark Ages also requires 8 GB of VRAM as a minimum.Actually, itdoesn'tand I'll prove this shortly. What youdoneed, though, is a decent platform around your graphics card. While Doom: The Dark Ages isn't super heavy on your CPU, it does need to be reasonably new and, ideally, one with 12 threads or more. But enough chitter-chatter, let's go and see how well the new Doom actually runs. To get a measure of how Doom: The Dark Ages runs across a range of gaming PCs, I usedBethesda's PC system requirementsto choose what systems to test it on. With ray tracing permanently used and no shader-based replacement to fall back on, that meant waving goodbye to my faithful old Radeon RX 5700 XT as the base GPU. The lowest spec ray-tracing capable GPU I could use was a GeForce RTX 2060. This, along with the Core i7 9700K platform it was housed in, is below the minimum system requirements but they're only guidelines, not hard and fast rules! The same is true for the RTX 4050 laptop, as both it and the older Turing GPU only have 6 GB of VRAM. However, I wanted to compare the two graphics chips to see if Nvidia's advances in ray tracing overrode the differences in CPU and VRAM amounts. I used the starting phase of the second chapter, up to the first locked door in the level, as my test area of choice. There are other sections of the game where the performance is lower than what you'll see below, but equally, there are plenty of sections where Doom: The Dark Ages runs faster. Overall, the area I've used is a reasonable representation of the whole game, though I've not checked out every section yet. One important thing to note with the new Doom is that the engine doesn't skip frames when running slowly. Essentially, the game's internal clock is somewhat tied to the frame rate, and when the latter is below 30 fps, the game becomes increasingly treacle-like, like everything is running in slow motion. It seems like the engine is capped at 60 fps, because any frame rate around this level feels sharp and snappy. Oddly, going much higher than this doesn't feel any better—in fact, between 90 and 120 fps, Doom: The Dark Ages feels a tad disjointed. It's not lagging or stuttering in any way, and no performance metric agrees with the feeling, but at 120 fps, it doesn't feel as silky smooth as you'd expect. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Doom: The Dark Ages has six graphics presets—Low, Medium, High, Ultra, Nightmare, and Ultra Nightmare. However, the last two in the review code were essentially inactive, as they'll be properly used when id Software releases a path tracing patch later. For testing, I used two pre-release drivers from AMD and Nvidia, as Bethesda recommended that these would ensure the game would run as glitch-free as possible. I didn't experience any crashes, but the Adrenalin drivers refused to work with MSI Afterburner (so I resorted to using Intel's PresentMon for some of the upscaling performance videos), and both sets occasionally threw up the odd rendering hiccup. As with all my performance analysis pieces, I started with the Low preset and left the rest of the graphics options on their default settings. This includes TAA for anti-aliasing and a texture pool size of 2048 MB (more about this setting later). Before we dive into the performance results, just watch the above video of a test run with the Low preset and then skip ahead and view that for the Ultra preset. Can you see any difference? There aresome,but you have to really look for them, and in some ways, it's really great that id Software has made Doom: The Dark Ages look as good as it does on the lowest of settings. On the other hand, it makes me wonder what the point of the other presets is—what use is there in having all those individual graphics options, when they barely seem to change anything? That oddity aside, the new Doom runs pretty well across the board at 1080p Low. I know that's to be expected, but with ray tracing used everywhere, there was always a chance that it wouldn't be great, even though Indiana Jones and the Great Circle runs pretty well, and that's always ray traced, too (and powered by id Tech 7). However, things take an interesting turn once the resolution increases to 1440p and 4K. The RTX 4050 laptop copes fine at 1080p, but adding more pixels just tanks the performance. Now thatisto be expected, as every pixel will just generate more rays to be processed and the RTX 4050 isn't designed to handle more 1080p. Now, you might think that another issue is the laptop's 6 GB of VRAM. Doom: The Dark Ages has a dedicated setting for the texture pool, and it defaults to 2048 MB—that means 2 GB of VRAM are being used for streaming textures, leaving just 4 GB for everything else. Doesn't sound like it's enough, right? As you can see above, changing the texture pool size doesn't make much difference. So, even though Bethesda recommends 8 GB of VRAM as being the absolute minimum to run the game, as long as you keep to 1080pandyou're using a recent generation of GPU, 6 GB isn't as big a barrier as you might think. The RTX 4050 might be able to run Doom: The Dark Ages faster if it had more VRAM but I don't think anyone's really going to complain about getting over 60 fps, when the Low preset looks fine. Switching to the Medium preset improves the quality and accuracy of ray-traced reflections, but that's about it for immediately noticeable graphics gains. There are other improvements, such as better lighting and shadows, but nothing to make you go 'Wow, this is so much better!' At least the performance hit is very small, going from Low to Medium. It's so small, in fact, that you might as well just use Medium as the 'Low' preset—you get pretty much the same frame rate as you get with the actual Low preset, but with nicer reflections. That's as long as you stick to 1080p or 1440p, as 4K really grinds down the frame rate. TheRTX 5090test rig loses just over half its performance when going from 1080p to 4K, with the Medium preset, but while that may sound like a bit hit, don't forget that 4K hasfourtimes more pixels than 1080p. That's a healthy amount of extra rays to trace and shade, so the performance drop is understandable. One interesting problem occurred with the RTX 2060 test rig, with the Medium preset (and it repeated for High and Ultra). Basically, the game refused to register shield hits for ticking off a quest marker—all of the animations, kill sequences, etc would run as normal (well, as normal as you'd expect for 26 fps) but they'd just not be recognised as having taken place. The solution was to use upscaling, and we'll look at what that does for performance shortly. I expected there to be some bigger changes in the graphics quality, going from Medium to High, but as you can see in the above video, there's little to separate the two. Just as with the previous preset, the drop in frame rate is small—enough that one might be tempted to consider High as basically the 'Medium' preset. But hang on, isn't Medium the new 'Low'? Surely that would make High the same as Low! I'm exaggerating, of course, as the RTX 3060 Ti test rig runs 20% slower, on average, at 1080p and 22% slower at 1440p (when comparing the High preset to the Low one). That's hardly an insignificant decrease, but the Ampere-powered GPU is still managing to pull over 50 frames per second. Just as with the other presets, 4K Dooming is the preserve of the RTX 5090, though the RX 7900 XT isn't that far off 60 fps with the Low preset—that's pretty impressive considering that this native rendering and AMD's GPUs have never had the greatest of reputations when it comes to ray tracing. At the very least, the closeness of the presets—in terms of graphics and performance—means that there's no need to worry about 'best settings' and other tweaks. Just fire Doom: The Dark Ages up at Medium or High, and then adjust the resolution (either natively or via upscaling) to get the performance you want. At the time of testing, the Ultra preset is the highest graphics option, and it should come as no surprise that Ultra doesn't look a whole lot better than the High preset (or Medium, for that matter), given what we've seen so far. The optionsarechanging something, otherwise, there would be no performance difference whatsoever between the presets, and it's entirely possible that the changes are far more noticeable in other regions of the game. However, I'm still conflicted over how I feel about it all. Let's take a look at the ray-traced reflections change with each preset, because it's too hard to pick this out from the videos. Note that with the Low preset, you don't get much in the way of the environment appearing in the reflections, just the lighting. But if you scroll across to the Medium preset and then follow through to the Ultra preset, you'll see that you get everything with all four options above Low. Of course, if one stops stomping around and peers closer at the scenery, other differences do start to show up. For example, the Low preset disables self-shadowing, whereas the other presets produce increasingly better levels of shadows and lighting. Just as with reflections, once you're past the Low preset, the graphical improvements are relatively small, especially if you compare Medium to High, and then High to Ultra. There are almost no changes to the textures used in the above screenshots, either. On the one hand, it's great that Low settings look pretty decent, and Medium is arguably good enough to be used by everyone. The upshot of this is that it means you don't need a super-expensive, high-end graphics card to enjoy a visual treat in Doom: The Dark Ages. But on the other hand, it's disappointing that Ultra doesn't really stand out from the crowd, compared to High or Medium. Perhaps when we get to see path tracing in action, it will be a different story, as id Software might also include higher texture resolutions. I explored how the size of the texture pool affected the performance of the RTX 3060 Ti with the Ultra preset, as this was the only 8 GB card I've used in this analysis. There's a noticeable drop in the 1% low frame rates once it's set to 3 GB or more, even at 1080p, but you might as well just leave it at the default 2048 MB setting because higher values don't really improve the graphics that much. At its lowest value of 1536 MB, you can definitely see where textures are being pulled in because they're not present in the pool, but with chaotic battles everywhere, you don't really have much time to sit back and worry about it. Overall, there's no catastrophic drop-off in performance with the Ultra preset, perhaps because of the small graphical improvements over High. Even the RTX 4050 laptop is still surprisingly playable—you're better off using a lower preset, though, to reduce the amount of asset streaming taking place. At 1080p, all bar the slowest two setups push 60 fps, or more, at 1080p; at 1440p, though, there are just too many rays flying around for the RTX 3060 Ti and RX 6750 XT to cope with. 4K is for the RTX 5090 only, but don't forget that this is still all at native rendering. Enabling upscaling and frame generation paints a very different picture. Doom: The Dark Ages supports AMD's FSR, Intel's XeSS, and Nvidia's DLSS upscaling systems, but it's fair to say that the latter's implementation is far superior to the others—in part because all versions of DLSS are using Nvidia's latest transformer model for the upscaling. It's not id Software's fault that AMD's latest tech isn't present, though, as currently FSR 4 doesn't support Vulkan (the graphics API used in this game). However, FSR 3.1doessupport Vulkan, and as far as I can tell, that's not being used. Or if it is, then it's disappointing that id Software hasn't decoupled the upscaler and frame generation mechanisms. Yes, that's right—if you have a GeForce RTX 20 or 30 series graphics card, you've got no way to use frame generation. This might all change in future patches, and I hope it does, because Doom: The Dark Ages is one of the few games where frame generation is not only useful, but its inherent input lag is barely noticeable. That said, there is one case where youdon'twant to enable frame generation. DLSS Quality upscalingRyzen7 7735HS, GeForce RTX 4050, 1080p, Medium preset No, those results aren't a mistake—I tested and checked them multiple times, and used different programs to record the frame rates. They all agreed with the fact that the use of DLSS frame generation on the RTX 4050 actually makes things considerably worse. I know what you're thinking and it's that with frame generation enabled, the RTX 4050 just doesn't have enough VRAM. However, having recorded the memory usage via PIX on Windows, DLSS Balanced with Frame Generation actually uses slightlylessVRAM than native rendering does, at 1080p Medium preset. What could be happening is that PIX isn't reporting VRAM usage correctly, or at the very least, it's not showing the full picture as to how much asset streaming is taking place. But whatever the explanation is, you don't need to use frame generation, as the little laptop GPU pulls some impressive frame rates once DLSS upscaling is used. Given that the CUDA, Tensor, and RT cores in the 4050 are exactly the same as those in, say, a 4090 (just a lot fewer of them), it makes sense that it should do well once you give fewer pixels to ray trace. DLSS Quality upscalingRyzen 5 5600X, GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, 1080p, Ultra preset Since the FSR implementation doesn't offer upscaling and frame generation separately, the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 2060 only get to use DLSS upscaling. But just as with the RTX 4050, the loss of frame generation isn't... well... a loss, and the Ampere GPU easily copes with Doom: The Dark Ages on the Ultra preset. That's at 1080p, of course, and increasing the resolution to 1440p puts a much bigger strain on the graphics chip. DLSS can make it playable, bringing the frame rate up to the 60 fps mark, but you won't see much over the 75 fps region, even with DLSS Performance. The old RTX 2060 can't get anywhere near 60 fps, but that's partly down to the Core i7 9700K it was paired with. It doesn't seem to be down to a lack of threads (it's an 8-core, 8-thread CPU) but more a case of the whole system not having enough performance to ensure the 2060 is never left waiting for data or instructions. Even so, with DLSS Balanced, you get a reasonable 44 fps on average, without too much fuzziness to the graphics. That might not seem very playable, but it's actually okay—it is a touch laggy when the game's world is packed with enemies, mind. FSR Performance upscaling + 2X frame generationCore i5 13600K, Radeon RX 7900 XT, 4K, Ultra preset Despite my criticism of id Software not separating FSR's upscaler and frame generator, I have to say that the actual quality of AMD's algorithms is really very good in Doom: The Dark Ages. Not quite on a par with DLSS, but during actual gameplay, you're never going to notice. With FSR Performance and frame generation enabled, the Radeon RX 7900 XT pulls off some very impressive frame rates. It's in that slightly odd zone of being a littletoofast, leading to that disconnect between smooth rendering but somewhat stilted feedback, but using FSR Quality instead easily gets around that. The star of the show has to be the RX 6750 XT. AMD's RNDA 2 architecture isn't the best at ray tracing, though you wouldn't think that here. Using FSR Balanced with frame generation results in a near-perfect blend of fast rendering and snappy inputs. DLSS Quality upscaling + 3X frame generationRyzen 79800X3D, GeForce RTX 5090, 4K, Ultra preset As good as the little RX 6750 XT is with FSR, I think it's fair to say that Doom: The Dark Ages is the poster child for Nvidia's DLSS 4. Ray reconstruction wasn't available in the preview code (it'll appear in a later patch), but everything else is present, and the combination of DLSS upscaling, multi frame generation, and Reflex produces some truly ludicrous frame rates. Whether one wishes to go down the road and argue that they're notrealframe rates is another matter entirely, but even if you don't bother with frame generation, upscaling is well worth using. There's no perceivable loss in visual fidelity, even at 1440p DLSS Performance, although 4x frame generation does produce a little too much blurring on fast-moving objects. The RTX 5090 is as good as you'd expect in Doom: The Dark Ages. Getting 90 fps on average at 4K Ultrawithoutupscaling is something to behold, though how that will change once path tracing makes an appearance is anyone's guess. When it was announced that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would be using ray-tracing all the time, I realised that the next iteration of the id Tech and Doom would almost certainly be doing the same thing, and that's exactly what we've got. It's certainly not the first game to be doing this, but it's arguably the first to run RT pretty quickly on GPUs that have traditionally struggled with ray tracing. There again, when you look at the graphics in Doom: The Dark Ages more diligently, it's not asvisually impressive as Alan Wake 2 or Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. But these are slower-paced games than Doom, and one isn't really going to be spending time admiring the grim world around you when there are hordes of demons to wade through. The 2016 reboot of Doom set the bar for excellent graphicsandexcellent performance, and while Doom: The Dark Ages is arguably not on the same level as that classic, it still looks pretty good and runs well for a fully ray-traced game. That said, the denoising isn't perfect, some of the textures are quite low in resolution, and the motion blur is rather overdone. But while the gameplay choices might not be to everyone's taste (for me, the music is actually the biggest letdown), but the coding wizards at id Software have certainly produced a solid entry in the three-decade Doom franchise. If a cheap gaming laptop can pull 60 fps, then there's hope for us all. And there aren't many game series you can say that about.

    "title": "HP Omen Max 16 gaming laptop review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The HP Omen Max 16 as tested offers 1% low frame rates that are lower than other RTX 5080 laptops, and slightly lower frame rates overall. That's not to say it's not a good laptop—it's well built, has a good screen and plenty of overall grunt. It all depends on whether you're prepared to wait for the drivers to catch up. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. The 16-inch gaming laptop is a wonderful invention. The slightly larger screen over a 15.6-inch model, made even wider thanks to modern slim bezels, looks great, and allows for a chassis that's just that tiny bit roomier, so we get full-size keys, numpads, even speakers. They're not as ridiculous as 18-inch laptops—those silly machines—and you canactuallyuse them as portables instead of being tied to keeping them on a table somewhere. HP has taken the opportunity to cram this 16-inch Omen Max 16 with the latest gaming technology. There's a Core Ultra 9 and anRTX 5080laptop GPU in there, along with lots of RAM and a decent SSD. It's a complete package, albeit a bit of a heavy one. There's a lot to like about the Omen Max 16, but what I especially appreciate is the way it doesn't skimp. Being able to fit one of the new RTX 50-series graphics chips in a laptop is one thing, but HP didn't need to put Thunderbolt 4 in a gaming machine—USB 4 or even USB 3.2 10 Gbps would have done—so we get extra video outputs alongside an HDMI 2.1 that's already perfectly well suited to hooking up an external monitor, alongside the capability to use some of the fastest external storage and a 2.5Gb Ethernet network too. Away from the port selection, this is also a really nice laptop to actually use. The screen is an IPS rather than an OLED, with a 16:10 2.5K resolution and a 240 Hz refresh rate that will still make many people happy. It's not a touchscreen, but you get a decent-sized trackpad.

There's also a keyboard with a 3D effect to the keys that looks like someone's been biting the tips off Toblerone segments. Still, it's definitely agaminglaptop. You can tell by the way it lights up (the keyboard is a rainbow, and there's a light bar under the front lip), has a foreboding name, and a little slogan written on the back. It's \"Designed and built for winning,\" apparently. While it's outside the scope of this review to promise victory, or even speculate on its likelihood, what it can do is offer proof of frame rates. Cramming a GPU like the RTX 5080 into a laptop was always going to generate the frames, but it generates heat too. Having the fan exhaust pointing downward means that warmth is directed at an area of leg just above your knees, making it a suboptimal machine for use while wearing shorts, and there are also some big vents at the back. It needs them. I saw CPU temperatures rise to 60 °C just while installing software and 105 °C (briefly—well into thermal throttling territory) while running benchmarks, with the GPU spending most of its time around 70 °C while being pushed. Though it's fair to say that all the laptops we've has tested with this CPU exhibit this same thermal behaviour. HP has equipped the Omen Max with its 'AI' fan control software, and an ‘Unleashed' mode that sends the fans up to 5,000 RPM in its attempts to keep the CPU under control, and they certainly make themselves known. The Balanced fan mode keeps things a lot quieter, but also knocks almost 25% off its score in the Time Spy Extreme benchmark. The Core Ultra 9 in the Omen Max 16 is a 24-core Arrow Lake-HX model (which means no hyperthreading), which is capable of 5.4 GHz alongside 36 TOPS of AI performance and with a maximum turbo power of 160 W. It's the same chip you'll find in laptops such as theGigabyte Aorus Master 16andMSI Vector 16 HX AI A2XW, clearly a popular choice for mobile gaming in 2025. It's a very capable processor, whizzing through creative work as well as games, and providing a lot of grunt for CPU-intensive games such as Baldur's Gate 3. It's not quite aRyzen 7 9800X3D, and BG3 sure does love that extra cache, but I'm not sure we need 150 fps or more in top-down RPGs anyway. If you've got the monitor to take it (and the Omen Max goes all the way up to 240 Hz) then you can use DLSS 4's multi-frame generation to give your games a bit of a boost. It's one of the more interesting features of the new RTX 50-series GPUs, and it does make a difference, boosting the frame rate in Cyberpunk 2077 from 38 fps to 116 fps at the native 1600p resolution. Elsewhere, the gaming benchmark results from the Omen Max are surprisingly inconsistent. It is capable of some good frame rates, though consistently produced ever-so-slightly lower average figures than other laptops we've tested packing the same RTX 5080 chips, and suffers from stuttering in multiple games leading to some 1% low scores that really stand out from the rest. This might be one firmware or driver update away from improvement, but we can only review what's in front of us. It's not all bad news: the SSD in the Omen Max 16 performs slightly better than those in similar machines. Its maximum bandwidth score in our tests hits 398.42 MB/s, beating the MSI Vector by almost 100 MB/s and theAsus ROG Flow Z13by more than 70 MB/s. It's probably not something you'll notice in-game, as it will shorten loading times by only a small amount, but it's always nice to know. And while nobody buys a gaming laptop for the battery life, the Omen Max doesn't do too badly... as long as you don't actually play games. Because it does that clever Nvidia Optimus thing that switches between the iGPU and GeForce card depending on what you're doing. So if you're just using it to watch videos or browse the web, you can expect almost four hours of use out of it before you go hunting for the very large 330W power brick. ✅ You can get it at a good price:there's probably nothing wrong with the Omen 16 that a few driver updates won't fix, so it's worth taking advantage of its value. ❌ You can't deal with the stutters:Chances are they won't last long, but with mildly better frame rates elsewhere, you might want to go there too. Start playing games and stressing the RTX 5080, and the time it can spend away from a power outlet will drop to about an hour and a half even thoughBlackwellGPUs are meant to be more power efficient than older generations. Value-wise, the Omen Max 16 has to be weighed against other gaming laptops with similar specs, and a lot of them have come along at once. There's the MSI Vector 16 HX AI, which has 16 GB of RAM but costs $900 less. And there's theAsus ROG Zephyrus G16 (2025)which costs $300 more and has a 120 W version of the GPU. So it does occupy some middle ground, especially when you put 32 GB of RAM in the Vector, and in recent laptop tests it's the cheapest to offer the 175 W RTX 5080 and 32GB of RAM. It's still not abudgetmachine—and that's okay—but the Omen Max 16 has a lot of competition out there from the usual suspects. You'll also have to keep the fans high if you want the best performance, so perhaps some of the best noise-cancelling headphones should be on your shopping list too. The HP Omen Max 16 as tested offers 1% low frame rates that are lower than other RTX 5080 laptops, and slightly lower frame rates overall. That's not to say it's not a good laptop—it's well built, has a good screen and plenty of overall grunt. It all depends on whether you're prepared to wait for the drivers to catch up.

Science classrooms across the globe have been pedalling a lie for decades, maybe even centuries. Eggs are not stronger when dropped on their ends.So say researchers from MIT, who claim that eggs are far stronger on their sides. Apparently, \"sideways eggs bend like shock absorbers, trading stiffness for superior energy absorption.\" Apart from overturning a specific assumption about eggs, MIT says the research findings represent a broader lesson. \"Even 'settled' science can yield surprises when approached with rigor and an open mind,\" MIT says. For the lay egg frier, this all seems pretty counter-intuitive. Surely it's easier to crack an egg on its side? Instead of accepting that assumption, the MIT team conducted two types of experiments. First, they applied static compression, gradually increasing the force to measure stiffness and toughness. Next were the classic dynamic drop tests, which investigate the likelihood of breaking on impact. The results found that the same force in terms of compression was required to break an egg both from the sides and the top and bottom. \"However, we noticed a key difference in how much the egg compressed before it broke,\" says Joseph Bonavia, a PhD candidate who contributed to the work,published yesterday in Communications Physics. \"The horizontal egg compressed more under the same amount of force, meaning it was more compliant.\" This suggests that in scenarios where energy absorption is important, such as a drop, eggs should be more resilient landing on their sides. A high-tech drop test—involving solenoids and 3D-printed supports, the better to ensure simultaneous release and consistent egg orientation—was thus devised. \"This confirmed what we saw in the static tests,\" says Avishai Jeselsohn, an undergraduate researcher and an author in the study. \"Even though both orientations experienced similar peak forces, the horizontal eggs absorbed energy better and were more resistant to breaking.\" All of which means you should start bashing your eggs end-on of a morning, right? Actually, not so much. \"Cracking an egg for cooking involves applying locally focused force for a clean break to retrieve the yolk, while its resistance to breaking from a drop involves distributing and absorbing energy across the shell,\" says Brendan Unikewicz, another MIT PhD candidate and author.

And so, the MIT team have exploded a long standing scientific misconception but at the same time managed to show how it has absolutely no impact, pun intended, on perhaps the most obvious practical application. As for me, I'm just glad I don't have to fundamentally rethink the technique for my regular sourdough, avocado, and two fried egg concoction.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered mod makes being a stealthy murder king easy, boosting your sneak attack damage modifiers from good to Grim Reaper",
    "article_text": "Strike unseen in Bethesda's visually upgraded RPG with maximum potency When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If, like me, you enjoy playing stealthy characters in fantasy RPGs, then a new mod that boosts sneak attack damage multipliers inOblivion Remasteredis well worth checking out. As standard in Oblivion Remastered, almost all weapon types deal the same sneak attack multipliers, which are x2 at Novice, before climbing (and crucially stalling) at x3 for Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert and Master. The remaster has some more notable damage boosts for daggers (in a change over original Oblivion), but it's just not the same and still lacks role-playing-friendly progression. Now don't get me wrong, landing a x2 or x3 sneak attack from stealth does do a good chunk of damage to a foe. What it often doesn't do, however, is one-shot tougher opponents (especially at higher levels of the game), which can feel a bit cheap when you shoot them directly in the eye with an arrow or bring a claymore down upon their neck from the shadows. Like, nobody, survives that, right? Luckily, though, the'Increased sneak attack damage multiplier'mod by Ismttt moves to address that, making sneak attack damage multipliers more potent at higher levels of stealth mastery with an improving linear progression. So now, for example, striking a foe with a bow unseen will deal x2 damage multiplier at Novice level, but then climb to x3 at Apprentice, x4 at Journeyman, x5 at Expert, and x6 at Master level. The better you get at stealthily striking from the shadows with your weapons, the more damage you will deal, unlike the base game where that stalls. Not all weapons follow the same multipliers, though, with larger two-handed weapons like the claymore (which in the real world would be harder to use stealthily, so it makes sense) only proceeding from x1 at Novice to x5 at Master. It's lower multipliers, but still, you get the linear improvement as you ascend sneaking levels. But, where I can't see many stealth assassin-type characters in Oblivion Remastered using a claymore as their weapon of choice, I can see many using a dagger, and thanks to this mod, any wielder of one will truly become one with Sithis. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That's because the dagger's sneak multiplier now starts at x5 at Novice, before ascending through x8 at Apprentice, x11 at Journeyman, x14 at Expert, and through to a Grim Reaper-approved x17 at Master level. Now that's potent! Neatly, following feedback from PC gamers, the mod's maker has also supplied a series of other variants of the mod, too, all of which offer different types of sneak damage multiplication. For example, if you want to keep the linear progression but don't want such high damage multipliers, you can grab that version by downloading the 'Sneak multiplier b' variant. If you'd rather deal so much sneak damage you could one-shot Akatosh himself, then grabbing the 'Sneak multiplier x2' variant is for you. That one takes the dagger's Master-level sneak attack damage multiplier up to x34! Yep, truly god-slaying damage. So, yes, if you're currently playing a stealthy character, then a variant of this mod feels to me like a smart download, even if it is just to add in that missing linear improvement that, to my mind at least, is better for roleplaying. Equally, if you haven't played a sneak-master in Oblivion Remastered then I'd recommend doing so immediately, as some of the game's best content (I'm thinking the Dark Brotherhood, especially) and mechanics (bows feel so much better than swords IMO) lean into this type of character.

    "article_text": "Panda-Medalum. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's got its first proper hotfix patch,and as promised, the 2 billion damage build is well and truly dead. Stendhal's been de-juiced, and a second, surprise nerf to Medalum will also tone down Maelle's damage just a bit. Overall,the update's relatively minor—it has a bunch of fixes to ultrawide support and mouse and keyboard controls (which the game doesn't quite recommend. People who parry with their mouse button are different beasts, and I fear them). The world map should have less geometry for you to get stuck on, whether you're hoofing it on foot or riding on best boy and certified weewee/woowoo expert Esquie. A couple of softlocks have been stamped out, too, including one where you could accidentally permanently banish most of your party to the shadow realm. The big changes here are in the weapons and balance tuning. Both Lune's Lithelim and Sciel's Blizzon have had their attribute scalings fixed, but the real tweaks are to Maelle's sword Medalum, and her big nuke Stendhal. Stendhal's just had its damage flat reduced by 40%—meanwhile, Medalum was apparently bugged. All weapons in Clair Obscur have three passive perks, and the max-level perk for Medalum, which doubled your burn damage while in Virtuose Stance, was apparently doublingall damage.Which, uh, yeah. That's less of a nerf and more of a bug fix. Again, I'm all in favour of these changes, which goes against my usual philosophy with single-player games. But there's a difference between a build being slightly broken, and it just allowing you to run over every single endgame challenge with a shank-wielding 16 year old. Besides, I beat Simon without Stendhal, and I am now pleased everyone else will have to suffer in the same way I did: A 16-minute knockout brawl with over 190 parries, just like the Paintress intended.

A Reddit user has turned their big rig truck into, well, abig rig. Yeah, the jokes write themselves, but one rather impressive gaming setup has popped up complete with a swivel-mounted monitor to play with a controller, accessories for simulator games, and energy via a full-on generator. Shared to the PCMR subreddit, userZanaZamorahas shown off an update to aprevious gaming rig postthey shared on that same subreddit. Though the specs of the machine are the same, they have since added head tracking, and have changed the truck due to the last oneblowing up. They are now set up inside a Freightliner Coronado. If the PC is theexact same rigthey showed off a few years ago, it currently has anIntel Core i9 9900Kand anRTX 2080. The PC has a bit of a storied past, with the user dropping it a handful of times, moving cases on three separate occasions, replacing the motherboard, and replacing an SSD. Thems the joys of PC ownership. Notably, the new gaming setup has a steering wheel, which they occasionally used to play truck simulators on their downtime, which sort of feels like me playingTyping of the Dead: OverkillorBlood Typersafter I clock out. Okay, maybe I kind of get it. The post shows off gameplay from a flight simulator namedDigital Combat Simulator(DCS), complete with a flight stick, flight controls, and head tracking in action. It all looks rather impressive and is covered in neon lighting.

    "article_text": "Shiny, shiny. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The world is full of distractions, many of which are localised to the screens we all stare at day in and day out. The fact that the surface you turn to for necessary but boring life tasks, such as paying bills or sending strongly worded emails, is also the same setting for hours upon hours of cat videos is perhaps why writing this news story took far longer than it should have. In a tale as old as time, I'm yet one more writer prone to procrastination. Freewrite's latest keyboard, featuring a mechanical word counter front and centre, may be just what I need. Freewrite is a line of products fromAstrohaus, a company that has taken it upon itself to create smart, distraction-free devices that ensure easily led astray writers such as myself actually get words on the page. Freewrite already offers a suite of ludicrously expensive smart typewriters, like thevery pretty Valentine costing almost a grand. The company'slatest crowdfunding campaign touts a keyboardwith a mechanical session timer plus a 'wordometer' to ensure writers meet all their deadline day goals. The Wordrunner is a snazzy, die-cast aluminium keyboard that Jacob has previously coveredwhen it was first unveiled at CES 2025. The promise of this wireless keyboard that will eventually retail for $449 has seen the crowdfunding campaign sail clear past its initial goal; originally only asking for $10,000, the Kickstarter has amassed almost 15 times that amount with more than a month still left to go. This may be a 'keyboard for dorks,' but it's also a 'keyboard for dorks with deep pockets. ' For everyone else, I'd recommend taking a look at the far cheaper options recommended in ourbest mechanical keyboards guide. Rather than relying on a small on-screen display or thumbing through the Tools drop-down menu in Gdocs, the Wordrunner places its mechanical word counter right under your nose. The rotating wheels of this wordometer alongside the clicky session timer buttons and five-way media knob offers a tactile, distraction-limiting experience that feels straight out of a sci-fi story from the middle of last century. Besides the incredibly powerful retrofitted vibes emanating from this keyboard, the onboard session timer and word counter have got me thinking about more novel applications of its feature set. For instance, if I keep track of my best word-per-minute scores, does that mean I can essentially race my own writing ghost data? As for the actual typing experience, the Wordrunner combines layers of internal sound-dampening with Kailh tactile switches in the hopes of offering lovely clacks as opposed to metallic clangs. The function key row has also been reconfigured to offer \"dedicated buttons for essential writing and editing functions.\" For me, someone who keeps Googling the same keyboard shortcuts over and over, that's a feature I genuinely welcome. Additionally, the Wordrunner also offers three reprogrammable macro keys for the real sickos out there. Due to its metal body, the Wordrunner is a decidedly hefty bit of kit. So much so, in fact, that the campaign page notes, \"One early reviewer said, 'You could kill somebody with this.'

At the time of writing, the community's figured out a grand total of two codes, but there are a few threads to pull: If this whole thing's linked to the mysterious morse codes coming from dead worlds, there's a pretty hilarious consequence happening: A months-long ARG is currently being bombarded by, as one diver in the Discord put it, \"a bunch of marines fighting over the last purple crayon\".

    "title": "A software engineer taught AI to hunt bugs by interfacing an LLM with debugging tools and has released the open source code: 'It's like going from hunting with a stone spear to using a guided missile'",
    "article_text": "This LLM \"might change crash dump analysis forever.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AI is an incredibly contentious space in the tech world, but that's mostly because of a misappropriation of all things involved with it. It all starts with the name, Artificial Intelligence or AI, because almost nothing we call AI in today's landscape qualifies as such.These aren't intelligences, artificial or otherwise. Generally, they're language models trained on huge data sets noticing patterns and predicting next steps. As such they're terrible at lots of things we see them used for andjust won't stop halucinating, but they can be useful tools when put to the right work. Debugging Windows and analysing crash data is a perfect example of exactly the right work for an AI. Tom's Hardwarereports that Sven Scharmentke (AKA Svnscha) a software engineer more than familiar with debugging Windows crashes has released a language model that can essentially do it for you. The mcp-windbg tool gives language models the ability to interface with WinDBG, Windows own multipurpose debugging tool. The result is a crash analysis tool that can be interacted with in a natural language that hunts down crash points for you. Scharmentke put his findings in ablog post, including a video which shows an example of the debugger at work. You can watch as Copilot is asked in very plain natural english to help find the problems, and it does so. It's able to read the crash dump, find relevant codes within it to pinpoint the problem, and then analyse the original code for problems and provide solutions. It can even help you find the crash dump in the first place. From the example it looks like Scharmentke has successfully taken a rather complicated process that would once require a trained professional to ascertain, and turned it into something even I could do. Better yet it's a frustrating task, that's far more easily handled by a machine than a human, and not many people would want to have to do anyway. That's a perfect use for an LLM, and that's just such a breath of fresh air. Usually this kind of debugging takes a lot of time, an encyclopaedic knowledge of various codes and pointers, an understanding of how the code runs, and a dogmatic level of determination. Now, it's a few minutes of casual conversation with your friendly computerised helper. As Scharmentke says \"It's like going from hunting with a stone spear to using a guided missile,\". But of course this comes with the same standard warning all AI should. It doesn't actually think, and its answers should always be taken with some scepticism involved. Scharmentke also reminds us that this isn't a magical cure-all tool, and instead is just a \"simple Python wrapper around CDB that relies on the LLM's WinDBG expertise.\" Still if you want to use this LLM and put this new style of debugging interface to the test, you can download it fromGithuband give it a try.

    "title": "Valve is using Steam Deck's beta build to test 80% battery limit",
    "article_text": "Let's see if this 80% charge limitation can help extend battery life for real. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The release of Valve's Steam Deck has supercharged the portable PC gaming scene. It harkened changes to Steam that have allowed it to flourish in the Switch-like form factor, welcoming in a new generation ofhandheld gaming computersand now theSteam Deck OLED. With more competition on the rise, Valve has remained committed to updating the firmware that keeps the Steam Deck ticking in this landscape. One such new update is currently available on the preview build sporting a feature that might help improve the long-term battery health of your Steam Deck. Batteries wear out with use and charge, and dealing with this degradation is probably one of the biggest lamentations of current technologies. On almost all the portable tech you own, I'd wager the battery life is likely one of the first places you'll start to notice it aging. It's why so many new pieces of tech are coming out with a battery limiting feature, just like the one in theMay 8th Steam Deck Beta Client update. Those with that update installed can navigate to the Settings on their Steam Deck to find a new Battery Charge Limit control in the Power section. Here you can limit a full charge on the unit to only charge until 80% battery. Of course, this will mean your battery life on a single charge will go down by about 20% but the overall life of the battery may thank you. It's especially recommended for anyone who doesn't take their Steam Deck off charge very often, or doesn't regularly go through a full battery depletion. It should help with potential battery problems caused by being on charge most of the time. If you're not running your battery down past 20% often anyway, this is of course a no brainer and should be an easy setting to flick on and forget about it. It's worth remembering that these settings can also always be turned off. If you're finding you just really need that extra bit of battery to get you through the day then feel free to flip it back to normal mode. If you're someone that finds yourself doing a bit of both then having the limited charge mode on most days, but turning it back to full charge when you go out could also be a great solution. It also will likely depend on whichaccessories you're choosingto use with it. For now the battery limit is only available in the test preview build for Steam, so it looks like Valve is going to wait and see before implementing it as a standard feature. Since the portable PC gaming scene is still somewhat enthusiast, having a nice test batch of willing beta subjects is fairly likely. It'll be interesting to see if this 80% limitation on battery does end up helping for overall battery life and whether or not it rolls out to the main software build.

    "title": "Razer's newest gaming headset goes on your chair instead of your head",
    "article_text": "Strap a near-field directional speaker mount to the back of your seat and hear the Gs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Audio in videogames doesn't get enough credit for the amount of heavy lifting it does for the medium. Whether it's atmospheric creepiness like floorboards creaking, satisfyingly responsive like a perfect reload, or just there to vibe to like a great soundtrack, sounds can really add to the gaming experience. For these reasons a good headset or set of speakers are essential to any gaming setup, but what about something in between, like the Razer's new headrest speaker the Clio. Headsets – even open backed ones – have a tendency to lock me out of my environment. Having that immersive focus in-game is great, but it isolates me from the goings on in my house.A set of PC gaming speakers,of course, are great for this but also involve sharing my game noises with everyone around me, regardless of how they feel about it. The Clio looks like a great middleground, allowing the joy and freedom of speakers without bothering the whole house. The other potential bonus with the Clio is it outsources wearing a headset to your chair, so it's even more freeing than agood wireless headset. Rather than have the potential discomfort from headset wear, the Clio attaches to the back of the headrest using adjustable straps which Razer says should fit most high-backed chairs. The plush memory foam is designed to be leaned into while still being comfortable, and has THX spacial audio piped into direction specific speakers angled to be heard by the person sitting in the chair. I'm a big fan of near-field directional sound when it's used well. I've been rocking it in the RayBan Meta smart glasses I have, and it's really easy to listen to music and take calls without anyone else being able to hear a thing. I assume the headrest will have to be a bit louder being further away from the ears, but the tech can be really effective, so I'm keen to see how it works here. The speakers in the Clio can also be used in conjunction with others already in your setup. Here the Clio can act as specific speakers in a surround sound setup to help enhance that experience. Having the speakers directly behind the head should really make the sounds feel like they're coming from right behind you. The speakers are touted as delivering good immersive sound whether they're stand alone or a part of a bigger unit, and apparently can do so even for those not directly in the chair at the time. With MSRP sitting at $229.99 USD or €199.99, you can hopefully expect some quality speakers and comfort to match the price tag. You could get a pretty fabulous gaming headset for that price, so you'd want to see at least the same value proposition here from the Clio. If it delivers, I'm really into the idea of speakers for my chair as opposed to my head. It's not only nice to see a slightly different product now and then and this is one I could actually see myself using. The idea of just sitting at my desk in my chair and being basically game ready is actually a pretty liberating one. I guess what I'm saying is I'm ready to rest my head and hope Clio cradles it gently while whispering sweet sweet videogame nothings to me.

    "title": "Razer announces travel-sized Basilisk Mobile mouse with dedicated AI prompt key alongside ultra-low-profile portable Joro keyboard",
    "article_text": "I can't wait to accidentally launch ChatGPT when I'm trying to do my fantasy murders. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Understated, simplistic, elegant, work friendly; These are all words I'd never normally associate with Razer, a brand better known for loud and proud RGB lit gamer chic. Today is a bit different, as Razer announces a few new products that in an effort of being ultra portable, and ergonomic truly shed any excessive gamer skin. Just one look at the new Razer Basilisk Mobile mouse and the Razer Joro keyboard, are all you need to establish these are a different kind of device from the gamer centric brand. The Razer Basilisk Mobile mouse shares the DNA of the largerBasilisk V3 gaming mouseandBasilisk V3 Prowhich both impressed our reviewers. These are mice known for being incredibly comfortable while touting top tier gaming sensors. Hopefully this one will be no different, boasting the Razer Focus X 18K Optical Sensor, this portable little guy should deliver 99.4% resolution accuracy. This is combined with Razer's Gen-3 Optical Mouse Switches which are tested for accuracy and latency and should last over 90 million clicks, on heads or otherwise. The baby basilisk also touts what Razer is calling HyperScroll Technology. This means instead of the typical scroll wheel this mouse features a 4-way tilt so you can scroll in different directions as well as your standard free spinning and precise tactile modes for fast navigation, and Tactile Cycling for precise control. As it's still a gaming mouse, there's a few extra buttons, one of which is supposed to be an AI prompt button, which I'm really hoping we can remap. It looks like it brings up a prompt window to enter info into ChatGPT and I can't imagine a more frustrating thing to hit while gaming. I usually have those thumb buttons mapped to things like punch, or some other alternate weapon I need in desperation. I can't imagine the rage that's going to flow through my body when I mean to knife my suddenly appearing opponent, only to be met with a window trying to help me compose an email. At least it might help me compose a congratulatory message to the other team for when I inevitably lose. Razer's Basilisk Mobile is also a wired mouse, with several modes of connectivity. The battery life has been rated for around 105 hours, and the entire unit weighs about 76 g. If it plays as nicely as the other Basilisk mice we've tested, this could be an excellent travel buddy. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The Joro Keyboard keeps that portability in mind. It's an ultra low profile 60% board that's just 16.5 mm thin, and weighs in at 374 grams. The layout is clearly gamer focussed, making sure to still provide things like full sized arrow keys, and a function bar. The keys are touted as gamer grade with tactile actuation, and it even has the RazerSnap Tap techthat allows keys to be held down but input still taken in order. It's worth keeping in mind this tech is considered so hackssome games have even banned it. Another wireless unit, the Joro should be good for around 1,800s hours of battery life. This plus those low profile keys makes this a board that will likely be much loved by Mac keyboard fans, as it looks like it could feel quite similar. This could have something to do with Razer commencing its release of Synapse, its gaming software for Apple gamers, so of course these devices have full PC and Mac functionality. The Razer Basilisk Mobile mouse and Joro keyboard should be available for purchase now, with the mouse $100 USD or $170 AUD and the keyboard $150 USD or $250 AUD.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. All theWordlehelp you need to win Friday's puzzle is right here and ready to go. Polish your general guessing with our everyday tips, or rush for today's answer and guarantee yourself the fastest Wordle win of your life. Hoping for a happy middle ground? No problem. There's a clue for the May 9 (1420) game here too. Oh. OK. I guess I'm done then. I honestly thought I'd just entered another word, something that'd help me organise the green and yellow letters I'd found into something more intelligible. I didn't think they'd be today's answer. I'm still a bit shocked, really. Specifically, this is the name used for the edible lining of a sheep or cow's stomach. More generally, this is something worthless, bad, or useless. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Need a hand? The answer to the May 9 (1420) Wordle isTRIPE. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "article_text": "It's all in Eberron: Forge of the Artificer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The D&D supplement that sees the most use at my table is Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, which gets referenced more often than the Dungeon Master's Guide thanks to its variety of player options—wacky subclasses like the college of creation bard and astral self monk, and a class themed around crafting magical objects, the artificer. (Though the artificer previously appeared in Eberron: Rising from the Last War, a setting book detailing a pulp fantasy magitech world that I skipped because it includes halflings who ride dinosaurs and one of my players flat-out vetoed that as \"just too silly\".) When D&D's 5th edition got itsbig rules update last year, the 2024 Player's Handbook included revised versions of all the RPG's base classes—your fighters and wizards and so on—but not the artificer. The one class that's all about giving you cool things to do that aren't themed around directly taking hit points away from bad guys will get its turn though in Eberron: Forge of the Artificer, a new supplement coming out in August. Forge of the Artificer will include four updated subclasses for the artificer, plus a whole new one: the cartographer, who uses magical maps to keep track of what's going on around them, and can use those maps to target characters who are hidden or beyond their normal range. With scouting and exploration as its focuses, the cartographer sounds a bit like a cross between an artificer and a ranger in the same way that other subclasses let you borrow a little bit of another class without becoming a full multiclassing sicko—like the way the arcane trickster gets to be a rogue who is also a bit of a wizard. The supplement will also include updated rules for player options like being one of the mechanical warpforged, 28 feats including ones representing the Dragonmarks that are another unique bit of Eberron Lore, 18 backgrounds, 20 monsters, and a bunch of spells, magic items, and bastions using the new rules from the 2024 Dungeon Master's Guide. Eberron: Forge of the Artificer will be out on August 19 and is up forpreordernow in physical and digital versions, with a bundle that includes both as well as a set of artificer-themed digital dice to use in DND Beyond.

    "article_text": "A HD-2D remake seems most likely. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's been a tumultuous year for Chrono Trigger enthusiasts. Rumors of a potential remake have cropped up several times, only to be quickly debunked. I can't blame fans for their gullibility: it really is very weird that Square Enix hasn't done anything with the Chrono series for so long, though the publisher did indicate in March that it intends to honor the 30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger with projects that \"go beyond the world of the game.\" Corporate mysticism aside, JRPG legend Yuji Horii, who among other things had a hand in writing Chrono Trigger, and has worked on countless Dragon Quest games including the forthcoming Dragon Quest 12, has indicated in an interview withGamereactorthat he wants to work on Chrono Trigger. Noting the 30th anniversary, Horii says \"Yes, it has been a long time. Yes, I want to do something.\" Acknowledging the HD-2D remakes of the older Dragon Quest games, Horii adds that he's \"getting a lot of requests for a Chrono Trigger remake as well, so I'm starting to look into it.\" This follows a quickly debunked rumor earlier this month. At a Comicon in Italy a translator misinterpreted Horii as all but confirming a Chrono Trigger remake, butGematsulater confirmed that Horii hadn't made any confirmation at all: it was a translator's gaffe, basically. A HD-2D remake seems like an obvious choice, though a small part of me dreams of Chrono Trigger getting the Final Fantasy 7 Remake treatment. That seems fanciful, especially given the erratic market and Square Enix'famously high sales expectations. Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D did exceptionally well for Square Enix—to the extent that they were actually happy with its sales—so it seems inevitable that the company will double down on this remake format. I'm fine with that, as long as theydon't touchthe music. Whatever form it takes, a Chrono Trigger revival of some kind seems basically inevitable at this point. While you wait, the original is discounted by 50% onSteamat the moment, and is perfectly playable nowadays despite beingbustedat launch. Its divisive sequel Chrono Crossis also going cheap.

    "article_text": "Let me be gone When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Someday, hopefully not soon, I'll shed this mortal coil and in short order be forgotten. Unless someone makes an AI Lance Ulanoff. In short, please don't. I had this epiphany and realized the need for a public statement that might one day protect my likeness from appearing after my demise after reading aboutthe tragic case of an Arizona man and road rage victim whose AI avatar delivered a short and, I must admit, moving speechto a judge who was considering the sentence of the man who, according to the ruling, killed him. It's a terrible and sad case, andin the video, Christopher Pelkey appears to deliver forgiveness and even some humor. It's not a perfect rendering. The voice sometimes sounds robotic, and the video is a bit stiff, but the overall effect is quite a thing. There's no getting around the tragedy of the court case, but the decision by Pelkey's family to bring him to life as an AI-generated avatar is problematic. While Pelkey appears to be delivering the impassioned words, they're actually written by his sister. I assume she knew her brother well, but I doubt she can know exactly what he would have said in the event of his death. This slippery slope we're standing over is crumbling underfoot, and we are about to slide down into a very weird and uncanny valley. That this technology was used in a court of law and done without, it appears, the assistance of a major corporation or significant funds, means that more and more people will consider not only trying to bring dead relatives back to digital life but also enabling real-world and sometimes important interactions for them. Pelkey's appearance is an extreme case, for now, but will likely not be an outlier. I expect others to start putting long-lost relatives to work as AI avatars in all sorts of cases, from class action suits to civil divorce proceedings. I'm sure many family members will think they're acting in your best interest when they digitally resurrect you. Just this week, we saw the family of legendaryNBA broadcaster Jim Faganokay the AI recreation of his voice for future NBA games (mostly promos and not, it seems, any play-by-play). I'm sure that a full-bodied AI Fagan isn't far behind. Pelkey, though, was not a celebrity, and businesses will likely crop up to help anyone digital revive Grandma, a brother, Sis, Aunt June, anyone you've lost and desperately miss. I understand the intention and, to be honest, I don't know if I would reject a chance to \"bring back a loved one.\" Of course, you're not bringing back anyone. The AI avatar will only look and sound like the deceased, though I guess it could go further than that. Last year, I wrote aboutSilicon Intelligence, a Chinese company that wants to use photos and videos to build a digital persona that can even respond in ways that the original, living relative might have done. The technology necessary to make fully functioning digital replicas of anyone living or dead is here now, which is why I'm encouraging everyone to declare publicly whether or not they approve of this for their corporeal presence. I understand that with the hours and hours of videos and thousands of photos available online depicting me blathering on about technology, I'm an easy target for this. My family may not be interested in resurrecting me, but I worry any enterprising techy could build their own Lance Ulanoff and then spend hours teasing it about all the times the real Lance Ulanoff was wrong.

    "article_text": "Nostalgia from a neural network When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The booming, baritone narration by Jim Fagan is as much a part of 1990s NBA games as Bugs Bunny selling shoes with Michael Jordan or the “Roundball Rock” theme song. Though Fagan passed away in 2017, NBC has his voice ready to go for the upcoming season thanks to AI voice cloning. NBC Sports announced the plan for when it regains broadcasting rights this October. Fagan’s voice won’t be narrating entire games, the current commentators don't have to worry about direct AI competition just yet. The plan is to use him selectively: show opens, promotional spots, maybe the dramatic lead-in to a playoff broadcast. The network is reportedly shelling out billions as part of a massive rights package shared withAmazonand Disney. What better way to brand its return than with the voice that defined the league’s TV glory years? NBC just hopes Fagan's phantom voice will remind people of the NBA's golden age three decades ago. NBC approached the project carefully to avoid a backlash from Fagan's fans. The company built Fagan's vocal doppelganger with the permission and cooperation of Fagan’s family. \"He took great pride in his work with NBC Sports, especially in helping set the stage for some of the most memorable moments in NBA history. Knowing that his voice will once again be part of the game he loved – and that a new generation of fans will get to experience it – is incredibly special for our family,\" Fagan’s daughters, Jana Silvia Joyce and Risa Silvia-Koonin, said in a statement. \"He would be so thrilled and proud to be a part of this.\" If this sounds like the echo of a similar idea, that's because NBCUniversal has dipped into its AI audio toolbox very recently.At the Paris Olympicslast year, NBC recreated Al Michaels’ voice to deliver Olympic recaps on Peacock. There’s a trend in sports broadcasting to remix the past using futuristic tools. Whether it’s classic theme songs, throwback logos, or AI-generated recaps, the goal is novelty nostalgia, a feeling more than a strictly perfect recreation.

    "title": "I asked the Google Pixel 9a to make an image of a successful person and the results were depressingly predictable",
    "article_text": "Some bigotry to go with your bargain phone When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If a new phone gave me an occasional electric shock, I wouldn’t recommend it. Even if it only shocked meoccasionally, when I open a specific app, I'd sayno. If a phone wasn’t just bad, but shockingly harmful, I would say that phone, or at least the electric shock part, should be removed. I just spent a couple weeks with theGoogle Pixel 9a, which has a tool called Pixel Studio, available on all of Google’s latest Pixel phones. Pixel Studio is an AI-powered image generator that creates images from a text prompt. Until recently,Pixel Studio refused to depict people, but Google removed those guardrails, and the resultspredictablyreinforce stereotypes. That’s not just bad, that’s harmful. I’m asking Google – and all phone makers – to stop offering image generators that make images of people. These tools can lead to bigotry. Let’s try a quick role play: You be the Pixel Studio, and I will be me. Hey, Pixel Studio:Make me an image of a successful person! What image will you make? What do you see in your mind when you think of success? Is it someone who looks like you? The answer will be different for everybody, depending on your own view of success. Not for Pixel Studio. Pixel Studio has a singular vision of a successful person. Unless you happen to be a young, white, able-bodied man, Pixel Studio probably doesn’t seeyouwhen it envisions success. A successful person, according to the Google Pixel Studio app, is usually young, white, male, able-bodied, thin, with good hair and expensive-looking clothes, in an urban environment. All of those are stereotypes A successful person, according to the Google Pixel Studio app, is usually young, white, male, able-bodied, thin, with good hair and expensive-looking clothes, in an urban environment.

All of those are stereotypes A successful person, according to the Google Pixel Studio app, is usually young, white, male, able-bodied, thin, with good hair and expensive-looking clothes, in an urban environment. All of those are stereotypes A successful person, according to the Google Pixel Studio app, is usually young, white, male, able-bodied, thin, with good hair and expensive-looking clothes, in an urban environment. All of those are stereotypes A successful person, according to the Google Pixel Studio app, is usually young, white, male, able-bodied, thin, with good hair and expensive-looking clothes, in an urban environment. All of those are stereotypes I got this result after more than 20 attempts to create an image of a successful person. This was the first Black person Pixel Studio generated. I asked Pixel Studio five times for an image of ‘a successful person.’ Of the five people Pixel Studio created for me,zerowere older. None used a wheelchair or hearing aids, or a cane. All of them wore expensive-looking suits, even the woman. That’s right, just one woman and four men. And yes,allof them were white. I have a serious problem with this because the Pixel's digitalbrainis clearly rooted in lazy stereotypes. These stereotypes support misogyny, ableism, racism, ageism, and who knows what other biases. This is ingrained in the Pixel's thinking. If you use the Pixel 9a to be more successful, you should know that it has a very limited, stereotypical idea of success. Whenever the Pixel phone represents success in its suggestions, it may be colored by this bigotry. In Pixel Studio's narrow world, success means you are young, white, able-bodied, probably a man, and wealthy. Apparently, nobody successful is old, non-white, disabled, transgender, or uninterested in flashy suits or material wealth, among countless diverse characteristics a successful person might have. Did I just get unlucky? I asked Pixel Studio five times, then I asked twice more when I realized it only created one woman. I got another white man and a woman who looked like shemightbe Latina or of Middle Eastern descent. Both young, standing tall, and wearing suits. I’m not simplifying anything; Pixel Studio is simplifying things down to the most basic, biased denominator. That's baked into how these AI tools learn. First of all, AI training data was mostly taken from the Internet and public forums. The data inevitably mirrors the biases of the messy, unequal world that created it. There was no concerted effort to combat stereotypes or introduce diversity into the training data. AI companies like Google simply hoovered up everything they could find, apparently without much thought regarding the biases shaping the data itself. That taints the entire model from the ground up. Second, machine learning looks for patterns and groups things together. That's not always a bad thing. When a computer looks for patterns and groups, for instance, letters and words together, you get language and ChatGPT. Apply that pattern-matching to people's appearances, andvoilà: stereotypes. That’s pretty much the definition of a stereotype. Merriam-Webster defines a stereotypeas “something conforming to a fixed or general pattern.” The fundamental way machine learning works reinforces stereotypes. It’s practically unavoidable. Finally, machine learning tools are trained by us – users who are asked a simple question after each response: was this a good response? We don’t get to say if the response is true, accurate, fair, or harmful. We only get to tell the AI if the response is good or bad. That means we're training the AI on our gut reactions – our own ingrained stereotypes. An image conforming to our biases feels comfortably familiar, orgood. A response that defies our expectations will cause cognitive stress. Unless I'm actively trying to deconstruct my biases, I'll tell the machine it’s doing a good job when it reinforces stereotypes I believe. Let's be clear: stereotypes are poison. Stereotypes are a root cause of some of the biggest problems our society faces. Stereotyping reduces diverse groups of people into simple, usually negative and unpleasant caricatures. That makes it easier to feel like the group doesn’t belong with the rest ofus. This leads to prejudice and discrimination. There is no benefit that comes from stereotyping. This isn't just philosophical hand-wringing; stereotyping causes real harm.People who feel discriminated against experience more health problemslike cardiovascular disease and hypertension.Doctors who stereotype patients offer a lower standard of carewithout realizing they are causing harm. The kind of stereotypical thinking reflected in these AI images contributes tohiring discrimination, wage gaps between different groups in the same jobs, and alack of opportunities at higher level positions for marginalized groups. When we look at attacks on diversity, equity and inclusivity, we must draw a depressingly straight line that passes through the Pixel Studio’s narrow vision of ‘success’ to real-world bigotry. It is ironic that these features are part of so-called Artificial Intelligence, because they demonstrate a profoundlackof actual intelligence. This egg is rotten and needs to be tossed If you asked me, an intelligent human, to draw a successful person, I would say that’s impossible because success isn’t a characteristic that defines the way a person looks. I can’t just draw success, I need to know more before I can create that image. Any attempt to create an image from just the word ‘success’ would be dumb. But AI isn't meant to be intelligent. It's designed to be a reflection of us - to give us what we want. It's designed to reinforce our stereotypes so that we will pat it on the head and say \"good job, Pixel Studio!\" while we share these tired images. I asked Google if it had any concerns about the results I got from Pixel Studio. I asked if it's a problem that the Pixel Studio reinforces negative stereotypes? And if this problem cannot be solved, would Google consider again removing the ability to make images with people? I asked those questions a couple of weeks ago and Google has not responded. This is not a chicken-and-egg question. It doesn’t matter whether the image generator creates the stereotype or simply reflects it. This egg is rotten and needs to be tossed. All of the eggs this chicken lays will be rotten. Let the AI play Tic Tac Toe and leave people alone. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

Insight Partners, a major venture capital organization that invested in some of the biggest tech organizations around today, has confirmed suffering a cyberattack in which it lost sensitive data on employees and some of its partners. In mid-February 2025, the company released a statement, informing that it suffered a cyberattack a month earlier. “On January 16, 2025, Insight Partners detected that an unauthorized third-party accessed certain Insight information systems through a sophisticated social engineering attack,” the announcement reads. “As soon as this incident was detected, we moved quickly to contain, remediate, and start an investigation within a matter of hours. We notified stakeholders connected to Insight in January to alert them and encourage vigilance and tightened security protocols irrespective of having shared data compromised. We also notified law enforcement in relevant jurisdictions.” The company said it didn’t find evidence of intrusions after January 16, and added that, since the attack was contained to a single day, it did not disrupt its day-to-day operations. It recently updated the announcement, saying the breach was verified and confirming that some sensitive data was indeed lost, including fund information, management company information, portfolio company information, banking information, tax information, personal information of current and former employees, and information related to limited partners. The company doesn’t know how many victims there are just yet, but said it would be notifying affected entities over the coming days.

    "article_text": "Fired workers could be replaced with bots When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) plans to use AI to replace workers having made extensive cuts to its workforce. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed the budget proposal in a House Appropriations Committeehearing, with reports confirming the IRS has lost almost a third of its tax auditors since the start of the second Trump administration - with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) trimming the workforce through layoffs and ‘deferred resignations’. Bessent argued further proposed reductions and plans to push further layoffs would not affect the agency’s tax collection abilities thanks to the “current AI boom” - although he didn’t explain exactly how the agency will be deploying the tech. The ramifications of personnel reductions will not result in a loss of capability, despite the majority of those fired being revenue agents, with 31% of the IRS’s revenue agent workforce laid off. \"I believe through smarter IT, through this AI boom, that we can use that to enhance collections and I would expect that collections would continue to be very robust as they were this year,\" Besset said. The 25% reduction in workforce for the IRS could lead to potential delays in tax refunds for American taxpayers, but it seems the cuts are likely to continue. Musk’s DOGE department has also cancelled multiple government contracts in the name of cost-cutting, including with IBM, Deloitte, and Gartner - to name just a few.

    "article_text": "Ransomware groups abusing Kickidler to run attacks When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Kickidler, a popularemployee monitoringtool, is being abused inransomwareattacks, multiple security researchers have warned. The software was designed for businesses, allowing them to oversee their employees’ productivity, ensure compliance, and detect insider threats. Some of its key features are real-time screen viewing, keystroke logging, and time tracking, with the former two being particularly interesting to cybercriminals. Researchers from Varonis and Synacktiv, who claim to have seen the attacks in the wild, say it all starts with a poisoned ad purchased on the Google Ads network. The ad is displayed to people searching for RVTools, a free Windows-based utility that connects to VMware vCenter or ESXi hosts. The ad leads to a trojanized version of the program, which deploys a backdoor called SMOKEDHAM. With the help of the backdoor, threat actors deploy Kickidler, specifically targeting enterprise administrators and many of the login credentials they use every day. The goal is to infiltrate into every corner of the network and ultimately deploy the encryptor. The two groups seen using Kickidler are Qilin and Hunters International, which seem focused on cloud backups, but seem to have hit a roadblock, Varonis said. \"Given the increased targeting of backup solutions by attackers in recent years, defenders are decoupling backup system authentication from Windows domains. This measure prevents attackers from accessing backups even if they gain high-level Windows credentials,\" Varonis toldBleepingComputer. \"Kickidler addresses this issue by capturing keystrokes and web pages from an administrator's workstation. This enables attackers to identify off-site cloud backups and obtain the necessary passwords to access them. This is done without dumping memory or other high-risk tactics that are more likely to be detected.\" Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The payloads targeted VMware ESXi infrastructure, the researchers added, encrypting VMDK virtual hard drives.

    "title": "As Nvidia struggles with RTX 5060 Ti stock, AMD’s RX 9060 XT GPU could sweep in and score a mid-range win with plentiful supply",
    "article_text": "Most 5060 Ti stock is the 8GB GPU, and there’s not much of that either When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AMD’s RX 9060 XT graphics card – which is still onlyrumored to be next in linefor the RDNA 4 family – is supposedly going to have healthy stock levels when it arrives. That’s the conclusion of Moore’s Law is Dead (MLID), a leaker onYouTubewho regularly provides GPU and CPU-related chatter. MLID cites multiple sources, the first of which is based outside of the US and reckons there will be a ‘pretty good supply’ of RX 9060 XT GPUs, albeit no firm numbers are given (by any of these sources, I should add). A second source at a major online retailer in the US claims that launch stock for this AMD graphics card is feeling \"very optimistic\" and another source (also in the US) backs that up. This feels somewhat more vague than the YouTuber normally is, but nonetheless, there’s clearly a positive vibe around how much stock AMD is likely to muster for the RX 9060 XT. Indeed, MLID underlines that this should be a similar launch to theRX 9070 XT, which arrived in decent numbers as you might recall. (Although due to demand, the GPU still sold through very quickly, or at least models at or near MSRP did). The caveat MLID adds is that the US may be slightly less well-supplied for the 9060 XT than other countries, or at least that’s a possibility. Another point addressed here is that the 9060 XT won’t likely affect the stock of AMD’s 9070 XT in the near future, according to the YouTuber’s best guess. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It certainly makes sense to me that RX 9070 XT (or vanilla 9070) stock wouldn’t suffer due to the launch of this third RDNA 4 GPU (not counting the GRE, which is Asia-only, for now anyway). That’s because the two existing graphics cards use the Navi 48 chip, whereas the 9060 XT is built around a different engine, the Navi 44 GPU. So, the latter chip won’t cannibalize the former (not directly, anyway). And also because there’s more profit to be made on the pricier 9070 models – the XT in particular – it doesn’t make sense that AMD would want to miss out on that (by sacrificing any 9070 production in favor of the 9060 XT). If AMD can indeed supply the RX 9060 XT in a decent quantity, as suggested here, that’s going to be trouble forNvidia, which is struggling to get its RTX 5060 Ti graphics cards – which Team Red’s inbound RDNA 4 GPU should rival – onto shelves in any real number. Yes, you can find RTX 5060 Ti models on sale, and there are a couple of flavors of the 8GB version around in the US currently. However, that’s more a reflection of thegeneral unpopularity of this GPU– and even then, the cheapest you’ll get is still 10% over the MSRP. With the better-received RTX 5060 Ti 16GB, I could only spot one in the US (all of this is at the time of writing), but this time it’s 15% over the recommended price, so you’re paying a premium. What we still don’t know is the MSRP of the RX 9060 XT, of course. Indeed, as noted at the outset, this GPU isn’t even officially confirmed yet, let alone the price. All we know is that there’s some kind of new RDNA 4 graphics card coming this quarter, though with the weight of the rumors at this point, it’s pretty certain to be the 9060 XT. Pricing will be key, of course, and MLID believes that AMD is going to pitch the RX 9060 XT somewhere between $329 to $379 in the US (and in line elsewhere). That’s for the rumored 16GB version of the graphics card, too, not the 8GB variant (which will be launched alongside it,at least according to some speculation). At the lower end of that pricing scale, this could be a killer blow to Nvidia in the lower-mid-range space (again, depending on exactly how performance pans out). There are too many unknowns to get overly excited yet, and looking at the overall picture – and where Nvidia is with its RTX 5060 models – I worry there’s not much of a driving force for AMD to have to pitch its new entrant to the GPU scene towards the more compelling end of the rumored range. What Nvidia has in its favor right now is that while the grapevine expects AMD to launch the RX 9060 XT very soon – on May 21, in fact – these graphics cards may not actually beon shelves before June. As ever, load up the seasoning with all this. What we do know is thatNvidia’s RTX 5060 (non-Ti) goes on sale come May 19, though again, its 8GB of VRAM loadout (across the board) is proving controversial, just as with that version of the RTX 5060 Ti currently.

This provides assurance that no modification has occurred during the build process. This comes as2024 saw a surge in malicious free VPN apps.Cybercriminals increasingly took advantage of the high demand forvirtual private network (VPN)tools to spread malware via fake software that mimicked legitimate services. VPN-based attacks have continued in 2025 as well, with Google warning of attackersusing legitimate VPN applications as a backdoorto inject malware and gain remote control of infected devices. \"We believe transparency is crucial for security software. Investing in reproducible builds is a testament to our commitment to providing you with a trustworthy and secure application,\" wrote Mullvad, one of thebest VPNproviders on the market right now,in its official announcement. Starting with version 2025.2, our Android app builds are reproducible. This means you can verify that the app you download and install is built from the open source code we publish.Read more here: https://t.co/GV1ZH8NO5OMay 9, 2025 As mentioned earlier, only Mullvad's latest Android VPN app comes with reproducible builds at the time of writing. It isn't yet clear if and when the company will extend this feature across its other applications. Talking to TechRadar, a Mullvad developer welcomed the idea, but said the team doesn't have any direct plans yet. \"There is no reason we would not want to do it, just that it has not been prioritized/evaluated for the other platforms,\" the Mullvad developer added. The company is now urging all technically inclined users to verify Mullvad builds. This will not only provide transparency to users – which is the main goal – but will also \"allow us to verify our own build environment is not compromised,\" said the Mullvad developer. The verification process does require some IT skills, but the VPN firm has put together aset of instructionsto help you do just that. \"To help ensure we are able to produce reproducible builds over time, we have added initial such checks to ourcontinuous integration(CI) environment,\" Mullvad added.

The hackers which struck PowerSchool in 2024 are now reportedly targeting individual schools and extorting them for ransom, threatening to release previously stolen student and staff information. “PowerSchool is aware that a threat actor has reached out to multiple school district customers in an attempt to extort them using data from the previously reported December 2024 incident,” the organization confirmed. PowerSchool is a top education software platform with over 17,000 customers spanning 90 countries, and supporting over 50 million students.

    "title": "Forget GTA 6, Mafia: The Old Country launches in August and it will be cheaper than you might think",
    "article_text": "Not $69.99? Nice When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While Rockstar Games' highly anticipated title,Grand Theft Auto6, is on the radar of most gamers with itsrecent delay announcementandtrailer release, another title that is also under Take-Two Interactive's umbrella finally has a release date - and its more affordable price tag may come as a surprise. It has been revealed thatMafia: The Old Countrywill launch on August 8, 2025, and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S, and PC. It will launch with a Standard Edition that comes in at $49.99 and a Deluxe Edition for $59.99, both of which are available for pre-order now. This comes after Nintendo andMicrosoftbegan raising the prices of some games to the $80 mark. It's worth noting that the new game prices for Microsoft won't come into effect until the start of this Holiday season, and we're still waiting to see whetherSonyfollows suit. However, the $49.99 price tag forMafia: The Old Countryappears to be much less about Take-Two Interactive and 2K Games not following the $80 trend, and more about the game's shorter length and linear presentation. 2K president David Ismailer, said: \"We think there's a large audience for compelling stories that don't require massive time commitments,\" which hints atThe Old Countryhaving a short runtime. Borderlands 4also launches a month after, on September 12, but there isn't any pre-order or price information on that title yet. There's no doubt that the upcomingMafiagame's price will have gamers wondering what this means for the looter-shooter andGTA 6. To say I detest $80, even $70 game prices, is an understatement and it's been sad to see Nintendo and Microsoft kickstart the trend. It's only a matter of time until Sony joins the party and for the large majority of game publishers to follow. I'm desperately hoping Take-Two Interactive don't budge but it seems unlikely. Gamers have been waiting forGTA 6for twelve years, going on thirteen now due to its 2026 delay - and it's safe to say that a large majority of gamers are willing to pay over $80 for it. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Considering the rumors of the game's $2 billion budget, a higher price tag might be justified but if Take-Two Interactive were to charge $70 (or even lower) for the highly anticipated title, it would reflect poorly on Microsoft and Nintendo and help it fly off the shelves and smash even more records than it already likely will. The reasoning is simple - it'sGTA 6, arguably the most anticipated game of all-time. Rockstar Games is in a league of its own when it comes to size, scope, and attention to detail and if I were going to choose betweenMarioKart Worldat $80 andGTA 6with the latter being cheaper, it's an easy decision.

    "article_text": "Cisco IOS XE Software contained a 10/10 vulnerability When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cisco has released a patch for a maximum-severity flaw found in its IOS XE Software for Wireless LAN Controllers which could have allowed threat actors to take over vulnerable endpoints. The flaw is yet another case of hardcoded credentials, this time in the form of a JSON Web Token (JWT). “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTPS requests to the AP image download interface,” it is explained in the NVD website. “A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload files, perform path traversal, and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.” The vulnerability is now tracked as CVE-2025-20188, and has the maximum security score - 10/10 (critical). It was also noted that the vulnerability can only be exploited on devices that have the Out-of-Band Image Download feature enabled which, on default settings, is not the case. According toBleepingComputer, this is a feature that allows access points to download OS images via HTTPS instead of CAPWAP, which is a somewhat more flexible and direct way of getting firmware onto access points. The publication says that while it’s off by default, some large-scale or automated enterprise deployments have turned it on. Unfortunately, there are no mitigations for the flaw. The best way to minimize the risk of exposure is to deploy the patch. A possible workaround is to disable the Out-of-Band Image Download feature, which could work well if the enterprise isn’t actually using it.

    "title": "How to unlock AI's industrial value while managing its risks",
    "article_text": "Ramping up AI to boost efficiency, streamline tasks and improve profitability. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Despite this enthusiasm, hurdles such as unstructureddata, uncertain model accuracy, and gaps in governance are preventing many organizations from getting the full benefit of AI tools. Firms that rely on large-scale, around-the-clock operations know the stakes are high. A system outage or an unforeseen failure can cost millions, disrupt the supply chain, and harm overall competitiveness. A study by Aberdeen Research found unplanned downtime in manufacturing can cost up to US$260,000 per hour. Against this backdrop,AIcan predict issues before they occur, helping companies repair equipment proactively and keep downtime to a minimum. Yet concerns linger around data reliability, potential algorithmic bias, and whether AI’s recommendations are truly explainable and safe. A carefully planned approach is key to overcoming these challenges, so that AI becomes a true value driver. Chief Technologist at Aspen Technology. When setting up a new asset to work in the field, organizations will necessarily have no data to draw on. That’s where they can access learning from first principles models, coupled with simulation models to ensure a balanced set of data, availability of unlikely scenarios, and therefore enable extrapolation to new regimes of operation. Data from the field can then be used to refine the model (close the simulation reality gap), or to predict future outcomes based on historical observations. With predictive maintenance technology, it is also possible to identify abnormalities by building models from normal modes of operation. To enable this, companies need strong governance policies, as well as processes for labelling, storing, and updating data. While a sizable upfront investment may be needed, the payoff is significant: well-organized data fuels accurate models that deliver meaningful results. Another challenge involves explainability. Some AI-generated recommendations can seem like a “black box” e.g., when models rely on complex neural networks. For day-to-day industrial operations, trust is crucial, as operators must be able to understand how and why decisions are made. Including interpretable features and highlighting key decision drivers helps build that trust. When people know the rationale behind AI findings, they become more willing to follow them, improving adoption rates. Well-designed dashboards that map input factors to recommend outputs have their part to play here. However, they will be not sufficient in themselves in achieving trust. Organizations should ensure that they select the right tool for the job in hand. A complex model can be necessary for complex nonlinear behavior. However, while a complex model can address simple use cases, this comes at a cost, for example explainability, challenges with extrapolation, risk of overfitting, large data requirements etc. It is therefore important to select the right tool for the job. Generally, the simplest approach that solves the problem is preferable. Trust can be further assured by the use of first principles guardrails that provide peace of mind and highlight that a provider has a thoughtful approach to AI. In addition, there is the question of bias. Historical data sometimes reflects outdated practices or inconsistent recording methods, and if this data is used without scrutiny, algorithms may carry forward biases into their predictions. Regular auditing of model performance, along with diverse data sets and ongoing feedback from subject matter experts, can mitigate these risks. Proactively revisiting the data strategy and staying aware of evolving regulations also helps organizations stay one step ahead. Finally, AI’s integration with existing workflows demands attention. Even the most advanced algorithms will struggle if they fail to mesh with established processes. For instance, if plant operators need to switch between multiple tools or can’t easily act on an AI-driven alert, the system’s value quickly diminishes. Seamless product integration, visualizing AI insights, training operators on new procedures, and ensuringIT infrastructurecan handle added data loads are often a make-or-break factor for success. A strategic roadmap for AI adoption starts with identifying use cases that promise strong returns. Many companies find early success in areas like predictive maintenance, where AI models spot signals of potential future breakdowns and enable timely fixes. Another example are hybrid models that allow the creation and sustainment of models from data in the field. This accelerates the model building for complex processes and improves the representation for design optimization or control, thus supporting efficiency and sustainability improvements. Another best practice is merging automation with human expertise. While AI excels at e.g., sorting through large data sets to pinpoint trends or anomalies, seasoned operators understand the practical nuances of running a plant. Collaborationbetween people and technology ensures that strategic decisions blend intuitive knowledge with data-driven recommendations. By keeping humans in the loop, organizations lessen the odds of unexpected failures and maintain trust among the workforce. To secure buy-in across management levels, pilot programs need to show quick, tangible benefits. If a narrow project using AI for quality checks significantly reduces scrap in a factory, the cost savings and improvedcustomersatisfaction help support broader initiatives. Documenting these early gains and calculating the return on investment helps justify scaling AI across multiple sites, which often involves more complex budgeting and approvals. As expansion proceeds, robust model governance becomes essential. Models must be monitored for “drift,” when real-world conditions change. Deploying self-adapting AI technology or regular checkpoints with engineering and data science teams helps ensure the technology performs as expected. Enterprises can also set up review boards or specialized groups to vet new AI solutions, confirm compliance with regulations, and measure alignment with corporate targets such as safety or sustainability. Lastly, organizations should build long-term expertise within their teams. Successful AI adoption isn’t a one-time event; it’s a continuous journey of refinement, learning, and adaptation. Training employees to understand AI fundamentals, interpret analytics, and collaborate with data scientists goes a long way toward embedding AI into the corporate culture. This level of internal capability also positions companies to pivot faster as new technologies emerge. We've featured the best AI chatbot for business.

    "article_text": "International news organizations and prominent X users are among the targets When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. India has issued executive orders to X, asking the social media company to block over 8,000 accounts across the country. The targets, X explains, include accounts belonging to international news organizations and prominent X users. X's Global Government Affairs team disclosed the detailsin a lengthy tweeton Thursday, May8, 2025, deeming these requests as \"censorship\" and urging account holders based in India to legally challenge the blocks. \"Blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship of existing and future content, and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech,\" wrote X. \"To comply with the orders, we will withhold the specified accounts in India alone. We have begun that process,\" wrote X, adding that the company disagrees with the Indian government’s demands. This means, however, that blocked account holders may be able to keep accessing the platform by using one of thebest VPNservices to spoof their IP address location. \"X is exploring all possible legal avenues available to the company. Unlike users located in India, X is restricted by Indian law in its ability to bring legal challenges against these executive orders,\" the company added, while encouraging all users impacted to seek appropriate relief from the courts. The social media company even shared a list of legal aid organizations that could help people challenging these blocking orders, and asserted that it had notified those impacted by these actions. X's Global Government Affairs account was temporarily withheld in India, as reported by Indian technology journalist Adit Agrawal onher LinkedIn account. The account was restored on Friday morning. According to a person aware of the matter, Agrawal reported, X blocked the account without an official order after authorities asked the company about the tweet. \"Now MeitY has issued an order to X to NOT block it, as per this person,\"wrote Agrawal. X's blocking orders coincide with a spike in internet censorship across the country as the conflict with the neighboring Pakistan intensifies. On Wednesday, May 7, Meta also blocked a major Muslim news page on Instagram at the authorities' request, asreported by The Guardian. On Thursday, India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting alsoissued an advisoryurging all media companies, streaming services, and online platforms to block all content originating from Pakistan. On his side, Pakistan has resumed access to X on Wednesday after a15-month-long ban. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority(PTA) also blocked accessto at least 16 YouTube news channels and 32 websites from India on the same day, for allegedly spreading misinformation and anti-Pakistan propaganda. Asreported by the BBC, India and Pakistan blame each other for escalating military tensions and have both been launching a series of missiles and drone strikes since Wednesday. This represents a major escalation of existing tensions over the disputed area of Kashmir between the two nuclear-armed countries.

With the vast amount ofdatathat enterprises are generating and storing, leaders are continually reminded to get their data in order so they can generate business insight and prepare forAIinitiatives. However, there is a reason why a majority of the enterprise’s human intelligence cannot be utilized to inform the business decisions being made today. The main issue is that computers are unable to determine the meaning and context of unstructured text—and there is simply too much of it for humans to process. With the global market for AI technologies expected to grow to over 1.8 trillion U.S. dollars by 2030, there is a clear business need for computers to understand the human language, or business leaders will fail to make the most of their AI investments. However, there is a solution. In using semantic analysis, which has automated and assisted text classification and fact extraction processes, a business can use AI to understand the meaning of its enterprise data with accurate, consistent and transparent outcomes. With this meaning, they are able to unlock valuable insights, enhance user experience and drive smarter decisions. SVP for Product and Engineering - Application and Data Platform at Progress. Semantic analysis builds upon natural language processing (NLP) and focuses on understanding and processing the meaning of words and phrases that have multiple meanings. It works by using methods and tools that can efficiently categorize and process data, whilst seeing relationships within data sets. In so doing, computers can finally comprehend the human intent behind words, phrases and sentences. Semantic analysis can answer questions like: “What does this text mean?”, and “How do these concepts relate to each another?” It also can extract specific information in the data like the age of a patient or the directors of a company. By revealing and encoding what the text really means, semantic analysis enables the most accurate information retrieval and improves communication between machines and humans. Put simply, it can understandbusinessdata to generate meaningful insights. By interpreting communications withcustomersand gaining insights into habits and preferences, semantic analysis can enable businesses to powerchatbotsand deliver a new level of agility to the organization. By deriving new insight from communications with customers—helping train chatbots, for example—Semantic analysis can add a new level of agility to the organization. Depending on what an organization is looking to achieve, semantic analysis can use two methods to extract information from text. These methods are text classification and fact extraction. Text Classification With this method, text is labelled based on insights you want to gain from the textual data. For example, Topic Classification can organize text within a particular category, for instance putting a school assignment into math, chemistry or physics. Intent Classification assesses the sender’s intent for a message, which can help the organization respond in the best way. Fact Extraction With Fact Extraction, organizations can identify and extract facts and relationships in their content to aid in the discovery of latent patterns and knowledge not previously known to their business. If organizations can make information easier to find within their content, it brings efficiency to the organization as it can reuse text for various use cases and audit it. The Text Re-use feature can help leverage content in different contexts quickly and for different use cases. Text Auditing helps you stay ahead of your competition and fully access the volume of knowledge in your content. Text Creation allows teams to focus resources on creating missing content that fills gaps rather than recreating content that already exists. Here are six ways semantic analysis can add value and agility to an organization: Intelligent search experience - It can help search engines understand the meaning of text to position it appropriately in results. It goes beyond repetition, improving the results through the richness of the semantic field. This results in an intelligent search experience that can understand user intent and context for better outcomes. Customer feedback– Since it can understand the positive, negative or neutral context, semantic analysis can help machines better understand customer feedback from social networks, reviews and forums by detecting elements that denote dissatisfaction, discontent or impatience. Trends insight – Semantic analysis can help marketers get closer to their customers and keep on top of market trends by processing large volumes of textual data. Customer experience– The overall elevated digital experience helps customers to find more relevant information faster and offsets problems before they can escalate. Regulatory compliance- Semantic analysis can help an organization meet regulatory needs, mitigate risk and streamline processes. It helps apply metadata that organizations can use to implement information governance best practices. Making your data AI ready– data agility is vital for successful AIapplications. Semantic data analysis allows for efficient data integration, classification and contextualization, which will enable organizations to build more adaptable and responsive AI systems. A well-executed semantic analysis methodology will bolster competitive advantage by elevating thecustomer experienceand company performance, improving search relevance and providing valuable insights for new business initiatives. Some key advantages of semantic analysis include: Build a customer-centric strategy:Semantic analysis contributes to the deployment of a customer-centric strategy, where each business decision is centered on the customer’s needs, boosting customer loyalty and retention. Improve company performance:By automating data analysis, semantic analysis offers considerable time savings for teams across the organization, channeling resources to prioritize business-critical functions and improve the bottom line. Enhance yourSEOstrategy:Semantic analysis can help uncover a user’s intent during the search process, enabling the organization to serve up more relevant content. Bolster customer self-service solutions:Semantic analysis allows machines to detect human emotions to extract valuable information from unstructured data so more effective self-service options can be created. Support AI Strategy: When it comes to machine learning and AI, semantic analysis supports feature extraction and understanding relationships in data. Smarter business decisions:Ultimately, semantic analysis extracts the meaningful information companies need to drive informed business decisions. Enable 360s: By providing a comprehensive view of all data, semantic analysis allows organizations to aggregate information effectively, enabling them to conduct more informed 360 reviews of products. With the advancement of AI and the rise of unstructured data, semantic analysis is essential for organizations in all sectors who are looking to embrace AI agents and data driven decisioning. The introduction of semantic analysis marks a significant leap forward for machines to become not only viable but trusted in the business landscape. By harnessing the power of meaning, businesses can unlock valuable insights, enhance user experience and drive smarter decisions. We've featured the best productivity tool.

    "title": "Immortal Regiment honors Soviet WWII veterans under tight police watch in Berlin (VIDEOS)",
    "article_text": "Hundreds of people took to the streets of Berlin on Friday to commemorate those who fought for the Soviet Union in World War II in a civilian march known as the Immortal Regiment. However, Soviet flags and symbols were not allowed and participants were prevented from marching in a single procession to the city’s main war memorial. The Immortal Regiment, which is held on May 9 in cities across Russia and other countries, is a procession in which people carry portraits of relatives who fought against Nazi Germany in World War II. The idea was first conceived in the Russian city of Tomsk in 2012 and has since spread across the world. The procession in Berlin, which drew members of the Russian community and local residents, moved through the center of the German capital and concluded at the Soviet War Memorial in Tiergarten, where thousands of Red Army soldiers are buried. Marchers wishing to lay flowers at the memorial to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat were allowed to approach the site in groups of only ten, each escorted by law enforcement. At the memorial, a group of pro-Ukraine activists attempted to interfere with the flower-laying ceremony and had to be restrained by police. Marchers were chanting“Russia, Russia,”while the opposing demonstrators waved Ukrainian and NATO flags and held signs reading“Arm Ukraine.” Earlier this week, Berlin city officials banned the display of Soviet flags and symbols at World War II memorials during the May 8–9 events in the capital. The restrictions also extended to singing Soviet songs in public. Moscow decried the ban as“degrading”and“discriminatory.”The Russian embassy in Berlin strongly criticized the measure, arguing that it violated the rights of the descendants of Soviet soldiers. Up to 27 million Soviet citizens died in the fight to defeat Nazism. In 2023, the city authorities outlawed both Russian and Soviet flags during Victory Day commemorations. In 2024, additional symbols, including the letters ‘Z’ and ‘V’, were banned for being associated with the Ukraine conflict. Despite the ban, participants of the Immortal Regiment sang ‘Katyusha’, a popular wartime folk song symbolizing hope, sacrifice, and the longing of those left behind on the home front.",

    "title": "Vucic and Fico are heroes – Kremlin",
    "article_text": "The Kremlin has praised Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico for defying EU pressure and attending the Victory Day celebrations in the Russian capital on Friday. Despite warnings from Brussels, Vucic and Fico also held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in addition to attending the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s victory in World War II. Both leaders faced travel hurdles after several EU countries closed their airspace to their jets en route to Russia. Moscow condemned the moves as“hostile.” “These days… it is simply an act of heroism. Showing one’s sovereign will to pay tribute to the memory of Victory Day, despite the blatant, frenzied pressure, is worthy of the highest praise,”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. Last month, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned leaders from member and candidate countries against traveling to Moscow to commemorations of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. She suggested that they visit Kiev instead. EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos reportedly also told Vucic in April that his presence in Moscow would be held against Serbia’s EU bid. Latvia and Lithuania denied their airspace to the plane of the Serbian president, forcing it to fly through Bulgaria, Türkiye, Azerbaijan, and Georgia in order to make it to Moscow on Wednesday. Vucic came to Russia despite a recent health scare that forced him to cut short a trip to the US and cancel a meeting with President Donald Trump in Florida. Estonia closed its airspace to Fico’s plane on Wednesday. The Baltic state’s foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, claimed that“Russia is a country that launched and continues a war in Europe”and“participation in propaganda events organized by them should be ruled out”for EU representatives. Putin earlier praised those who accepted the invitation, calling them courageous for attending despite pressure from Brussels. The celebrations in Moscow were attended by heads of state and top officials from 30 countries, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.",

    "title": "Trump’s pope? Here’s what Leo XIV’s election says about US power",
    "article_text": "For the first pope in history from the United States, only his citizenship, place of birth – Chicago – and nickname are actually American. The faithful call him Father Bob, but not in English, which had no place in his first address to believers from the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica. The new Pope Leo XIV spoke in Italian and Spanish – the languages that, for him, formerly Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost (Prevo being the French pronunciation), have been his working languages all these years. As the leader of the Augustinians, he visited orders around the world, communicating in these languages. So is the new Pope a liberal or a conservative? For today’s America, where the government is increasingly leaning toward traditional values (recall the visit of Catholic US Vice President J.D. Vance to the Vatican on the eve of Pope Francis’s death, or the daily briefings that Trump’s press secretary Caroline Leavitt begins with a prayer), this question is crucial. And here, the American left has already made an unfortunate blunder. Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost hadn’t even become Pope Leo XIV yet, and the liberal Wall Street Journal had already put its foot in it. On the eve of the conclave, the publication confidently claimed that his American citizenship would supposedly prevent his election.“A US passport is a liability, especially in the Trump era,”the paper wrote. But it turned out that this was only a liability for American liberals. You can become pope with that passport. That said, Cardinal Prevost can’t be called a Trumpist either – otherwise, he wouldn’t have stood a chance of being elected. The election of Leo XIV shook the Catholic world, as there had long been an unspoken taboo against a pope from the United States. Given the geopolitical power of the US, electing an American as pontiff was seen as risky. Thus, the changes in the Vatican are also an indirect sign of the weakening of U.S. hegemony, as well as an indication of the emergence of a multipolar world. Ordained in 1982 at the age of 27, Prevost received his doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical University of St Thomas Aquinas in Rome. He has served as a missionary, parish priest, teacher and bishop in Peru. He has travelled all his life, which has shaped his particular attitude towards migrants, similar to that of Pope Francis. He has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration’s policies on illegal migration. A recent example is the retweet of a post from April 14, in which Prevost expressed support for those condemning the White House for deporting Kilmara Abrego Garcia – an undocumented migrant and father of three who is suspected of ties to the MS-13 gang in El Salvador. Cardinal Prevost also publicly sparred with J.D. Vance on issues of illegal immigration. In 2017, the future pope reposted a post in support of DACA recipients - illegal migrants who were brought to the US as children. And a year later, he shared a post saying,“There is nothing remotely Christian, American, or morally defensible about a policy that takes children away from their parents and warehouses them in cages. This is being carried out in our name and the shame is on us all.” So he is a liberal? No, that’s wrong too. In a 2012 address to bishops, for example, Prevost lamented that Western media and pop culture encourage ‘sympathy for beliefs and practices that are contrary to the Gospel’. He mentioned ‘homosexual lifestyles’ and ‘alternative families made up of same-sex partners and their adopted children’. As Bishop of Chiclayo, Peru, he openly opposed a government plan to introduce gender education in schools. ‘The promotion of gender ideology is confusing because it seeks to create genders that do not exist,’ he told local media. A quiet reformer, continuing the work of his predecessor but trying to smooth out sharp edges - this is how the new Pope’s future policy can be described for now. At the White House, where they were watching the white smoke over the Sistine Chapel with particular interest, there seems to be no objection. The US president and vice-president were quick to congratulate Leo XIV on his election.  And it’s no surprise. Catholics in modern America make up a fifth of the population, the majority of whom are Spanish-speaking – a key voter bloc that Republicans have been increasingly successful in competing for against the Democrats. Both of Donald Trump’s potential successors, when looking ahead to the 2028 election – J.D. Vance and Marco Rubio – are also Catholics. In such circumstances, a loyal pope could be considered almost an ally.",

    "title": "UK hits Russia with ‘largest ever’ sanctions package",
    "article_text": "The British government has announced its“largest-ever”sanctions package against Russia, according to an official statement. The measure aim to deal a blow to the Russia’s oil transportation network and reduce Moscow’s energy revenues. The announcement was timed to coincide with Russia’s celebration of the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany on Friday. London, one of Kiev’s staunchest supporters – providing it with military and tactical support and billions in cash – has long claimed that Moscow poses a threat to the UK’s national security. Various British governments have implemented over 2,000 sanctions against Russian individuals and entities, since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict over three years ago. “The threat Russia poses to our national security cannot be underestimated. To ramp up the pressure on Putin, I’m announcing the largest package of sanctions yet,”Prime Minister Keir Starmer wrote on X. The new measures blacklist up to 100 oil tankers that the West claims are part of a Russian“shadow fleet,”older vessels operating outside Western insurance systems. According to London, the vessels have carried more than $24 billion worth of cargo since the start of 2024. The EU and the US have also targeted Russian shipping and a 17th European sanctions package that would blacklist another 150 ships is expected to be approved later this month. Moscow has dismissed the restrictions as a“futile”gesture that will not harm the Russian economy, but instead drive-up energy costs and inflation across Europe.Russia’s oil revenues have remained robust thanks to non-Western buyers, such as China and India. Last month, the Russian Embassy in London urged the British government to stop“theatrical and short-lived gestures of hostility towards Russia.” The UK has also accused the vessels of posing a threat to critical undersea infrastructure, such as telecommunications cables and oil and gas pipelines, dismissed by Moscow as“hastily concocted fantasy stories.” London’s tough sanctions rhetoric comes as Britain, along with the EU, is being sidelined from the peace process around Ukraine. A key London meeting on the conflict was downgraded last month after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio canceled his attendance. US President Donald Trump has also floated the idea of a possible partial lifting of restrictions on Moscow as part of a possible peace settlement.",

    "article_text": "NATO’s deputy commander for Ukraine support has been dismissed over a rape-related remark he made during a high-level meeting, Der Spiegel reported on Tuesday. Major General Hartmut Renk told a gathering in February“If rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy.” Following a formal complaint from a female British officer, Renk admitted to making the comment but reportedly used it sarcastically to motivate his team, according to the outlet. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius and General Carsten Breuer, the head of the German armed forces, oversaw an investigation, after which, the minister removed Renk from his NATO post, canceled his planned promotion to a role in the US, and initiated disciplinary proceedings. The two-star general now reportedly faces early retirement. NATO publicly committed to combating conflict-related sexual violence and adopted a zero-tolerance policy in 2020. Each bloc member is responsible for investigating misconduct and taking disciplinary or legal action against its own personnel. Despite this policy, sexual misconduct within NATO ranks, including incidents involving senior officers, has been widely reported. A 2024 NATO Review highlighted persistent sexual harassment and called for cultural change within military institutions. Renk’s dismissal comes as new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged to overhaul the country’s armed forces, restore credibility, and significantly increase military spending under the campaign slogan,“Germany is back.” The former senior commander began his military career in 1982 and was deployed to both Kosovo and Afghanistan. He most recently worked on providing weapons and training for Kiev through NATO’s Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) program.",

    "title": "US considering lowering China tariffs to 50% – media",
    "article_text": "The administration of US President Donald Trump is mulling a plan to reduce the massive tariffs previously imposed on goods imported from China, the New York Post reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the matter. The measure will reportedly come into force as soon as next week and remain in effect during trade talks between Beijing and Washington. Senior officials from China and the US are set to meet on Saturday in the Swiss city of Geneva to hold negotiations, as the countries with the world’s two largest economies seek to de-escalate tensions that have resulted in a de facto mutual trade embargo. The sweeping 145% tariff on Chinese imports will be reduced to between 50% and 54%, the New York Post cited sources close to the negotiations as saying. Trade tariffs on neighboring South Asian countries could be cut to 25%, one source told the tabloid. Commenting on the reported reduction, White House spokesman Kush Desai told the outlet that any decisions on tariffs would come directly from the president, adding that“anything else is just pure speculation.” Relations between Washington and Beijing have been strained due to Trump’s decision to impose the steepest-ever tariffs on Chinese exports to the US. The president cited national security and concerns about the trade imbalance to justify the measure. The Chinese authorities, in turn, have accused the White House of“economic bullying”and retaliated with 125% tariffs on all US imports and introduced export controls. Earlier this week, China’s Commerce Ministry confirmed that Vice Premier He Lifeng will meet with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for economic and trade talks during his visit to Switzerland this coming weekend. On Thursday, Trump expressed hope that the two nations could resolve their differences and reach a deal that would benefit both sides.",

    "title": "Germany to declare immigration emergency – media",
    "article_text": "New German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will declare a national emergency to tackle the country’s issues with migration, Die Welt has reported. Merz, who was elected chancellor on Tuesday, said on his first day in office that his government would begin turning back illegal migrants at the border. Germany remains the top destination for asylum seekers in the EU. Last year, it received a quarter (over 237,000) of all asylum applications across the 27-member bloc. Berlin has already informed the ambassadors of neighboring countries about the chancellor’s decision to impose a national emergency, the paper said in an article on Thursday. The move would allow the German government to prioritize its own decisions over EU regulations, according to Die Welt. In order to turn away migrants, Berlin will invoke Article 72 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which provides for“the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security”by member states. Germany has a 3,700km land border with nine countries, including Poland, Austria, France, and the Netherlands. They are all part of the EU’s Schengen area, which allows passport-free travel for most EU citizens and many non-EU nationals. On Wednesday, Germany’s newly appointed interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, told journalists:“we will control the borders more strictly,”which will lead“to a higher number of rejections”of asylum applications. The goal is to“send a clear signal to the world and to Europe that the policy in Germany has changed,”he explained. In a letter seen by Bild, Dobrindt instructed the head of the Federal Police to disregard a 2015 directive from then-Chancellor Angela Merkel, who allowed more than a million migrants into the country at the height of Europe’s 2015-16 refugee crisis.",

He made the remarks during an informal meeting on May 8 with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the Foreign Ministry in Beijing. Xi is among more than two dozen world leaders attending this year’s events in Moscow commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Xi and Putin heldtalksin a closed format and later in an expanded session with their delegations. “China advocates and adheres to the common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable global security concept for the Ukrainian crisis,”the ministry said in a statement, citing the Chinese president. “The reasonable security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously, and the root causes of the crisis should be eliminated.” Xi expressed hope for a“fair, lasting, binding,”and mutually acceptable settlement between Moscow and Kiev through dialogue. Putin“highly appreciated”Xi’s approach, the ministry noted, and reiterated that Russia remains open to peace talks without preconditions. According to the ministry, the discussions between Xi and Putin covered a broad range of international and regional issues and focused on enhancing bilateral cooperation. Xi said the world“has entered a new period of turbulence and change,”adding that as long as China and Russia“adhere to strategic cooperation, no force can stop the two countries from achieving their own development and revitalization.” The Kremlin previously announced that Putin and Xi signed a joint statement on deepening their comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation, as well as nearly three dozen intergovernmental and interagency agreements in a variety of areas.",

The drill, conducted on Thursday, involved the launch of short-range ballistic missiles and long-range artillery to assess the readiness of the nation’s nuclear forces. The exercise featured 600mm multiple-launch rocket systems and the Hwasong-11 (KN-23) tactical ballistic missile, both said to have nuclear capabilities. The missiles reportedly flew around 800km before landing in the sea, demonstrating the operational capacity of North Korea’s missile systems. The drill also included an inspection of the“nuclear trigger”system, designed to manage and control the nation’s deterrence arsenal and ensure rapid deployment if necessary.“The goal of the drill was achieved, and the reliability of the command and mobilization system capable of quickly reacting to any nuclear crisis was verified,”the KCNA reported. Kim stressed the importance of maintaining the combat readiness of the country’s nuclear forces, highlighting the need to enhance long-range precision strike capabilities and overall weapons efficiency. Last month, he called for accelerated efforts to arm the navy with nuclear weapons, while attending a weapons systems test aboard the DPRK’s Choe Hyon multi-mission destroyer. After witnessing the demonstration, he reportedly noted that the warship’s firepower still relied on conventional weaponry and“cannot be called a reliable means of maritime defense.” The US and South Korea have been conducting regular joint military exercises in the region, which North Korea has repeatedly condemned as provocative. In response, Pyongyang has increased its missile testing, asserting its right to self-defense and deterrence. Russia has also pledged to help protect North Korea if it comes under attack, under a mutual defense agreement signed last year. The treaty obligates both parties to provide immediate military assistance to each other if necessary. The agreement was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim in June 2024, after which North Korean troops officially joined Moscow’s military operation aimed at repelling a Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s Kursk Region. Putin later expressed gratitude for the role Pyongyang’s troops played in liberating the region, noting that they had demonstrated“heroism, a high level of specialized training, and bravery.”",

(Photo: AP/Francois Mori) Robert De Niro will receive an honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, a culmination for the 81-year-old actor whose history with the French film festival stretches back half a century. In 1976, De Niro starred in two films – Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 – that premiered in competition at Cannes. Taxi Driver was an immediate sensation, and went home with the festival's top prize, the Palme d'Or. Since then, De Niro has been a regular on the Croisette, returning with The King of Comedy in 1983, Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America in 1984 and Roland Joffe's The Mission in 1986. Joffe's film also won the Palme, making De Niro the rare actor to star in two Palme d'Or winners. Though De Niro helps run his own film festival back in New York, the Tribeca Festival, he has remained a mainstay in Cannes. He presided over the jury in 2011 that selected Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life for the Palme. Most recently, he and Scorsese returned to premiere Killers of the Flower Moon in 2023. \"I have such close feelings for Festival de Cannes,\" De Niro said when his honorary Palme d'Or was announced last month. \"Especially now when there's so much in the world pulling us apart, Cannes brings us together – storytellers, filmmakers, fans, and friends. It's like coming home.\" De Niro is to receive the award in the festival's opening ceremony on May 13. Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

    "title": "US measles cases surpass 1,000 for first time in 5 years",
    "article_text": "World World Signs inform people of measles prevention and testing at the Gaines County Court House in Seminole, Texas, US Apr 6, 2025. (Photo: Justin Rex for The Texas Tribune via REUTERS) The number of measles cases in the United States has crossed 1,000 for the first time in five years, federal data showed on Friday (May 9), as the country battles one of its worst outbreaks of the childhood disease. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 1,001 measles cases in 31 jurisdictions, as of Thursday. The CDC count does not reflect the latest data from Texas, the epicentre of the current measles outbreak, where cases have increased by seven to a total of 709. Researchers have warned that the United States is at a tipping point for the return of endemic measles, a quarter century after the disease was declared eradicated in the country. Infections only previously surpassed the 1,000 mark in 2019 when the country reported 1,274 cases. \"I think we are still at risk of seeing these numbers at least stay steady, if not continue to increase over time,\" said Lisa Maragakis, senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins Medicine. The CDC said 13 per cent of those infected with the disease this year have been hospitalised. There have been three confirmed deaths so far - two young girls in Texas and an adult in New Mexico. All three were unvaccinated. The outbreak in Texas is centred in a Mennonite community and has spread to neighbouring states, including New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas. North Dakota is the latest state to report an outbreak, with nine cases so far. Around 180 school students have been forced to quarantine at home, according to the North Dakota Monitor. \"This is a virus that's the most contagious infectious disease of mankind, and it's now spreading like wildfire,\" Paul Offit, a paediatrician and vaccine expert at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told AFP. He warned the true case count could be far higher, as people shy away from seeking medical attention. \"Those three deaths equal the total number of deaths from measles in the last 25 years in this country.\" US paediatricians and infectious disease experts say that the fight against rising measles cases nationwide is being hampered by a lack of forceful advocacy for vaccination by government health officials and by misleading statements about unproven treatments that confuse parents. The measles vaccine is 97 per cent effective after two doses, according to the CDC.

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Gifting Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Singapore People Living Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Style & Beauty People Dining Dining Dining Singapore Travel Singapore Singapore Entertainment Entertainment He died earlier this week after a year-long battle with brain cancer, his representative said Friday (May 9). Director James Foley at a photocall for the world premiere of Fifty Shades Freed in Paris on Feb 6, 2018. (Photo: AP/Francois Mori) James Foley, a journeyman director best known for \"Glengarry Glen Ross,\" has died. He was 71. He died earlier this week after a yearlong battle with brain cancer, his representative, Taylor Lomax, said Friday (May 9). In his long and varied career, Foley directed Madonna music videos, 12 episodes of House of Cards and the two Fifty Shades of Grey sequels, but it was his 1992 adaptation of David Mamet's foulmouthed Pulitzer Prize winning play that stood above the rest. Although it wasn't a hit at the time, \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" wormed its way into the culture and grew into an oft-quoted cult favorite, especially Alec Baldwin's made-for-the-film \"always be closing\" monologue. Critic Tim Grierson wrote 20 years after its release that it remains \"one of the quintessential modern movies about masculinity.\" He added, \"while there are many fine Mamet movies, it's interesting that the best of them was this one – the one he didn't direct.\" Born on Dec 28, 1953, in Brooklyn, Foley studied film in graduate school at the University of Southern California. Legend has it that Hal Ashby once wandered into a film school party where his short happened to be playing at the time and he took a liking to him. Foley would later attribute his ability to make his first feature, Reckless, a 1984 romantic drama about mismatched teenagers in love starring Daryl Hannah, Aidan Quinn and Adam Baldwin, to the Ashby stamp of approval. It was also the first screenplay credited to Chris Columbus, though there were reports of creative differences. He followed it with the Sean Penn crime drama At Close Range, the Madonna and Griffin Dunne screwball comedy Who's That Girl and the neo-noir thriller After Dark, My Sweet, with Jason Patric. Critic Roger Ebert included After Dark, My Sweet in his great movies list, calling it \"one of the purest and most uncompromising of modern film noir\" despite having been \"almost forgotten.\" He also directed several music videos for Madonna including Papa Don't Preach, Live to Tell, and Who's That Girl, and an episode of Twin Peaks. Foley adapted John Grisham and worked with Gene Hackman on The Chamber and made the Reese Witherspoon and Mark Wahlberg teenage love-gone-scary thriller Fear, as well as the largely derided Halle Berry and Bruce Willis psychological thriller Perfect Stranger, which was released in 2007. It would be a decade before his next film was released, when he was given the reigns to the Fifty Shades of Grey sequels, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed. \"For me, what's most challenging is stuff that doesn't involve the actors, oddly enough – in three, there's a big car chase and there's different stunts and stuff and that stuff really bores me,\" he told The Associated Press at the UK premiere of Fifty Shades Darker. \"So when the actors aren't around, that's difficult because the actors give me so much energy and kind of engagement and a car driving by doesn't do the same thing.\" Foley was not an easily definable director, but that was by design. In 2017, he told The Hollywood Reporter that he had no interest in repeating himself. \"I've always just followed my nose, for better or for worse, sometimes for worse,\" Foley said. \"What's best and what's worst (about the industry) are almost the same to me. What's worst is you get pigeonholed and what's best is I haven't been. It means that I'm still making movies, despite hopping all over the place.\" Foley is survived by his brother, Kevin Foley, and sisters Eileen and Jo Ann. Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "title": "How Ken Koh revived his ailing family business in Singapore to produce the ‘Rolls-Royce’ of soya sauce",
    "article_text": "Dining Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living People People The third-generation owner of Nanyang Sauce is setting up shop in Bhutan — while branching into wellness and biotech. Ken Koh is the third-generation owner of Nanyang Sauce. (Photo: Kelvin Chia/CNA) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Entrepreneurs have been known to trumpet bold claims, and third-generation soya sauce maker Ken Koh ofNanyang Sauceis no exception. He professes to sit on the “vat of youth,” frothing gently with soya beans that are fermented the traditional way, laced with koji mould. The latter, he posited, contains properties that may reverse ageing and — if you'll suspend your disbelief — possibly kill cancer cells. Never mind that such assertions may bear whiffs of snake oil sales spiel; Koh has skin in the game. He’s stumped up resources to launch a fermented skincare line, as well as a new age pharmaceutical firm that inked a research collaboration agreement with National Cancer Centre Singapore to explore the cancer therapeutic potential of mycobiota fermentation. While the 41-year-old demurs on the scientific details, he says ongoing research is promising, prompting a recent trip to Dubai to bankroll his venture. Admittedly, it may seem out of left field. “Never in a gazillion years would I have imagined that I’d move in this direction,” he mused. “I wanted to tell the world about Nanyang Sauce and sell as much sauce as I could, to turn our family business around and keep it going for the next generation,” said the entrepreneur, who began to delve into the beauty and wellness space after being approached by an A*STAR researcher requesting to study the properties of his soya beans. Two years ago, he launchedwellness-inspired private dining company Nanyang Chef,which features dishes starring ingredients sourced from Bhutan and Borneo. While he credits those pursuits with the pithy slogan, “the secret is in the sauce,” there was a time where Nanyang Sauce's branding was more soya than sizzle. By the time Koh joined his family business — hitherto run by his mother and uncles — they were beset by debt and circling the proverbial drain. He traces the company's decline to 1996, when his grandfather and Nanyang Sauce’s founder, Tan Tiong How, passed away at the age of 70 after suffering a heart attack. “He was working so hard, always the first in the factory and the last to leave,” he said. “He did not plan for succession, as it was considered inauspicious. That’s why I wrote my will in my 20s.” In a way, the family’s fortune has waxed and waned with Singapore’s shifting tides. Tan, who came from a line of soya sauce makers from China’s Fujian Province, fled the Sino-Japanese war for Singapore in 1942 — carrying a jar of koji and the desire to claw out a better future. He eked out a hardscrabble existence as a coolie and brewed his own soya sauce to flavour his meagre porridge meals. Friends developed a taste for Tan’s umami-rich brews, so he eventually began peddling it out of a tricycle. This bare-bones outfit built on elbow grease creaked and clattered its way into a kampung factory in 1959. While they relocated several times over the decades, the family has hewed to their painstaking method of fermenting hand-brewed soya sauce under the sun for months, stubbornly eschewing mass-market machine production at their own mounting costs. This was before the term “artisanal” was flashed like a badge of honour by chefs and soap-makers alike. “People are now starting to appreciate old school, real food again, but the 1990s and early 2000s were all about cheaper, processed food and air-conditioned hypermarkets like Carrefour,” recounted Koh. The patriarch’s sudden passing during that super-sized milieu marked a nadir for the business. “He was the one making the deals with thezha huo dian(sundry shops) and minimarts, and people respected him. When he left, there was really no one to fill his shoes,” recalled Koh. He witnessed his family suffer the financial repercussions of its low-key, handshake economy approach, which ultimately precluded their products from supermarket shelves. “I grew up feeling like it was all so such a pity. When my grandfather was running the business, we could afford to give away gold pendants in lucky draws and all this stopped because there was no clear succession plan,” he reflected. As a child, Koh played hide-and-seek among clay kilns steeped in the earthy aroma of fermenting soya sauce. He was something of a right-hand man for his grandfather, who entrusted him with counting spare change and tracking stock prices on the flickering Teletex screen. “He would say, 'Call me if the numbers turn green. If they go white, which means losses, call me faster,’” he recounted. That was Koh's introduction to entrepreneurship. By the age of 11, he was a young fly on the wall at board meetings — and one such conclave remains etched in his memory. A group of consultants had proposed a quicker, cheaper way to produce commercial soya sauce using chemicals. Visibly rankled, the formidable founder rose from his seat and pointed at his wide-eyed grandson. “He shouted in Hokkien, ‘If I don’t dare to feed this to my grandson, how can I feed the rest of Singapore?',” he recalled. The episode endured as a lesson in conviction and authenticity.  “He was not willing to shortchange his customers and stuck to those values,” said Koh. Those anecdotes imply that he was, for all intents and purposes, groomed to succeed his grandfather — so why till his 30s to claim the mantle? According to Koh, his mother and uncles emphatically discouraged him from joining the business, out of good intentions. “No parent wants their child to walk the hard path,” he reasoned. Yet, family members cannot deny that echoes of Nanyang Sauce’s headstrong founder resonate in Koh. As an 18-year-old buzzing with moxy, he shrugged off failure after unsuccessfully pitching for funding at a Singapore Management University business plan competition, and bootstrapped his corporate training company with just S$2,000. The cock-sure youth secured his first contract within a year, and built a venture that continues to thrive to this day. “Before other people believe in you, you must first believe in yourself,” declared Koh, who lent that training as a dragon boater helped mould his self-confidence. In 2017, he channelled that obdurate spirit into a bold proposition for his elders: Let him staunch the bleeding of their beleaguered business. He’d start by hiking the price of a bottle of soy sauce to S$10. This was one leap too far for his incredulous predecessors. “Their jaws dropped. ‘Kikkoman sells a bottle of their soya sauce for S$6, what makes you think you can do that?’,” he recounted. But this wasn't the flight of fancy dreamt up by a greenhorn. He’d visited enough soya sauce factories across the region to know that they were singular in brewing their soya sauce the “traditional, kung-fu way”— instead of boosting production through chemical hydrolysation. Pricing it at market rate was no longer sustainable. To allay his uncle’s and mother’s fears that he’d make a muck of their decades-old business, he set up a separate entity — one that sold their surplus, aged soya sauce. “I named it Nanyang Sauce, as they were using the Golden Swan label. Not all of our forefathers were literate, so many brands used logos of animals that could be easily recognised,” he explained. But that was just the tip of his branding overhaul. Koh then leased a clapped out old shophouse at East Coast Road and transformed it into an experiential space where customers discovered his products through workshops and savoured his soya sauce chicken. Slowly, he cultivated a loyal following of chefs and food connoisseurs with a penchant for the sauce’s richly flavoured, moreish notes. The momentum eventually landed his products on the shelves of FairPrice Finest and Cold Storage. Besides those premium supermarkets, Nanyang Sauce products are now also sold on Redmart, Shopee, as well as overseas in Indonesia and Malaysia. Along the way, the separate businesses merged, but not without friction between him and the second-generation. “We are in a harmonious situation now, but it wasn't always this way,” he shared. “I changed a lot of things they weren’t used to. For instance, we never had an automated invoicing system, and relied on hand-written invoices that simply stated Ah Tan or Ah Chai,” he said ruefully. Having propelled the business into the digital age, Koh revealed that every drop of soya sauce they produce is spoken for, with the brewery now running at full tilt. It bears testament to his marketing savvy in distilling a fine brew from what was once a fusty old outfit. At the same time, his mother’s tireless dedication to the craft of soya sauce brewing was vindicated when she was conferred the Stewards of Intangible Cultural Heritage award by the National Heritage Board in 2021. But success, as they know, is a perishable brew. While their lease is up for renewal this year, they’re all teed up to open a production facility in Bhutan, where they source organic, non-GMO soya beans and pristine glacial water for their bespoke vats. Priced at an eye-watering S$10,000 each, these are in high demand, according to Koh. The remote Himalayan kingdom holds a special place in his heart. For one, he’s convinced that people there — who are the “nicest, gentlest and happiest you can find”— are naturally inclined to brew soya sauce par excellence, thanks to the positive energy they radiate. He dubs it ‘the Rolls-Royce of soy sauce’ — a nod to his 1984 Silver Spirit, which he regards less as an accoutrement of success and more as a sentimental treasure. “I want to build Nanyang Sauce like how they build a Rolls-Royce, from their dedication to handicraft, to the materials they use,” he concluded.

The strikes came after Pakistan said India fired missiles at three airbases inside Pakistan, including one on the outskirts of the capital, as the conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours spiralled toward full-blown war. According to state-run Pakistan Television, retaliatory attacks were underway targeting “multiple locations in India”. The government has named its new retaliatory operation against India \"Bunyan-un-Marsoos\". Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the name means “a wall fortified with lead”.

Pakistan's military said the prime minister had called a meeting of the National Command Authority, a top body of civilian and military officials, which oversees decisions on its nuclear arsenal. The South Asian countries have exchanged fire since Wednesday, whenIndia launched air strikes on what it called \"terrorist\" sites in Pakistani territoryafter adeadly attack on tourists on the Indian side of the divided Kashmir region. The clashes - which have involved missiles, drones, and exchanges of fire along the de-facto border in disputed Kashmir - are the worst in decades and have killed more than 50 civilians. Military spokesman Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, in a live broadcast aired by state television in the middle of the night, said India had \"attacked with missiles\" targeting three air bases. He said a \"majority of the missiles\" had been intercepted and \"no flying assets\" had been damaged. One of the bases targeted, Nur Khan air base in Rawalpindi, the garrison city where the army is headquartered, is around 10km from the capital Islamabad. Several blasts were heard from the capital overnight. The air base is used to receive foreign dignitaries and Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs Adel Al-Jubeir had departed just hours earlier. “This is a provocation of the highest order,” Chaudhry said. \"Now you just wait for our response,\" he warned India. The fighting comes two weeks after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for backing an attack on the Indian-run side of disputed Kashmir that killed 26 tourists, mostly Hindu men. India blamed the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba - a UN-designated terrorist organisation - for the attack but Pakistan has denied any involvement and called for an independent probe. The countries have fought several wars over the Muslim-majority Kashmir, which both claim in full but administer separate portions of since gaining independence from British rule in 1947. Previous clashes have been mostly limited to the Kashmir region, separated by a heavily militarised border known as the Line of Control, but this time India has struck multiple cities deep in Pakistan. Pakistan's foreign ministry alleged New Delhi's \"reckless conduct has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict\". Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met top security officials on Friday, including his national security advisor, defence minister and the chiefs of the armed forces, his office said. Most of the more than 50 deaths were in Pakistan during Wednesday's first air strikes by India, and included children. On Friday, the Indian army said it had \"repulsed\" waves of Pakistani attacks using drones and other munitions overnight, and gave a \"befitting reply\". Pakistan's military spokesman denied that Islamabad was carrying out such attacks, and vowed revenge for the initial Indian strikes. Pakistani military sources said its forces had shot down 77 in the last two days, with debris of many incursions seen by AFP in cities across the country. An Indian army spokeswoman on Friday spoke of \"300 to 400\" Pakistani drones, but it was impossible to verify that claim independently. Pakistan has accused India of fabricating the drone strikes, and early Saturday, its military claimed Delhi's forces had bombed their own territory in Amritsar, without providing evidence.

    "title": "Some people are just difficult. Here are 6 books on how to handle them",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Gifting Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Singapore People Living Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Style & Beauty People Dining Dining Dining Singapore Travel Singapore Singapore Wellness Wellness These books can help ease tensions. (Art: The New York Times/Monica Garwood) Earlier in my career, I worked for a hot-tempered woman who, according to an office rumour, had thrown a shoe at one of my predecessors. Rattled by her blowups, I tiptoed and stammered around her, fearing the day when she’d wing a pump at me. Then a friend passed along Coping With Difficult Bosses by Robert M Bramson, which was published in 1992. The book’s solid, seen-it-all advice helped me stop perseverating and find my spine. I learned from Dr Bramson to stand tall when my boss exploded, to call her by her name (to humanise the relationship) and, if I couldn’t quite look her in the eye, to focus on her forehead–close enough that she couldn’t tell the difference. If you’re struggling with a difficult colleague, family member or friend, books can validate your experience and teach you helpful communication skills, said William Doherty, a professor emeritus of family social science at the University of Minnesota and a co-founder of Braver Angels, a nonpartisan nonprofit that facilitates conversations between people with differing political views. But, he added, be wary of books that give you “one large global theory” about whatever is wrong with the other person. Most relationship problems are caused by both parties, at least to some degree, he said, so books that encourage you to consider your part are generally more helpful. We asked therapists, psychologists and other workplace experts to recommend books that can help you get along with difficult people–or at least disagree with them more constructively. Here are six titles that rose to the top of the list. 1. HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE (DALE CARNEGIE) In this classic advice book, originally published in 1936, Carnegie, a pork salesman turned public-speaking sensation, draws on his experience and the experiences of others to explore ways to ease tension “when personal problems become overwhelming.” He also details effective strategies for getting people to stop noxious, bullheaded behavior, including by admitting your own mistakes first so they are more receptive to your feedback. Jonathan Haidt, a professor of social psychology at NYU’s Stern School of Business and the author of The Anxious Generation, said in an email that he assigns Carnegie’s book to his students and has found it helpful personally. “It taught me to avoid arguments and instead listen, learn, take the other person’s perspective and then, if warranted, persuade skillfully,” he said. 2. WHY WON'T YOU APOLOGIZE? (HARRIET LERNER) This 2017 title from Dr Lerner, a psychotherapist and best-selling author, offers a framework for understanding how skillful, sincere apologies can repair even profound rifts in relationships. It also delves into why some people overapologise, while others can’t say “I’m sorry” without a blame-reversing rider that only makes the injured party feel worse. Calling it “the best self-help book” he’d ever read, Dr Doherty recommended it because of the generous, detailed way Dr Lerner describes the intricate back-and-forth dance between the offended and the offender, normalising familiar problems with apologies so we can understand and potentially improve them. 3. THE ASSHOLE SURVIVAL GUIDE (ROBERT I SUTTON) In this 2017 follow-up to his organizational-psychology bestseller The No Asshole Rule, Dr Sutton writes that he thought the topic “would be a brief side trip.” But the thousands of requests for advice that he received after the book came out persuaded him to stay on the beat. The resulting guide is packed with tips and strategies for dealing with demeaning and disrespectful people, including by using humour to save your sanity and carefully documenting evidence of workplace harassment to give yourself leverage if you decide to go to human resources. Adam Grant, an organisational psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business and a contributing Opinion writer at The New York Times, said in an email that he has recommended the book to more people than he can count, calling it “an impressively evidence-based, surprisingly actionable read on how to deal with abusive bosses, difficult colleagues and toxic customers.” 4. THE DEFINING DECADE (MEG JAY) Daphne de Marneffe, a clinical psychotherapist in the San Francisco Bay Area and author of The Rough Patch, said in an email that this book, first published in 2012, about navigating one’s 20s had really stuck with her. Dr Jay, drawing on research on brains and human development, argues that our 20s are a potentially future-defining decade. When young adults, who are more likely than older adults to feel walloped by criticism, decide to bail out on difficult situations with difficult people–including cranky, faultfinding bosses–they miss out on valuable opportunities to learn how to calm themselves and develop confidence. While Dr Jay’s point about the benefits of gaining enough mettle to withstand jerks at work (or wherever they crop up) may be particularly helpful to young adults, “I think it’s applicable to all ages,” Dr de Marneffe said. 5. DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS (DOUGLAS STONE, BRUCE PATTON, SHEILA HEEN) This international bestseller, first published in 1999, dives below the surface of personal and professional disagreements to show how quickly they breed distrust and negative assumptions about the people with whom we disagree. “This was one of the first books I read on how to have difficult conversations, and I find myself going back to it again and again with clients,” Elizabeth Earnshaw, a licensed marriage and family therapist based in Philadelphia and the author of the book ’Til Stress Do Us Part, said in an email. Among its “clear and actionable suggestions,” the book outlines a process for both parties to “own their part” in creating the problem in the relationship, Earnshaw said. The first person to admit any wrongdoing is “ modelling to the other person that it is safe for them to express their own contribution, too,” she explained. 6. THE ART OF POSSIBILITY (ROSAMUND STONE ZANDER, BENJAMIN ZANDER) First published in 2000, this is an eclectic book of practices for achieving personal and professional fulfillment. Filled with stories that underscore the high costs of leaping to conclusions and labelling other people as dangerous or difficult, it shows readers how, with a shift in perspective or adjustment toward generosity, they can improve challenging relationships and live happier lives. “Without a doubt, we’ve got more than a few ‘difficult’ people in the world,” Seth Godin, a marketing expert and author of This Is Strategy, said in an email. “But often, the most productive way forward is to realisethat they have a hard-earned self-talk that’s driving their behavior. Just as each of us do,” Godin said. “The Art Of Possibility is the best book I know about empathy,” he added.

    "title": "How hard do you have to push yourself to get stronger?",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Gifting Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Singapore People Living Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Style & Beauty People Dining Dining Dining Singapore Travel Singapore Singapore Wellness Wellness Here’s how to find the right effort level for a strength workout. (Art: The New York Times/Angie Wang) You’re sweaty and sore, and just hoisting your gym bag onto your shoulder makes you groan. The workout was exhausting, but was it effective? Many trainers and athletes have long believed that lifting to failure–the moment when you can’t complete another repetition of an exercise–is the best way to build muscle. Butrecentresearchhas challenged that idea, suggesting that training at a slightly lower intensity can produce similar results. “The question I ask people is: ‘Are we getting better or are we getting tired?’” said David Frost, an associate professor in the kinesiology department at the University of Toronto. If you’re new to lifting, it can be tough to know how hard your workout should feel. Learning what failure feels like–and understanding when you should push that far–can help you build a sustainable strength training routine and allow you to safely progress as you get stronger. There are two types of failure in strength training. “Technical failure” is when you can’t do another repetition with proper form and control, so you may have to rely on other muscles and joints to lift the weight. “Muscular failure” happens when your muscles are so fatigued that you can’t lift the weight at all. While you can build muscle mass by training to failure, some experts say the risks may outweigh the benefits. “If you push yourself to failure and damage your muscles to a very extreme degree in a single workout, that’s going to impair what you can do the next day and the next day,” Frost said. Pushing yourself to lift with poor form can also increase your risk of injury. What matters more is that you’reworking hardeach time you step into the gym. Challenging your muscles creates micro-damage in the tissue, which is what makes them change. When you rest, that tissue repairs, grows and gets stronger. “You don’t need to necessarily be pushing to failure, but a high level of effort is required over time,” said Brad Schoenfeld, a professor in the exercise science programme at Lehman College in New York who studies how different methods of resistance training affect muscle growth. When you’re starting out with strength training, perform new exercises with just your body weight first so you can learn proper form, said Elizabeth Davies, a strength coach in Kent, England, who works primarily with women who are relatively new to lifting. Once you’re ready to add weight, start by picking up a weight that feels light to you. Focus on moving with good form rather than trying to do as many repetitions as possible. You can use what’s known as theReps in Reserve, or RIR, scale to find out how much weight you can handle for a full set. When you perform an exercise, estimate how many more times you could lift the weight–your “reps in reserve”–before feeling maxed out. You want to choose a weight where at the end of your set, you feel like you have a few repetitions left in the tank. The RIR method lets you adjust your workouts for how you feel–which can vary based on everything from sleep and diet to hormonal changes and stress–rather than sticking to a set amount of weight. As a new lifter, your muscle tissue will generallyadaptquickly to training, so you can stop when you feel like you have five or six repetitions in reserve and still see progress, Davies said. As you get stronger, research suggests thatstopping two or three repetitions before failurecan be ideal for maximising muscle growth. Once you’re able to complete the same number of repetitions in a given set for two or three weeks in a row, add a bit more weight and see how that changes your sense of effort, Frost suggested. When you’re familiar with an exercise and can practise it consistently with good form, it can be worthwhile to occasionally train to failure to refine your sense of how hard you need to work. After all, “if you don’t train to failure, you don’t know how far away from failure you are,” Dr Schoenfeld said. When your body is pushed beyond its limits, it will also try to adapt to meet that challenge more easily next time, Dr Schoenfeld said. If you really enjoy the feeling of hitting your maximum effort, failure can have an occasional place in your workouts. Davies gives her clients that opportunity on single-joint moves like bicep curls that won’t leave them too exhausted and hinder their progress, she said. The key to getting the most out of strength training is stacking up hard work over time, Frost said. On most days, that means aiming to push yourself a little bit more than you did the day before.

    "title": "We checked out Singapore’s new stylish bathhouse at Dempsey that’s designed for doing nothing",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Gifting Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Singapore People Living Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Style & Beauty People Dining Dining Dining Singapore Travel Singapore Singapore Wellness Wellness The newly opened Nowhere Baths at Dempsey is a dreamy new communal bathhouse that’s an antidote for modern life. Bathers enjoy a conversation in the Cloud Bath, a nanobubble pool, with a view of the garden. (Photo: Khoo Guo Jie) This audio is generated by an AI tool. The rain begins to fall in slow, silvery threads. In the distance, a lone red junglefowl darts for cover. Around me, the bathers fall into a hush, as we watch the dense wall of greenery blur behind wide windows. I start to notice the small things: The silky warmth of water enfolding my body, the layered soundscape of drizzle and sonic beats. The storm outside lulls me into a kind of limbo, and my mind quiets. I feel cocooned in a forested mountain hideaway. Except that I’m in the heart of Dempsey at Nowhere Baths, a contemporary bathhouse designed to bring back the ancient, communal pleasure of bathing. Opened on Apr 18, Nowhere Baths is the brainchild of Derrick Foo, 37, and Sarah Chan, 34. The couple are the same duo behind Palm Avenue Float Club, Singapore’s pioneering floatation therapy centre opened in 2014, and Altered States, a now-shuttered wellness and movement space in Kampong Bahru. Nowhere is their newest vision yet – a sanctuary to “soak, sweat and steam, dream, and simply be.” Growing up in Singapore, communal bathhouses were hardly part of the cultural norm. The turning point came in 2017, when Foo had a profound bathing experience while attending a silent meditation retreat in Japan. The only place to wash was a communal onsen. \"I didn’t realise it then, but soaking in silence, resting my aching knees after long hours of sitting, changed my perception of what it meant to bathe,\" Foo said. Back in Singapore, they began visiting Yunomori Spa and Onsen monthly, each time emerging more re-energised. It sparked a deeper curiosity: and they dove into bath-related literature, such as Undesigning The Bath, Leonard Koren’s philosophical treatise on bathing spaces. Throughout history, bathing for pleasure is an ancient ritual tied to health, spirit, and enjoyment. For instance, wherever the Romans conquered, they built bathhouses that became integral to daily social, cultural, and political life. “So much of modern wellness focuses on results, biohacking, and performance recovery,” added Chan. “But what about pleasure? What about stillness? We wanted to bring it back to basics – bathing as an experience. A space to awaken the body, rest the mind, and reconnect with yourself and with others.” A post shared by Charmaine Seah-Ong (@eleventhour) Having decided to close Altered States, they also felt a deep, personal need to evolve themselves, the business, and “to follow what truly excited them.” The pair travelled to Finland, Taiwan, and Japan to study global bath cultures, and noticed a recurring theme: bathing was always intertwined with nature. In Singapore, such nature-based bathing experiences are rare, or tucked away in exclusive luxury hotels. They scouted several locations, from Mount Sophia to Gillman Barracks, before finally settling on Dempsey. The journey wasn’t easy – it took over a year to build Nowhere Baths. There were no accurate records of the site, and it lacked proper sanitation. They consulted local experts and even brought in a holistic consultant, who used sacred geometry to help design a space that would feel balanced and healing. The journey to Nowhere Baths already invites a slowdown. Driving out of the city’s bustle into the leafy calm of Dempsey sets the tone. I arrive on a soft-launch Saturday evening, where a two-hour pass goes for S$55. The bathhouse team welcomes me warmly. Architect Pan Yi Cheng, co-founder of design studio Produce, envisioned the space as a continuous, unfolding journey – one that moves through both space and shifting atmospheres of temperature, humidity, and sensory environments. With curved forms, cave-like alcoves, and organic transitions, the space conjures up images of Ottoman-era hammams. The spherical structures and flowing lines are meant to “caress” the body, creating a sensuous, immersive experience. The atmospheric palette – earthy, subdued tones, sandy hues, and warm terracotta – are a gentle canvas to the rich vibrant, green of the surrounding forest.  Inside, mirrors shaped like mirages and curved walkways add a sense of mystery. Guests experience a range of spaces designed for rest and recovery: Two hot pools (one infused with Epsom salt, another with calming nanobubbles), a dry sauna of steady heat, a steam room, and an invigorating cold plunge. A post shared by Tracy Phillips (@tracyjoyphillips) The bathhouse’s thin-edged windows frame the dramatic greenery outside, designed to blur the line between inside and out. “Unlike the more predictable and picturesque mountain or seaside contexts of Japanese, Nordic or Mediterranean, this site was raw – lush, humid, layered, and pulsed with the essence of the tropics; unpredictable, immersive, and rich in biodiversity. And it was exactly this unfiltered vitality that inspired our approach,” said Pan. The botanical landscaping by Pudica features tropical plants native to Dempsey Hill’s secondary forest – ferns, philodendrons, palms, and understorey foliage – that thrive in the humid, dappled light within the bathhouse. The plants are placed with natural spontaneity: some nestled into crevices, others elevated on ledges, and some appear precariously balanced in pots, evoking nature’s quiet reclamation of man-made space. This approach mirrors the adaptive reuse of the former military barrack, where the old and new, the natural and constructed, coexist without domination. Nowhere Baths prioritises inclusivity with a gender-neutral space, swimwear required in shared areas, and full wheelchair accessibility, including step-free entry and accessible bathrooms. The founders’ previous experience hosting para-athletes at Palm Avenue informed their vision of a space for all Nowhere Baths is part of a small but growing wave of holistic wellness and bathing experiences in Singapore, joining establishments like Yunomori Onsen and Spa in Kallang, Hideaway in New Bahru, Trapeze Rec Club, and The Ice Bar Club. This resurgence of bathhouses, both locally and globally, reflects a renewed appreciation for traditional cultural practices.Internationally, bathhouses are making a comeback,with places like Othership, Bathhouse and Remedy Place in the United States take the spotlight, the founders point out. While many global bathhouses lean into sleek luxury or sensual appeal, positioning themselves as trendy spots for romance, Nowhere focuses on fostering slowness and stillness. Chan believes people seek mindful connections in these \"new social wellness spaces,\" whether through self-reflection or shared experiences. Inspired by bathhouse cultures that promote mindfulness and spiritual living, Nowhere’s founders want to foster that in Singapore too.  “Bathing teaches you how to be present with others in a thoughtful way,” Foo said. By respecting the sacredness of the space, you care for yourself and those around you.” Two hours slip by, and I reluctantly peel myself from the bath, sinking into the lounge with a cup of hot ginger tea. Soft music hums in the background, and the space feels like someone’s thoughtfully designed living room. My body feels light and restored, grounded by the warm timber underfoot. It’s a slow return to myself. Outside, rain lashes the roof in a steady rhythm. The cold fogs up the windows, conjuring images of winter. We’re momentarily trapped, but no one’s in a hurry to rejoin the mad hullabaloo of the outside world. Around me, others sit in silence, mellowed, simply being. It brings to mind a favourite reference by the team at Nowhere Baths. In artist Leonard Koren’s words: “A vacation that consists of standing still… the utterly simple alchemy that turns us back into ourselves.” For this brief moment, we are all nowhere, and perfectly so.

For Southeast Asia, it must be a deal that does not create more collateral damage, better still a deal that does notforce countries to walk a tightropebetween the two strategic rivals. Southeast Asia worries about becoming thedumping ground for excess Chinese goods, about being forced to cough up exorbitant tariff fees to continue exporting to America, and the expectation to impose trade or investment restrictions on China. It’s really all about China. American officials are brutally frank when it comes to Southeast Asia. They don’t hide their disinterest in the region. The Trump 2.0 administration is focused on righting the “wrongs” of trade imbalances between the US and its trading partners. For now, it is less concerned about Washington’s strategic approach to Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific. Any ounce of interest comes in the form of lamenting the region’s sanguine approach to China, when Washington is keen to line up a defensive perimeter around China. Yet it does not appear that Mr Trump has formed a coherent China strategy, apart from what is effectively a trade embargo on China and using tariffs to exert pressure on everyone else to limit their relationship with Beijing. In the interim, it appears that the US’ lazy default on Taiwan and the South China Sea will be implicit deterrence. One think tank analyst reminded us of his favourite Trump quote about his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping: “I wouldn't have to (use military force), because he respects me and he knows I'm f****** crazy,”. But Washington cannot have a coherent China strategy if it does not have at least some Southeast Asian cooperation or acquiescence. The Indo-Pacific is the world’s new centre of gravity, and Southeast Asia lies at its core. The region’s economy will eventually reach US$4.5 trillion to become the world’s fourth biggest economy come 2030, overtaking economic powerhouses like Japan and Germany. With ASEAN and its related entities such as the East Asia Summit in its diplomatic toolkit, the grouping exercises some form of convening power among the major powers. Southeast Asia alsosees the US as a way to balance China, as suggested in the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute’s 2025 State of Southeast Asia Survey. A significant portion of respondents welcomed Mr Trump’s strongman persona and his ability to stand up to China’s aggression, particularly in the South China Sea, though it should be noted the survey was conducted before “Liberation Day”. The centre cannot hold, however. Speaking at this year's edition of the S Rajaratnam lecture in April, Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong underscored how the post-World War IIrules-based international order was fraying, given that the US is retreating from its traditional role as the guarantor of global order and no country is able to fill the void. A changed global order does not mean that Southeast Asian countries have no agency. The region is not without ammunition in the ongoing trade war between China and the US. Courting trading partners who are looking for alternatives in the face of US tariffs is one. ASEAN may be a distinctive group of 10 economies but it has spun a complex web of bilateral and regional free trade agreements (FTAs) together as a collective grouping. These include the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world’s largest FTA comprising 30 per cent of the world’s total GDP and population. Four ASEAN countries are also part of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the precursor of which was abandoned by the first Trump Administration. ASEAN’s proposed Digital Economic Framework Agreement, the world’s first regional digital economic trade agreement, could be another game changer in the burgeoning digital services trade. Despite on-off talks of an FTA with ASEAN, the EU has held back due to reservations about ASEAN’s ability to harmonise and meet up to stringent EU trade, environment and human rights rules. The perfect cannot be the enemy of good. It would be timely for the two blocs to revive and accelerate these talks. The EU also needs to consider if joining the RCEP and CPTPP could help to bolster its own trade resilience and strengthen its equally precarious trade position vis-a-vis the US. Similarly, an expansion of the CPTPP – which Indonesia, China, Taiwan, Costa Rica, Uruguay and Ecuador have applied to join –  would serve to extend and strengthen trade linkages between Asia, Latin America and Europe. The real cherry on the cake will be getting India to join the club. It is the fifth-largest economy by gross domestic product and soon-to-be the world’s third-largest consumer economy, and its young demographic dividend is alluring. Getting India to enter more trade pacts has been difficult. But on May 6, it struck a mega deal with the United Kingdom which may be indicative that India is open to trade agreements in this volatile geoeconomic environment. On the security front, regional countries are not holding their breath either. If Mr Trump can settle tariff negotiations with Southeast Asian countries, a proper approach would be to use the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” strategy to get US allies and partners to uphold principles, such as freedom and navigation and no recourse to the use of force, as an implicit deterrent on China. For now, Trump 2.0 appears to be heading in the right direction. In his first meeting with Quad leaders in January, Secretary of State Marco Rubio upheld this strategy. In his inaugural tour of Japan and the Philippines in March, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth stressed that America First does not mean America Alone. But such a traditional US approach to regional security cannot be assured. The fear is that the US will shake down its allies and partners to carry more of the defence burden as the US cuts back on its forward-deployed posture. No wonder, there is talk about Southeast Asian countries deepening security cooperation with Quad countries sans the US, and revived debates about South Korea and Japan breaking the taboo on nuclear weapons. As the US-led world order frays in a multipolar one, Southeast Asian countries still retain agency to chart their own paths.William Choong is a Senior Fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, and the Managing Editor ofFulcrum, the institute’s commentary and analysis website on Southeast Asia.

    "title": "Harry Styles Wore a Cult-Favorite Cap to (Reportedly) Witness Leo XIV Become Pope",
    "article_text": "All eyes were onVatican Cityyesterday as the papal conclave elected Robert Francis Prevost, an American-born cardinal, as the new leader of the Catholic Church. On the ground in St. Peter’s Square, tens of thousands gathered as the affirmative white smoke swirled into the sky. And among the crowds who witnessed Pope Leo XIV’s ascendancy in real time was, reportedly, the English pop star Harry Styles. Not long after the news broke on Thursday afternoon, a fan claiming to have spotted the musician in the throng outside of the Sistine Chapel shared a candid photo ofStyleson X. In the photo, which quicklymade the rounds online, Styles looked understated—if still very much recognizable—in a blue collared jacket, which could be the same one by The Rowhe wore last monthin London, and a pair of dark sunglasses by the luxury eyewear brand Jacques Marie Mage, a brandhe has wornin the past. His most conspicuous accessory, however, was a gray baseball cap embroidered with the phrase “Techno Is My Boyfriend.” Valentino creative director Alessandro Michele—a longtime friend of Harry Styles’s—wore his “Techno Is My Boyfriend” cap to a film screening in Rome in October 2024. The cap is produced by Idea, an art bookshop in London that also sells novelty slogan hats, and boasts other famous wearers including the Spanish musicianRosalía. Funnily enough, I myself saw this particular hat in person last week when I crossed paths with designer Alessandro Michele, who wore it toColman Domingo’s Met Gala outfit fittingat the Valentino boutique in Manhattan. Michele, who isa longtime pal of Styles’s, even wore his “Techno Is My Boyfriend” cap in the headshot photo that accompaniedhis formal announcementas Valentino’s creative director last March. “Alessandro wears this and other hats of ours all the time,” Angela Hill, the director of Idea bookshop, toldGQvia email. She also surmised that “he probably lent that cap to Harry as they are good friends.” The hat, whichretailsfor £40, frequently runs out of stock at Idea—even when it’s not being worn by a pop star in the midst of a historical conclave. “We are sold out as it sells so quickly they are hard to hold onto,” said Hill. “We will restock at some point.” Before he reportedly bore witness to dawn of a new papacy, Harry Styles went for a stroll around London last month. Harry Styles has popped up, Carmen Sandiego-style, in metropolises all over the globe in recent months; fans have spotted him biking around London,wearing teeny shortsin Berlin, and running a marathon in Tokyo. Many seemed delighted, if not exactly surprised, by his latest pitstop in Vatican City. “Harry literally your unemployed friend on a random tuesday, marathon in tokyo? he’s there. pope announcement? he’s there,” readone poston X. “He said i’m finna be in the pit for the pope announcement,” wentanother. And on that note: Cue the techno.",

    "title": "16 Best Workout Shoes of 2025 for Every Kind of Athlete",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The best workout shoes can make or break your fitness experience. You can’t saunter into thegymin a pair ofloafersand expect to set a new squat PR. (Though if you do, get it on video.)Workoutshoes provide the proper foundation upon which all of your exercise happens, ensuring you're calm, cool, and collected as you sweat it out. Comfortable yet functional, they’re essential to getting the most out of your workouts, and they make anexcellent giftfor the fitness fanatic in your life. Everyone works out for a different reason, so narrowing down the list can be tricky—that's where we come in. Across 12 different categories, we’ve selected the best workout shoes in the game, so whether you’re a diehard gym rat who never skips leg day, looking to PR in a half marathon, or recently caught the pickleball bug, we’ve got all the top picks you need to paint your athletic masterpiece or find theperfect presentfor the gym rat in your life. Reebok Amazon Material:Mesh upper, grippy outsole Special Features:Lightweight and breathable The Reebok Nano X5 does just about everything and does it well. Just as capable of handling a regular lift as a CrossFit session or even a Barry's class, it’s practically a one-stop shop for all your gym-related needs. Flexible enough for dynamic movement but still stable enough to ground hardcore lifts, these gym shoes do it all with a Goldilocks amount of foam cushion. While it’s not thebestshoe for powerlifting or olympic weightlifting, it gets the job done, and it’s more than well-equipped for accessory movements and the activities that most of us will do in a gym workout—deadlifts, lunges, basically anything dumbbell related—while maintaining a good amount of breathability that keeps it feeling light. Versatility is the name of the game here, and if you’re looking only to getoneshoe for the gym, this is it, hands down, because it just transitions so well from exercise to exercise. If you do any form of working out, here's the shoe you'll need. Hoka Nordstrom Material:Single-layer mesh upper, gum rubber outsole Special Features:Pull tab, a touch of reflective details As we discussedin our best cross-trainers piece, the Kawana’s are versatile shoes that are ready for anything right out of the box. With a stable base, they’re capable of handling weightlifting sessions with ease but are supportive and cushioned enough to hit the tread or the pavement for some cardio, too. These cross-training shoes are particularly great for HIIT workouts or to pop in your travel pack (or wear to the airport) as your go-to shoe while on vacation thanks to the sheer number of activities they’re capable of tackling. Think of them as a veritable Swiss Army Knife in shoe form. Nike Nordstrom Material:Mesh upper, grippy outsole Special Features:Lace lock, extended rubber warp Nike’s Metcon series is a perpetual beast in the gym, and the 9 continues to improve upon the shoe's near perfection. With a stable platform that lends itself to intense lifting sessions while still being good enough for quick sprints, the Metcon (not to be confused with the NikeFreeMetcon, built for cardio) is exceptionally well-suited to tackling functional training and CrossFit activities. They’re great for general lifting, too, as the lace-lock system keeps everything out of the way. Most importantly, your foot feels stable, secure, and in place, with strong durability to match whatever a session throws at you—all without having to throw in some extra insoles in there. NoBull NoBull Material:Mesh upper, rubber outsole Special Features:Herringbone pattern outsole, padded elements, water-repellent upper The NoBull Outwork Edge is perhaps the grippiest option on this list. Thanks to a herringbone-style pattern that allows for intense traction on all kinds of surfaces, these shoes are great for strength training. While some gym rats swear by cheap Converse, they’ll get a kick out of how much more stable they'll feel when they lace up in these. The flat sole ensures constant, even contact with the floor, and they’re almost as comfortable as being barefoot (almost). TYR TYR Material:Mesh heel support, rubber outsole Special Features:anatomical toe box, 21mm heel to toe drop, back heel support Love hittingTom Platz-esque leg days? These L-2 squat shoes (aka weightlifting shoes) from TYR are your best bet—they're the new and improved version of the L-1s, which won aGQFitness Awardlast year. “For the price of a brutal bar tab, you’re looking at a windfall of benefits to your squat and leg development that you wouldn’t get squatting barefoot or in flats,”GQsenior commerce editor Ian Burke saysabout the first iteration. “If you have trouble hitting depth on a squat, have ankle mobility issues, or want to target your quads more by putting them in a more stretched position in the hole, you’ll love squatting in a heel. If you have wide feet or just want a well-made squat shoe trusted by some of the world’s best squatters, you can’t go wrong with these. And anecdotally, squatting in these shoes changed my entire leg day experience—I used to squat barefoot, but when I made the switch to heels, my legs blew up, my numbers rose, and the nagging shin pain I had for years while squatting finally went away.” Vivobarefoot Vivobarefoot Material:Mesh upper, rubber outsole Special Features:PU foam sole Few shoes are as likely to elicit a “What are those!” on the streets as a pair of Vivobarefoots. In the gym? Well, seeing a dude rocking these is a sure sign that this guy's about to get low and break a new PR. The Motus Strengths are about as close to lifting barefoot as possible but with the bells and whistles that'll keep him on his feet when he's lifting overhead. The sole is super responsive so you can get a full-body feel for your movements, and with the high midfoot sidewalls, you can get into cross training during the same lifting sesh. It's grippy, it's stable, and it's a damn great shoe for going beast mode at the gym. Brooks Brooks Material:Mesh upper, rubber outsole Special features:12mm drop, cushioned GQcontributor Tanner Bowden said this of theGhost 16 in his review, “If you're in need of a regular old running shoe, the Ghost is proof that, even in the era of super trainers, excellence doesn't have to mean fancy features.” That’s a bang-on summation of why we love the Ghost 16 as a good running workout shoe. If you’re hitting the tread for a run, the Ghost is extremely well-suited for easy miles, something that can disappear into the background as you put one foot in front of the other. Arc'teryx Arc'teryx Material:Gore-Tex upper, Vibram sole, InFuse midsole Special Features:Gore-Tex, DWR-treatment Leave it to the experts from one of the best outdoor brands in the world to engineer one of the best trail runners, too. The Arc’Teryx Norvan LD 4 GTX is your first and last stop when it comes to hitting the trail thanks to Gore-Tex upper and a textured, 4mm lug pattern Vibram sole that provides the perfect grip for any surface you’ll come across while running. Breathable and supportive, your feet will stay cool without overheating. Everything you could possibly want or need to hit the dirt is here in one striking package, now it’s just up to you to put one foot in front of the other. Mizuno Amazon Material:Mesh upper, foam cushion sole Special Features:Secure eyelet wrap, responsively energetic midsole With Pickleball continuing to dominant courts all over the country, it makes sense to have a dedicated option for those looking to get in some reps. For this recommendation, we spoke with pro pickleball player, poach, and commentatorDaniel Roditi, who loves the Mizuno Wave Exceed Tour 6. “If I can play in them the first day I wear ‘em, then that’s a good sign,” he says of the shoes. The shoes are constructed with a responsive midsole that helps propel you forward for quick movements to get right to where the ball is going. “When I want to move quickly, I like the Exceed,” he adds. “They’re very lightweight, very low profile.” They’re also quite the head-turners, offered in four different colorways, including this electric blue that’s easily our favorite of the bunch. La Sportiva REI Material:Polyester, microfiber, rubber Special Features:Downturn shape for better support Tired of renting shoes every time you go bouldering? La Sportiva is one of the leading brands in climbing shoes and its Katana Laces are at the top of the pack. Eschewing the typical velcro closures for laces, these shoes have a dramatic downturn shape, which helps them perform better on slabs wiggle their way into thin, typically inaccessible cracks. They're shockingly comfortable—or as comfy as one can get with a pair of climbing shoes—and while they might not help you figure out the beta on a V8, you'll at least look like you know what you're doing. Nike Nike Material:Sock-like mesh upper, foam cushion sole Special Features:ZoomX Cushioning, insanely light, very stable We published a morein-depth review of the Vaporfly 3, Nike’s super running shoe, earlier this year, with the TL;DR being that it absolutely lived up to the hype for long-distance runs at high speeds. But the Vaporfly 4? Woo, boy—this is one helluva follow-up, with a lighter, more stable sole that is, however, maybe a bit more narrow than some would prefer. While it’s a bit overkill for simple runs on the treadmill at the gym, it is beneficial if you’re doing speed work on a treadmill or if for some reason, your gym is swanky enough to have an indoor track for some Olympic-level training. Oh, and it just looks cool as hell, especially if you snag a pair in that bright crimson colorway (not exactly minimalist, but they’re sick). Springy and supportive, thanks to its Zoom sole, you’ll feel like you’re flying as you soar through treadmill work with ease because these are truly some of the best running shoes we’ve tried. Kane Kane Material:Sugarcane-derived foam Special Features:Slip-on style, toe-to-heel support How are your feet doing? A little achey? Time to throw on a pair ofrecovery shoes. We're fans of theKane Revives, a pair of airy slip ons that. From raised footbed nodes to support along the heel, arch, and forefront, these shoes offer up every possible detail that can help you spend less time on your ass and more time going back after it (on your feet). The super-supportive soles give you the cushioning you need to just walk around, whether it's bopping in your apartment or heading out for a protein shake. Are these shoes you'd work out in? No, but if you work out, this is a pair of footwear you want in your rotation. Converse SSENSE Chuck Taylors are pretty universally beloved for being a great lifting shoe. Their flat soles make them great for even contact with the ground, and hell, these used to betheshoes for playing basketball. Sure, they've fallen out of favor for some more technical footwear (highlighted above) but if you've just got a pair of Chucks lying around and you want to get a good lift in, well, you could do way worse for way more money. UnderArmour UnderArmour If the Rock is your physique role model, then you might as well look towards the shoe that he's collaborated with Under Armour on. The Project Rock 7 training shoes offer a sock-like fit, with responsive forward-propelling cushioning that's great for HIIT workouts. The grippy sole offers excellent foot-to-ground contact, which'll ensure you stay on your feet during your heaviest lifts. Lululemon Lululemon CanLululemon make a good running shoe? You bet (and we know because we tried them). These offer a superb cushy ride against miles and miles of terrain. It's not a stability shoe, so keep that in mind, but for something that'll keep your dogs feeling comfy during your runs, these are a damn good pair of running shoes. New Balance New Balance Don't let your budget mean you can't get a good workout shoe. These New Balances have super-soft cushioning to protect your feet, while the rubber outsole is durable for all the wear and tear you'll put it through. Plus, these are probably some of the nicer pairs of workout shoes so you can wear them out without alerting everyone that you're a gym bro. Much like any good pair of shoes, how you select a pair is going to boil down to what kind of activity you’re doing. Are you doing lots of static lifts? Then you probably can get away with something that’s a little stiffer because you won’t be moving a lot and don’t need that flexibility. Are you doing HIIT training? You might want something that’s really responsive so your feet aren’t killing you at the end of the day. Are you trail running? You’ll want traction. Once you’ve locked into what it is you’ll be doing, it comes down to some key factors like grip to keep you grounded, support to ensure your lower body isn’t hurting, breathability to fight off blisters, and cushioning. With so many different options on the market, the only way to see how these shoes perform is to, well, test them. We scoured the internet for fitness enthusiasts' opinions on their favorite workout shoes, eventually pairing those selections to a final list of the pairs that appeared the most frequently. From there, we put the shoes through a variety of different activities where comfort and support were among the most important factors, and those guided us in making our final selections.",

    "title": "The Best COS Menswear in 2025 for Budget-Savvy Minimalists",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Leo DaVinci, the original design nerd, supposedly once proclaimed, “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” London-born label COS has taken that alleged declaration to heart for nearly 20 years, mastering affordable, wearable minimalism so effectively that the store lives in its own tier; somewhere between amall brandand a European fashion house. One one hand, COS doggedly delivers a line-up of refined wardrobe staples, from chinos to knits to basics, that stay in our closets for years on end. But the brand's real strength is that it also shows up every season with a crop of pieces that channel the “less is more luxury” style of capital-F fashion labels like The Row, Lemaire, and Yohji Yamamoto—all at prices that don't take a hammer to your budget. Time after time, month after month, COS quietly delivers menswear that punches above its price tag without going into dupe mode. Which is why it stays bookmarked—and why we've decided to pull some of our favorites off its racks. It’s no secret that we love a lightweight jacket at the GQ office, and COS enables our addiction by consistently churning out transitional hits. Tailored bombers, investment leather, and shirt jackets are just scratching the surface. COS COS COS COS COS COS COS COS This is one category where COS has crushed for years. Knitwear makes up a big part of any closet, and COS turns out stellar sweaters, polos, cardigans, and beyond. Nothing flashy, all in colors that'll sync up with your wardrobe as it stands—though the brand will gladly help you venture into new territory with something like a knit blazer, a favorite cardigan’s less expected cousin. COS COS COS COS COS COS COS COS Nowhere do the philosophically Scandinavian vibes of COS show themselves more prominently than its suiting. Hidden buttons closures, relaxed shapes, and hybrid shirt-blazers avoid gimmick, and land in effortlessness. No, the fabrics aren't the finest wools and the construction isn't going to mistaken for Saville Row, but at these prices, you can get geared up for a workwear revamp or summer weddings, plural, without destroying your own out-of-office budget. COS COS COS COS COS COS COS COS COS would like you to know that there are more options than either a canvas tote and a branded work swag backpack. The brand's nylon line went viral basically for delivering Prada cool on a Pepsi budget. It's leather bags also hit the mark, too. And you'll even find a few options that step outside the brand's studied nonchalance, like thisquilted crossbody. COS COS COS COS COS COS COS COS The purest distillation of COS’s minimalism is its shirting. You could build an unshakeable capsule wardrobe foundation out of its classic button-ups and easy oxfords. Lately, though, we've been cashing in on the brand's boxy collared short-sleeves and exaggerated camp collars in a soft washed linen. COS COS COS COS COS COS COS COS",

    "title": "19 Best Conditioner for Men, According to GQ Editors (2025)",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. I would argue that choosing the best conditioner for men—specifically for yourhair type—is more important thanchoosing the right shampoo. Now, that’s not to say the shampoo is any less challenging to identify for your hair type, but conditioner gets the credit for how stylable your hair is and how it holds up from one day to the next. As such, a conditioner's ingredients should be tailored to your hair's needs, including factors like curl texture, strand thickness, overall density, hair loss, dryness, and damage. The best conditioner can make a huge difference (especially in fightingfrizzand fraying) to your hair's overall look. So, after extensive testing of shampoo and conditioner, here are theGQpicks for the best men’s hair conditioner—for each hair type. Sachajuan Sachajuan Key Ingredients:Behentrimonium chloride, argan oil If you're looking to add some moisture to your hair, you can't go wrong with this unreal-smelling conditioner from industry darling Sachajuan. It uses argan oil and a bevy of other ingredients (including something called Ocean Silk Technology, which is a proprietary blend of nutrient-rich algae and marine ingredients) to leave hair healthy, shiny, and under control. We've also reported on Sachajuan products' scents before—noting that they're so good, anyone who shares your shower might steal some—and this bottle is no exception. This stuff smellsgood. Ouai Amazon Key Ingredients:Keratin, biotin, chia seed oil Hair care for naturally fine, thin hair can be tricky. You want to choose something that adds volume or body to the hair, but not something that makes your hair greasy and weighed down. (This is one of the primary distinctions between“thin” hairand “thinning” hair; the latter is not necessarily fine in nature.) Our advice: Look for a conditioner that prioritizes strength and reinforcement, similar to products used in dry or damaged hair—to give fine strands as much muscle as they can get. We recently named Ouai the best shampoo for fine hair, so it's no surprise that its sister product is our top pick in this category once again. We definitely recommend using both of these products together, and they should provide extra height and volume in just a few weeks of regular use. Amazon Key Ingredients:Burdock root, sodium hyaluronate, sunflower seed oil, fermented argan oil For any dry, damaged hair (including color-treated), you need to look for strengthening, restorative formulas—similar to those that you’d use on fine hair. Your biggest threats include breakage, splitting, and frizzing, so get to work reinforcing the strands’ bonds; conditioner should be a product you invest in above all others. I can think of a few products that excel as perfectly as this Olaplex conditioner. It's terrific for all hair types, but it's best for anyone who needs a miracle in a quick couple of minutes. Olaplex's formula fills in all those tiny little broken bonds throughout the strands, resulting in fortified fullness and silky smoothness. Perfection. Davines Amazon Key Ingredients:Olive extract We dedicated an entire article to the topic ofconditioners specifically designed for thick hair, but at its core, what you probably want is something labeledsmoothingandhydratingto ensure that those coarse hairs bend a little in your favor. These conditioners will also prioritize frizz control by shielding the cuticle from the outside elements. By using olive extract (it's also made in Italy using Italian olives), Davines' conditioner deflates frizz and restores healthy buoyancy, hydration, and control to your hair. Combine it with the brand's matchingleave-in conditionerfor a double-down defense against frizzing, fraying, and poofing. Jack Black Amazon Key Ingredients:Tea tree oil, basil leaf extract, vitamin B5, silk protein Do you have as much scalp as hair showing these days? Jack Black's conditioner protects your hair, scalp, and follicles with an assist from tea tree oil and other naturally hydrating ingredients. To support hair that's seen better days, vitamin B5, silk protein, and seaweed extract work together to nourish your strands. Corpus Amazon Key Ingredients:Olive oil, rice protein, hydrolyzed quinoa, squalane, baobab oil When one of our grooming writers was battling eczema and a dry, itchy, damaged scalp, the Cypress Shampoo and Conditionersaved his scalp. It's also one of the best-smelling conditioners on the market today, with notes of vetiver, cypress, and cedar. This vegan, plant-based conditioner uses a gentle formula packed with natural ingredients that fortify your hair, no matter how sensitive. The matchingCypress Shampooalso earned a spot in our guide to thebest men's shampoo, so pick up both for the best results. And if you've got hair so sensitive that you can't handle fragrance of any kind, check out Prose's custom conditioner and opt for the fragrance-free version. Amazon Key Ingredients:Amaranth peptides, marine algae extracts, glycerin, sunflower seed oil The \"Full\" line from Living Proof promises guys volume and texture, and in my testing, it delivers on that front. It adds a lightweight, fibrous fullness to each strand, along with a silky smoothness and shine. This is also one of the rare conditioners that we can recommend for nearly all hair types. So, whether your hair is thick, straight, fine, or wavy, this conditioner provides a fuller look throughout the day to come. That also makes it a smart choice for guys who regularly style their hair. Prose Prose Key Ingredients:Hyaluronic acid, plum oil, fermented rice water, vitamin E, grape seed extract We hear the same question about Prose over and over. Howcustomis it, really? Having walked the Prose factory floor in Brooklyn and tried the products firsthand, I can confirm that Prose takes customization seriously. As just one example, your formula will get extra UV protection based on both the time of year and your ZIP code. There are dozens of possible extracts, vitamins, oils, and botanicals that could be added to your formula depending on your answers to the Prose hair quiz. If you blow dry, you could find a heat protectant like arginine in your formula. For color protection, oat oil. For volume, soy proteins. For city slickers in high-pollution areas, an extra dose of antioxidants from ingredients like sunflower and ivy extract. GQ contributor Timothy Beck Werth recently tested the entire line ofProse hair and skincare products. His conclusion? They definitely live up to the hype, though he said that for men specifically, the shampoo and conditioner will work best for guys with long hair, curly hair, or very specific hair care needs. We also love their fragrances, and that they over unscented versions, too. Geologie Geologie Amazon Key Ingredients:Tea tree oil, aloe vera, squalane, vitamin B5, glycerin, jojoba seed oil, rice protein Normally, we advise guys to steer clear of two-in-one shampoo and conditioners, but Geologie's Co-Wash isn't like any drugstore 2-in-1 you've tried before. This Co-Wash nabbed aGQ Grooming Awardafter its 2022 release, and some of our contributors still use it today. The Cooling version of the Co-Wash is packed with ingredients we love, with proven hydrators like squalane, tea tree to cleanse your scalp, and protein to support your cuticles. The end result is a product that supports your hair from the roots to the tips. A good co-wash is also a good choice for guys with oily hair. It will effectively lift away excess oil, grime, and product buildup without over-stressing your strands. Doing so can even help temper that oil production, by limiting how frequently you parch the skin with shampoo. (Since your scalp responds to dryness with a boost in oil. Less dryness will equate to less oil, in the long haul.) This low-lather product cleanses your scalp and hydrates your hair, and it's amazing how well it works, even when used sparingly. Thanks to tea tree oil, it can even help prevent dandruff and itchiness. Just be sure to follow the instructions instead of using it like a normal shampoo or conditioner. Shea Moisture Amazon Key Ingredients:Mafura oil, manuka honey, fig extract, baobab oil In general, the curlier the curl, the more moisture you need—and continuously so. We recommendsticking with a leave-in conditionerfor all tightly curled and coiled hair, as it provides more nonstop nourishment for texture, shine, and vitality. The best ones will also purport to help detangle hair easily and prevent further knotting. But what about guys who prefer wash-out conditioners? This formula taps a combination of natural ingredients such as mafura oil, manuka honey, fig extract, and baobab oil to restore damaged hair and keep it hydrated over the long term. For best results, leave this conditioner in your hair for at least three minutes while you shower. Amazon Key Ingredients:Glycerin, linseed seed, hydrolyzed quinoa If frizz is ruining your look, then your hair conditioner should prioritizesmoothingandmoisture. Yeah, we see these words a lot in this department, but imagine your hair with a lack of those two words: It’s teased, tousled, dry. Then, picture theBefore & Afterwith hair that is shiny, smooth, and all tamed into place, and you’ll understand why this combination is so important. Evo's formula locks in moisture, thwarts heat and humidity, and delivers a shiny, salon-caliber smoothness to even the most dry, damaged, or color-dyed strands. Tea Tree Amazon Key Ingredients:Lavender, peppermint, tea tree oil, ginger root extract, aloe vera If you're dealing with too much oil, dandruff, or scalp itch, then you'll enjoy the cooling, tingling sensation you get from this Tea Tree conditioner. Regular washing is probably more imperative for oily-haired individuals since your overactive scalp helps to nourish the strands with its persistent sebum production. Still, you shouldnotoverlook conditioner, especially following each wash. In fact, you’re a prime candidate for aco-wash, like the brand's excellentLavendr Mint Co-Wash. You should also consider the brand's Tea Tree Special. Tea Tree is known for its scalp tingling shampoos and conditioners, and the brand's Special Conditioner includes its signature combination of lavender, peppermint, and tea tree oil. And because tea tree oil has natural antiseptic and anti-fungal properties, it can help men with dandruff and damaged scalps. Huron Amazon Key Ingredients:Biotin, wheat protein, argan oil, aloe, shea butter Huron's shampoo made the cut in my guide to the best men's shampoo, and if you picked up a bottle already, get the matching conditioner. This product really shines for oily hair types, cutting down on grease without leaving your hair overly dry. Huron's conditioner is packed with heavy hitters, including biotin (for thinning hair), wheat protein (for damaged hair), argan oil (for shine), and aloe and shea butter (for moisture). Keeps Amazon Key Ingredients:Biotin, saw palmetto, caffeine, tea tree, aloe vera Now, if yourhair isthinning, no matter its natural texture, you’re probably wanting to preserve as much fullness as you can—even if there’s a little smoke and mirrors happening. Look for a conditioner that adds texture and density to each strand, for an overall effect of more uniform, mass fullness. When you're done messing around with thinning hair, it's time to invest in proven treatments likefinasteride and minoxidil. And if you want to give your hair the best possible chance of remaining on your scalp where it belongs, you can supplement it with a biotin conditioner like this one from Keeps. With ingredients for both your hair and your scalp, this conditioner works on multiple levels to help guys with thinning hair. David Mallett Dermstore Amazon Key Ingredients:Organic coconut oil, organic argan oil, organic shea butter, organic cocoa butter If your hair is short—and if you intend to keep it short—then you don’t have to care about its health for the long haul as much. Still, that doesn’t mean you should neglect it, either. But this is a good chance to use something that plays to your texture or oily/dryness level. You’re also in a prime place to use a conditioner that suits the most general wide-cast net; nourish those strands after each wash, bottom line, so that you have cooperative, healthy, frizz-free hair on the regular. David Mallett's salon-caliber recipe suits all hair types, by promising a healthy shine, buoyant softness, and cooperative styling with each use. It's a terrific pick for the entire household, should you want to pare down the shower supply. It also uses organic ingredients, if that matters to you. Baxter of California Amazon A favorite ofGQ's senior commerce editor Ian Burke, this everyday workhorse has a great minty scent and lathers surprisingly well for a conditioner. Davines Davines Another of Burke's go-to picks, this tub from Davines brings hair back to life—particularly, he notes, after using anti-dandruff shampoo or scalp scrubs. The Ordinary The Ordinary The Ordinary makes affordable skin- and hair care solutions that simplywork.Behentrimonium chloride helps wrangle in your locks, reduce frizz, and promote healthy hair texture. Malin + Goetz Malin + Goetz We love Malin+Goetz, and this lightweight conditioner is one of the (many) reasons why. It's great for detangling longer hair, but also shines with short- to medium-length cuts as well. Plus, it smells great. Scent is great, and packaging looks nice on your bathroom counter, but theingredientsare what really makes or breaks conditioners. Look for hydrating ingredients including natural oils (argan oil, avocado oil, coconut oil), proteins and amino acids, detanglers (behentrimonium chloride), protectants (dimethicone), moisturizing agents (cetyl alcohol), and more. However, depending on what you're looking for in your conditioner, the ingredients list might look a little different from bottle to bottle—as it should. That's why it's important to figure out what your individual hair care needs are before you make your purchase (think: dry hair, oily hair, thinning hair, curly hair, etc.) and choose a conditioner that matches those specifications. As grooming editors, we've spend a lot of time lathering up and taking meticulous notes about all the different conditioners in the list above—and using the decades of grooming experience between us, we've narrowed down our favorite picks to the ones we think are the best for various hair types and needs. We took into account value, ingredient quality, scent, look, anecdotal evidence, and customer reviews to bring you the best conditioners for men. The industry is always cranking out new formulas—and new brands pop up all the time—so we'll continue to update this tested list over time.",

    "title": "'Grand Theft Auto VI' Is Delayed, but Its Florida-Man Shirts Are Right on Time",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. For a franchise that largely revolves around getting wasted, bowling with your cousin, and curb-stomping random pedestrians,Grand Theft Autohas an unusual number of notable menswear moments. There’s the good: Tommy Vercetti’sScarface-indebted pink suit in Vice City. The anti-fashion: Niko Bellic’s vintage JD Sports-adjacent look inGTA IV. And the downright filthy: whatever soiled garmentGTA V’sTrevor deigns to drape across himself. Despite its recent delay to May of 2026,Grand Theft Auto VI’slouche, vibrant style moves are bang on the zeitgeist. As you’ll already know from Rockstar’s game trailer (with 475 million views it's one of the biggest video launches of all time),protagonist Jason Duval is a man of few words—but many loud shirts. Most summers you’d expect these searing prints to be confined to the populace of Miami Beach. Come 2025, you can expect to see them all over your timeline…and not just via folks complaining they’ve got to wait another year for the follow-up toRed Dead Redemption 2. From what we’ve seen ofGTA 6so far, Duval’s own wardrobe strikes a vibe that’s somewhere between Adam Sandler’ssignature pickup-hoops uniform, Bad Bunny’sgloriously undone everyday look, andWalton Goggins’whiskey-addled Rick fromThe White Lotusseason 3. GivenGTA 5’s successor has already been 12 years in the making, I doubt its developers were taking cues from the vintage Guess and Eleventy pickups that dominated Goggins’ depression-core rotation this February. Still, there’s no denying the serendipity. Should you also be inclined to dress like the inhabitant of a Florida Keys all-inclusive this summer, you’re not short of options. Plenty of menswear brand have decided that now is the moment to go all-in on lurid prints. Whether you opt for fullMiami Vicecosplay and accessorize with a pair of aviators and a brazen gold chain is a matter of taste and machismo. (But mainly taste.) WhenGranf Theft Auto 6does finally drop in 2026, though, I’d advise keeping the Glock confined to your PS5, and letting Rockstar handle the Bonnie and Clyde fantasy.

    "title": "Michael B. Jordan’s 'Sinners' Watch Couldn't Be More Authentic",
    "article_text": "Who knew Ryan Coogler'smost successful film to date would be about gangsters and blues-loving vampires? Michael B. Jordan must have had an inkling when he signed up to play the lead inSinners.The movie shines a light on themes like race and religion in the American South with a solid attention to detail that makes it highly rewatchable The film is set in 1932. Jordan plays twins Smoke and Stack, who both fought in World War I before they came back to America and stole a venue in Clarksdale, Mississippi, from Al Capone. The finer details make the film so engaging, so it's perhaps not surprising at all to learn that there is significant meaning behind Smoke's military watch. For most of the film, he wears a vintage Elgin trench watch (but switched to a vintage watch with no identifiable name for the gorier later scenes). It’s a piece that perplexed Reddit watch nerds in the aftermath of the film. Somethought it was a Hamilton field watch,while others considered a Longines or Omega. But here's the back story from the man responsible for sourcing the Elgin piece. “When I read the script and got some of the back story from Ryan [Coogler] that the brothers were part of the 369th infantry, I wanted to give Smoke something that still ties them to WW1,\" saysSinnersprop masterDouglas Ware. \"I didn't think Smoke would have that watch before he shipped off to France but something he acquired after being there a while. Maybe he arrived with chocolates or American cigarettes and traded with a French soldier. Maybe he won it in a card game or got some French soldiers out of a dangerous situation. To show their appreciation, someone gave him their watch. I wanted to give his watch some history to show how important it is to him.” Douglas Ware If we take Ware's backstory on board, an Elgin watch is a perfect fit. “Elgin was founded in 1864, primarily manufacturing pocket watches. By 1913, they were producing men's strap watches. However, it was still considered somewhat effeminate for men to be wearing a wristwatch rather than a pocket watch. That all changed with the advent of America joining the fighting,” says Leslie Fleischman, managing director ofThe Vintage Watch Room. “Towards the end of the war, Elgin produced three models, all named after the three principal Allied Generals; the Kitchener (UK), the Foch (France), and the Pershing (USA). These were open to public ownership after the armistice in 1919.” Smoke dresses more hardcore, in workwear-style tailoring, compared to his twin, who wears sharp Italian suits. And the trench watch is an outwardly visible signifier of his military roots and how his character will develop into a gun-slinging vampire killer. Weirdly, in a movie about blues-loving vampires, it helps add to a sense of reality. “Ryan [Coogler] wasn't too particular about what the watch looked like. He was more concerned with it being period-appropriate for the time. We showed him a few watches he was happy with. However, he deferred to MBJ and said to let him pick,” says Ware. “During a camera test, initially, Michael was happy with the first choice. However, when he put on his suit jacket, the sleeve would catch on the watch face and look a little sloppy. He didn't care for that. So the watch that made it into the movie was our second choice. It worked much better for Michael.” Douglas Ware Watches snagged on more than just shirt sleeves over the course of filming. 100-year-old military watches don’t work like modern-day G-Shocks, and things can go wrong. “The one he [Jordan] wears in the movie did actually work. Until he goes into the water to stab [spoiler alert] Remmick. We quickly found out it was not waterproof,” says Ware. But that’s actually more common than you might imagine. “Elgin watches were not really waterproof. During WW1 there were trench watches where the case was made by Francois Borgel, [and were] considered waterproof. But we’ve never seen a Borgel-cased Elgin,” says Fleischman. With a high-octane thriller likeSinners,having a watch that is grounded in reality is a constant, albeit subtle, reminder of Smoke’s past life and military credentials. Sure, it’s not a direct point of reference in the dialogue, but just like watches IRL, it is a poignant and present signifier to the world. In Smoke’s case, he is showing that he fought for his country, and is a capable guardian of those close to him, which comes in handy when shit goes down.

    "title": "13 Best Field Watches Under $500 in 2025: Rugged and Spring-Ready",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Some iconic designs are the result of lightning strikes of genius, while others are happy accidents. The best field watches under $500 are decidedly members of the second group. Simple, legible, and tough, usually featuring white numerals on a black dial and a 24-hour scale (a.k.a. military time), field watched were created in the 1940s as a standard-issue timekeeper for soldiers in WWII. Much likebomber jackets,cargo pants, andaviator shades, though, it didn't take long for their rugged appeal to catch on among the civilian population. Nowadays, you don't need a full camo wardrobe (or a military-scale budget) to enjoy the benefits of this former military accessory, as our top budget-friendly picks prove. For more timely ticker recommendations, check out theGQ Watch Shop. Bertucci Amazon As good on a camping trip as it is on a city patio, this is basically the denim chore jacket of watches. (It looks great with a denim chore jacket, too.) Seiko Amazon You can think of the Seiko 5 as the used Subaru Outback of field watches. It’s affordable, reliable and you can beat the crap out of it for years to come. Casio Amazon In the event of a zombie apocalypse, this is the watch you want to grab on your way out the door. It’s beefy, rugged and—unlike you—can run forever without stopping. Stay safe out there. Citizen Amazon With its mechanical movement, day indicator and date window, this is far from a bare-bones field watch. You wouldn’t guess that from the price. Orient Amazon You only need three chords to write a classic country song and you only need three things to make a good field watch. With a legible white-on-black dial, a steel case and a sturdy nylon strap, consider this the \"Jolene\" of your watch collection. Timex Huckberry The result of a meeting of minds on par withAsics x A.P.C., Huckberry teamed up with Timex to upgrade the look of its classic field watch. Now, thanks to an automatic movement, a titanium case, and a retro-modern look, it's every bit as stylish and durable as their waxed trucker jackets. Momentum Momentum In keeping with their utilitarian origins, most field watches tend to feature white numerals on a black dial, making them easier to read in low light. This one takes it to a moodier—but still extremely functional—place with a black-on-black titanium case. Vaer Vaer A period-correct 36mm case and small seconds dial make this American-made watch an authentic (and affordable)tribute to one of the most coveted field watches of all time. Hamilton Huckberry Rugged looks, Swiss-made quality, and a price well under five bills. What more could you want? Unimatic Huckberry As this beloved Italian indie brand ably demonstrates, a military watch can look just as good in black-on-black as it does in khaki and green. Marathon Marathon Little-known fact: Canada has a military. Littler-known fact: this is its watch brand of choice. Praesidus Amazon Think a small watch can't still look badass? Consider this 1960s repro (complete with a vintage-correct 34mm case) exhibit A. Lorier Lorier If you're not familiar with this NYC-based microbrand, the tasteful lines of this \"explorer-style\" field watch tell you everything you need to know. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, theflyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "The Agony of Being a Celtics Fan in New York Right Now",
    "article_text": "At 9:26 on Wednesday night, I was at a concert in Queens when my friend Thao texted me: “you know you are so loved in this world!!!!!!” The six exclamation points told me that theBoston Celticshad lost Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, falling down 0-2 in the series to theNew York Knicks. Despite having an otherwise wonderful night, I grew despondent. As sarcastic “wellness checks” from my Knicks fan friends sent my phone into repeated spasms, my despair continued to increase. The series is far from over; the Celtics could still make a comeback starting on Saturday night. But the taunts still stung. With all due respect to Jean Paul Sartre, hell isn’t other people—it’s other teams’ fans. I have lived in New York City for nearly fourteen years, but I am deeply and immutably From Massachusetts, which means that I’m not in therapy despite being Jewish and a professional standup comedian. Such is my stoic New England commitment to improving my mental health through sucking it up and/or walking it off. It also means I grew up rooting for sports teams that the rest of America, and especially New York, hates. I regularly have my beloved Celtics trash-talked to me by both NYC natives and other transplants too cowardly to have imported their native allegiances when they arrived here. Last year, in a turn of events that was huge for me personally, the Celtics won the NBA Finals despite the predictions of most analysts and the preferences of most NBA fans. But now, with the C’s looking more vulnerable as of late, the critics are back in full force. This criticism is stressful for me because I’m not, by nature, a confrontational person. I apologize to my dog when I scoot her over so I can climb into bed. I help strangers carry strollers up the subway stairs. When people describe my work they often refer to me as “nice” even though the word “funny” is sittingright there. It is hurtful, but it is consistent. When basketball is involved, though, I am an irredeemable hater. Should the Celtics lose this series to the Knicks or otherwise fall short of a championship season, I will salute my hometown squad for their effort and accomplishments, and I will warm myself by a blazing trash can of spite. I will take solace in the fact that Lakers fans convinced themselves they were contenders in Luka’s first season of the team without having a legitimate starting center on their roster, the way your most delusional and tone deaf friend thinks they could winAmerican Idolif Paula Abdul were still judging. It was a treat to see the Celtics historic rivals punted out of the first round in the same way it made me smile to watch contemporary foes theMiami Heat’sseason dissolve like, to use a Miami-appropriate analogy, so much cocaine dropped into a jacuzzi. If I’m being honest though, I’m a little jealous of Knicks fans. Let me be clear here: It’s not because of the Knicks themselves. People love to say: “The league is better when the Knicks are good!” Okay, but, real quick…when is that?The Jalen Bronson era has been a thrill, I type through gritted fingers. But before that the team hadn’t been relevant for, what? A quarter of a century? They haven’t won a championship since 1973. Spike Lee couldn’t legally drink back when the team popped that victory champagne.Timothée Chalametwas negative twenty-two years old. The Celtics, for contrast, boast eighteen championship banners compared to the Knicks’ pair of rings. Still, deep down, I am envious of Knicks fans’ ability to feel their feelings. When the Knicks lose (and I will remind you that, historically, happensa lot) they feel bad, as they should. But when the Knicks win (and I’m including regular season games here) their joy radiates through the streets of New York City. Take the ultra-viral “Bing bong!” clip from the Street Talk web series that has become a touchstone for Knicks fans. May I remind you that it was filmed after the Knicks defeated the Celtics in the very first game of the 2021-2022 season, a season in which the Celtics made it to the Finals (do not ask me about the results) and the Knicks FAILED TO REACH THE PLAYOFFS. Desus Nice and The Kid Mero (my bosses at the time, and true Knicks diehards) mocked meby nameon television the next day. Fans still use “Bing bong!” as a rallying cry, which feels to me like celebrating a ship’s maiden voyage by shouting: “The Titanic is…unsinkablllleeeeee!!!!!” I hate this quality so much—and I want it for myself so badly. Because I know that they are right and I am wrong. We should, as lovers of sports, allow ourselves to feel the dizzying rush of triumph at whatever altitude it presents itself. When I say I desire what Knicks fans have, I don’t mean a 2-0 series advantage. (Okay I don’tjustmean a 2-0 series advantage.) I want the same access to my own interiority in both victory and defeat. I want the swagger and the joie de vivre. I want to believe and hope and live in the present. I want the optimism I feel in the rest of my life to permeate my fandom as well. But, as a Massachusetts native and a hater, I will settle for the eighteen rings.",

    "title": "Every Time Maple Leafs Star William Nylander Wears This Suit, He Scores Another Goal",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Hockey is, without question, the most superstitious sport on the planet. There areplayoff beards, of course, the grand tradition in which players don’t shave for the duration of their team’s postseason run—a great look for hirsute vets like NHL all-time leading scorerAlex Ovechkin, not so much for peach-fuzzed rookies like Ovi’s 20-year-old Washington Capitals teammate Ryan Leonard. There’s the whole thing aboutnever touching the conference championship trophies, lest you jinx yourself out of lifting theStanley Cupa week or two later. And then there are the personal rituals and microfixations that every player in the league makes up for themselves—and especially hang onto when they’re in the midst of a hot streak. “There’s probably a few that are borderline crazy,” Pittsburgh Penguins superstar Sidney Crosbysaid in 2010about his own pregame routines, which at that time included walking a specific circuitous route through his home arena to avoid passing the visitor’s locker room and wearing the exact same lucky jockstrap he’d had since his junior hockey days to every single game. William Nylander, the red-hot Toronto Maple Leafs forward who has scored five goals over his last three playoff games, is adhering to a sartorial superstition of his own at the moment—and thankfully it’s a whole lot sharper and less repelling than Crosby’s overused cup. Since the Leafs’ series-clinching Game 6 over the Ottawa Senators on May 1, in which Nylander logged two vital goals and an assist, he’s arrived to every game wearing the exact same suit: a chestnut browndouble-breasted ensemble, paired with a crisp whitedress shirt, a gleamingsilver chain, and a low-key pair of suede Adidas kicks. It’s a handsome look—while NHL players, unlike theiranything-goes NBA and NFL brethren, are required towear suits to games, Nylander is among the few style-inclined stars who actually looks good in ‘em. And the suit sure seems to be working for him: the Swede opened the Leafs’ current series against the Florida Panthers on Monday with another two goal game, and followed that up on Wednesday with one more tally. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. With the series shifting to Florida for a crucial Game 3 tonight, rest assured Nylander will be outfit repeating for a fourth consecutive game. And frankly, the Leafs—who haven’t won a Stanley Cup since 1967—can use all the luck they can get. Maybe with some combination of Nylander’s slick suit, his teammateMitch Marner’s newfound dad strength, and Toronto superfanJustin Bieber continuing to clear his calendarto lock in every game, the franchise can finally turn the tide. If you’re looking to nab your own semiformal good luck charm, Nylander’s two-piece appears to hail from his collaboration with theToronto custom tailor Garrison Bespoke—which explains its especially flattering cut, fitting him perfectly in the shoulders withlooser, flowier trousersthat stand apart from the skinnies typically preferred by the rest of the league. Not able to make it up north to get your measurements taken? Not to fear: J.Crew’s got a nice linen dupe with your name on it. J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew",

    "title": "13 Best Utility Vests in 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The best utility vests are born from the same function-before-fashion ethos asfield watches,aviator shades, andfatigue pants. You’ve got multiple pockets, tough fabrics, and a roomy fit that lets you cast a line or climb a ladder—or, you know, reach for your phone without dislocating your shoulder. And yet, the utility vest’s MacGuyver vibe has suddenly arrived on the style scene, regardless of whether the wearer spends his weekdays doing manual labor or Slack triage. Makes sense: an array of zip, flap, and mesh pockets in asymmetrical layouts can hold tools or a spare MagSafe charger. Techy fabrics like nylon, canvas, and cotton twill can shrug off surprise rain showers or a dripping iced latte. Linen and mesh make sure you can breathe on the job site or the job hunt. We’re hitting peak utility vest now because it’s one of the few styles you can wear overT-shirts(including simplewhite tees) without looking like you’re seeking $2 million at a $20 million valuation. Suddenly a basic shorts-and-tee look gets a layer that adds both panacheandpockets. If you’re worried about looking too Cabela's-core, you can play against type by pulling on a utility vest withcargos,jeans,canvas sneakers,hoodies, orboat shoes. We’ve found the best utility vests, covering Americana style, techy minimalism, Italianate flexing, and a surprise heater from Amazon. L.L. Bean L.L. Bean L.L. Bean doesn’t chase trends so much as it carries classics, which has put the Maine brand in menswear’s sights lately, between the resurgence of thebarn coatand a recentJapan Edition pop-upin NYC that had lines wrapped around the block. Its Upland Hunting Vest is waxed-cotton wonder, made in tandem with British Millerain, a legendary purveyors of wind- and water-resistant fabrics since 1880. There's a large, lined front-entry pouch for stashing essentials, plus roomy lower pockets perfect for snacks, gear, or more snacks. Waxed cotton means it’ll keep your torso dry in the rain (sorry, arms) and that the vest that—like Bean itself—only gets better with age. Polo Ralph Lauren Polo Ralph Lauren No matter what trends unfold in menswear, King Ralph remains a reliably stylish and blissfully fad-resistant safe haven. This utility vest, in a stealthy black, hits Polo’s wearable-but-elevated bullseye. Crafted from 100 percent nylon with a breathable mesh lining and water-repellent finish, this vest can handle everyday life (and a sudden afternoon heat wave) with ease. It’s also got enough pockets to make a cargo pant blush: one at the right shoulder, two on the chest, four at the waist, a few on the back…enough that, frankly, we lost count. Flygo Amazon Here’s what you need to know: Lots of pockets, very little money, next-day delivery. Flygo’s utility vest isn’t made by a heritage brand or a Japanese label with Type-A tendencies, which maybe makes it the most honest of the bunch. Nylon-poly fabric isn’t luxurious, but it is quick-drying, wrinkle-resistant, and tough enough to handle most excursions—particularly if they stay on the sidewalk. We really like the removable back panel that converts the Flygo into a full mesh vest, offering maximum ventilation. With 15 pockets total, you could wear thistrail running—or to your local coffee shop “cubicle”—and ditch the backpack entirely. Stone Island Nordstrom Stone Island’s iconic compass logo remains a fashion flex, but the brand’s real strength is going full mad-scientist mode when it comes to textiles, often reinventing existing materials with wild dying and coating techniques. Case in clothing: its utility vest is made from a three-layer fabric, with an outer nylon over a breathable, water-resistant membrane, backed by a whisper-thin polyester base. That nylon outer layer also has a water repellant finish that makes liquids bead up and roll off. The vest also brings a black ops-by-way-of-Milan vibe, with 3-D pockets more than ample enough to handle your everyday carry (keys, phone, existential dread) and an adjustable front belt with a buckle that cinches everything in. Plus, a secret: a stowaway hood that pops out of the collar, for when it turns out your weather app fumbled the bag. Again. Snow Peak Snow Peak A denim vest conjures visions of handlebar mustaches and reruns ofAmerican Chopper, but Japanese outdoor brandSnow Peakreboots the look with a utility-forward twist. Its Takibi vest—takibimeaning “gathering around the fire”—isn’t just a fire piece of menswear, it’s literally fire-resistant. Made from a flame-retardant fabric milled in Japan that’s been blended with modacrylic and cotton, this vest means business. Adjustable over-shoulder strapsa laoveralls combine with a zip-front closure to let you slip the Takibi over lighter jackets and shells with ease. Which means, with its two billowy front pockets and one massive back pouch, you’re able to carry anything you need for the campsite. That said, we’re more likely to throw it over acrewneck sweatshirt, then add someStan Rayutility pants andRed Wings, and happily leave thecross-body bagat home. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Fromknit polosto easysuitingand everything in between,Todd Snyderhas a knack for making it absurdly easy for guys to get dressed. Take this beautiful cigar-colored vest, for instance: it's a masterclass in making something that can veer costume-y into a piece that’s approachable. Made from 100 percent linen, it's unlined, garment-washed, and soft as your favorite summer beach shirt. Toss it over apolo, pair it with some matchinglinen pants, and finish it off withmoc-toes. Better yet, pack it for vacation—this utility vest looks equally good with your favorite swimtrunks, a bare chest, and a margarita. Randy's Garments Huckberry Randy’s Garments is much newer than itsworkwear wavecompetition (Carhartt, Filson, etc.), but this vest is further proof that the made-in-USA label can hang with the originals. The hefty 12-ounce duck canvas vest feels like it could be dragged behind an F-150 and come out looking fine, which means it’ll hold up just fine for a weekend flea market crawl. With two deep welt pockets and bar tacks placed right where they count, this is a vest built for the long haul. Obviously, you could pair it with some ruggedwork pants, but maybe flip the script and throw on somewhite jeansfor a full oat milk latté look (actual oat milk latté optional). Carhartt WIP Huckberry Nike ACG Nike Finisterre Finisterre Engineered Garments SSENSE Barbour Barbour Universal Works END Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "A Selvedge Denim Expert Breaks Down His 6 Favorite Jeans Ever",
    "article_text": "Some guys collectvinyl, some collectwatches, and some—likeStandard & Strange’s denimhead-in-chief Jeremy Smith—collectjeans. Calling Smith a denim enthusiast, however, is a bit like callingA$AP Rockya guy who likes jewelry. Smith is a denimconnoisseur. As the co-founder of one of the country’s most respected destinations forhigh-grade dungarees, Smith has spent more than a decade immersed in the culture, science, business, andlore of denimand had access to some of the most covetable specimens on the planet, from century-oldLevi’sdug out of barns to rare creations byJapan's most revered denim artisans. Unsurprisingly, he’s amassed a formidable personal collection of jeans along the way. This week, to celebrate Standard & Strange’s 10-year anniversary, the boutique is releasing theOoe Yofukuten 10 Year Anniversary Jeans, a limited-edition collab with an enthusiast-grade denim brand that Smith describes as “the best jeans-makers in the world.” Crafted in Japan by a husband and wife duo with a fanatical devotion to old-school denim, Ooe Yofukuten (Ooe is pronounced OA) represents a culmination of everything Smith loves about the art and craft of jeans. In that vein, Standard & Strange will also be publishingNot Just A Pair Of Pants, a 98-pagegraphic novel that lays out the history, anatomy, and essential vocabulary of blue jeans in loving detail. In honor of the occasion—and his ongoing campaign to spread the gospel of high-quality denim with the world—Smith offered to give us a tour of his enviable denim collection, and tell us the stories behind a few of his favorite pairs. “One of my very first pairs of Japanese jeans was from Pure Blue Japan. It’s [run by] this one guy who's in love with fabric more than jeans, so the fit and the construction are not as good as a lot of other brands, but where he really shines is being super innovative with denim. Like, how slubby can you make it? How soft? What are all of these levers you can pull on selvage denim, on these old looms—inducing chatter, inducing more slub, inducing regularities—he's done all kinds of crazy shit. When I think about who's the first brand to really focus on fucking around in the fabric world, it was them. It took me a lot of effort to get these, because I got them before there were any American stockists, and it took a lot of back and forth, trading, and proxy buying to find the pair I wanted that fit the way I wanted them to. I wore those for five years straight, almost every single day, and it shows.” “I’m reluctant to say someone or something is the best in the world, and you won’t hear me say that about many things, because the definition of ‘best’ is so fuzzy. But I don't know anyone else who could produce a better pair of jeans thanOoe Yofukuten. There’s no one more dedicated to the craft. Ryo patterns and cuts, Hiro sews, and every pair of jeans they make is only touched by the two of them. This is their sole focus in life. When we launched their first release in 2015, we were pushing into a bit of a headwind, because the trend was for all kinds of over-the-top textures designed to create intense, contrasty fades—it was the denim equivalent of triple-hopped beers with names like ‘Hop Mess Monster.’ In comparison, the denim Ooe uses is very quiet. It showcases the craftsmanship of the jeans and fades slowly and evenly, just like vintage. The 16oz Golden Gate denim was the first time we sat down with them in their workshop and put together a pair of jeans. It turned out that this denim is hard to fade, so these have a lot of wear on them, but it doesn't show as much.” “Another one from the early years, from a now-defunct brand out of LA called Rising Sun, designed by a guy named Mike Hodis. Great denim designer. He also designed for JNCO and Lucky Brand. Rising Sun was part of the resurgence of American-made denim brands, and the first time I encountered them was in 2008 or 2009. These are a higher-rise, full-cut, suspender button jam, and they're just good jeans. They weren't flashy, they were just nice, high-quality denim.” “These were made somewhere around 2010, and they’re made from chambray, not denim. It’s not a great material for jeans, I'll be honest, because it’s not sturdy enough, but I wore the shit out of these. They've been repaired multiple times, they've got great fades, and they were a really good fit for the time. Jean Shop was a $300 pair of jeans back in the day, selvedge, made in New York City. It was very commercial, like, let's take Japanese denim, use really nice trims, say everything's the best of the best, and charge a premium price. It was a very Grey Goose move. But still, excellent jeans. I still love them. They’re kind of an outlier in my collection because they are so commercial and so uninteresting in so many ways, but I just can’t get rid of them.” “Jungle cloth is what is used in an N-1 Deck Jacket. You rarely see it in pants, and you never see it in jeans. So, Mister Freedom is tied up with another brand called Sugar Cane, and with another brand called Buzz Ricksons, all under the Toyo Enterprise umbrella. Sugar Cane had made a pair of army pants in black jungle cloth years ago, and I really wanted them, but couldn't afford them. Then these came out. I’d never seen an indigo variant of this fabric, and I think it was just deadstock or sample fabric from Toyo that Christophe from Mister Freedom found, so I got them. It’s an amazing cut, amazing color, everything about them was just so good that I couldn’t pass them up.” “Ooe has made this repro of an old Boss of the Road work pant for multiple iterations, and these are the best iteration. They'd gotten a repro of the original canvas duck made in Japan by a mill that bought the rights to an old American canvas brand called Alberton. We were originally gonna do multiple colorways, but it turned out to be so hard to sew that after this run, Hiro was just like, “I'm not doing it again.” It was snapping needles, it was snapping thread, and every pair took us twice as long as it needed to because this duck was so abrasive and so thick. It came to the point where they went to the thread manufacturers and, with the help of that whole community, they figured out how to sew it well. From there, I went on to beat the everlasting shit of these. I built the Berkeley shop wearing them, I crawled around in concrete for eight hours a day in them, and the pants themselves are still at 100% integrity, minus where I ripped out one of the hip pockets. They’re not jeans, but they’re very, very dear to me.”",

    "title": "Exclusive: Hoka Just Blessed This Buzzy Menswear Label With Its First-Ever Sneaker Collab",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. For independent clothing designers, getting your first sneaker collab has become something of a coming-of-age ritual. If you freak it—like, say,Grace Wales Bonnerdid withher Adidas debut—the drop has the potential to supercharge your stature and open the door to even greater opportunities. And if it flops? Well…let’s just say it’s best not to flop. Now entering the fray: Toronto menswear maestro Spencer Badu, whose eponymous label has teamed up withHokato reimagine the running specialist’s puffy-soled Elevon X. “This has definitely been a dream of mine,” Badu tellsGQ. “I’ve always thought about what that first shoe for us could look like. I think we’ve mastered clothes at this point. So the next thing, naturally, felt like footwear.” The shoe is riddled with details that speak to Badu’s Ghanaian roots: The striking yellow and black is a nod to Ghana’s flag; a small piece of hardware in the shape of a cowrie shell—a Ghanaian symbol of wealth—sits at the tongue; and a heatmap on the footbed pays homage tohis brand’s longtime design codes. To give context and highlight the career milestone, Badu and Hoka produced a short film that captures the inspiration for the design, filmed across Toronto and Ghana. Badu often references his personal life in his work, which makes his garments feel “much more organic,” he says. “So once I [began] building the narrative for the shoe, it felt only right to go back [to Ghana], to invest in creatives there to produce it. And it was surreal to be back there shooting. It felt right to give the shoe context, the same way I create my collections.” The collaboration came about after Thomas Cykana, who oversees partnerships at Hoka, stumbled upon Badu’s work and shot him a cold DM in February 2023. From there, over the course of several fashion week linkups in cities across the globe, Badu’s vision for the sneaker slowly came into focus. “I think just the shape really complemented his brand codes,” Cykana says of the Elevon X.  “It was easy once we found that shoe to give him the creative autonomy to add materials, colors, and obviously those ornamental details to make the shoe his own.” “Hoka really gave me free rein to do my thing,” Badu says. “It was like, how can we just make it feel as Spencer as possible?” The result is the rare performance running silhouette revved up with the brash, electric vibes necessary to cut through all the noise of the sneaker-hype economy. In other words: Badu freaked it. And in addition to all the buzz he’s already created on his own—with his clothes popping up on the likes ofKendrick LamarandA$AP Rocky—this Hoka collab might just be the key to taking his label to the next level. The Spencer Badu x Hoka Elevon X will release viaSpencerBadu.comon May 15, with an additional drop throughHoka.comand select retailers on May 16.",

    "title": "Francis Ford Coppola on 50 Years of Winemaking, Trump’s Tariffs, and Why You Can't Stream ‘Megalopolis’ Yet",
    "article_text": "In 1975, Francis Ford Coppola and his wife, Eleanor, bought a celebrated winery in Napa Valley that had survived prohibition and produced some of the finestwinesin the world, only to fall into the hands of the same conglomerate that would later bring us Smirnoff Ice. As tragedies go, there are certainly worse problems. But for anyone who cares about wine, the fall was crushing.Wine Spectatoronce called Inglenook 1941 Cabernet Sauvignon “one of the top wines of the century.” By the time the Coppolas showed up, the estate was trading in $9 dollar jugs of table wine. The Coppolas spent the next four decades acquiring the original 1,700-acre property piece-by-piece, finally securing the name Inglenook in 2011—for a reported $14 million. (That same year,Coppolarecruited Château Margaux’s’s Philippe Bascaules to be the director of winemaking, who promptly set about restoring the winery’s early reputation.) In a way, it makes sense that a five-time Oscar winner would become “the custodian of Inglenook,” as Robert Mondavi once called Coppola. Who else but an artist who went bankrupt bankrolling his own films would fall so hard for a nearly impossible comeback story? The wine business has been good to the Coppolas. To make last year’s long-gestating opusMegalopolis,starringAdam Driveras a visionary architect, FFC borrowed $200 million dollars against his portfolio of supermarket wines. (In 2021, Coppola merged that part of his business with Delicato Family Wines in an equity deal he told the Wall Street Journal was valued at around $650 million; some of that $200 million also went to improvements at Inglenook.) ThatMegalopoliscash has basically evaporated, though Coppola hopes to make it back in time. (More on that below.) But he notably never leveraged Inglenook, which dates back to 1879, perhaps because the property is so personal. He and his wife raised their children there, in the Queen Anne home that once belonged to Gustave Niebaum, the Finnish furrier who famously imagined Napa could compete with Bordeaux. In honor of the Coppola family’s 50 years at Inglenook, the director shared some intimate family photos withGQ. In one, a young Sofia sits at the dining room table doing some homework alongside her father. In another, Coppola’s sons, Roman and Gian-Carlo (who died in a boating accident at age 22), pose inside a fermentation tank. And to mark the occasion, Coppola logs into Zoom from London, where he’s writing a musical adaptation of a lesser-known Edith Wharton novel,Glimpses of the Moon, about two broke strivers in love. At 86, he’s looking regal as hell, dressed in the kind of teal robe his nephew Jason Schwartzman might wear in a Wes Anderson film. (Coppola is reportedly spending some time abroad in the wake of his wife’s death in 2024 after 62 years of marriage.) There’s a lot to talk about today, includingPresident Trump’s proposed tariffs on the film industry, and Coppola’s refusal to let the public streamMegalopolisnearly a year after its divisive release. While anniversaries can be boring stuff, Coppola is a great talker. (I met him briefly at the Napa Valley Wine Auction in 2017, where he told me the best bottle of wine he ever shared was with Bill Cosby.) In advance of our conversation, I dropped $170 on a bottle of 2017 Rubicon, Inglenook’s flagship wine, which I destroyed over dinner. Coppola seemed flattered, though he politely informed me that I’d opened the wine about 12 years too soon. Naturally, he has the first word. Francis Ford Coppola:That whole thing about wines being older and getting better? My wife and I once were given a chance years ago to drink some old Château Margaux in L.A. The owner came to L.A. and we drank two bottles that were memorable. One was a 1786, I think. Which meant that, probably, Jefferson drank it. He was a great wine lover and he would’ve tasted those wines inParis. Can you imagine? It wasn’t just wonderful, it was spectacular. I couldn’t describe it to you. It was the softness and the flavors. But what really astounded me was that I was sharing an experience with one of our Founders. Well, I mean, it tastes good. It’s nothing like it will be in 20 years, or what it’ll be like in a hundred years. Of course, you’re not going to be around then. Maybe your kids will. But these wines, they don’t only get better, they get magnificent. Francis Ford Coppola (center) with his parents Carmine (left) and Italia. Sofia Coppola (left) does her homework while Francis does his. I truly didn’t intend to do anything so significant. A lot of people don’t know this, but Prohibition allowed wine-drinking families—Europeans, primarily Germans, Italians, French Hungarians, God knows—to drink wine at the table. But they had tomake itin their own home. And they couldn’t sell it. My grandfather in New York had a concrete fermenter in the basement. He would split half a trainload of grapes with some other people in the neighborhood. My grandfather had seven boys. And these boys, I’m told, they would take an orange and every kid in the family would get asegmentof the orange. That’s how poor they were. So, when these grapes arrived to be fermented, the boys would send the littlest kid—who was, like, two—down into the basement to steal a bunch of grapes. The whole thing, as it was related to me by my uncle, sounded like a lot of fun. My budget when I went to UCLA was a dollar forty a day. I had 25 cents for breakfast, I had 50 cents for lunch, and whatever was left over for dinner. Usually, I ate Kraft macaroni and cheese because they cost 19 cents. But with the advent ofThe Godfather, that changed overnight. Suddenly, I was both famous and had some money. I was already married and had two kids. And then afterThe Godfather, I had three kids. I said to my wife, “Let’s buy a little house, a summer house in Napa, with maybe an acre of grapes. And then we’ll make wine like my grandfather used to do, and we’ll give it to the relatives.” We had a real estate agent who showed us some little houses with some grapes—very small, very modest. Francis (left) with Gian-Carlo and Roman Coppola. The Inglenook estate had been sold to any number of people. But the original homestead that the famous Finnish captain had built—along with a lot of the mountain and the water rights, which were very important, and about a hundred acres of the original vineyards—was all for sale. The agent said to us, “This isn’t for you, but it’s a chance to see it. It’s the most beautiful property in Napa Valley.” Anyway, I made a bid for it and I didn’t get it. I was disappointed. I was getting ready to go makeApocalypse Now.And someone said the people who bought Inglenook were financed by a company that’s going to build 60 homesteads on that mountain. And now, due to Napa’s laws—it was an agricultural preserve—you couldn’t build homes on it. I went to the owners and I said, “Would you be interested in selling it to me?” They said, If you’ll give us $200,000 for the extra water tanks we built, we’ll sell it to you. It was like a million-four or something. I asked the bank to advance money on myGodfatherpercentage, I went off to makeApocalypse Nowand I forgot about it. When I came back, we had a hundred acres of grapes. People were coming to my wife and saying, “Oh, we’ll lease those grapes.” They were being very aggressive about it. I said, “Gee, everyone seems to want those grapes. They must be good. Maybe we should keep them and just make the wine ourselves?” She said, “Francis, what do you know about how to make wine?” I said, “Well, I don’t know anything about how to make wine. But I don’t know how to make movies either. And look what I just did.” So, we kept the land. From left: Roman Coppola, Gian-Carlo Coppola, and their cousin Chris Neil Well, it’s our home. And it is the home of our children. There was a famous chicken farmer in Argentina—he was the chicken king of Argentina—and he had a big ranch where he’d raise all these chickens. And he made a fortune. When he got older, he got rid of the chickens and made a home for each of his grandchildren. The reason was that he wanted them all to know each other. So, I sort of took a cue from that and started to make homes for each of my kids on the Inglenook property. Every summer, all the kids would get together. On the Napa property, we used to do what they call “creativity camp.” One year, we would all do one-act plays, one year we would all have songwriting and every kid would write songs. That’s how we knew Sofia could direct.Jason Schwartzmanwrote wonderful songs. I was a camp counselor when I was a kid, and that’s what I am as a grandpa. Where did he run it? There was a famous camp that I was a counselor at called Camp Baco and Camp Che-Na-Wah. They were Jewish camps up in thatMarjorie Morningstarplace [editor’s note: The Adirondacks, in upstate New York]. And the lady who was the counselor before me was Anne Bancroft. Talk about a great drama counselor. I have a lot of lifelong dreams.Megalopoliswas one. I have others. Basically, I have a film I’m obsessed with [now]. But I take exception with this phrase that’s been coined, the “passion project.” All motion picture directing you do out of passion. Sure, you do some things—you gotta make a living. But when you make the film, you are passionate about it. All directors are. Because the film is still being shown in theaters. I don’t want anyone to own it. After the election, people are selling out screenings ofMegalopolis—the way it was intended to be seen. Being that it was so prophetic or prescient to say America is like Rome—it’s going to maybe lose its republic—now people are rushing to see it in theaters. We sold out three screenings in Boston recently, in Detroit, and people are really lining up. It’s just like what happened withApocalypse Now.Apocalypse Nowwas a big flop, it got terrible reviews, everyone said it was the worst movie ever made. And yet people never stopped going to see it. The same thing is now happening withMegalopolis. No one I know thinks that this tariff philosophy— All it does is create uncertainty. People don’t understand that the economy in the previous administration? There was world inflation, there wasn’t [just] inflation in America. The entire world was going through a serious inflationary trend. But the country that did the best with it—and which other countries were jealous of—was the United States. So, the United States really banked a lot of money previous to this new administration, and there’s a lot of money in the country, and these tariffs are like slamming the door closed on what was a very prosperous situation. Can you wait a half a second? Someone’s ringing the bell. I’ll come right back. [Coppola returns a few moments later.] That was Amazon.com. They just left a bunch of boxes in front of my door. I’m back. There was some Rubicon there. It was such a spectacular event, so many wonderful old friends were there. It was like coming back to your old neighborhood and seeing all the people you remembered as a kid. And some of the kids liked you, some didn’t like you, but they were all there. And you realize that was your home. Because I’m a creature— I was created by Hollywood. Let’s face it, I went to Hollywood, a kid nuts about movies without a penny to my name or an important connection. I didn’t have one person that I could call up and say, “I’m Francis Coppola, help me.” Fortunately, I went to UCLA and I saw on a bulletin board a job to work for Roger Corman as his assistant. People think the Coppola family is a big movie family, but we weren’t. The Coppolas, from left: Roman, Eleanor, Francis, Sofia, and Gian-Carlo. Sixty-twoyears. It’s my lifetime. I was in one bankruptcy or another. The process server is tricky when they have to go on a private estate. Because technically they’re not allowed to come. A process server came anyway. And of course we knew who it was. So, my wife and I disappeared, and only little Sofia—who was about eight years old—stood on the porch, and said, “What are you doing here? You are not allowed here. This is Tara! You must leave.” Yeah. “This is Tara. You cannot come here!” That was a pretty good memory. She’s a character, Sofia. She was quite a precocious little girl. He was a wonderful man. He drove up and said, “I just want to tell you that you bought one of the icons of the Napa Valley, and you’re now the custodian of it, and to let you know what you have.” We went down into the basement. I said, “I own this wine, it came with it, let’s see what it is.” We opened up a bottle of 1890 [Inglenook] and he just jumped up and down. He said, “See, what I’ve always said. If the wine is given the proper age, it’s as great as any wine in the world.” Well, I mean, respectfully, Mr. Mondavi was a patriarch of the Napa Valley. I was just a newcomer. Coppola and Napa Valley legend Robert Mondavi. I did try. In fact, I threw a dinner in his honor to commemorate a birthday, in which I invited his family, his brother, his sons. Some came, some didn’t come. I don’t know. It’s beyond my ability to understand the nature of that. It had to do with the mother, and the boys. It was complicated, as every family story is. I mean, we could go back to Aeschylus and tell the story of Atreus and get to the root of what all enmity between peoples are. In Aeschylus’s time, once you kill someone else’s kids, they will never forgive you. Yes. Well, he was a great man. One thing he said that I would repeat to you is this. “As an actor, you can’t care or they’ll see it on your face. Whether you’re good or bad, you can’t care. Or they’ll see it.” So when he acted, he just didn’t care. The most powerful story I have is having that bottle of 1786 Château Margaux with my wife, Eleanor, because we both realized that it’s true that these wines live hundreds of years. It was an unforgettable experience. Also, having the 1941 Inglenook. A bottle of it costs, like, $30,000. I drank a bottle with my family. It was pretty wonderful. [Editor’s note: In December of 2024,Sotheby’s solda single bottle of 1941 Inglenook Cabernet Sauvignon for $7,500. Though in 2004, FFC bought a bottle himself at auction for just shy of $25,000 dollars. If anyone is opening a bottle soon within driving distance of Los Angeles, please invite me.] Yeah, we have two bottles left of it. I guess all of Inglenook is for special occasions, of which we have many. I have six grandchildren, I have three grandchildren, one great-grandchild. They’re all gems. We have many commemorative occasions that we’re going to enjoy together. Do you have grandchildren? Children? Well, gather some with you. They’re remarkable. Tastings at Inglenook start at $75 and reservations are recommended.The AFI Life Achievement Award: A Tribute to Francis Ford Coppolapremieres on TNT on June 18, with an encore airing on TCM on July 31.",

    "title": "I Test-Drove Tudor’s New Supercar of a Watch at the Miami Grand Prix",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterBox + Papers,Cam Wolf’s weekly deep dive into the world of watches.Sign up here. Formula 1 driver Liam Lawson stumbled into the perfect word to describe Tudor’s new Black Bay Chrono “Carbon 25.” “Racey,” Lawson said at an event last Friday. “It feels racey on the wrist.” “It looks like a car,” agreed Isack Hadjar, Lawson’s rookie teammate on the Visa Cash App Racing Bulls. And if there’s one thing these guys are experts on, it’s what does and doesn’t look like a car. Both drivers were standing at the front of a large, sparse room at the W Hotel in Miami. It was the night before the Miami Grand Prix’s Saturday sprint race, but Lawson and Hadjar were already fully kitted out in team gear with the sleek new—and, yes, very racey—Tudors on their wrists. As we chatted, Lawson occasionally raised his wrist to jangle the watch a bit and stare at its gorgeous white-and-blue dial. Who could blame him? The “Carbon 25,” which costs $7,575, really does resemble a sexy car—just look at thisvintage Porsche 911 Carrera in the same color scheme. The watch’s carbon fiber case is familiar to the drivers as well. Hadjar said that it’s like putting a piece of a car on your wrist. I would soon get comfortable with that feeling. Isack Hadjar with the new watch Along with a few other members of the press I was soon led into another vast, mostly empty, poorly lit room. The only decoration was a table in the center with over a dozen watch boxes set up like dinner plates. (I joke a lot about the “Watch Illuminati,” but if it were real, this is exactly how I would picture its meeting rooms.) Nestled in each box, of course, was this supercar of a watch for us to test drive for the weekend. The electric shade of blue—a racey hue, if you will—prompted a question from among our midst. Breaking the silence in the room—whose occupants were attentively grabbing videos and images of their new wristwear—someone asked if the blue was printed right on the crystal. We all swerved our heads to discover the enquirer was Kevin O’Leary,Shark Tank’sMr. Wonderful, who haspoured a not-insignificant portion of his fortune into a flashy watch collection. Dude is deep in it: Here he was fraternizing with a bunch of the press just to get the earliest possible look at a new Tudor (it is limited-edition, after all). And he’s already started wearing the piecethis week on TV. Oh, and to answer that Wonderful question: the blue is not printed on the dial, but it comes up just enough on the outer track of the face to understand where O’Leary was coming from. The blue is a blistering blue, a shade that just looks like it goesfast. The new watch on my wrist The next day, in the beaming Miami sun, I got my first good look at my weekend watch fling. The white is like fresh paint: sparkly rather than flat. Tudor increased the watch’s size to 42 mm (from 41 mm on the regular BB chrono), but because of the light carbon fiber case it doesn’t wear huge. In fact, I keep trying on watches that convince me bigger might be better, especially after all the hysteria around tiny vintage pieces these past couple of years (maybe more on that another day). As a foremost expert on Formula 1 (i.e. I binged most of the latestDrive to Surviveseason on Netflix last week), I can state with confidence that I know precisely what Tudor is up to. These days, you’re simply not a proper watch brand without ties to F1. Race weekends can sometimes feel like watch events where they also race cars. Formula 1’s new title sponsor TAG Heuer, who just took over for Rolex, has its logo splashed all over the raceway. Richard Mille sponsors both Ferrari and McLaren, Alpine has a partnership with H. Moser, IWC is with Mercedes AMG-Petronas, and TAG Heuer also has a team with Red Bull, which means it gets plenty of time on the wrist of the era’s most dominant racer, Max Verstappen. (Side note: In Miami, the upcomingF1movie starring Brad Pitt had its own pop-up experience in the super-VIP area, which I was desperate to get into because Jimmy Butler’s Bigface coffee was slinging cortados down there. I did not succeed. Ball up top.) Despite its recent inroads into racing, however, Tudor remains a diving brand first and foremost. The Black Bay and Pelagos were made explicitly for exploring the depths—and some of myGQcolleagues have even gone scuba divingwhile wearing the brand’s pieces. But in 2025, the brand is committed to its Black Bay Chronograph. The stopwatch complication has deep racing ties, so a partnership with Red Bull’s little sister brand is an obvious way to cement legitimacy in the sport. Until now, Tudor has mostly limited its F1-related pieces to special editions made exclusively for drivers. Last year’sceramic Black Baywith its deep black case and contrasting blue dial was especially cool, and there were two additional versions made for theMiamiandLas Vegasraces. You can see how the brand is ramping up desire for its racing-themed pieces. Last year’s were completely off limits, while the new carbon piece is one of Tudor’s rare numbered and limited editions (there will be 2025 in total). The racing-adjacent chronograph is also where Tudor likes to have the most fun. For diving, the brand is still pushing serious tool watches: Its flagship release at Watches and Wonders was a 43-mm Pelagos Ultra, made to dive to 1,000 meters underwater. Meanwhile, Tudor’s put out chronographs with vivid pink and blue dials before this latest racey one debuted this weekend. And just a few days after the release of the carbon watch, Tudor put out a variant of its Pelagos FXD Chrono with bright pink accents. Just because they’re fun doesn’t mean they’re not useful, though. During the main race on Sunday, Tudor arranged a group of us to go down into VCARB’s garage, where the team’s mechanics observe the event between their racers’ pit stops. One of the mechanics came near our group to pull a protein bar out of a small pouch of snacks—because the cars aren’t the only things that need to fuel up. On his wrist? The aforementioned Tudor Black Bay made exclusively for the team. I looked down at my own carbon Black Bay Chrono with a warm thought:It’s racey.

    "title": "“She Was Tearful About It”: The Nuances of Casey Means’s Medical Exit and Antiestablishment Origins",
    "article_text": "When Dr.Casey Meanswas just months away from finishing her grueling residency in head and neck surgery at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Oregon, she did something that stunned her fellow residents in the tight-knit, high-octane program: She quit. In the years since that 2018 career swerve, Means has leveraged the decision into a platform as a critic in chief of the medical establishment, a medical entrepreneur, and aNew York Timesbest-selling author. Her book,Good Energy,which she cowrote with her brother,Calley Means,a White House special government employee and top adviser to Health and Human Services SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.,describes her transformation from a cog in a profit-driven sick-care system, with medical training that taught her nothing about the root causes of illness, to a physician freed to have “deep conversations” with her patients to help “restore and maintain good health.” It’s a classic conversion story—and for the Means’s hundreds of thousands of followers, it’s proven hugely potent. Casey Means’s time in the trenches, and her claim of willingness to sacrifice her own medical advancement in a corrupt system to fight for America’s health, have, in some corners of the internet, given her apostle status. All of it has also helped make her book a number oneNew York Timesbestseller, with a total of roughly 38 weeks on the best-seller list. On Wednesday, PresidentDonald Trumpsaid he would nominate Means to be America’s next surgeon general. He pulled his previous choice, Dr.Janette Nesheiwat,a former Fox News medical contributor, after itemerged that she had earned her medical degreenot at the University of Arkansas School for Medical Sciences College of Medicine, where she claimed to have gone and where she completed her residency, but at the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine in St. Maarten. (After having her nomination rescinded, Nesheiwat wrote on X that she looked forward to serving Kennedy in a “senior policy role.” Nesheiwat did not immediately respond toVanity Fair’s request for comment.) Means’s nomination has now placed her—as well as her brother, Calley—under an intense spotlight, the culmination of their rapid transformation into standard-bearers of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, a loose coalition that has largely rallied behind the distrust in mainstream medicine that Kennedy has frequently espoused. In celebrating the news of her nomination, FDA commissionerMarty Makaryposted that Means is a “genius physician who has educated millions of Americans about the real story on health.” It’s also brought with it new attacks; online agitatorLaura Loomerand Kennedy’s former running mate,Nicole Shanahan,both derided the pick in the hours after Trump announced it. MAGA world convulsions aside, the more salient question about America’s future top doctor, say some who trained with Means, is her level of authority to issue such a sweeping indictment of the medical establishment. Two former residents and a now retired department chairman tellVanity Fairthat she left the program after suffering from stress, then spun the story as a revelation about medical corruption, benefiting from that retrofitted narrative. Dr.Paul W. Flint,who was chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery at OHSU at the time, tellsVanity Fairthat when Means left the program, it was because she found the surgical work “too stressful” and was not able to continue in the residency. “At least she had the strength to recognize that in her fourth year,” Flint says. “It took a lot of guts. I didn’t push her out the door.” He adds, however, that “you lose some credibility when you just drop out.” He says he believes that since then, she has mischaracterized US medicine as a “conspiracy” to keep people sick. “She’s wrong,” he says, adding, “It’s a certain attitude that denies all the successes that occur in medicine.” When asked for on-the-record responses to questions provided to her for this story, Means did not reply. (Flint’s perspective was first reported by theLA Times.) Casey Means has spent the last year as a burgeoning star of the MAHA movement. She and Calley have appeared on shows hosted byJoe RoganandTucker Carlson,the latter of whom told her—after she described reading “sacred texts and the Bible and Rumi and [Ayn] Rand” from a young age, and discussing those at the family dinner table—“I honestly think you’re going to change the world.” In this media ecosystem, Means’s life story of renouncing the establishment is a key selling point. As she explains inGood Energy,“For most of my adult life, I was a vocal advocate for the modern health care system and collected credentials to rise within its ranks.” Among those credentials: president of her Stanford undergraduate class, a standout student at the Stanford School of Medicine, and an acceptee into the competitive surgical residency at OHSU. There, in 2018, on the precipice of a promising and lucrative career as a surgeon, she found the medical-industrial complex so hyperspecialized and profit-driven, as she has said, that she turned in her scalpel to preach a holistic view of health and wellness. “In September 2018, on my thirty-first birthday and just months shy of completing my five-year residency, I walked into the chairman’s office at OHSU and quit,” she writes inGood Energy.“With a full wall of awards and honors for my clinical and research performance and with prominent hospital systems pursuing me for mid-six-figure faculty roles, I walked out of the hospital and embarked on a journey to understand the real reasons why people get sick and to figure out how to help patients restore and sustain their health” In January 2019, according to Oregon business records, she set up a small medical practice in Portland, focusing on metabolic health despite lacking a degree in nutrition science. In her book, she describes a “plant-filled office, which intentionally looked more like a peaceful living room than a clinical space,” where her patients sat in comfortable armchairs and she addressed the “root causes of illness rather than just treating isolated symptoms.” Seven months later, in August 2019, she cofounded and launched Levels, a health technology company that helps customers track their blood glucose levels using continuous glucose monitors. Her medical license is currently inactive, according to recordsfrom the Oregon medical board. Less than two years later, the Means’s mother, Gayle Brown Means, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died within a few weeks at age 71. It was a devastating loss, and it inspired them to take action, as Calley told Rogan last year. “Casey and I, on her grave site, literally hugged each other and said we want to write a book” to raise awareness about the missed warning signs of poor health that led their mother to be “chopped down by cancer.” By that point, Casey had already “embarked on a journey to understand the real reasons why people get sick,” their book recounts. Some of the doctors who trained with Casey Means, in the program she has since lambasted, question her characterizations as well as her motives for making them. “[It] feels unfair and odd that she passes judgment when she’s never worked truly in this system and has a myopic view because of what she’s left,” one former junior resident who worked with Means tellsVanity Fair. At OHSU, Means entered a program in which she was training to perform ear, nose, throat, and neck surgeries. The hours were grueling and the stakes were often high. In the small training program, the residents were exhausted and “trauma-bonded” because of the workload and stress, as one of them puts it. Two former residents she served alongside offer a version of her departure from the program that matches with Flint’s. They say that contrary to Means’s oft-told version of events, she exited due to her inability to handle the admittedly high pressure. They describe her as being deeply unhappy and fearful of harming patients, and say she took a leave of absence before departing altogether. The former residents also tellVFthat they do not recognize the version of events laid out in the book. In their view, Means misrepresented her residency training and proclaimed a medical conspiracy against good health that simply doesn’t exist. (Both former residents have asked not to be named because they fear retaliation from the Trump administration.) Another resident, who was one year ahead of Means in the program and has asked not to have his name used due to restrictions imposed by his current employer, says, “I thought she handled the stress of the program exceedingly well, and that’s one of the reasons why people wanted her to stay and see it through.” He adds, “The way she explained it to me at the time, she felt it wasn’t the best fit for her, the residency in general and otolaryngology in particular. It wasn’t as fulfilling or rewarding as she expected.” He recalls Means as “overdedicated, sometimes to a fault, and that may have caused some issues with burnout.” Means certainly could have started harboring skepticism of her training while still undergoing it and kept it private. Her book describes her taking a three-month leave of absence to treat her own neck pain a short while before making her decision to leave the program. Flint says that Means returned from leave saying, “‘I still can’t do this.’ She was tearful about it.” He adds that the other residents had to “cover for her, and we’re a small department and all the call falls on them. That’s the problem with late departures.” After she left, the two former residents grew increasingly skeptical of her public claims. “I did not witness a spiritual awakening,” the former junior resident says. “It felt more and more like she was preying on the less educated and using the MD she had to tout these pseudoscience things.” The other former resident observes, “She’s a good person and does care for people and wants what’s best. But it feels disingenuous, demonizing your training. She didn’t make it through.” The former resident adds, “By trying to question our entire field and sowing distrust in medicine, it’s hard to ignore that she may benefit from that.” But as Kennedy wrote on X on Thursday in defense of her nomination, “Casey is the perfect choice for Surgeon General precisely because she left the traditional medical system—not in spite of it. Her leadership has inspired many doctors to reform the system and forge a new path away from sick care, which fills corporate coffers, and toward health care, which enriches all of us.” How anOrgasmic Meditation GroupSparked a Troubled Federal Case Deconstructing Trump’s ElaborateOval Office Makeover Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act MeetCardinal Robert Francis Prevost, the First American Pope Revisit All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet The Dystopian Coming-of-Age StoryStephen KingConsidered Too “Merciless” to Film Wes Anderson’sNext Breakout StarJust So Happens to Be Kate Winslet’s Daughter All ofQuentin Tarantino’s Movies Ranked Elon Musk’s 14 Children and Their Mothers (That We Know Of) From the Archive:Princess Margaret’s Not So Happily-Ever-After",

    "title": "Abigail Spanberger Says She Can Take on Trump Without Bashing Him",
    "article_text": "Abigail Spanbergertalks for nearly three minutes without saying the nameDonald Trump. That’s an eternity in Democratic politics these days. The president lives to draw attention to himself, and his cuts to the federal workforce and federal spending are doing significant damage to the state of Virginia, where Spanberger is the Democratic gubernatorial nominee. Yet one reason she is theearly front-runnerin the race is that Spanberger is so far refusing to allow rage about Trump to dominate the discussion. So when I ask where fighting back against the president ranks among her campaign priorities, Spanberger first talks about the new administration’s negative impact on everything from Virginia research universities to suburban Washington convenience stores to tattoo shops in coastal Hampton Roads. “I am focused on standing up for Virginians, and that means standing up to the Trump administration when their actions are hurting Virginia, Virginia’s economy, our workforce, our people, because that is the job of the governor of Virginia,” she tells me. “My favorite thing is when the pollsters come back and they’re like, ‘Wow, people are really talking about the economy.’ I’m like, No shit. Thank you for validating what I’m hearing on the ground.” Spanberger’s campaign—in a purplish state that has an incumbent Republican governor but went forKamala Harrislast November—is an intriguing test case for a Democratic Party that’s being roiled by arguments over how to rebound. The strongest energy has been on the populist left, with Vermont senatorBernie Sandersand New York congresswomanAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezdrawing huge crowds for their “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies. I tell Spanberger I am not asking her to proclaim a solution for the party as a whole. “Everyone else does!” she says, both brightly and sarcastically. “We should just take a second and listen to people,” she continues. “We’re a broad-tent party, and I think we should celebrate that rather than trying to figure out, Okay, who was the most recently successful Democrat? Now everybody do the same thing.” Spanberger, 45, is tough, funny, and passionately pragmatic, a profile forged by her eclectic background. The daughter of a cop and a nurse, she was born near the Jersey Shore (her mother and aunt went to high school withBruce Springsteen). As a teenager, she moved to suburban Richmond with her family, eventually graduating from the University of Virginia. Spanberger, a mother of three daughters, later became a CIA case officer, specializing in terrorism and nuclear proliferation. She owes her political career, in a sense, to Trump. In 2018, Spanberger was a member of a group of Democratic women who ran for Congress for the first time in reaction to Trump’s original White House win. She served three terms in the House of Representatives, compiling a bipartisan legislative record, twice declining to vote forNancy Pelosias Speaker, and occasionally criticizing PresidentJoe Biden. In November 2023, Spanberger announced she would leave Congress at the end of her term to run for governor in 2025.Mark Rozell,the dean of the school of policy and government at George Mason University, initially expected Spanberger to face a progressive primary challenger looking to “vanquish the opposition.” But no one emerged. “In statewide elections, Virginia can lurch from one party to the other, so it’s not really clear that running a more firebrand progressive would yield a good result for the Democrats in this state,” Rozell says.Stephanie Taylor,cofounder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (and a native Virginian), cautions against extrapolating from Spanberger’s middle-of-the-road approach to the national Democratic debate. “She is working to include progressives and progressive values into her coalition,” Taylor says. “But I would be careful about reading too much into the race.” The Republican nominee is the state’s current lieutenant governor,Winsome Earle-Sears.She is already trying to lash Spanberger to Biden, pointing to the Democrat’s congressional votes on pandemic-era federal spending bills as being responsible for boosted inflation. Spanberger parries that Earle-Sears and her Virginia Republican colleagues were happy to take credit for spending all that infrastructure money. But then Spanberger does something more interesting than throwing partisan punches: She comes close to admitting that mistakes were made. “The choices we made in an exigent circumstance are choices that, at that moment in time, I stand by,” she says. “Now, hindsight being 20/20, we should all be learning from what we did or didn’t do. And in the event, God forbid, we are ever in that sort of crisis mode again, we will make better choices.” Spanberger is also making a choice when it comes to Trump and her campaign—hardly ignoring the president, but focusing on the wreckage rather than on resistance rhetoric. “While standing up to Trump, or the discussion of what Trump is doing, isn’t necessarily the thing that I lead with, it is the foundation on which there’s urgency to all of these types of things,” she says. Spanberger believes her part on the Democratic road to recovery is delivering on everyday needs, from broadband access to housing prices to teacher training, while defending core civil rights, including legal access to abortion. “Even talking about teacher residency programs—there’s a strong measure of success in those programs, and now the federal government has cut dollars.” That framework makes sense given the job she’s seeking. One risk, though, is that Spanberger’s centrist approach might not meet the polarized moment and motivate enough Democratic voters in November. Spanberger scoffs at my suggestion. “Come to my events. They’re quite crowded and energized,” she says. “If you’re working 80 hours a week to pay the rent and put food on the table and, oh my God, hopefully your kid doesn’t get sick—they don’t want to be excited. They want somebody to fix it. They want to know that somebody cares and is decisively focused on the issues that matter to people.Thatis actually compelling. Whether it’s exciting, I don’t know. I’ll let people determine their own emotions.” How anOrgasmic Meditation GroupSparked a Troubled Federal Case Deconstructing Trump’s ElaborateOval Office Makeover Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act MeetCardinal Robert Francis Prevost, the First American Pope Revisit All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet The Dystopian Coming-of-Age StoryStephen KingConsidered Too “Merciless” to Film Wes Anderson’sNext Breakout StarJust So Happens to Be Kate Winslet’s Daughter All ofQuentin Tarantino’s Movies Ranked Elon Musk’s 14 Children and Their Mothers (That We Know Of) From the Archive:Princess Margaret’s Not So Happily-Ever-After",

    "title": "Laura Loomer Is on an Anti-MAHA Social Media Rampage, Showing More Cracks in Trump’s Influencer Sphere",
    "article_text": "Laura Loomeris noMarie Kondo.The right-wing provocateurlovesmess. This week, Loomer has taken umbrage with major MAHA movement personnel and their boosters: Loomer, via her very active social media presence, has come out against new surgeon general nomineeCasey Means, accusing her ofbeing unvettedand unqualified for the role, as well asJessica Reed Kraus,wannabe White House reporterandRobert F. Kennedy Jr.fan, who is also known by her social handle HouseInhabit. Loomer’s recent bit has been promoting herself as a master vetter, the ultimate unearther of skeletons in political closets. Her crowded timeline is essentially a case study in mean, self-promotion by way of being last woman standing: Means, in the running to become America’s Next Top Doctor, ismore akin to a witch than a doctor, in Loomer’s characterization, and a photo of Kraus huggingMichael Cohen(who, as you’ll recall, isDonald Trump’s former fixer whotestified against him in the hush-money trialthat led Trump to becoming thefirst president to also be a convicted felon. After the election,Cohen unsuccessfully called for the case against his former boss, who oncereferred to him as “a rat,”to be dismissed) is evidence that she is a Democratic plant sent to infiltrate and destroy the presidency. Unspoken is the implication that Loomer, with the power of Google at her fingertips, not only passes the purity test, but should be the one to administer it to others before they cross the threshold at the White House. MAHA, according to Loomer, is failing its health exam. Loomer is about as far right as it’s possible to go,self-describing as a “proud Islamophobe”during her unsuccessful 2020 congressional bid and maintaining thatMuslims are “unfit for holding office.”The frequent twitterstorms and shitfits, complete with shock-value name-calling (on a February 28 episode of her streaming show,Loomer Unleashed,she referred to Kraus as an “insufferable cunt”) and stunts worthy of aJackassspin-off (handcuffing herself to the Twitter headquarters for hours when she was banned from the platform; asking a person who she thought looked Muslimto “disavow terrorism;”eating MAGA-coded dog food for a few bucksand going back for seconds, and more) would seem to make her easy to write off as another shrieking harpy, but, terrifyingly, she seems to have the ear ofDonald Trump. The self-proclaimed pro-white nationalisthas traveled on his planeand in his entourage multiple times, and in April,after Loomer met with Trump,JD Vance, and other officials, claiming that she had a list of people within the administration who were disloyal and undermining, six National Security Council officials were promptly canned. “Laura Loomer is a very good patriot and she is a very strong person,”Trump told reportersthe next day on Air Force One. “I saw her yesterday for a little while. She makes recommendations of things and people, and sometimes I listen to those recommendations.” What Loomer left out of her recap of the remarks on social media was Trump denying that she had influenced the decision to fire the staffer. “No, not at all,” he said,according to theNew York Times. Loomer alsoclaimed in late Aprilthat Trump has told his team to offer her a job several times, but those White House scoundrels “do not listen to him. His staff undermine his authority.” In April 2023, theTimesreportedthat Loomer was set to be hired on Trump’s campaign, but that staff backlash halted the hire. Loomer, then, declined to comment “out of respect for President Trump.” Still, Loomer is kamikaze-ing into the heart of MAGA, taking down those she believes to be bad actors down with her. “MAHA is literally being taken over by Marxists and Grifters,” shetweeted on Thursday, declaring the current situation “A TOTAL CRISIS!” “I’m glad I initiated the MAHA breakup,”she asserted, also on Thursday. “Many of these grifters needed to be exposed for who they are.” She doesn’t specify in those tweets who the breakup was between, butin another missiveshe points out Means and her family as the Marxist grifters in question, partly due to Means’s father,Grady Means, authoring a children’s book,The Adventures of Felix the Flamingo: Based On Many True Stories.” In the book, the titular Felix “begins to discover that he is an unusual bird who has lost his way,” according to its Amazon summary, which also touts exploration of gender and sexuality issues in the brightly colored pages. WhenCalley Means, brother of Casey and son of Grady, as well as acurrent advisor to Kennedy at the Department of Health and Human Services, pushed back on one of Loomer’s many critiques of Casey as being not a real doctor,Loomer dared the siblings to“condemn your father for writing a book encouraging children to be transgender.” “I don’t want a Surgeon General that isn’t capable of condemning their own family member for pushing child mutilation,” Loomer continued. “Do you and your sister condemn your father?” They did not, it would seem.Calley saidthat the book was written “when a gay family friend was suicidal. It has nothing to do with trans.” Loomer alsosuggested ThursdaythatMarco Rubioshould take on yet another federal side hustle and add surgeon general to the list, appending a screenshot froman October 2024 newsletter published by Casey Means listing thingsshe did in pursuit of finding love, including praying to photos of her ancestors, talking to trees and asking them to help her out, and wishing on stars. Loomer, a woman who makes her living as someone who says a lot of inflammatory things on the internet for attention, found another woman who makes her living saying a lot of inflammatory things on the internet for attention—beyond Means—to put in her crosshairs this week. Ina tweet Tuesdaystyled as a note toLara Trump, Loomer highlighted Kraus for hugging Cohen, who, she says, “tried to have your father in law jailed for life.” (The maximum sentence for Trump’s charges isfour years in federal prison, and though he was found guilty of 34 counts, legal experts said that any sentences would likely have been served concurrently.) She accused Kraus and wellness influencerVani Hari, who also sat front row at the confirmation hearingsfor Kennedy, of being “opportunistic liberal women who are pariah social climbers” and “subversive infiltrators in your circle who are trying to serve as Trojan horses to possibly undermine you and your family with their leftist agendas.” She pointed out that Kraus was a Kennedy supporter and didn’t vote for Trump—which is true. Kraus has in fact taken heat for not voting at all in the 2024 election, claiming, depending on the day, that she was either too busy supporting Trump and traveling to get her ballot in, or that she wanted to “remain untethered” to political parties. She has also spoken aboutidentifying in the past as a “super liberal” Democrat, but changing her allegiances during the Covid-19 pandemic. When Cohen responded to Loomer’s tweet byproclaiming himself to be a “bipartisan hugger,”Loomer was having exactly none of it. She also offered up a new spin on the “not like other girls” ‘tude. “There are women who are workers, and then there’s women who are social climbers and opportunists who will throw anyone under the bus for some access and a selfie,” she wrote in part. “I’m not like those women. It’s why I go out of my way to avoid groups of women.” And for good measure? “You won’t ever get a hug from me. I value loyalty and principles.” It would appear that Loomer issaving her affectionsfor former veep candidateSarah Palin, who onWednesday praisedLoomer’s “belated vetting of political appointments,” including an uncropped screenshot of a photo of herself and Loomer together. Loomerhappily acceptedthe praise from thefamously undervetted Palin, retweeting her and adding: “Thank you, @SarahPalinUSA! Very kind of you to say! I have always admired you! Vetting matters!” Yes,just ask John McCainabout how much vetting matters. Laura Loomer, Casey Means, Jessica Reed Kraus, and the White House did not immediately respond toVanity Fair's request for comment.

    "title": "Was Harry Styles at the Vatican to Catch a Glimpse of Pope Leo?",
    "article_text": "Those who were at St. Peter's Basilica on Thursday afternoon posted photos or social stories, sent selfies to friends or tried to be immortalized by the hundreds of cameras that came from all over the world to document the election ofthe new Pope. Among the crowd, however, someone also tried, failing completely, to blend in.Harry Styleswas spotted right in the Vatican square, looking out onto that balcony from whichPope Leo XIV, born Robert Francis Prevost, would soon be emerge. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. The former member ofOne Directionmingled among the faithful wearing a blue jacket, dark sunglasses and a gray baseball cap emblazoned with the words \"Techno is My Boyfriend,\" known to fashion addicts for being particularly beloved of Valentino's creative directorAlessandro Michele, a close friend of the singer, whom he met during his time working as a designer for Gucci. The hat, sold by Idea,became almost unobtainable after photos of the star in Rome went viral, immediately triggering the irony of users, who especially on X indulged in hilarious comments. Like one who, next to an image of the new pontiff facing the crowd, wrote, \"The Pope did not know he was greeting Harry Styles.\" This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Another, on the other hand, tells of exchanging a couple of jokes with him, \"I met this guy on my way home tonight. We started chatting and I said, 'You look just like Harry Styles,' and he said, 'It's because I am Harry Styles.'\" From what we can tell, no one seems to have bothered him much, but if Styles' intent was to enjoy the solemn moment of the Pope's investiture anonymously, judging by the amount of paparazzi around the web, the mission can be said to have failed miserably. Although, to be fair, meeting the singer on the streets of Rome is becoming less and less unusual. It is not the first time, in fact, that he has spent a few days in the capital, where he also celebrated his 31st birthday last Feb. 1. After the 2023 Love on Tour, Styles is currently working on a new album, indulging in frequent getaways around the world in the meantime. After Rome in February, he went to Tokyo, where in March he ran in the Tokyo marathon. That same month, he was also seen in London. Now the return to Rome, with which he seems so much in love that, according to rumors, he is thinking of buying a house in the historic center (after the one already purchased in the Viterbo village, Civita di Bagnoregio). In the meantime, he is familiarizing himself with the city, often touring it by bike and lingering in the spots dearest to Romans, such as Porta Portese, where in June 2024 a video that had gone around the world caught him browsing among the flea market stalls. And on Thursday, finally, at St. Peter's: could this mean he's staying in Rome for good?

    "title": "Breaking: It Was an Incredible Week in New York",
    "article_text": "On Tuesday night, those seeking to snag a walk-in table at Balthazar were greeted with an unusual sign. Hung by the door at one of the most iconic French bistros to ever open in America was a note: “Closed for a Funeral.” Fair enough. And yet, if you peeked inside, those milling around were hardly in mourning attire, and there seemed to be quite a bit of celebratory champagne flowing, and hey…was thatAlec Baldwinlimping around? (More on this in a bit.) The “funeral” was actually a morbid front for a book party forKeith McNally,the restaurant’s owner, who has perhaps become better known for the acerbic wit on display in his relentless, very funny, improbably popular Instagram account. Bored during the pandemic, with his restaurants all shut down, McNally used the platform to reflect on his decades in hospitality, lash out at enemies, praise his famous friends, and wax poetic about the glory of living in Manhattan, the land of beauty and brains and financial power. The easy fluency of his captions led to a book. His memoir,I Regret Almost Everything,is a buoyant, frequently hilarious look at life after he had a stroke, a recovery story without your typical narrative, dotted with characters famous and not. It’s out this week, so McNally threw himself a book party. Scratch that—he threw himselftwobook parties, one of which fell on what might be the busiest night on the Manhattan calendar. It’s clear to basically anyone in the creative industries that this first week of May is the week-long stretch that makes this city’s cultural offerings the best in the world. The five-day feast kicks off with the maelstrom of pop-culture content creation that is the Met Gala, where the concepts of celebrity and fashion have a night at the museum. Then it’s off to hundreds of gallery openings throughout town, from the blue-chip temples in Chelsea to the younger upstarts in Tribeca. On top of that, there are a dozen art fairs, from the global behemoth Frieze to the Maastricht-based TEFAF to the smaller but potent homegrown fair Independent. There are also billions of dollars of art on display at the three major auction houses, ready for the sales to start next week. Into this, McNally unleashed his two-night self-fêting. The crowd Monday night seemed highfalutin’ enough that it was unclear how McNally might follow it…until I sawWoody Allen,whom McNally has unwaveringly supported on his aforementioned Instagram account, walk into the double doors on Tuesday. Upon entrance, I took a perch next toAmos Poe,the legendary New York filmmaker who’s known McNally since the ’70s and gets a mention in the memoir when McNally describes his favorite things about living downtown during that period: “theVillage Voice,CBGB, Spring Street Books, the Mudd Club, the Bleecker Street Cinema, the bars of Mickey Ruskin and the films of Amos Poe.” (Poe is also my father-in-law, but hey, it was a family kind of evening.) We started doing some people watching. It was like the ultimate murderer’s row of Gotham’s cultural elites: sitting next to Allen was the writerMichael Wolff,who’s out with his latest Trump book,All or Nothing.Down the table from them was Baldwin, who later explained that he had torn his meniscus, which sounds quite painful.Griffin Dunnewalked by, and galleristCharles Moffettwas sitting with Le Bernardin chefEric Ripert,and the restaurateurStephen Starrwas a table over.Tony Shalhoubwas standing by the bar with the comedianJeff Ross.McNally sat himself with only his family, and, later,Christy Turlington. But hey, it’s not all movie stars and models and funny guys—Vanity Fair’sLili Anolikwas there, along withCarl Bernstein,who was seated with the filmmakerAlexi Wasser.Bestselling author and chef andburgeoning stand-up comicPadma Lakshmi? Padma was there. My seatmate was the poetMax Blagg,a dapper Englishman who moved to New York in 1971 and is a repository of SoHo knowledge—he can still remember walking into the space we were currently inhabiting when it was a gigantic leather factory, when the whole neighbourhood was factories, when it was Hell’s Hundred Acres. After appetizers and before the entire room was served steak frites, actorRichard E. Granttook the podium to read some excerpts from McNally’s book. “I know you were all at the Met Gala, and like me, you’re all hungover,” Grant deadpanned, though at least one dinner guestwasactually at the party the night prior: Condé Nast global chief content officerAnna Wintour. Before he began reading, Grant invited McNally up to the podium. “This is a very sad night for me,” McNally said. “This is the first time I’ve ever not been given a check. So now I must leave!” The endless spree of happenings began Monday morning, with a press preview at The Met—the exhibition at the Costume Institute is unveiled to editors prior to the big party that night. The show’s a knockout. After the editors soon split for Sant Ambroeus—and one nearly knocked intoJeremy Allen White,with his cap on and AirPods in—it was on to pre-parties galore, followed by a red carpet that was especially loaded with VIP art stars this year.Rashid Johnson, Amy Sherald, Lorna Simpson, Eric N. Mack, Henry Taylor,Met trusteeJordan Casteel, Alex Da Corte, Cy Gavin(whose artwork is what you see emblazoned on the tent in all of the red-carpet photos) andArthur Jafa,resplendent in Fear of God, all made appearances, as did Gagosian directorAntwaun Sargent.There were after-parties—so, so many after-parties—but many of those in the art world opted to skip out in favor of pre-Frieze festivities, such as an event at a collector’s home in the Dakota honoringCecilia Alemani,who is curating the SITE Santa Fe International this summer. Also on Monday,Pierre Huygheopened an insane show at Marian Goodman, his first at the gallery in 14 years, withwork that was first shownat Francois Pinault’s Punta della Dogana in Venice last year. In attendance, somewhat surprisingly, wasThe Brutalistdirector and writerBrady Corbet—a confirmed Huyghe-head, we’re pleased to report.Raf Simonswas there to soak up the terrifying LED masks on mannequins. A dinner followed at Overstory, the private room on the 66th floor of a Deco skyscraper in the Financial District above Manhattan that allegedly has amazing views. But a cloud had consumed Manhattan, engulfing the space in a fog that seemed very much like…a Pierre Huyghe work. The vernissages and cocktail parties fanned out throughout Manhattan, but on Wednesday morning, the masses all assembled in the shadow ofThomas Heatherwick’sVesselto attend the pre-fair breakfast for Frieze New York, taking place, once again, at the Shed. Frieze is in a funny place right now. After a year on the block as part of previous owner Endeavor’s take-private by Silver Lake Capital, the fairannouncedlast week that superagent and Endeavor principalAri Emanuelwould acquire the fairs, which now include Expo Chicago and New York’s the Armory Show. The market sees Emanuel as a steady hand; he’s already owned the thing for a decade, and he’s pledged to keep CEOSimon Foxat the wheel. But rumors still swirled about how the New York fair would be at a different location come next year. As nice as it is to navigate a 65-booth outing, art fairs make money when hundreds of galleries pay booth fees, and Emanuel’s purchase valued the whole unit at $200 million. Time to up the profits, some say. Speculation aside, it was clear that the fair’s blue-chip denizens brought the goods this year. An obvious highlight was Gagosian’s booth featuring three works fromJeff Koons’sHulk Elvisseries, masterful cast bronze sculptures of Bruce Banner’s angry side enveloped by musical instruments.Anderson Cooperwalked by an hour into the fair, and then moved on to the David Zwirner booth, featuring a remarkable array of works bySherrie Levine,paintings aping Mondrian and Picabia, along with a big cast bronze caribou skull, and, again, Raf Simons.Tracey Eminwas on hand to see her big new painting in the White Cube booth. By the afternoon, things were getting quite scene-y. The writerKaty Hesselwas locked in conversation withCaspar Joplingand the artistEmil Sands,while a few feet away, the collectorPamela Joynerstepped off the elevator. I was standing outside when I saw something remarkable. A Rolls-Royce glided up to the entrance, and out cameMichael Shvo,the real estate tycoonlast seen by this columnist hanging out withPeter Marinoin Miami Beach, on an AirPods-in call, seamlessly talking as the Rolls drove away. (McNally’s habit of putting bad restaurant etiquette on blast?Yeah, he did that to Michael Shvo.) But was anything actually…selling? The art market’s been slumping for over a year now, and certainly the post–Liberation Day mood isn’t helping things. What’s a mega-rich lover of the arts to do in America? “All the art advisers are telling their clients this is a good time to buy, and all the financial advisers are telling them to keep all their cash on hand,” one observer noted. Maybe the quality of work on view was too good to not be snapped up. By the end of the day, White Cube found a buyer for the Emin painting at a price of £1.2 million. Word around the fair is that Gagosian sold one of the Koons sculptures for around $3 million. Karma’s booth, one of the more successful group show presentations at the fair, sold well: a small Gertrude Abercrombie work for $350,000, an oil painting by Richard Mayhew for $350,000, a painting by Manoucher Yektai for $275,000, and a painting byReggie Burrows Hodgesfor $175,000. Hauser & Wirth pulled off a pretty great flex. They brought works by gallery artists Rashid Johnson, Amy Sherald, Lorna Simpson, and Jack Whitten, all the subjects of grand-scale museum surveys at the city’s most prominent museums: the Guggenheim, the Whitney, The Met, and MoMA, respectively. And the gallery sold work by all of them, for prices as high as $1.2 million. “The crowd and conversations today have been incredibly upbeat,” said gallery presidentMarc Payot.“Perhaps most significantly, the energy this first day at the fair has been amazingly optimistic.” Usually by Thursday of an art fair week the powder’s spent, the collectors are jetting off to somewhere else—consider Art Basel Miami Beach, where, as I reported last year,people have started to bragabout leaving onWednesday,after the VIP preview opens, days before the public are even allowed to see the fair. The opposite happens in New York—Thursday is arguably thebusierday. TEFAF New York, an offshoot of the fair in Maastricht, launched an Upper East Side edition in 2016, and it’s come close to taking the crown from Frieze, at least in terms of prestige. All the city’s major galleries take a booth at the Park Avenue Armory. There, on Thursday afternoon, VIPs could peruse and buy new paintings byAnna Weyantat Gagosian, historical works by Ruth Asawa at Zwirner, and a wealth of earlyGeorge Condoworks on paper at Gladstone, including one that’s an homage to his friend Jean-Michel Basquiat. There’s also, of course, Basquiats, specifically at the Van de Weghe booth, whereChristophe van de Wegheis offering the artist’s 1984 portrait of Michael Patterson, his friend from the nightclub Area. Collectors such asTico MugrabiandAby Rosenwandered through, and while the oysters (top notch) were free in a nod to the fair’s Dutch origins, a single glass of bubbly set back guests nearly $50. The art was considerably pricier, still. At the Richard Green booth, the London gallery brought a towering 2009Stanley Whitneyto tie the whole thing together, along with a Frank Auerbach painting of his muse, Juliet Yardley Mills, seated. And over at Edward Tyler Mahem, there wasBarkley Hendricks’sSelina/Star,an incredible portrait that sold in 2020 for $937,500 at Phillips. The market in general may be softening, but not for everyone. Sources said the Hendricks had a price tag of more than three times the sale price at the auction five years ago. By Thursday evening, there was another art fair of sorts taking over the smattering of blocks between 10th and 11th Avenues in Chelsea. Already open through the week were painting bonanzas such asSalman Toorat Luhring Augustine,William Kentridgeat Hauser, a historical show of Warhol’s oxidation paintings at Skarstedt, and the boisterous, uncanny installations by the inimitable German artistRosemarie Trockel,in a two-part show between Gladstone’s Chelsea space and Sprüth Magers on the Upper East Side. In Chelsea on Thursday, Zwirner opened its brand new building on 19th Street withnewwork by itsnewestmarket star,Michael Armitage.But it was still a bit overshined by the spectacle two blocks away:Takashi Murakami’s first show with Gagosian in the neighborhood since 2014, a series of epically sized paintings based on Utagawa Hiroshige’s prints from the 1850s that inspired the Impressionists toward Japonisme. On Wednesday, more than 24 hours before the official opening,Larry Gagosianhimself strolled through the show, with a flurry of his staffers giving private tours to hand-selected clients. By Thursday night, a line to get into the gallery snaked down the block. For the dinner celebrating the opening, well, it could only be at one place: Jean’s, the extremelyboom boom aesthetic–coded sleaze-tastic eatery on Lafayette Street in the space that once housed Butter,thescene-forward restaurant of the aughts,asRichie Akivacan attest to. A few days ago, Jean’s hostedA$AP RockyandRihanna’s Met Galaafter-party, and now it was Murakami’s party. On the menu was shrimp cocktail, cheeseburgers, and steak tartare. A pretty serious number of heavy-hitter collectors and curators were in attendance. Gagosian directorNick Simunovicgave a heartfelt toast about Murakami’s show, raising a glass to the artist, who was sitting with Gagosian. After the dinner, I went to my apartment to let the dog out, and me and the ridgeback—who is named Butter, not after the Akiva-era spot, but a fun coincidence—strolled down the dog-friendly stretch of Great Jones Street, past the fire station, then found our way back to the dinner, a few blocks from my place. What I encountered outside of Jean’s was remarkable: crowds of people with Murakami posters and merch and handbags and albums he designed, hoping Murakami himself, in town for just a few days, might sign them. Paparazzi was present. It was beautiful mayhem, and all part of the best week for culture in New York. Have a tip?

    "title": "King Charles Sends Pope Leo XIV a Private Message of Congratulations",
    "article_text": "A king who has always described himself as a peacemaker, as he did during a 2020 speech in Davos, could not remain indifferent to the first words spoken byPope Leo XIVfrom the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica: \"Peace be with all of you!\" On Friday, from Buckingham Palace comes confirmation thatKing Charles III,Supreme Governor of the Church of England, sent a private message to the new pontiff, elected only Thursday to the Chair of Saint Peter. Newly elected Pope Leo XIV, Robert Prevost addresses the crowd on the main central loggia balcony overlooking St Peter's Square on May 08, 2025 in Vatican City, Vatican. White smoke was seen over the Vatican early this evening as the Conclave of Cardinals took just two days to elect Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who will be known as Pope Leo (Leone) XIV, as the 267th Supreme Pontiff after the death of Pope Francis on Easter Monday. \"The King has sent a private message toPope Leo XIV, congratulating him on his election as the 267th Pontiff and Bishop of Rome. His Majesty sent his, and Her Majesty’s, most sincere good wishes for his Pontificate,\" reads the official note. A congratulatory message that also carries with it the signature ofQueen Camilla. The royal couple hadmet with Pope Francis in April, during the last day of his state visit to Italy, before leaving Rome and heading to Ravenna. It wasa private meeting with Francis, while the official visit to the Vatican, which was supposed to include a moment in the Sistine Chapel, now the scene of Leo XIV's first mass, had been postponed. But not canceled: According to sources close to the Palace, the visit will be rescheduled in the coming months, now with the new pontiff. In this handout image supplied by the Vatican on April 10, King Charles III and Queen Camilla meet Pope Francis during day three of their State visit to The Republic of Italy on April 09, 2025 in Vatican City. Their Majesties will attend a State Banquet at the Palazzo Quirinale, hosted by The President. He is the first pope to come from the United States. Pope Leo XIV, born Robert Francis Prevost, was born in Chicago in 1955, to a father of French and Italian descent and a Spanish mother. His path was then marked by a long stay in South America, between missions in Chulucanas and Trujillo, Peru. It was an experience that left a profound imprint on his pastoral vision, as was also evident from his first speech, delivered in Italian and Spanish (and without a single word in English). From Spain, meanwhile, came official congratulations fromKing Felipe VIandQueen Letizia: \"We congratulate Cardinal Prevost on his election as the new pontiff, Pope Leo XIV. His call for peace inspires us, encourages us and reflects the deep desire and feelings of the Spanish people.\" Words that recall once again the common thread of this new election: peace. A theme that seems to run through the first international reactions, such as that ofPrince Albert IIof Monaco, who expressed in French, the official language of Monegasque protocol, his \"fervent prayers for the greatness of the pontificate\" of Leo XIV. And it is precisely at the Vatican, in mid-May, that Pope Leo XIV will return to welcome Spanish Jubilee brethren, including representatives of the Esperanza de Málaga, a community to which he is particularly attached, following his 2007 visit to Colegio Los Olivos. An American pope, a British king, European sovereigns: the echo of Leo XIV's election crosses borders and continents, like a shared call to dialogue and reconciliation. “Peace be with you, unarmed and disarming. Help us build bridges to be one people” – Pope Leo's first words struck a chord.

    "title": "A Close-Up Look at Kristi Noem’s Attempts to Glamorize MAGA and Affirm Trumpian Codes of “Femininity”",
    "article_text": "Department of Homeland Security SecretaryKristi Noemnever fails to make headlines. Whether posing for photos at anEl Salvadorian prison wearing a $50,000 Rolex watchor regalingreaderswith the tale ofkilling her family dog, Noem has made a point to keep all eyes on her. After her purse—which contained $3,000 in cash—was stolen over Easter and subsequent arrests made,she claimedthe suspect, Mario Bustamante Leiva, had been in the \"country illegally for years.” And then there's just the way she presents herself. Celebrities know how to deploymethod dressingfor press tours for blockbuster releases, and Noem is bringingthe same sort of publicity-hungry fashion energyto thepolitical theater, through an apparently endless supply of cowboy hats,pilot-inspired leather jackets, and baseball caps, plus a heap of ultra-conventional gender performance for good measure.Donald Trumpis asilver screen executivefor theinfluencer-age, so it's logical that the supporting cast is also camera-ready, and Noem has made her roleindelible. When Noem first came onto the scene in 2010 during her run for Congress with a fluffy, feathered lob, à laKate Gosselin, she wouldn’t have been out of place in any corporate office setting. Fast forward to the current MAGA era and herhair cascades in waves, the lipgloss is high-shine, and the lashes are full, lookingFox News-readyat any moment. The ease with which Noem costumes herself for far-right political activism has earned her the nicknames Cosplay Kristi and ICE Barbie—and shows a sincere awareness of the strategic power of aesthetics, playing to the tastes of one President Trump. See: her lengthy vlog documenting hercosmetic dental proceduresto “fix her smile” when speculation swirled around whether she might be tapped for the VP spot. (Travelers United sued herfor “undisclosed advertisement” which it claimed violated a consumer protection law; a judgedismissedthe complaint last May). It's true the style choices and physical appearances of female politicians have been, historically, more heavily scrutinized than their male counterparts. Not least by Trump himself. Referring to Noem when the twospoke at a Ohio rally in 2024: “You’re not allowed to say it, so I will not. You’re not allowed to say she’s beautiful, so I’m not going to say it.” Noem’s hyper-feminine look, polished to apageant-y sheen, is by no means an accident, particularly in light of thecomments Trump has made regarding the appearancesof those close to him and his apparent preference for women to“dress like women.”Like any cultural moment there is a certainvisualstyle guide to being MAGA—the New YorkTimesrecently offered ananalysis of exactlywhat that means—and Noem stands as an exemplar of it. Here, a close look at how Noem’s aesthetic shifts have lined up with her public actions. Whether dressing up as anelectricianand ahighway patrolmanto sell the idea of working in South Dakota in local ads or donning accessories that gained her the “ICE Barbie” nickname, Noem has taken the notion ofpolitical theatreto it's most surface degree. Noem has distilled the look of “Trump's kind of woman” by often wearing some variations of the American flag colors, long waves with a middle part and highlights—at times calling to mind not only the women on Fox News but also those of the Trump family tree. Last year saw Noem on the Trump rally circuit, a book tour of sorts as shetried to make a molehillof the mountain of oddities in her memoir released later in the year, and to top it off she was barred fromseven of the nine reservationslocated within South Dakota. While her one-woman-show didn't land her the VP position she was able to bid her gubernatorial post farewell and step into the role of Secretary of Homeland Security with a fresh balayage. Noem's national notice grew in leaps and bound in 2021 as shebannedtransgender girls from sports via executive order,fielded a scandal overhandling of her daughter’s real estate appraiser license, and enjoyed CPAC praise as she lauded South Dakota's pandemic response, of course despite the data sayingotherwise. One of Noem's earlier interactions with Trump centered on his visage as he'd shared he always dreamed of being carved into Mount Rushmore. Reminded of the commentby the Guardianin 2022 (January 6 insurrection was just the year prior), Noem said, “I don’t think we’re adding any faces to Mount Rushmore any time soon. It is pretty special just the way it is.\" With Trump's first turn at the Oval Office fresh in mind and a second run on the horizon, Noem's transformation kicked into higher gear as speculation swirled around whether she might get the VP tap. Four Congressional terms later, Noem staged her homecoming with a bid that saw her become the first woman elected governor of South Dakota,a narrow win at 51 percent of the vote. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee in her final term in the House, she helped pass the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017— emphasizing provisions in the bill as addressing needs ofworking mothersin her state. When Noem was detailing the importance of closet space to NPR in 2015, it had nothing to do with her current rotation of costumes. Instead she and fellow lawmakers on Capitol Hill were working by day and sleeping in their offices by night—in Noem's case on apull-out. Bolstered by the 2010s girlboss era, a fresh, more structured take on theKate Gosselinasymmetrical haircut and abachelor’s degreein political science from South Dakota State University, Noem focused her efforts on the 2012 Farm Bill,imploringthen-PresidentObama's support. Signed into law January 2014, the bill included a “sodsaver” provision meant to incentivize conservation of prairie land and protection of wetlands. At a moment when the Republican party was particularly cognizant of being perceived as a “party of southern white men,” Noem was touted as a breath ofdiverseair for the GOP amid a greaterwaveof Republican women running in 2010. Her narrow defeat of four-term incumbent Rep.Stephanie Herseth Sandlinlanded her immediate notice for her freshman term. Also notable at the time was herdisavowingfull-scale dismantling of governmentdepartments—not so much the case today. Noem's firstadfor her Congressional bid invoked a down home sensibility with a full denim getup and prominent belt buckle; connecting her support for her family (\"I came home to help run the family farm.\") to her campaign promises.

    "title": "Even Cubs Fans Are Excited About Da Pope, a Sox Fan and Chicago’s Hometown Hero",
    "article_text": "On an unseasonably chilly and windy Thursday afternoon in Chicago, a dozen or so people stood outside Wrigley Field, their phones drawn to snap a picture of the iconic marquee. It was celebratingthe new pope,Robert Prevost,henceforth known as Leo XIV, who was (incorrectly, it seems) rumored to be a Cubs fan. One advertisement after another flashed across the screen—for Home Run Inn pizza, for Jewel-Osco, for the Wendella boat tour—but nothing about the Chicago-born pontiff. “It feels like we’re waiting for the white smoke,” I said to the guy standing next to me. “I was just thinking the same thing,” he replied as a frigid breeze blew across Clark Street. “I’d rather be in Rome.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Incidentally, I had just recently gotten back from Rome; my wife and I happened to be there when Pope Francis passed, the day after Easter. And when we went to the Vatican that evening to pay our respects like the good—albeit lapsed—Catholics we are, we found ourselves being interviewed by an Italian television reporter. “Do you want the next pope to be an American?” she asked. An American pope, at this moment in America? No, that’s all right, we said. AChicagopope, though? Well, that’s a different story. Leo—who holds dual United States and Peruvian citizenship—was born at Mercy Hospital on Chicago’s South Side, grew up in the far south suburb of Dolton, and studied at Chicago’s Catholic Theological Union while teaching math and physics at St. Rita on the southwest side, where it is common to identify not by neighborhood but by parish. (My stepdad went to St. Rita. My wife was part of the first class of girls to graduate from its rival, Marist. I went to public school in the suburbs and am still trying to wrap my head around all these feuds.) Those Chicago roots could give Prevost a “unique perspective,” saidJames Robinson,dean of the University of Chicago Divinity School. “I think it’s really incredible that he comes from here,” Robinson told me. “Chicago people like to talk about this as the City of Broad Shoulders, the Windy City, but it is also, in my opinion, one of the most interesting religious cities in the country and the world.” Hyde Park—home of the University of Chicago, as well as the CTU, where Prevost studied—is “the center for the mixing of [religious] traditions,” Robinson said, adding that that’s “something that’s needed, I think, more than anything in this increasingly divisive world.” Michael Patrick Murphy,director of Loyola University’s Hank Center for the Catholic Intellectual Heritage and a senior lecturer at the school, had dinner with Prevost last summer in west suburban Wheaton while they were working on a project together. “We had a great couple hours,” Murphy told me. “He was such a great guy.” They exchanged emails; Murphy still has Prevost’s cell number saved in his phone. Now the 69-year-old is the leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics. “It’s mind-boggling,” Murphy said. “Chicago’s gonna eat this up.” Indeed, the new pope’s Chicago roots have already elicited waves of jokes—“No ketchup on the Eucharist!” one friend texted in our group chat. But Leo’s election will be about “more than the optics and spectacle” of having a new pope, Murphy said. Chicago isone of the most Catholic citiesin the country, one where you might hear older Catholics speak reverently about when Pope John Paul II came to town in 1979. Do Leo’s roots portend another papal visit to Chicago? Perhaps. If he does come, though, he may not take the Cubs up on their offer to sing “Take Me Out to the Ballgame”; his brothersaysthe pontiff, as a native South Sider, is a lifelong fan of the White Sox, a team thatwould likely welcome all the prayers it can get. “A pinstripes White Sox jersey with his name on it and a hat already are on the way to Rome,” the team said in astatement. “And of course the pontiff always is welcome at his ballpark.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.

    "title": "Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act: “She Looked at Me and Said, ‘Who Are You?’” Her Daughter Tells VF",
    "article_text": "It was supposed to be Rita Hayworth’s epic return to the silver screen. Instead, the Hollywood icon’s role in the 1972 WesternThe Wrath of Godbecame the last moviegoers ever saw of her. As she faded away in the years that followed, a heart-wrenching disease would come into greater focus. Hayworth herself would not be spared from the worst of it, but countless others around the world would be helped by her story. It’s a bittersweet legacy, but one that continues to this day. Rita Hayworth with her daughter Yasmin. Hayworth had developed early onset Alzheimer’s, which began manifesting when she was only in her 40s. It robbed Hollywood of one of its most luminous golden age stars well before her time, but the diagnosis and her family’s decision to go public with her condition helped raise awareness about the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease at a time when not even doctors knew much about it. “I think it helped the world,” saysPrincess Yasmin Aga Khan,the daughter of Hayworth and Prince Aly Khan, who were married from 1949 to 1953. “It helped people in general. I’m still frustrated though, because people don’t want to talk about it still.” As the honorary vice chair of the Alzheimer’s Association, Khan has dedicated her life to helping patients and their families contend with the disease. The annual Rita Hayworth Gala, she says, has raised in the neighborhood of $90 million for medical research and patient support over its 40-year history. But it was too late for Hayworth herself: She had no idea what was happening as her mind began to deteriorate when she was still in her prime. Born Margarita Carmen Cansino, Rita Hayworth was the daughter of a Spanish father and an American mother of Irish descent, both of them dancers. As soon as she could walk, she was taught to dance, and was performing professionally with her family by the age of 12. “She first gained the attention of motion picture producers when she was featured with her father in the floor show at the famous Agua Caliente Hotel,”The Sunday Starof Washington, DC, reported in a 1939 profile. She left that Tijuana resort for Los Angeles when she was 16, and was probably happy to go. In the 1989 biographyIf This Was Happiness,Barbara Leamingwrote that Hayworth had been abused by her father. Hayworth ended up in the clutches of another domineering figure. The imperious Harry Cohn, who ran Columbia Pictures, signed her as a contract player and controlled and manipulated much of her career. Cohn worked with Edward Judson, a salesman turned pseudo-manager, to shape Hayworth into a screen performer. Judson took his involvement in her life even further, and the two developed a romantic relationship, despite the objections of her family. “Eduardo protested loudly that Judson was as old as he himself, her own father,” veteran Associated Press journalist Bob Thomas recounted in his 1967 biographyKing Cohn. “But Margarita was unconcerned. She was intrigued with the balding, round-faced Judson and his talk of how she could become a big star.” They married in May 1937, when she was 18 and he was 40. She appeared in a flurry of movies over the next several years. She has been credited under the name Rita Cansino for some time, then Americanizing it to Hayworth. In 1939, director Howard Hawks cast her as Judy, the former lover of Cary Grant’s character in the South American romantic dramaOnly Angels Have Wings. Hawks reportedly advised the studio chief to keep Hayworth under wraps so audiences would be caught off guard by her stunning screen presence. She was so beautiful and so charismatic that he considered just the sight of her a spoiler. “If you’re smart, you won’t do anything with her until the picture comes out,” Hawks said. “No other movies, no publicity, nothing. Then you’ll know what you’ve got.” As it turned out, Cohn had a bona fide star. Hawks was right. Hayworth stole her scenes in the drama, and was groomed to be a leading lady. Her biggest star-making moment came at 22, when she was paired with Fred Astaire in 1941’sYou'll Never Get Rich,as two Broadway dancers who fall in love. It was such a crowd-pleaser that Cohn ordered up another film, 1942’sYou Were Never Lovelier,to keep the duo dancing and the box office cash flowing. That movie remains one of her daughter’s favorite films. It came out seven years before she was born, but when Khan wants to remember her mother as she once was, separate from the frail figure she cared for until her death in 1987, she watches that one. “There’s my mom.You Were Never Lovelier—light as a feather,” Khan says. “She was amazing, beautiful. She was like a diamond in the sky.” Hayworth was not only Cohn’s breakout star, but her iron-clad contract with him also meant she could be a profitable asset to lend to other movie studios. During one such arrangement, she struck up a romantic relationship with Victor Mature while performing with him in the 1942 20th Century Fox filmMy Gal Sal. Judson was enraged. “She charged that Judson demanded $30,000 to get out of her life; if she didn’t pay, he threatened her with bodily harm and exposure to public contempt and ridicule,” Thomas wrote inKing Cohn. She refused. “In the end, Edward Judson got his $30,000—from Harry Cohn,” Thomas reported. And Hayworth got her first divorce. By then, she was on her way to becoming one of the brightest stars of Hollywood’s golden age. Moviegoers swooned for her. Newspapers nicknamed Hayworth “The Love Goddess.” American GIs carried cutout photos of her from aLifemagazineprofilewhen they fought overseas in World War II, making her one of the most popular pin-ups of the era. After the war, she became a literal bombshell—the atomic devicetested at Bikini Atollin 1946 was affixed with a sultry photo of her fromEsquiremagazineand stenciled with the name of her most famous role—the title character from a film noir thriller released that year:Gilda. She was not flattered. Hayworth reportedly despised being associated with a weapon of mass destruction. “Rita almost went insane, she was so angry,”said Orson Welles, who was married to her from 1943 to 1947. “She wanted to go to Washington to hold a press conference, but Harry Cohn wouldn’t let her because it would be unpatriotic.” Gildacreated its own shockwave. Her entrance in that film sees her rising from below the camera with a luxurious flip of her hair and a dazzling smile. The 1994 filmThe Shawshank Redemptionfeatures the prisoners going wild when they watch the scene, and the effect was similar with moviegoers all across the country at the time. (The full title of theStephen Kingnovella that inspired the film wasRita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, since the main character uses one of her pinup posters to hide the escape tunnel he is digging in his wall.) While married to Welles, Hayworth struck up a secret romance with herGildacostar Glenn Ford, an on-again, off-again relationship that would endure for the rest of their lives. She was married five times, but never to Ford—although they lived next door to each other in Beverly Hills for many years. Hayworth blamed the upheaval in her personal life on her “Love Goddess” image. InKing Cohn, Virginia Van Upp, who wrote many of Hayworth’s movies and produced her most famous film noir, recalled Hayworth saying: “It’s your fault. Every man I know has fallen in love with Gilda and wakened with me.” Hayworth remained a Hollywood powerhouse for years to come—comparable to theAngelina JolieorJulia Robertsof her day. Exotic and beautiful but relatable. Among her most memorable roles was another film noir, the 1947 thrillerThe Lady From Shanghai,which Welles directed. Their marriage broke apart soon after, but she and Welles remained cordial. His final public words were about her. In a 1985 interview onThe Merv Griffin Show,recorded just hours before he diedfrom a sudden heart attack, he called Hayworth “one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived.” She was still alive at this point, but long gone from the ravages of dementia. Welles suggested she had been defamed over the years by those who didn’t know better. “I never believed she was a drunkard. I didn’t know about Alzheimer’s disease, but I believed that something like that was wrong with her.” Leaming’s biography of Hayworth took its name from something Welles told her, recounting that “Rita told him, ‘You know, the only happiness I’ve ever had in my life has been with you.’” The remark stunned Welles, who thought their relationship had been fraught and difficult. “If this was happiness,” he told Leaming, “imagine what the rest of her life had been.” Hayworth and Orson Welles on their way to filmLady From Shanghai In his final interview with Griffin, Welles concluded: “I was lucky enough to be with her longer than any of the other men in her life, and she is a dear person. She was a wonderful wife and an extraordinary girl in every way and I’ve never heard anybody—anybody—who sounds like an enemy.” He then amended that: “But she used to throw stuff around the house a little bit when she’d think about Harry Cohn.” Hayworth’s work was marked by endless clashes with the studio boss over which roles she should do and her volatile love life, which Cohn thought generated bad press. He raged over her haircut inShanghaiand her switch from auburn red to icy blonde according to Thomas’sKing Cohn. They also feuded over her wardrobe choices, her travel, and countless other minor matters. “He felt like he owned me,”Hayworth toldjournalist John Hallowell in 1968. Her marriage to Prince Khan had ended after four years, which was about the limit for most of her relationships. Then she was briefly married to singer Dick Haymes from 1953 to 1955. The Argentine singer was plagued by debt, alimony, unpaid taxes and was battling deportation. She was locked in acontract lawsuitagainst Columbia Pictures, part of her ongoing war against Cohn in the years before his death. Tensions in the marriage led to an explosive argument at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles in August 1955, where Haymes was a performer at the Cocoanut Grove. Broadway columnist Earl Wilson reported that Hayworth “charged Haymes had ‘used violence’ and indicated the breakup was irreparable.” Florabel Muir of theNew York Daily Newsreported that the clash was partly over her plans to end the lawsuit against Columbia. “Dick opposed her peace move. He insisted that any settlement of Columbia’s contract squabble with Rita must include a pact for him as producer of the siren’s films.” She and Haymes divorced, and Hayworth agreed to return to the studio to shoot two more films to end any further litigation—although Cohn was already scheming against her. She headlined the love-triangle comedyPal Joeyfor the studio in 1957, playing a former burlesque dancer turned gold-digging widow who falls for an unscrupulous lounge singer played by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra agreed to give her top billing, in deference to her years of work at Columbia. Kim Novak got third billing as the impoverished, struggling dancer who was nonetheless pure of heart. InPal Joey, Hayworth was the flame-haired devil on Sinatra’s shoulder, and the blonde, wide-eyed Novak was the angel. But Novak’s big break at the studio came about due to the furious battles Hayworth had with Cohn. Cohn decided that Columbia Pictures was too reliant on Hayworth, and he was on the search for a new signature leading lady when he signed Novak, who was previously known as “Miss Deep Freeze” from a popular refrigerator ad campaign. In a 1962 profile of Novak, syndicated Hollywood columnistLloyd Shearerreported that Cohn, “faced with the problem of an obstreperous Rita Hayworth, decided to groom someone—‘anyone,’ as he put it, ‘to replace that ingrate.’” Cohn’s reputation as a bully was well-known throughout Hollywood, so Hayworth was regarded as justified in her defiance. According to Thomas’sKing Cohn, when the studio chief died in 1958, comedian Red Skelton remarked to the 2,000-plus attendees at his funeral service: “Well, it only proves what they always say—give the public something they want to see, and they’ll turn out for it.” But soon, the narrative shifted: Maybe Cohn was right about Hayworth. Rumors about Hayworth’s volatile temper circulated throughout the industry. Filmmakers and crew workers privately grumbled about how difficult she was, and how unprepared she sometimes seemed. Her daughter says the family didn’t watch her mother’s movies, but as a child she became suddenly aware that mom was somebody important because of all the photographers who swarmed them when they disembarked from a cruise ship. And then there were mother’s famous friends. “I remember Frank Sinatra, Hermes Pan the choreographer,” Khan says. When she was around nine years old, she remembers moving with her mother to the desert while she shot the 1959 WesternThey Came to Cordurawith Gary Cooper. Hayworth was about 40 at the time. “Already I think she was having problems with that film,” Khan says. “I didn’t see it on set. I just saw behavioral changes at home.” Her mother usually could maintain herself in public, but sometimes the cracks showed. “I didn’t see it on our little trips except for maybe vaguely. There was some drama on the Spanish steps, and I can’t recall what the drama was, but she was very upset with us, with the whole situation. I wish I had a better memory of those days. Sometimes you just want to block it out.” As Hayworth’s health worsened, so did her personal life. The once stalwart star became increasingly unable to stand up for herself. Her final marriage was to screenwriter James Hill, an uncredited producer on the 1958 dramaSeparate Tableswho recruited her to play the lead role: a divorced woman trying to reunite with her ex-husband (Burt Lancaster). Hill and Hayworth were married from 1958 to 1961, and their relationship was reportedly just as volatile as her last. In his 1995 autobiography,In the Arena,Charlton Heston recalled meeting them both for the first time at a dinner party, which he described as “the single most embarrassing evening of my life.” Hayworth with James Hill, 1958. “[Hill] began the evening by relentlessly heaping obscene abuse on her. She was rapidly reduced to a helpless flood of tears, her face buried in her hands; the rest of us simply sat stunned, witnesses to a marital massacre,” Heston wrote. “I didn’t know either of them, but I was strongly tempted to slug him anyway. If he hits her, I thought, that’s it. Looking back, I really wish I hadn't waited.” They departed when Heston’s wife, Lydia, came close to tears. “I’m ashamed of walking away from Miss Hayworth’s humiliation,” Heston said. “I never saw her again.” After she and Hill divorced, Hayworth never married again. But she was not fully alone. HerGildacostar Glenn Ford, lived next door to her, and they had worked together several times over the years. They had always remained close, and in 1965 she costarred with him again inThe Money Trap, a thriller about a cop who goes bad and decides to rob some thieves who’ve stolen half a million dollars, with Elke Sommer as the temptress who leads him astray. “Third-billed, playing the cop’s washed-up former girlfriend, was a woman my father had known and worked with for over a quarter of a century, his longtime friend and sometime lover, Rita Hayworth,”Peter Fordwrote in his 2011 biography of his father,Glenn Ford: A Life. “It had been nearly 20 years since Rita and Glenn had burned up the screen inGilda. Now, in 1965, Glenn was still playing male leads, but Rita—and her career—had declined. It was one of the inequities of the Hollywood system that the male stars seemed to go on and on with their careers while the leading ladies had to struggle for good parts once they reached 40.” Hayworth and Glenn Ford inThe Money Trap The Money Trappublicist Bob Crutchfield said in the book: “I was at his house a lot in those years, and Rita of course lived next door. She was always calling Glenn or would just appear through the gate in the backyard. Sometimes champagne bottles would precede her arrival. She’d throw the bottles toward the skylight that covered the atrium. Glenn finally put up chicken wire or something to stop the bottles coming through. He was always tender and sweet with her, no matter how she acted.” Those close to Hayworth believed she was succumbing to alcoholism. Looking back, her daughter believes it was a way to self-medicate. Hayworth didn’t understand that there was a deeper problem. “She had no idea,” Khan says. “She was drinking quite a bit, with bursts of anger and then sweetness. She was frustrated and of course I was frustrated. And then I was away at boarding school for a good part of my life. I’d go back to California and I’d see the different stages.” Khan’s elementary school days were spent at the North Country School in upstate New York in the Adirondack Mountains, then high school in Massachusetts at the Buxton School. The time away from home highlighted the changes in her mother that seemed gradual to others closer to her. “She would come visit. But already I noticed something was wrong. She wasn’t quite right,” Khan says. It was obvious to those in the Hollywood community too. Work opportunities dried up for Hayworth. The bombshell had become a ghost. “There was loss of memory, there was unhappiness, there was fear,” her daughter recalls. “In Beverly Hills, at our house, she would think that there were people outside, and she’d call the police. And then they’d arrive, and of course there was nobody there. There was quite a bit of paranoia.” In 1968, John Hallowell set out to land an interview with the increasingly elusive star, and began trying to make connections at a Hollywood event showcasing a PR company’s new roster of talent. He found that the film industry had largely written her off. “One of the biggest-deal press agents in the world, Warren Cowan, was making the scene with all the new and beautiful people, when someone tapped him on the shoulder and asked: ‘Do you represent Rita Hayworth?’”Hallowell wrotein his lead. “Cowan turned, pained. ‘Of course not. We only representtodaypeople.’” When he finally did make contact and secured an interview, her representative warned him: “She’s very shy. She doesn’t see people much.” Hallowell described his encounter at her Beverly Hills home, lined with a wall of hedges, and said the star answered the door herself. “She stands a little unsurely in the doorway,” he wrote. “At first it’s all yes and no. She looks down at her hands, trapped. The house is so empty you can hear the silence.” He likened her to the fading silent film star played by Gloria Swanson in 1950’sSunset Boulevard. Hayworth complained to him about the TV antenna on her neighbor Ford’s roof, spoiling her view. After so many of her studio battles, the reporter asked if she thought contemporary stars have more freedom. “Honey, I have so much freedom, I don’t work,” she replied. Hallowell wrote: “And she starts laughing, an old, wide open Rita laugh that sends her hugging herself into a wicker chair. ‘Sorry, I just broke myself up.’” Hayworth told him a story about being lectured by a film producer, who warned her that if she got a certain unspecified role that she couldn’t change any of it—an indication of her reputation for being “difficult” on set. Hayworth said she ended the meeting over the indignity. “I could have used that part,” she said. “I take care of myself. Nobody gave me this house. And I don’t get alimony and all that jazz.\" That’s when the press agent signaled Hallowelll: “Time to leave” On a second visit to her home, the writer described Hayworth as even more erratic, scribbling circles in red ink on a notebook while she spoke to him, then crumpling the page. She lashed out at Harry Cohn, theorizing that he’d “purposely come up with a lousy picture” to spite her, and called him “a monster” while pounding her fist on a table. Other times she would ramble, or express non sequiturs. “Slowly, fading out with the last afternoon light in her dark red hair, Rita Hayworth walks you to the door, not saying anything now,” Hallowell wrote in his closing line. “But outside, leaning against the doorway, she all of a sudden summons up another great screen goddess: ‘Ava is smart. She’s living in Europe. Ava knows.’” Her daughter, then only 18 and a freshman in college, had become alarmed by her mother’s strange behavior. “When I was at Bennington in Vermont, she would call me and she would just repeat the same question, and I was very concerned,” Khan says. “And thank goodness there were people who cared about her in Beverly Hills—her lawyer, for one. And so I kept an eye on her, but it was frustrating for me because I was at school.” “Rita Hayworth to End Holdout; She’ll Clown With Carol Burnett,” announced the headline to an Associated Press report from February 1971, written byKing Cohnauthor Thomas. “I had seen Carol do a take-off onGildaon her show, and I thought it was hilarious,” Hayworth said in the article. “I sent her a wire saying so. Then in a couple of interviews I mentioned that if I ever did television, it would be with Carol Burnett. She suggested it, and I agreed.” Hayworth and Carol Burnett perform in 1971. Hayworth’s daughter recalled her mother being intimidated by her return to the spotlight. “She was hesitant about television,” Khan says. “She was aware that she was losing.” In an interview with columnist Joan Crosby before shooting the show, Hayworth seemed to be managing expectations. “I’m getting a little scared,” she said. “Probably I’ll just stand there and laugh and look at the camera and say, ‘I forgot my line.’” Instead, herguest spot onThe Carol Burnett Showwas a surprise success. Hayworth played herself in one sketch, having lunch with her agent (played by Harvey Korman) while Burnett gawked at her as an intrusive fan. Most of Hayworth’s work was merely reacting to Burnett’s over-the-top gushing, and when she does have lines, it appears as though she’s reading them from the menu she’s holding. Hayworth seemed more confident in a later sketch when she and Burnett danced and sang a silly song about their “Mutual Admiration Society.” There may have been a clinical reason for this. Studies have shown that music can be helpful for those with Alzheimer’s disease. “Musical memory is partially spared in patients with [Alzheimer’s], despite severe deficits in episodic memory,” says a 2022National Institutes of Healthreport. “Patients can learn new songs, encode novel verbal information, and react emotionally to music.” Khan experienced that firsthand with her mother, even as the disease deepened in the years that followed. “Often she would perform when I was at home,” she says. “ She was trained as a flamenco dancer with her father, so she would put the music on and play the castanets that she loved. She twirled around the living room. That brought her joy, the dancing.” Several months later, she appeared on a July episode ofThe Merv Griffin Showthat was billed as a special tribute to her. Then in September, she made another sketch comedy appearance onRowan & Martin’s Laugh-In. Some of the jokes seemed to toy with her questionable reputation. In the intro, hosts Dan Rowan and Dick Martin bring her out to fulfill her request to read a Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem on network television. Hayworth opens the book, then falls silent. The awkwardness builds. After a moment she snaps it closed, and says: “Thank you. Boy, that Henry W. sure can write a poem.” (The joke is that she always intended to read it to herself—not that she was confused.) Another sketch featured her doing slapstick as an aging film star named Laura LaMont, who is falling down drunk and perpetually crashing into furniture. She only pulls herself together when she thinks cameras are running, but when her new chauffeur accidentally says “cut,” she reverts to her drunken state and face-plants into a cake. Once again, her strongest performance was a song. She sanga bawdy numberwithLily Tomlinas they sipped tea and dished about the attractiveness (or lack thereof) of the show’s impresarios. Thanks to Merv, Carol, andLaugh-In,Hayworth suddenly seemed viable again. “Rita’s Back!” theDaily Mirrordeclared in a bold-faced headline from January 24, 1972. This was accompanied by an image of Hayworth with her mouth pursed in steely resolve, staring into the middle distance with her lavish mane of hair tucked beneath a flat-brimmed black hat. “Rita Hayworth, Hollywood sex symbol of the 1940s, is back in business as a movie star,” the article stated in a report that was intended to be enthusiastic but today reads as insulting. “Give or take a few wrinkles, she clearly still packs plenty of appeal…. Miss Hayworth, who costars with Robert Mitchum, is working in Mexico on her comeback film,The Wrath of God. It’s described as an adventure drama—for the leading lady, too, perhaps.” Hayworth inThe Wrath of God. At that point Hayworth hadn’t appeared in a feature film in two years, and she’d only made a few sporadic big-screen appearances during the decade before. InThe Wrath of God, Mitchum would play an outlaw priest in the untamed frontier of Central America who carries a gun in his bible and a knife in his crucifix. Hayworth played Senora de la Plata, the mother of a silver miner (Frank Langella) who is targeted with assassination. “She was by then finished in pictures and the word was that Mitch had insisted on her, possibly for old time’s sake,” Langella wrote in his 2012 memoirDropped Names. Despite her lively TV comedy appearances the year before, Hayworth struggled even with this small role. The knowing look in her coffee-colored eyes, so piercing in her early roles, had been blunted. The quick delivery of lines that made her one of the most playful of femme fatales had grown stiff and stilted. Her costars were the first to notice. “On the set, she is a total pro. Ready to go, eager to do her best. But the lines won’t come,” Langella wrote. “No matter how hard she tries, she can’t retain the simplest phrase. In our first scene together, I approach her at prayer in a church and ask, ‘Why are you here?’ Her line is ‘Because God is here.’ But she can’t do it. Take after take, she is unable to retain those four words.” Her struggles dragged on so long that the crew became restless, with some of them quietly mocking her inability to say a simple phrase. “Finally a man is laid down on the floor at her feet,” Langella wrote. “Action is called. I ask, ‘Why are you here?’ He whispers, ‘Because God is here.’” She quickly repeated the line. “The crew bursts into cheers and applause,” Langella wrote. “Rita beams like a little girl who’s just been crowned Miss Snow Queen, completely unaware the cheers are jeers.” After learning of her Alzheimer’s diagnosis years later, Langella felt regret about his own behavior toward her: “The jokes about her are lewd and cruel and for years after, I too would be guilty of reenacting the scene for friends at her expense.” Langella and Mitchum joined forces to make sure she would get to set on time in the mornings, and the crew developed ways to compensate for her memory problems. “In all her scenes, large placards are put next to the camera and her lines are written out in huge block letters,” Langella recalled. “It becomes agony for her to try to hold on to what little she can, and an embarrassment to face each daunting day. But she does face them, and she does make it through.” The Wrath of Godwould not be her comeback. It would be her farewell, and an unworthy one at that—reviled by critics, ignored by ticket-buyers. Langella himself described it as “an embarrassing disaster.” “She was angry a good part of the time,” her daughter says. Hayworth’s final years of awareness were plagued with outbursts and confusion. “There are those with Alzheimer’s who can be mild in their personality and pleasant. And then there are those, like my mother, who raged. And I think alcohol helped to blossom that rage,” Khan says. Hayworth had always fought so hard for her independence—against her father, against her husbands, against her studio chief. The part of her that remained could not stand to acknowledge she was losing control. Rita Hayworth and Yasmin Khan in New York City, 1984. “To take the car keys away was major,” Khan says. “After I graduated from Bennington, I went home and we went for a car ride somewhere, and it was on Sunset Boulevard. She was driving and she swerved over and hit the curb. It was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this is a disaster.’ It was panic. And I had to tell her to get out of the car and go to the back seat. That was the beginning of the end of her driving.” Her family still didn’t know exactly what was afflicting her, other than the alcoholism. “I got a diagnosis in ’81 by a psychiatrist in New York City, but before that, there was no diagnosis,” Khan says. “I don’t know what her doctor in Beverly Hills was thinking. It was very difficult. In London, they had carried her off the plane and she was in a drunken state of confusion.” The world saw those photos. The 57-year-old looked disheveled and miserable as she was escorted from the aircraft. “‘Unwell’ Star in Airport Riddle” was the headline in theManchester Evening Newsin January 1976. The article said she had been drinking and became disruptive on the flight from Los Angeles, and it took two airline workers 30 minutes to carry her out. That gave paparazzi plenty of time to line up their shots. In March 1977, an even more grim headline hit the press: “Rita Hayworth alcoholic, mentally ill; gets guardian.” The Associated Press reported that a California court had ordered a temporary conservator to oversee her well-being after Dr. James Miner of Hoag Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach testified that the 58-year-old was “gravely disabled as a result of mental disorder or impairment by chronic alcoholism.” Hayworth was officially no longer in control of her own life, but the blame was still being primarily placed on booze. Her daughter moved her to New York and began getting her treatment there. Even then, the public remained judgmental. In response to the court order,Los Angeles Timescolumnist Harriet Van Horne wrote: “We have all had friends or acquaintances whose days have ended in disgrace of confinement. Because we have glimpsed them occasionally on that miserable downward slope, the inevitable crack-up doesn’t shock us. But Rita Hayworth! How could she, who was so dearly loved, love herself so little?” In the 1979 bookThe Decline and Fall of the Love Goddesses, authorPatrick Aganquestioned why Hayworth had failed to mount a successful comeback after her TV comedy appearances years earlier, and pointed not to her awkward performance inThe Wrath of Godbut to a follow-up appearance on Griffin’s TV show that became disastrous. “It became all too apparent to both Griffin and the studio audience that she was simply too drunk to continue, and was escorted offstage during a station break,” Agan wrote. “Sensitive, shy, and no longer secure in the beauty that had made her a goddess, Rita had tried to compensate for her insecurities by drinking in the dressing room, and it proved her undoing.” No consideration of a degenerative illness was made. It was only later, when Khan got a proper diagnosis for her mother and decided to share it publicly, that those judging Hayworth realized how wrong they were. By then, it was too late for Hayworth. She would never know vindication. She could not accept apologies. She was already gone. Khan set her mother up in an apartment next to hers and visited her frequently. Once again, songs would enliven her. “I would put music on and she was in the chair, and she’d be very peaceful and smiled,” Khan says. “For some TV programs or movies, she would say, ‘Oh, I’ve seen that movie. I know that movie, right?’” Sometimes she was even in the movies she watched.You Were Never Lovelier,the 1942 musical that Khan counts among her favorites, was one that brought back memories for Hayworth. “She talked about how she loved Fred Astaire,” Khan says. One day, mother and daughter were standing before a full-length mirror. Hayworth would live for several more years, but this was the last that Khan would ever see of her. “She looked at me and she said, ‘Who are you?’” her daughter recalls. “She didn’t know who I was. But she knew that she was safe, which is most important.” Hayworth’s long goodbye had ended. The rest of her days would pass in silence, staring. “She was not verbal. She could not feed herself. I fed her, the nurse fed her. She put the food in her mouth and she couldn’t swallow,” Khan says. “We had to stimulate under her chin in order for the reflex to swallow. It was very, very difficult. It is just a very slow and painful decline. In 1985, Khan gave birth to her son, Andrew, and would bring the baby to visit his famous grandmother. “I’m not sure that she actually knew, but you always hope and pray and wish that she would know that that’s her grandson,” Khan says. “Being a caregiver, I was very concerned, of course—wanted her to live as long as possible. But it was difficult because I don’t know that she was aware.” Rita Hayworth died on May 14, 1987, at the age of 68. Even before her mother’s death, Khan began helping others confront the disease openly, without the shame or stigma that befell her mother, or the confusion and misdiagnosis that delayed her care. Among the Alzheimer’s Association’s initiatives is ahelplinefor family members who need advice—800-272-3900. It was a resource she and Hayworth never had. The nextRita Hayworth Galais scheduled for May 10 in Chicago, a day before Mother’s Day. The event is already sold out. “We have incredible people involved—caring, generous, amazing. We’re so fortunate,” Khan says. This was her whole reason for revealing her mother’s diagnosis when she finally understood it fully. “It was something that I didn’t know about,” Khan says. “I wanted to share it with people.” By the end, Rita Hayworth no longer knew who she was. But the world has never forgotten.

    "title": "How an Orgasmic Meditation Group Sparked a Troubled Federal Case",
    "article_text": "“I am here to tell the story of my sister,” a woman says as she addresses the camera. “That she was in a cult, and her experience of going through that.” The mood is somber, and a title card appears to explain thatAyries Blanckdeclined to be interviewed for the 2022 Netflix documentaryOrgasm Inc,“out of fear of reprisals by OneTaste,” a wellness company devoted to a meditative concept of female stimulation. Instead, her sister,Autymn,reads aloud from her journals. “I remember being told not to go to the hospital,” Blanck wrote, claiming that she was beaten and sexually assaulted in the course of her activities at the organization. She was told, she continued, that her shaking and vomiting were part of her orgasm. The journal entries provide the opening for a kind of archetypal cult-documentary third act, with the other shoe just about to drop. They are also, as Brooklyn federal prosecutors pursuing a criminal case against OneTaste leaders recently acknowledged, to some degree falsified. Nicole Daedonecofounded OneTaste in San Francisco in 2004. Over the following decades, a period during whichalternative health ideaswere reaching mainstream saturation, she became the face of orgasmic meditation, a mindfulness practice in which a partner, typically a man, strokes a woman’s clitoris for 15 minutes. In press coverage of OneTaste, the wordcultappeared intermittently. Participants sometimes lived together in communes devoted to Daedone’s teachings. Untila 2018 Bloomberg reporton the company was published and a criminal investigation began, though, she was largely treated with a shifting mix of fascination and skepticism. At that point Daedone underwent a late-2010s arc familiar to any observer of the streaming era’scult-documentary boom. The year afterOrgasm Incwas released and OneTaste became known to Netflix’s vast audience, prosecutors charged Daedone and her longtime head of sales,Rachel Cherwitz,with a count of forced labor conspiracy. They claimed that, among other forms of coercion and surveillance, the women exploited their employees’ and participants’ histories of sexual trauma to obtain control over their time, money, and willingness to perform sexual acts. Daedone, who sold her stake in OneTaste and stepped down as CEO in 2017, and Cherwitz, who left the company in 2018, have pleaded not guilty. In March, with a trial date soon approaching, the government made a jarring concession. Blanck’s handwritten journal entries, which formed central evidence in the case, had been physically copied from an electronic file created years later. Lawyers for Daedone and Cherwitz had for months been arguing that the diaries were fabricated for Netflix’s purposes, noting that the streamer paid Blanck’s sister $25,000 for use of her archival materials. The prosecutor who had been vouching for the authenticity of the journals left the case. (The government has had a full turnover of its prosecutors over the period between indictment and trial.) The evidence was thrown out, and Blanck was no longer set to be called as a witness. (A spokesperson for Netflix declined to comment. Blanck’s sister and a lawyer who has represented Blanck did not return requests for comment. OneTaste paid Blanck a $325,000 settlement in 2015, but has denied that she was beaten or sexually assaulted in connection with her employment or courses she took.) The trial’s opening arguments began on Tuesday, but Daedone had already been on the offensive. Aside from OneTaste suing Netflix for defamation—the complaint was dismissed by a judge, but OneTaste is appealing—Daedone has posted videos of her supporters, a sizable group of women, walking in unison outside the Brooklyn courthouse where she is being tried. She has conducted a spirited PR campaign; following the prosecution’s backtracking on Blanck’s journals, aDaily Mailheadline declared that the case “teeters on the brink of collapse.” In several interviews, including one I conducted with her last month at Organic Erotic, a home goods store in Harlem affiliated with the orgasmic meditation community, Daedone has vowed that she will testify in her own defense. “First they call you a kook, then they say you’re a danger to society,” Daedone said, comparing the treatment she had received to that ofRobert F. Kennedy Jr.“Then they dig into your history, and then they move into legal. And it was like, Wow, that’s what happened.” In 2009 a Berkeley couple wrote toTheNew York Timesregarding a splashy story the paper had just published about OneTaste.Elana Auerbachhad been a resident of the company’s original commune and, as she stated in her initial account to theTimes,had given her self-image and internal compass over to Daedone. In a letter to the editor, Auerbach and her husband went further. “We found the environment manipulative, unhealthy and disempowering,” they wrote. “Group-think and the threat of being shunned were used to coerce people to adopt the dominant viewpoint.” Auerbach has maintained this conviction up until the present day, including in an appearance inOrgasm Inc.In January, she published an essay inThe Sunday Times,writing of Daedone, “I realized I had become her servant, just like the others.” To prepare for a OneTaste ritual that involved lying naked on a table for an audience, she wrote, she needed to sign up for a course that cost $15,000. (A company spokesperson told theTimesthat Daedone and OneTaste “firmly dispute” Auerbach’s portrayal, “which appears to be meticulously designed for dramatic effect.”) Such accounts, in their broad view of Daedone’s power over OneTaste participants’ sexuality and finances, are at the core of prosecutors’ case. The indictment invokes an alleged pattern of “abusive and manipulative tactics” that entailed absolute commitment to Daedone and rendered members “emotionally, socially and psychologically dependent on OneTaste.” Daedone explained as we spoke that orgasmic meditation is an attention-training practice that uses sexual energies but is not itself sexual. She saw her work in a lineage with yoga, Buddhism, and psychedelics—sources of previous American panics that won acceptance as time passed and attitudes loosened. Relaxed and gregarious, she held unflinching eye contact and flitted freely between references to Schopenhauer and Andrea Dworkin. At the peak of her success, Daedone was neither in the shadows nor extraordinarily prominent. In the world of celebrity-adjacent wellness, brushes she had withGwyneth PaltrowandKhloé Kardashiancould be viewed as akin to table stakes. Her rise has always involved a degree of intrigue in her backstory. In her 20s, she told me, she worked as a stripper for a time at the recommendation of an academic friend who was doing so. Around the same period, she has said, she learned shortly before her estranged father’s death that he had cancer and that he was in prison after being convicted of child molestation.Orgasm Incincludes footage from a Daedone talk in which she discussed her reaction to the revelation. “I never took on the idea that he was a bad person,” she said. “I took on the idea that he was just so expansive and fourth-dimensional that he couldn’t confine himself into the arbitrary laws of the third dimension. That was his only crime in my mind.” When I asked if there were moments when she felt OneTaste had veered off course, Daedone said that some of her commentary in this vein, in its accommodating analysis of male culpability amid the #MeToo movement, “was a place where I really misread the room,” though it had seemed to her a given that “women have power in agency and that we aren’t inherently in a form of subjugation.” The case against OneTaste has attracted attention from some specific frequencies on the ideological spectrum. In February, the libertarian magazineReasonpublished a lengthy deconstruction of the charges, accusing prosecutors of relying merely on “salaciousness, scandal, and the all-too-familiar sense that female sexuality is something to be suppressed and controlled by the state.”Matt Gaetz,at a moment whenDonald Trump’s supporters have become increasingly fluent in discussions of “lawfare,” bemoaned FBI overreach in a recent segment on his One America News show—and weighed in on orgasmic meditation. “I posit no theory on the efficaciousness of these purported remedies,” Gaetz said. “But I don’t know—after being poisoned, lied to, and deprived of my rights by Big Pharma, I’m probably more open-minded about alternative naturopath therapies than I was years ago.” OneTaste had the “seeming makings” of a cult, Daedone conceded, “except for a nefarious intention,” but she thought that common perception had been shaped by the term’s loose use. “Once you use those words, then people’s cognitive ability goes down.” Daedone’s publicist,Juda Engelmayer,who was sitting by her side, chimed in. “Ultra-Orthodox Judaism, it’s cultish,” he said. “Not a crime.” Daedone tracked Engelmayer down in 2018 after she read a news story that was relatively favorable toward his clientHarvey Weinstein.The day before we spoke, Engelmayer had attended the opening of the producer’s retrial on rape and criminal sex act charges. (Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations of sexual misconduct against him.) He has also recently represented Ozy Media cofounderCarlos Watson,who was sentenced in December to nearly 10 years in prison for defrauding investors, but saw his term commuted by Trump after Engelmayer facilitated a sequence of connections to the president’s“pardon czar.” ANew York Timesreporter has been trailing Engelmayer for a profile, and the spokesman observed that his work on behalf of embattled public figures had hit a turning point in recent years. “Slowly but surely,” he said. “TheJohnny Depptrial withAmber Heard,I think that might’ve broken the cork.” Under their bail conditions, Cherwitz told me in a separate interview, she and Daedone were not allowed to be in the same place at the same time. Before she was indicted, she said, the government had approached her through her attorneys as a potential victim. “It’s like they were coming to brainwash me,” she said, “or somehow coerce me to fit into their narrative.” At 19, Cherwitz moved to Israel and practiced Orthodox Judaism for five years. Later, she said, she was diagnosed as anorgasmic and couldn’t find suitable help within the medical community. At an Iyengar yoga class, a teacher told her about OneTaste. “I’m losing so badly in my life right now, I should try this,” she remembered thinking. “And it spoke to me in a pretty deep way.” In an October court filing, the government laid out its position in more detail. The overall portrait centered on a persistent advocacy for more sex, including instances in which the defendants allegedly taught employees to engage in sexual acts that they found uncomfortable or repulsive as a means of expanding their horizons—“ensuring that the OneTaste participants would continue to have sex with strangers for Daedone’s financial benefit.” According to prosecutors, Daedone and Cherwitz directed women to have sex with wealthy potential clients. (In her opening statement on Tuesday, Daedone’s attorneyJennifer Bonjean—who also represents Weinstein, among other high-profile men accused of sexual misconduct—said, “Grown people made grown decisions they don’t want to stand by.”) The accusations could be construed as allegations of sex trafficking, which had initially been a focus of the FBI’s investigation into OneTaste. But as lawyers for Daedone and Cherwitz noted in a reply filing, the government did not bring any charges of that severity. Engelmayer has been emphatic about communicating to reporters that the case against OneTaste, to his and defense attorneys’ knowledge, marks the first time that forced labor conspiracy has been charged as a stand-alone count, without an accompanying crime that would typically represent an instance in which the conspiracy—an agreement to commit the crime—was enacted. (A spokesperson for the Eastern District of New York’s US Attorney’s Office declined to comment.) WhenFrank Parlatofirst read about OneTaste in 2018, he was convinced that something was amiss. It was what looked like familiar territory: For a brief period beginning in 2007, Parlato worked as a publicist for NXIVM, then a little-known self-help organization. A decade later, after turning his attention to reporting for his website, the Frank Report, he played an early role in revealing that his old bossKeith Ranierehad operated a sex cult. (In 2020, Raniere was sentenced to 120 years in prison for racketeering and sex trafficking, among other crimes.) In addition to his NXIVM and OneTaste coverage, another recent Parlato fixation is his claim thatJerry Sandusky,the former Penn State football coach convicted of serial child molestation, was railroaded. After Engelmayer approached him about OneTaste, Parlato told me, “I made a very serious news-gathering effort in an investigation to determine whether they were being fairly or, in my opinion, unfairly prosecuted.” In his coverage, he has described the case in his hyperkinetic house style, writing, “Parlato Lives Rent-Free in Prosecutors’ Heads, While Actual Evidence Lives Nowhere.” (Prosecutors have claimed OneTaste paid Parlato $20,000 per month for his coverage. Parlato has written that OneTaste retained him to investigate the prosecution. Engelmayer said the agreement lasted a few months and that Parlato continued writing about the case afterwards.) Parlato proposed to me that the OneTaste case amounted to “criminalizing regret.” He compared participants’ lodging allegations to going to Harvard and later realizing that the education hadn’t been as valuable as expected. As he sees it, the charges, brought in the same jurisdiction as those against Raniere, are simply an attempt at bringing about another high-profile cult case, or, as he described it, “NXIVM 2.0.” For their part, 20 Brooklyn prosecutors appeared at a recent pretrial hearing in a show of support. The prosecutor who led the investigation of Raniere,Moira Penza,who left the US Attorney’s Office in 2019, told me that she found a few aspects of the case against Daedone and Cherwitz unusual. The government had pursued a novel strategy, lost a key witness and evidence at the finish line, and swapped out all its prosecutors on the case. “Keith Raniere wasn’t doing TED Talks and appearing in South by Southwest and talking to Gwyneth Paltrow,” Penza said, describing Daedone’s media profile. Penza emphasized that she had no reason to think that her former office had acted improperly in pursuing the charges, with its trial strategy still to be seen, or that it could not secure a conviction. Jurors wouldn’t necessarily wonder, “Oh, well why didn’t they charge this the way they charged NXIVM?” she said. She also thinks that since Daedone’s initial rise, “there are more people who are very skeptical of the way wellness can be used to exploit women.” Still, Penza said, “As a former prosecutor, I can tell you you don’t want to be trying a case with those things stacked against you.” For the last several years, Daedone told me, as she dealt with the media and legal fallout around OneTaste, she has been focused on preparing for her trial and keeping up her meditation practice. On social media, she has been weighing in on pop-culture discussions of women’s sexuality, including those surroundingBianca Censori’s displays of nudity andBonnie Blue’s pornography stunts. “I am not a martyr,” Daedone insisted, but she understands her struggle in a broader sense, as something “more telling about the culture than it is about me in a lot of ways.” As we discussed the circumstances leading up to her indictment, I asked if it was fair to characterize OneTaste participants as seekers. She had an instant reaction and a partial objection: The term had a diminishing connotation. They were “almost invariably someone who had touched something,” Daedone said, “or had a sense that something more was possible.” This story has been updated.

    "title": "Liev Schreiber Also Doesn’t Think His Daughter Being Trans Is a “Big Deal”",
    "article_text": "Fathers, be good to your daughters. In anew interview withVariety,Liev Schreibershowed love and support for his 16-year-old trans daughter,Kai. Schreiber shares Kai and a son,Sasha,with his ex-wife,Naomi Watts.TheRay Donovanstar says Kai never officially came out as trans to him or her mother. “Kai was always who Kai is,” Schreiber said. “I suppose the most profound moment was her asking us to change her pronouns. To be honest with you, it didn’t feel like that big of a deal to me, only because Kai had been so feminine for so long.” Kai made her modeling debut in March, walking the runway for Valentino. She proceeded to star in an ad campaign for the Italian fashion house. Kai is set to join her father and his wife,Taylor Neisen,at the Ali Forney Center’s A Place at the Table Gala on Friday, May 9, in New York City. The gala raises money for the Ali Forney Center, which provides housing and support for homeless LGBTQ+ youth. Schreiber is well aware that by virtue of being his daughter, Kai doesn’t necessarily face the same challenges as other girls in the trans community. “This isn’t just about representing the trans community. This is actually a community of people who don’t have great resources, who don’t have access to help, who aren’t being protected and looked after by their families,” the actor said. “These are people who are being rejected. These are people who are experiencing the harshest version of humanity that we can offer, and some of them are not surviving it.” He also knows he is not able to necessarily give parenting advice to other parents of trans children. “I don’t know the answer for your kid,” he said. “I don’t know what it’s like for you to be a trans dad. I don’t know how you were brought up. I don’t know what religion you encountered or what your spirituality is. And for me to tell you what I think about my kid feels like an overstep.” Schreiber did, however, have this piece of advice. “I guess if I would say anything to someone who’s having trouble with their trans teen or their adolescent trans kid, it’s ‘Teenagers are a headache. They’re hard,’” Schreiber said. “It doesn’t matter whether they’re trans or not because you’ll come out of this. But a trans teen is going to be a teen. They’re such a pain so much of the time, and Kai is as feisty and outspoken as they come.” Schreiber’s not the only famous father to speak out in support of his trans daughter. Last week,Robert De Niromade headlines after his daughter,Airyn,announced that she was trans in a story forThem.Like Schreiber, De Niro said he did not think Airyn being trans was a“big deal”and expressed love for all his children. But not every trans person with a well-known father is fortunate enough to have his support.Vivian Wilson,21, recently spoke out against her estranged father,Elon Musk,in an interview withTeen Vogue.In the story, Wilson called Musk, with whom she hasn’t had any contact and from whom she hasn’t received any money since 2020, a “pathetic man-child\" and “fucking cringe.” Thankfully, Schreiber is fully supportive of his trans daughter. “Kai is such a fighter,” he said. “It’s important that she goes, ‘Hey, I am trans,’ and, ‘Look at me.’” How anOrgasmic Meditation GroupSparked a Troubled Federal Case Deconstructing Trump’s ElaborateOval Office Makeover Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act MeetCardinal Robert Francis Prevost, the First American Pope Revisit All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet The Dystopian Coming-of-Age StoryStephen KingConsidered Too “Merciless” to Film Wes Anderson’sNext Breakout StarJust So Happens to Be Kate Winslet’s Daughter All ofQuentin Tarantino’s Movies Ranked Elon Musk’s 14 Children and Their Mothers (That We Know Of) From the Archive:Princess Margaret’s Not So Happily-Ever-After",

    "title": "23 Films We Think Will Rock the Cannes Film Festival 2025",
    "article_text": "By this time next week,Vanity Fairchief criticRichard Lawsonand Hollywood correspondentDavid Canfieldwill be deep into the Cannes Film Festival 2025—and will have already identified a few favorite titles. For now, though, they can still speculate about which films might pop most at a festival that has become not only the most prestigious on the international cinema circuit, but perhaps the most crucial in introducing each year’s Oscar contenders. (Just askAnora.) Below, the 23 movies that seem most bound for glory—or at least, a lot of discourse. Beloved Scottish directorLynne Ramsayreturns to the Croisette eight years after winning the screenplay prize forYou Were Never Really Here.This time she’s bringing with her a drama-thriller about postpartum depression calledDie, My Love.The film will have no trouble attracting attention at the festival—both because Ramsay is revered in the international art house world, and because it starsJennifer Lawrence, Robert Pattinson, LaKeith Stanfield, Nick Nolte,andSissy Spacek.This will no doubt be one of the hottest tickets this year. While we love the laid-back Texas stylings of someRichard Linklaterfilms, we also quite like it when he goes Euro, as he did to such memorable effect in his trio ofBeforefilms. Linklater’s latest honors the tradition that inspired those movies, examining the onset of the French New Wave in the 1960s—particularly the making of the Godard classicBreathless.The cast is largely French, thoughZoey Deutchdoes appear as the actress Jean Seberg (a figure once played in a biopic byKristen Stewart). Linklater’s deep affection for the art of film suggests that he’s an ideal craftsman to tell this story; we expect something gentle but insightful about the dawn of creative revolution. Norwegian auteurJoachim Trierleveled up with his heartbreaking 2021 character studyThe Worst Person in the World,nabbing Oscar nominations for best international feature and, in a big surprise, original screenplay. He’s reuniting with that film’s star,Renate Reinsve—who won best actress at Cannes in 2021—for this new family drama, which also features bigger Hollywood names includingStellan SkarsgårdandElle Fanning.LikeWorst Person, the film is being distributed by Neon in the US—the company that has backed the last five Palme d’Or winners, including best-picture Oscar winnersParasiteandAnora.If Trier can maintain his momentum on the global cinema scene, watch out. Wes Andersonloves highlighting the same performers over and over. So the headline out of the Oscar winner’s latest intricately designed, star-studded romp may be that of its three leads, he’s only ever worked withBenicio Del Toro(inThe French Dispatch). Del Toro plays a wealthy businessman with a long list of enemies who enlists his estranged daughter and Norwegian tutor—played by Anderson newcomersMia ThreapletonandMichael Cera,respectively—to secure his family’s future. Threapleton, whose mother isKate Winslet,is poised to be the film’s discovery, nailing Anderson’s particular brand of deadpan heartbreak. “I remember this moment where I hadTom Hankson my left,Bryan Cranstonon my right,Riz Ahmeddiagonally, Benicio in front of me, Wes at one end, and Michael to the other side,”Threapleton recently toldVanity Fair.“I just sat there and I put my hands under my legs.” From writer-directorHarry Lighton,this romantic drama starsHarry MellingandAlexander Skarsgårdas two men who enter into a sub-dom relationship. It wouldn’t be a proper Cannes without at least some taboo sex in the lineup, whichPillionseems to offer, what with its leather and pup play. Though we probably shouldn’t expect something luring and exploitative. We’ve heard thatPilliontakes the arch provocation of last year’sBabygirl(also from A24) and turns it into something more sincere, even poignant. Even so, there should be lots of post-premiere chatter about what is and is not seen onscreen. Two men, played by rising starsPaul MescalandJosh O’Connor,fall in love—and that’s only the start of this sweeping period drama, which opens in the midst of World War I. The movie’s initial romantic encounter reverberates over decades alongside the eclectic folk songs that light up the soundtrack. “We felt very boyish in each other’s company throughout,”Mescal toldVanity Fairof his dynamic with O’Connor. “I’ve always said this to Josh, but he brings out a childlike version of me. I haven’t felt that kind of degree of boyishness in myself for a long time.” Beware the movie-star-directed film that winds up on the Cannes lineup. We’ve learned that lesson the hard way over the years, with films likeThe Last FaceandLost River.Yet actorHarris Dickinson’s first feature has us curious anyway. The film starsFrank Dillane(ofHarry PotterandFear the Walking Deadfame) as a transient young man living in London, which sounds appropriately modest in scale for a debut effort. And Dillane is an intriguing actor, wiry and weird and unpredictable. Maybe Dickinson will buck tradition and deliver something worthwhile. Maybe Kristen Stewart will too! The actor’s debut feature film as a director is based on a 2011 memoir about a former swimmer experimenting with drugs and exploring BDSM sex. That has the makings of a buzzy Cannes envelope-pusher. It certainly won’t hurt Stewart’s chances that she is beloved by French cineastes—Stewart is one of only two American actors to have won a César award, France’s equivalent to the Oscar.The Chronology of Watercould also mean good things for its star,Imogen Poots,though we’re more curious about her costarThora Birch—a former teen queen who doesn’t work much these days but is an arresting screen presence whenever she pops up. But wait, a third! Early word is positive onScarlett Johansson’s feature directorial debut, which stars Oscar-nominated nonagenarianJune Squibbas a retiree who relocates to New York after the death of her roommate and best friend. With distribution already secured via Sony Pictures Classics, the film’s launch in the festival’s Un Certain Regard section marks only the beginning of a hopefully long, splashy rollout for the dramedy, which Johanssonhas comparedto throwback indies likeLiving Out LoudandMoonstruck. Julia Ducournau’s previous movie,Titane,won the Palme d’Or in something of an upset; a film that introduces a sexual relationship between a young woman and a car is never going to be an obvious slam dunk. So all eyes are on her follow-up, which we know centers on a 13-year-old girl but is otherwise shrouded in mystery. Despite having just two features under her belt—2016’sRawalso premiered on the Croisette—Ducournau has swiftly emerged as one of our most fearless, audacious filmmakers. That makesAlphaan instant event. Kleber Mendonça Filhohas been ruffling feathers in Brazil for years with his polemical, genre-defying social dramas, most recentlyBacurau,which won Cannes’s Jury Prize. Coming off of that high, Filho returns to the Croisette with a higher personal profile, a bigger star (Narcos’Wagner Moura), and another urgent examination of his home country. This one is set in 1977, and follows a technology expert on the run. The versatile French filmmakerRebecca Zlotowskiis no stranger to Hollywood stars, having directedNatalie Portmanand a teenageLily-Rose DeppinPlanetarium. That film was not as well-received as what the director has made in her native France, particularly 2022’s critical hitOther People’s Children,butVie Privéemay thrillingly split the difference. It’s described as a French murder mystery, and it stars none other thanJodie Foster.Sign us up. Back in 2022, the great American indie directorKelly Reichardt’sShowing Upwas the the next-to-last Cannes competition premiere on the schedule. Many journalists had already returned home, and the movie came and went largely unheralded. Which was a shame,given what a lovely film Reichardt made. This year, Reichardt returns with what is billed, quite compellingly, as a crime film.The Mastermindboasts an impressive cast of cool actors—Josh O’Connor,Alana Haim, John Magaro,Gaby Hoffmann—and a beguiling art-heist premise. Maybe this time Reichardt will get her Cannes due—though of course, they’ve scheduled the movie at the end of the festival again. Sigh. Perhaps some of us on theVFstaff have traumatic memories of going to sleepaway sports camp in our younger years, and are thus particularly drawn to the premise of filmmakerCharlie Polinger’s debut feature. The film follows a 12-year-old boy at an all-boys water polo camp, where things quickly turn grim. We thinkThe Plagueis something of a horror film, though perhaps of the arty, psychological Cannes variety—more about ominous mood than jump scares. Either way, we can’t wait to relive our own troubled youths—safely in movie form, that is. This film, from Australian writer-directorSean Byrne(The Devil’s Candy), seems to be a more straightforward horror film.Jai Courtneyplays a serial killer whose weapon of choice is live sharks, a fun tweak on the genre that we don’t think we’ve seen before. There may not be much more to the film than that, though its presence in the often experimental Directors’ Fortnight sidebar suggests something a bit more textured than your standard B movie. If it is just a basic fright fest, though, a little grimy entertainment is always welcome amid the pomp and seriousness of Cannes. Spike Leeis conditioning us to expect the unexpected of his take on Akira Kurosawa’s 1963 classicHigh and Low—and that’s just in the delivery of the movie. Cannes didn’t include the film in its initial lineup announcement, but Lee posted on his Instagram that it was going to Cannes anyway; earlier this week, A24 posted on socials that a teaser trailer would land in about 24 hours, then Lee almost immediately leaked it. Here’s a guy who likes to keep us on our toes. How thrilling that anything seems possible for the project that marks Lee andDenzel Washington’s first collaboration sinceInside Man, 19 years ago. Every Cannes, a few under-the-radar films prescreen and are promptly followed by enthusiastic whispers. This German drama connecting four generations of women is one of them. (For the record, neither contributor to this list has seenSound of Falling.) This marks the first feature in eight years from directorMascha Schilinski,and her first ever to premiere in Cannes. So while there are a lot of unknowns about this title as of now, the onebigknown is rather compelling: It’s already getting people excited. Following the death of his friend, lauded French filmmaker Laurent Cantet, the also lauded French filmmakerRobin Campillostepped into the role of director and cowriter for this drama about a teenage boy struggling to find his place in a world starkly divided by class. His family is wealthy, but Enzo has rejected their academic ambitions and sought out an apprenticeship in construction. While struggling with his family, Enzo develops a friendship with an older Ukrainian man on his work crew. That’s a compelling premise, and we trust Campillo—the director behind terrific films likeEastern Boys, 120 BPM,andRed Island—to bring his own sensibilities to the film while honoring his departed friend’s vision. The main cast thatAri Asterhas assembled for his latest, a Western set in the glorious spring of 2020, says all you need to know about just how excited Hollywood is by the rising filmmaker ofHereditary, Midsommar,andBeau Is Afraid:Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone,andAustin Butler.Even when he’s divisive, Aster has proven unmissable. FilmmakerAkinola Davies Jr.brings us to 1993 Nigeria, where political and social tumult surrounds a contentious election and two young boys journey to Lagos with their furtive, distant father. African cinema has made a strong showing at Cannes in recent years (last year’s stunningOn Becoming a Guinea Fowl, from Zambia, is available to watch in the US now), and we hope that Davies continues in that burgeoning tradition. We’re especially encouraged by the presence ofṢọpẹ́ Dìrísù,a rising British actor who was excellent in the 2020 horror filmHis House. Screening on the market side, this small gem out of Brazil merits attention as it courts US distributors.Marianna Brennand’s searing debut offers an unflinching, intimate, and deeply humane portrait of a 13-year-old coming of age in the Amazon rainforest amid increasingly harrowing conditions. It’s one of the few titles on this list to have already earned an award out of Cannes: Brennand, who also won the director’s prize at Venice Days last fall, will be honored with Cannes and Kering’s prestigious Women in Motion Emerging Talent Award. DirectorLloyd Lee Choihas been making a name for himself on the short-film circuit, taking home awards out of major festivals like Berlin, SXSW, and Toronto. It’s no surprise, then, that his feature debut is slowly but surely generating buzz as a standout of the festival’s Directors’ Fortnight section. The drama tracks a Chinese immigrant over two days in New York, when his food-delivery gig is put in jeopardy just as the rest of his family is set to join him from abroad in their new home. Tom Cruisestars in this tiny independent drama about a man coming to terms with things. We can’t wait.

    "article_text": "Consultant at Prince of Wales Hospital says tech helps doctors understand how to perform surgery well, accurately and as quickly as possible A Hong Kong hospital is now using advanced mixed reality and 3D printing technology to improve the precision of orthopaedic surgery and provide patients with better treatment. Prince of Wales Hospital in Sha Tin officially implemented the mixed-reality visualisation last year, applying head-mounted displays that allow virtual objects to be overlaid onto the real world. The tool helping surgeons plan and prepare complex operations has been used in 50 cases of bone and soft tissue tumours at the hospital so far since its trial in 2023. The institution said it expected to apply it to 140 cases per year involving treatment of bone tumours and scoliosis – a type of spinal deformity, complex fractures and bone deformities. “We take the patient’s images and create a digital 3D model, which is integrated with the patient’s body … It’s like you can actually see through the patient’s skin and see what tissues are underneath,” said Dr Wong Kwok-chuen, consultant at the hospital’s department of orthopaedics and traumatology. “It is a tool to help doctors understand how to perform surgery as quickly as possible, and perform the surgery well and accurately, so that the patient can have the best results.”",

    "title": "Will private Hong Kong hospitals set high fee estimates to avoid explaining bill?",
    "article_text": "Lawmakers worry that hospitals will presume worst-case scenario under government proposals aimed at improving price transparency But Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau on Friday dismissed the concerns and said private operators would not want to scare away patients by setting very high price expectations. The Health Bureau earlier this week put a range of measures to the Legislative Council for discussion, including a requirement for private hospitals to give price estimates and a written explanation to patients or their family members if the final bill for procedures was significantly higher, such as 20 per cent or more than the expected amount. But lawmakers raised doubts about how the government would ensure the rights of patients were protected. “Private hospitals might include potential stays in the intensive care unit in the fee estimates for operations that are a bit more complicated,” legislator Rebecca Chan Hoi-yan said.",
