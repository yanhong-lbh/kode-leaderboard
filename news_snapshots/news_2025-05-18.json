    "article_text": "CNN's Abby Phillip suggested on Friday that Robert Hur \"undersold\" the extent of Biden's memory lapses in his interview with the former president during the classified documents probe. CNN host Abby Phillipsuggested on Friday that former Special Counsel Robert Hur \"undersold\" the extent of former President Biden's decline after his interview with the former president in the February 2023 classified documents probe. The CNN host argued that Hur threw the former president and the Democratic Party \"a lifeline.\" \"In a way, Robert Hur kind of undersold this,\" Phillip said. \"He kind of threw Joe Biden a lifeline. It was an opportunity, actually, for Democrats to take it seriously, maybe change gears at that point, maybe give a potential nominee more time.\" The audio, obtained by Axios,contains clips from several interviewsbetween the former president and Hur related to an investigation into his handling of classified documents when he was vice president. The transcript of Biden’s interview with Hur was released last year, and confirmed the president’s frequent memory lapses. Hur's written report described Bidenas a \"sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" HUR TRANSCRIPT CONFIRMS BIDEN MEMORY LAPSES, CONTRADICTS PRESIDENT'S CLAIM ABOUT EXCHANGE OVER SON'S DEATH CNN host Abby Phillip suggested Robert Hur \"undersold\" the extent of Biden's decline after interview audio is released.(Screenshot/CNN) Joe Borelli, a former Republican leader on the New York City Council, argued that no one was surprised by the Hur-Biden audio. \"I would count the number at zero. The number is zero, of people that heard the Hur tape and were surprised. And this is why there’s so much distrust in media. Because you‘re right, maybe in 2020 it wasn‘t obvious, but 2022, 2023, right, now, everyone saw this person first with the notes of who to ask questions, with the questions pre-handed out, pre-answered, right. Then there was the guy who couldn‘t get up the stairs, he couldn‘t get up a single flight of stairs without falling. He fell off his bike. He would struggle for every answer,\" Borelli said. \"We all saw that, and most of us were able to identify the fact that the White House, and allies in media, were lying night after night after night, and then suddenly the script flipped.Joe Bidenwas cast aside, and suddenly now we could talk about that as though we all should have known, or we all should saw it. We all made mistakes that maybe we should apologize for. But it was clear as day to anybody,\" Borelli continued. Pete Seat, former spokesperson for President George W. Bush, highlighted a specific portion of the audio when Biden admits that he held onto documentsrelated to Afghanistan for \"posterity.\"Biden first said he didn’t recall why he had the document when asked about it by Hur, who told him it was found in the library of his lake house. \"I don’t know that I knew,\" that he had the document, Biden answered, \"but it wasn’t something I would have stopped to think about.\" AXIOS REPORTER PUSHES BACK ON BIDEN'S DENIAL OF MENTAL DECLINE, SAYING WHITE HOUSE INSIDERS DISAGREE Biden then said, \"I guess I wanted to hang on to it for posterity’s sake. I mean, this was my position on Afghanistan. I’ve been of the view from a historical standpoint that there are certain points in history, world history, where fundamental things change using technology.\" \"So he was admitting what the White House was telling us was just inadvertent, that all these documents were in boxes in his garage in Delaware, inadvertently. Here’s the president admitting that he knowingly kept the document. But then his attorney interjects, Bob Bauer. And he‘s like, ‘no, no, no, no, no, he doesn‘t remember. We can‘t speculate.’ So, in private, they were leaning into his forgetfulness. They were trying to use that to protect him from a criminal charge. Yet, to the public, they were telling us, ‘Oh, he’s sharp, and he’s lucid, and he can recite the periodic table by memory,'\" Seat said. Ahmed Baba, journalist and columnist for the Independent, pushed back on the notion that it was a media cover-up and argued that the media covered it \"pretty ferociously as they could from the outside.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Former President Joe Biden during the White House Creator Economy Conference in the Indian Treaty Room of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 14, 2024.(Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Bloomberg via Getty Images) \"I don’t think it was necessarily a media failure because I think they covered it ferociously. I just think now, as we have this context in hindsight, the real key thing was he shouldn‘t have run for reelection,\" he said. Maria Cardona, a CNN political commentator, added, \"I think at the end of the day, the accountability falls with Joe Biden and, frankly, probably with Jill Biden, too.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Yeah, that’s true. But it also falls on theDemocratic Party, which ostracized people who said anything about Joe Biden,\" Phillip added. \"Including attacking the media for even raising the issue of his age, when clearly it was an issue. I mean, there’s accountability there, too.\" Hanna Panreck is an associate editor at Fox News.",

This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that’s just ‘standard fare.’ Then we’ll all see how it goes for him!\" Springsteen declared last year that \"I'll be casting my vote forKamala Harrisand Tim Walz\" in the presidential election.

    "title": "Angel City's Savy King released from hospital 9 days after her on-field collapse",
    "article_text": "Angel City defender Savy King has been released from the hospital, just more than a week after she collapsed on the field during a match and needed surgery to treat a heart abnormality. King posted a photo of herself in the hospital holding a heart-shaped pillow and giving a thumbs up onsocial mediaSunday. \"I’m still finding the words to express just how much your love and support have meant to me over these past few days. What I do know is that I wouldn’t be getting through this without my incredible family by my side, my amazing teammates who have shown up for me and prayed for me, the fans, the entire soccer community, and the outstanding medical team here at ACFC who saved my life and cared for me every step of the way,\" she wrote on the post. \"I know God’s got me and I’m looking forward to recovering and getting back out on the field!\" Angel City issued a statement that said King had been released from the hospital the day before. King, 20, collapsed during the second half in a National Women's Soccer League match between Angel City and the visiting Utah Royal on May 9. She was treated on the field for more than 10 minutes before she was taken by ambulance to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Once there, doctors discovered a heart abnormality and she underwent surgery on Tuesday. Her prognosis was good, the team said. Players and fans alike were shaken by the incident, but the match continued, a move that was widely criticized. The league later said it was reviewing its policies. TheNWSLPlayers Association was among those that said the match should not have continued. \"These moments demand humanity, sound judgment, and restraint. Any medical emergency that requires the administration of life-saving care should bring play to an end. The match should not have continued,\" the NWSLPA said. On Friday, a league statement expressed regret for allowing the match to continue. \"The health and well being of the entire NWSL community remains our top priority, and in any similar situation going forward the game should and would be abandoned,\" said the statement. Angel City visitedBay FCin a match on Saturday night, the team's first since King's collapse. Before kickoff at San Jose's PayPal Park, both teams wore shirts with ‘SK3’ printed on the front as a tribute to King. Angel City captainSarah Gordenalso held up King’s jersey during the team photo. NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman spoke to reporters at halftime. \"All we could do is learn from the experience and conclude that in a future situation, we will ensure that our policies and protocols do not allow the game to continue,\" she said in her first comments about King's collapse. King was the second-overall pick in the 2024 NWSL draft by expansion Bay FC and played 18 games for the club. She was traded to Angel City in February and had started in eight games for the team this season. Reporting by The Associated Press.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel unpacks former President Joe Biden's 'aggressive' prostate cancer diagnosis on 'Fox Report.' Prostate cancer cases have been on the rise in recent years, increasing 3% annually since 2014 – and now former PresidentJoe Bidenis one of the more than 300,000 men to be diagnosed this year. Biden's office released the announcement on Sunday, days after news that a \"small nodule\" had been found in the former president's prostate during aroutine exam. \"While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management,\" his office said. \"The president and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.\" NEW PROSTATE CANCER TEST PINPOINTS DISEASE BETTER THAN PSA OPTION, STUDY FINDS Treatment is usually more effective when prostate cancer is hormone-sensitive, as that means the disease will likely respond better to hormone therapy, according to Mayo Clinic. Hormone therapy is used to block the effects of the hormones that fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells. Former President Joe Biden is one of the more than 300,000 people to be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year.(Getty Images) \"Prostate cancer cells rely on testosterone to help them grow. Cutting off the supply of testosterone may cause cancer cells to die or to grow more slowly,\" the above source stated. In addition to hormone therapy, commontreatment optionsfor prostate cancer include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and radiopharmaceutical treatments. Prostate canceris a disease found in men that develops in the prostate gland. About 313,780 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in 2025, and 35,770 men will die from the disease, according to the American Cancer Society. Hormone therapy is used to block the effects of the hormones that fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells. One in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, the same source stated. Older men are at a higher risk of the disease, with six in 10 cases diagnosed in patients 65 and older. The average age at diagnosis is 67, with men under 40 rarely affected. Biden is 82. PROSTATE CANCER DRUG NOW AVAILABLE TO MORE PATIENTS WITH AGGRESSIVE FORM OF DISEASE Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer in men, behind onlyskin cancer, the ACS noted. Among men who undergo routineprostate cancer screening, the disease is usually caught early before symptoms emerge, per the ACS. Typical early symptoms include problems urinating, a weak or slow urinary stream or an increased need to urinate. About 313,780 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in 2025 and 35,770 men will die from the disease, according to the American Cancer Society.(iStock) Some men may also notice blood in the urine or bodily fluids. More advanced symptoms may occur after the disease has spread. Those may include pain in the hips, back (spine), chest (ribs) or other areas, the ACS stated. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Men may also suffer from erectile dysfunction,weight loss, extreme fatigue, weakness in the legs or feet, or loss of bladder or bowel control. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force states that men aged 55 to 69 years should have the option to undergo periodic prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening to monitor forprostate cancer. \"Before deciding whether to be screened, men should have an opportunity to discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and to incorporate their values and preferences in the decision,\" the USPSTF states. While screening offers a \"small potential benefit\" of reducing the chances of dying from the disease, health officials warn that some men may experience negative effects.(iStock) While screening offers a \"small potential benefit\" of reducing the chances of dying from the disease, the agency noted that some men may experience negative effects, including false-positive results, overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and treatment complications. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Alternative prostate cancer screening methods are currently being researched, including one that uses a non-invasive urine test, as Fox News Digital recently reported. For localized prostate cancers, where the disease is contained within the prostate, the five-year survival rate is at least 99%, according to the ACS. For regional cases, where the disease has spread only to \"nearby structures or lymph nodes,\" the five-year survival rate is also 99% or greater. If the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, the five-year survival rate drops to 37%.

    "title": "College dropouts celebrate at unconventional 'graduation' ceremony in San Francisco",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Douglas Kennedy explains the push to revive shop classes in U.S. high schools backed by the Trump administration on 'America's Newsroom.' \"F--- school,\" said dropout and tech entrepreneur Haz Hubble at a graduation ceremony forcollege dropouts, a sentiment that captured the mood of the event. \"If you’re smart and high-agency, you don’t need to go to school,\" he said. Though a \"dropout graduation\" might sound like satire, a crowd of quitters packed into San Francisco's Marina Theater seized the opportunity to mark a declaration of freedom – from tradition, academia and expectations. Dozens of 20-somethings donned regular button-ups, casual dresses or otherwise everyday clothing, with the occasional outlier donning a cap and gown – but one thing they all shared was the suspicion that college just isn't for everyone. GEN Z BRANDED AS 'THE GHOSTED GENERATION' AS DATES, COLLEGES AND EMPLOYERS KEEP SAYING 'NO' Some dropouts mingled over the common idea of rejecting the traditional college route to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams.(iStock) \"Our natural instinct as children is to question everything: authority, tradition, the status quo,\" Cory Levy, founder of the Z fellows program that helps aspiring entrepreneurs make their way into Silicon Valley, toldThe San Francisco Standard. \"But somehow, when it comes to college, we stop questioning it. This is a room full of exceptions,\" he added. It's no secret that some of the world's top earners dropped out of college – Bill Gates, Michael Dell, Mark Zuckerberg and the late Steve Jobs among them – and their imprint on the technology sector is clear. The doubt their success creates towardthe traditional college pathis only supplemented with a rising skepticism that's driving many to select different avenues – trade school, apprenticeships and online learning programs among them. VIVEK RAMASWAMY EXPOSES 'NATIONAL SECURITY RISK' AS STUDENTS FALL BEHIND IN SCHOOL Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg smiles during a \"fireside chat\" at a conference organized by technology blog TechCrunch in San Francisco. Zuckerberg and other top tech entrepreneurs were college dropouts.(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) The Standard writes that this skepticism is even more prevalent in a place like San Francisco, where many tech companies aren't concerned about someone lacking a 4-year degree. \"Meanwhile, college graduates struggle to field job offers; bosses say those who do make it into the office — remote or otherwise — are often unprofessional; and AI is getting better at tasks previously reserved for white-collar workers,\" the article, published Sunday, continues. The traditional college approach has lost credibility with some members of Gen Z, many of whom have become notorious for questioning authority. In some circles, they've become the \"toolbelt generation,\" opting to learn a skill that translates into a high-paying job without shelling out the cost of a 4-year college experience. NEARLY HALF OF ALL US COLLEGE STUDENTS REJECT MANDATORY DEI COURSES ON CAMPUS: STUDY But, as former construction worker \"Blue Collar Cash\" author Ken Ruskonce mentionedto \"Fox & Friends,\" the traditional college path is deeply embedded into the educational structure. \"So, if you think you might want to do that [trade] job, you’re walking down the hallway and all you hear is ‘college prep,’\" he said. \"And you’re thinking, ‘Wow, do I not fit in here?’\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Ali Debow, who helped co-organize the dropout graduation, described it as a \"really lonely, very isolating\" feeling because families often have the expectation that everyone goes to college, and they become dissatisfied when someone breaks that college mold. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But, The Standard writes, the key takeaway from the mingling of dropouts isn't as black and white as college or no college – rather, it's about recognizing autonomy and trusting yourself to follow a path to your own success.

    "article_text": "U.S. ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker joins 'FOX & Friends Weekend' to discuss President Donald Trump preparing to call Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to work towards a ceasefire. Secretary of State Marco Rubio addressed the timing of a potential face-to-face meeting between PresidentDonald Trumpand Russian leader Vladimir Putin regarding a ceasefire deal in Ukraine in an interview that aired Sunday. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday while returning to Washington, D.C., from Abu Dhabi that no peace in Ukraine would be reacheduntil he met with Putinin person. The president added in a Truth Social post on Saturday that he planned to speak with Putin on the phone on Monday, followed by a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some NATO leaders. Meanwhile, Rubio — who attended Pope Leo XIV's inaugural mass in Rome on Sunday — said the Vatican has offered to host a direct meeting between Ukraine, Russia and possibly other parties. \"Obviously, the Vatican has made a very generous offer to host anything — by the way, not just a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, but any meeting, including at a technical level, you know — any meetings that need to be hosted, they've expressed a willingness to do so. So it's a very generous offer that may be taken up on,\" Rubio told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" in an interview that was recorded on Saturday. \"I mean, it would be a site that all parties would feel comfortable. So hopefully we'll get to that stage where talks are happening on a regular basis, and that the Vatican will have the opportunity to be one of the options.\" ZELENSKYY SHEDS DETAILS ON MEETING WITH VANCE, RUBIO IN ROME AFTER RUSSIA PEACE TALKS STALL Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, left, and Vice President JD Vance, right, greet each other as Secretary of State Marco Rubio looks on ahead of Pope Leo XIV's formal inaugural Mass in St. Peter's Square in Rome on Sunday.(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) Rubio had a phone call with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, on Saturday afterPutin was a no-showto a face-to-face meeting the Russian leader called with Zelenskyy in Turkey last week. Despite Putin's absence, the Ukrainian and Russian delegations did agree to a prisoner exchange of 1,000 people from each side, though a broader ceasefire or peace deal failed to materialize. CBS host Margaret Brennan asked Rubio if he spoke with Lavrov about lining up a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin. \"Well, we talked about a variety of things,\" said Rubio. \"I wanted to get his readout on his view of how the talks went yesterday. They were not a complete waste of time. For example, there were 1,000 prisoners that are going to be exchanged, and that, from a humanitarian standpoint, is very positive. He explained to me that they are going to be preparing a document outlining their requirements for a ceasefire that would then lead to broader negotiations.\" Rubio said the Ukrainians will be working on their own proposal coming soon, and he hoped proposals from both sides would be \"serious and viable.\" \"So we'll have to wait and see. But he wanted me to know, and he communicated in our call, that their side will be working on a series of ideas and requirements that they would have in order to move forward with a ceasefire and further negotiations,\" he said. Rubio said the U.S. is \"testing\" whether the Russian are just \"tapping\" them along, as Trump has suggested could be the case.

So there's some element of patience that is required. On the other hand, we don't have time to waste,\" Rubio said. \"There are a lot of other things happening in the world that we also need to be paying attention to. So we don't want to be involved in this process of just endless talks — there has to be some progress, some movement forward. And if at the end of this, in the next few days, we get a document produced by both sides, and it shows that both sides are… making concessions and being realistic and rational in their approach, then I think we can feel good about continuing to remain engaged.\" \"If, on the other hand, what we see is not very productive, perhaps we'll have a different assessment. I also agree that, ultimately, one of the things that could help break this logjam — perhaps the only thing that can — is a direct conversation between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. And he's already openly expressed a desire and a belief that that needs to happen, and hopefully that'll be worked out soon as well,\" he added. Pressed on whether the in-person talks between Trump and Putin were being planned, Rubio reiterated that the president had already made that offer publicly.

    "article_text": "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., breaks down efforts on Capitol Hill to pass President Donald Trump’s ‘big, beautiful, bill’ on 'Fox News Sunday.' Multiple conversations are ongoing on Sunday — some in person but most on the phone — asHouse Republicanstry to lock in agreements for the big, beautiful bill. Three areas are outstanding overall. Two are specific to theBudget Committee, which reconvenes Sunday night. Republicans are trying to work out a final pact on green energy tax credits, which could be a major payfor in the bill. The other item is work requirements for Medicaid recipients — and when those kick in. Fox News is told that prospective deals on this front will likely be handshake pacts or \"gentlemen’s agreements,\" as it was phrased to Fox News. REPUBLICANS READY LATE-NIGHT SESSION ON TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AFTER GOP MUTINY The other issue in question is the SALT deduction. That refers to state and local tax breaks for high-tax states. That provision is of the utmost importance to court the votes of moderate Republicans from New York and California. The \"SALT caucus\" wanted a tax write-off, which might cost as much as $600 billion. The new proposal only costs $230 billion. Fox News is told they are trying to forge a compromise which grants a higher SALT deduction at the beginning of the bill’s implementation — and then dials that back over the 10-year budgetary window for the bill. Remember, this measure must not add to the deficit over that decade-long budgetary timeframe in order to qualify for a special process to avoid a filibuster in the Senate. Fox is told that nothing will change in the bill before the Budget Committee on Sunday night. TheWhite Houseis currently addressing how to implement possible changes with a \"manager’s amendment\" before the Rules Committee later this week. That would finalize and lock in stone the actual text of the bill. Fox is told that the GOP leadership believes they are certainly within range. The GOP brass is generally feeling good at where they stand, \"so long as people don’t start adding things,\" said one senior House Republican leadership source. HOUSE GOP UNVEILS MEDICAID WORK REQUIREMENTS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' The overall goal is to post the text of the bill early this week and go to the Rules Committee on Wednesday with a possible vote on Thursday. But one senior GOP source told Fox the timetable could be expedited with a Tuesday Rules Committee meeting — where changes would be made — and maybe go to the floor on Wednesday. Now, on to what will likely happen on Sunday night in the Budget Committee: The resolution, mashing together the text from all the other committees, failed on Friday afternoon. The process can’t move forward unless they get the measure out of the Budget Committee. Hence, Sunday's 10 p.m. ET meeting. There will be little if any debate — it’s only about that math. Either the GOP leadership and the White House have satisfied the concerns of those who voted nay or they haven’t. In fact, if things go swimmingly, this could be wrapped up after 20 minutes or so. Here’s what it will look like: The first vote is the \"motion to reconsider\" the failed Friday vote. If that fails, they are stuck. But if they get over that hurdle, it’s on to an actual re-vote of what failed on Friday. This is the key vote. If the Budget Committee greenlights the package at this stage, it’s on to the Rules Committee this week and then the floor. There will be five non-binding votes after that key vote on issues we don’t need to worry about. Chad Pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).

House Speaker Mike Johnson on Sunday defended the \"aggressive\" timetable he is pushing to advance PresidentDonald Trump’s \"big, beautiful bill,\" saying the House remains on track to pass the \"historic\" legislative package by Memorial Day. The House Budget Committee willreconvene at 10 p.m. Sunday nightafter a vote to advance the more than 1,100-page \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" failed Friday, when five Republicans sided with committee Democrats to sink Trump’s sweeping tax bill. \"We’re on track, working around the clock to deliver this nation-shaping legislation for the American people as soon as possible,\" Johnson said during an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday\" regarding ongoing negotiations. \"All 11 of our committees have wrapped up their work, and they spent less and saved more than even we’ve projected initially.

    "title": "Biden's woes converge: Last-minute pardons under fire, calls for prosecution mount following Hur tape release",
    "article_text": "Author Tom Fitton discusses the release of former President Biden’s interview audio with Special Counsel Robert Hur on ‘Fox News @ Night.’ The release of audio recordings of former PresidentJoe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur have intensified criticism of the administration's use of an autopen on official presidential orders and pardons. The damning tapes, which bring Biden's alarming mental decline into sharp relief, were kept under wraps by Biden Attorney General Merrick Garland. Now that Biden's cognitive problems have been bared, some are calling for Garland to face prosecution for rejecting Congressional demands to release the tapes when he ran the Department of Justice (DOJ). \"Key decisions made in the final days of the Biden presidency, including using autopens to issue blanket pardons for the Biden Crime Family, must be fully examined. There are serious concerns that President Biden lacked the mental capacity to authorize those actions,\" House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., posted to X on Saturday. Axios released hours of Biden's interview with the special counsel's office on Saturday – a year and a half after the interviews were held across a two-day period in the fall of 2023. The recordings showed the former president tripping over his words, slurring sentences, taking long pauses between answers and struggling to remember key moments in his life, including the year his son Beau Biden died of cancer. The recordings have further bolstered conservative outrage stretching back years that Biden's mental acuity had cratered and that the Delaware Democrat who had served in the Senate for decades had become a \"shadow\" of himself and was unfit to lead the country as president. CRITICISMS MOUNT THAT BIDEN IS A 'SHADOW' OF HIMSELF AFTER DISASTROUS DEBATE: 'NOT THE SAME MAN' FROM VP ERA Former President Joe Biden is facing renewed scrutiny over his mental acuity following the release of the Hur tapes.(AP Photo/Morry Gash) The flurry of pardons Biden allegedly signed by autopen in the waning days of his administration included ones for his son Hunter Biden, his siblings and their spouses, retired Gen. Mark Milley, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and members and staff of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, told Fox News Digital in a phone interview on Sunday that he has long sounded the alarm over the validity of Biden's pardons, as many lacked specifically what charges an individual was protected against. Instead, many of the pardons outlined blanket protections, such as preemptively pardoning Milley and Fauci from potential prosecution and blanket pardons for unidentified members of Congress who served on the J6 select committee. \"I've been long of the position that the pardons, many of the pardons, are not valid based on the fact that they don't pardon anything. It's just a pardon for conduct that's unnamed … it's further confirmation that the pardons are not valid,\" said Fitton, who had sued for the release of the audio recordings. WHAT IS AN AUTOPEN? THE SIGNING DEVICE AT THE HEART OF TRUMP'S ATTACKS ON BIDEN PARDONS \"A competent president would say, ‘How is it I could pardon someone for nothing?’\" he continued. Fitton added that \"more importantly, Biden should still be prosecuted\" after he was \"mollycoddled\" by the Biden DOJ during the investigation into the documents he possessed from his days in the Senate and when he served as vice president. Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks during a news conference at the Department of Justice under the Biden administration.(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) \"The audio shows he was mollycoddled by the Justice Department, you know, because Hur was working for the Justice Department. … There's an argument that the records he had as vice president, he could have. But that wasn't the position of Justice Department. But certainly he didn't have the right to have those records from his days of the Senate,\" Fitton said. President Donald Trump railed on Truth Social that the release of the audio recordings revealed a \"bigger scandal\" about the use of an autopen under the BidenWhite House. \"Whoever had control of the \"AUTOPEN\" is looking to be a bigger and bigger scandal by the moment,\" Trump posted to Truth Social on Friday. TRUMP CLAIMS BIDEN PARDONS ARE ‘VOID,’ ALLEGING THEY WERE SIGNED VIA AUTOPEN He added: \"THIS IS WHY THE UNSELECT COMMITTEE OF POLITICAL THUGS, WHO WERE GIVEN A FULL AND COMPLETE PARDON BY THE PERSON WHO WIELDED THE NOW ILLEGALLY USED AUTOPEN, DELETED AND DESTROYED ALL EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION FROM THEIR CORRUPT AND VICIOUS WITCH HUNT AGAINST ME, AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE, WHOSE LIVES WERE COMPLETELY SHATTERED AND DESTROYED BY THIS HISTORICALLY CRIMINAL EVENT.\" An example of an autopen machine.(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File) Autopen signatures are automatically produced by a machine, as opposed to an authentic, handwritten signature. The conservative Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project first investigated the Biden administration's use of an autopen earlier this year and found that the same signature was on a bevvy of executive orders and other official documents, while Biden’s signature on the document announcing his departure from the 2024 race varied from the apparent machine-produced signature. The reports led to speculation that Biden aides had approved of executive orders and sweeping pardons, not the president. Hur led an investigation intoBiden's handling of classified documentsfollowing his departure as vice president under the Obama administration. Hur announced in February 2024 that he would not recommend criminal charges against Biden for possessing classified materials after his vice presidency, citing that Biden is \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" Although a transcript was released, the White House asserted executive privilege over releasing recordings after Garland urged the administration not to release the recordings, according to a letter obtained by Fox News in May of last year. BIDEN'S 'AUTOPEN SIGNATURE' APPEARS ON MOST OFFICIAL DOCS, RAISING CONCERNS OVER WHO CONTROLLED THE WH: REPORT Audio from then-President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur, right, reveals that he, and not the special counsel, brought up Beau Biden's death.(Getty Images) \"The audio recordings of your interview and Mr. Zwonitzer's interview fall within the scope of executive privilege. Production of these recordings to the Committees would raise an unacceptable risk of undermining the Department's ability to conduct similar high-profile criminal investigations--in particular, investigations where the voluntary cooperation of White House officials is exceedingly important,\" Garland wrote in a letter to Biden last year, justifying why the recordings should not be released. PRESIDENT BIDEN PARDONS HIS SIBLINGS JUST MINUTES BEFORE LEAVING OFFICE Comer and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-OH, subpoenaed theDepartment of Justicein February 2024 for the recordings and other materials related to the interview and investigation, but to no avail. The House voted to hold Garland in contempt of Congress over the matter in June 2024. Comer announced on Friday that his committee will continue \"its investigation into the cover-up of Biden’s mental decline and use of autopen\" and the use of the pen when Biden pardoned members of his family. House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY).(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) \"The American people deserve to know who was actually calling the shots in the Biden White House, because it wasn’t Joe Biden. His mental decline was obvious to anyone paying attention. But instead of being honest, the Biden Administration, Democrats in Congress, and the legacy media lied and covered it up. They gaslit the American people while propping up a man who was unfit to lead,\" Comer said in a press release on Friday, noting that Garland \"defied\" a subpoena to release the recordings. \"Key decisions made in the final days of the Biden presidency, including using autopens to issue blanket pardons for the Biden Crime Family, must be fully examined. There are serious concerns that President Biden lacked the mental capacity to authorize those actions. The American people are done being lied to. We’re going to bring the truth into the light, and starting next week, those involved in the cover-up will begin to be put on notice,\" Comer said in a statement on Friday. The recordings \"demonstrate that Biden was completely out of it, and we already found documents that the Biden White House had changed the transcript, edited it to hide this. This is what they were hiding. There's got to be accountability. Garland should be prosecuted by the Attorney General over the contempt he had for Congress to hide this,\" Fitton said on Fox News last week. Fox News host Mark Levin said Garland \"should be forced to testify before Congress under oath\" over the alleged cover-up of Biden's health. \"Former Attorney General Garland heard these recordings and used lies and deceit to prevent them from being released to the American people before the Democrats nominated Biden. He should be forced to testify before Congress under oath and held to account for his grotesque abuse of power,\"Levin posted to X. HUNTER BIDEN PARDON: MEDIA TAKES LATEST BLOW TO CREDIBILITY WITH BOTCHED COVERAGE OF BROKEN PROMISE Hours before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, the White House announced pardons for both Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; and Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Less than a half an hour before Trump became president, Biden pardoned members of his family, including his brother James B. Biden, sister Valerie Biden Owens, brother-in-law John T. Owens and brother Francis W. Biden. The former president had previously issued a \"full and unconditional pardon\" to his adult son,Hunter Biden, after he was convicted in two separate federal cases last year. Hunter Biden's pardon covered a 10-year period, between 2014 to 2024, for any offenses he may have committed. \"I do think that the Biden pardons need some scrutiny, and they need scrutiny because we want pardons to matter and to be accepted and to be something that's used correctly. So, I do think we're going to take a hard look at how they went and what they did. And if they're null and void,\" Ed Martin said in his final press conference while serving as acting U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump speaks during an event.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump claimed on Truth Social in March that Biden's pardons were \"void\" due to the \"fact that they were done by Autopen.\" \"The 'Pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,\" Trump claimed in a Truth Social post. \"In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them! The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden. He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime,\" Trump added. BIDEN STRUGGLES WITH WORDS, KEY MEMORIES IN LEAKED AUDIO FROM SPECIAL COUNSEL HUR INTERVIEW Martin, who will now lead the Department of Justice's \"Weaponization Working Group\" targeting political corruption within the federal law enforcement department, added in a media interview earlier this month that he had been investigating Biden's last-minute pardons. \"When [former President] Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Rich, and it turned out that Marc Rich had paid a boatload of money to one of Clinton’s friend’s lawyers. That’s not corrupt, it’s not criminal, because the plenary power of the pardon. But in the case of Joe Biden and his pardons, they were so specific. Back 14 years, covering everything you’ve ever done. And when I say specific, they were broad, but they had time stuff on them,\" Martin said earlier this month, according to the Daily Caller News Foundation. Former Interim United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Ed Martin.(Getty Images) \"And that at least leads to questions, because the plenary power’s true. But the question is what is going on here, and I did get responses from some of them and those questions are ongoing,\" Martin continued. Conservative social media users have sounded off that the recordings show Biden lacked the cognitive ability to know about the pardons or executive orders he allegedly signed off on. HUR TRANSCRIPT CONFIRMS BIDEN MEMORY LAPSES, CONTRADICTS PRESIDENT'S CLAIM ABOUT EXCHANGE OVER SON'S DEATH \"Joe Biden had no clue where he was for most of his presidency... Just listen to Robert Hur's interview with him... He's a complete mess. There's no way Biden knew about the pardons, executive orders and directives coming out of his office,\" conservative X commentator Tim Youngposted to the platform. \"I'd say with the Hur tapes coming out, maybe those pardons can be challenged?

    "article_text": "Senator Adam Schiff and Kash Patel clash over January 6th song. PresidentDonald Trump's nominees consistently engage with Democrats who challenge them in increasingly viral hearing moments that analysts say are not intended as gifts to the media, but red meat for their base. The media understands Democrats have little power on a Republican-dominated Capitol Hill, according to Bill D’Agostino, senior analyst for the Media Research Center. \"If you were to watch any given night on CNN or MSNBC evening shows, you'll find a couple of panel discussion segments that are basically just Democratic strategists and the host talking shop,\" he told Fox News Digital in a Thursday interview. \"The discussion has focused almost entirely on how can Democrats show their voters that they're trying to fight this, that they're trying to make a difference, that they're resisting the Trump administration.\" WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY DEFENDS TRUMP'S FIRING OF INSPECTORS GENERAL Partisan politics has come to a point, D’Agostino suggested, where constituents send Democrats to Washington to stop Trump at every turn, regardless of ideological alignment or differences. \"Obviously, as the minority party, there's not much action they can actually offer. So instead, their political futures basically rest on how hard they're trying to stop Trump.\" One of the most contentious exchanges occurred during FBI DirectorKash Patel’sJanuary confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sen.Adam Schiff, D-Calif., dug into granular language used by Patel after the Capitol riot in regard to a song released by inmates that featured Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Patel told Schiff he stood by prior testimony that he had had nothing to do with the recording of the song, while the Burbank Democrat grilled him over a comment to former Trump adviser Stephen Bannon about \"what we thought would be cool… captur[ing] audio\" for the song. Schiff asked why he said that, and Patel incredulously shot back \"that’s why it says, ‘we’ [as opposed to I] as you highlighted.\" Patel denied participating in the digitizing of the song. The exchange was compared to former President Bill Clinton’s grammatical comments about the word \"is\" during the Monica Lewinsky affair. During Attorney GeneralPam Bondi’sconfirmation, Schiff was at the fore again, demanding she disclose whether she might prosecute former special counsel Jack Smith over his Trump probe. Bondi repeatedly said she wouldn’t answer hypothetical, anddinged Schiff in responsefor focusing on Smith while his own California is rife with violent crime. RFK Jr, left, Kash Patel, center, Adam Schiff, right(Getty) Bondi also snapped back at Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., after a grilling on the Fourteenth Amendment and citizenship, saying, \"I'm not here to do your homework and study for you.\" During Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s hearing, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., delved into Hegseth’s multiple marriages and allegations of untoward behavior. Kaine said Hegseth had \"casually cheated\" on a former wife shortly after his daughter Gwendolyn was born. Hegseth countered that the situation had been investigated and that Kaine’s claims were \"false charges.\" \"You've admitted that you had sex at that hotel in October 2017. You said it was consensual, isn't that correct?\" Kaine went on, probing further. BONDI ANNOUNCES ONE OF LARGEST FENTANYL SEIZURES IN US HISTORY Hegseth also made headlines when he interrupted Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., mid-sentence as she criticized the revolving door among military generals, Pentagon chiefs, and defense contractors. \"I’m not a general, senator,\" he said, prompting laughter in the gallery. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also had several similar moments, including when Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., opened his remarks by speaking about the measles and telling the nominee bluntly, \"You frighten people.\" Kennedy also rejected a line of questioning from Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., claiming that he had compared the Atlanta-based CDC’s work to Nazi death camps. Outbursts and grilling continued in recent oversight hearings, including this past week when Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., got into a tiff with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem about Salvadorandeportee Kilmar Garcia. At one point, Swalwell informed Noem he has a \"bull---t detector.\" Mark Bednar, a former top aide to ex-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was one of many \"sherpas\" tasked with guiding nominees through the confirmation process, including meetings with senators. Bednar assisted EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin through his process, which, by comparison to others, was mild. Zeldin’s hearing actually included some bipartisan joking – like when Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., riffed that Zeldin’s cell phone rang unexpectedly because \"the fossil fuel industry\" was calling him after a line of questioning on the matter. SWALWELL WARNS NOEM HE HAS A ‘BULLS---’ DETECTOR DURING HEATED EXCHANGE ABOUT ABREGO GARCIA Bednar recounted a loud protester in the hall who remained for some time, offering conjecture that the disruptive woman hadn’t yet crossed any legal lines like protesters actually inside hearing rooms like during Kennedy's confirmation. But Bednar said that many of the other nominees faced Democrats who would rather make a show than \"be diplomatic and deliberative over policy.\" \"I think that is a big indicator to me that the left has no substantive answers for rebuttals to President Trump's agenda or Republicans' agenda. And that, to me, is a sign that if you're a Republican, that that's encouraging -- the public's on your side, and the far left has been unable to formulate a rational, level-headed response, much less not even be able to articulate one.\" Fox News Digital reached out to other sherpas but did not hear back. Meanwhile, Bednar said that it has been interesting to watch the hearing disruptions evolve into larger scenes with similarly little substance or long-term gain. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I thought I was very rich and pun intended, that Cory Booker delivered a record-breaking speech that the Democrats were basically just grasping for anything to kind of count as a win, even though it didn't really amount to anything,\" he said, after the New Jersey Democrat held an unofficial filibuster – as there was no legislation being held up – for more than a day. That speech, however, precipitated several fundraising emails from the left, Bednar said, which bolstered D’Agostino’s claim about playing to the base. \"If it's a session day in D.C., and Republicans are in charge, there's going to be liberal agitators protesting; as the sky is blue,\" Bednar quipped.

    "title": "Republicans ready late-night session on Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' after GOP mutiny",
    "article_text": "House Speaker Mike Johnson breaks down efforts on Capitol Hill to pass President Donald Trump’s ‘big, beautiful, bill’ on ‘Fox News Sunday.' House lawmakers are being summoned to Capitol Hill late Sunday night as Republicans’ self-imposed deadline to pass PresidentDonald Trump’s\"big, beautiful bill\" looms just days away. The House Budget Committee is meeting at 10 p.m. for a vote on advancing the wide-ranging legislation toward a chamber-wide vote later this week. Initial plans to advance the bill on Friday morning were upended in a mutiny by four members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus – Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, Ralph Norman, R-S.C., Josh Brecheen, R-Okla., and Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., all joined Democrats in voting against the bill. The fiscal hawks are opposed to aspects of the legislation’s crackdown on Medicaid, which Republicans have said they are only trimming for waste, fraud, and abuse. But Medicaid work requirements for able-bodied people are not set to kick in until 2029, and conservatives have argued that it was a large window of time for those changes to be undone, among other concerns. ANTI-ABORTION PROVIDER MEASURE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' COULD SPARK HOUSE GOP REBELLION President Donald Trump is pushing House Republicans to get his budget bill over the line(Getty Images) They’re also pushing for a more aggressive effort to repeal green energy tax subsidies passed in the former Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). That push has pitted them against Republican lawmakers whose districts have businesses that have benefited from the tax relief. Meanwhile House GOP leaders and the White House have held the bill up as the most significant fiscal reform in decades. Holdouts were expected to negotiate with GOP leaders in Congress and the White House through the weekend. \"I really need to see something in writing. You know, we’ve talked enough. They know where we are. And you know, before, if it's just if it's the same old thing, that we can't get [a majority], we're going to have to pretty much stick with what we have, I’ve got a problem,\" Norman told Fox News Digital on Sunday morning He said heand other criticsof the legislation were asked to meet with House GOP leaders at 1:30 p.m. on Sunday afternoon. BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY Republicans are working to pass Trump’s agenda via the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party controlling both Congress and the White House to pass vast pieces of legislation while completely sidelining the minority – in this case, Democrats. It does so by lowering the Senate’s threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51, lining up with the House’s own simple majority. The legislation must adhere to a specific set of rules, however, including only items related to federal spending, tax, and the national debt. Both the House and Senate are dealing with razor-thin margins. That extends to the House Budget Committee as well, where Republicans can only lose two of their own to still advance the legislation. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was confident that Republicans could overcome their differences and stick to their timeline during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., talks with reporters after a meeting of the House Republican Conference in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, February 5, 2025(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) \"The plan is to move it to the Rules Committee by midweek, and to the House floor by the end of the week, as we meet our initial, our original Memorial Day deadline,\" Johnson said. Johnson said Republicans also \"have got to compromise\" on Medicaid work requirements, adding he was in contact with states \"to make sure what the earliest possible date is.\" \"This is the biggestspending reductionin three decades, maybe longer,\" Johnson said. Norman signaled that significant compromise was going to have to be made on leaders’ parts. \"Let’s say they want it to kick in, in a year or six months. It ought to be now, but we'll look at that. We're not inflexible,\" he said. \"But the main thing I want to relay, this isn't the end-all-catch-all-be-all. Nobody would disagree that the tax cuts are good policy, and nobody would disagree with President Trump's wanting to phase out Green New Deal scam credits. Anyone we want to do it on day one. So we're carrying out his policies.\" Meanwhile Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought, a close ally of Roy’s, took to X in support of the bill after it failed Friday. \"Critics have attacked the House's One Big Beautiful reconciliation bill on fiscal grounds, but I think they are profoundly wrong. It is truly historic,\" Vought said. \"The bill satisfies the very red-line test that House fiscal hawks laid out a few weeks ago that stated that the cost of any tax cut could be paid for with $2.5 trillion in assumed economic growth, but the rest had to be covered with savings from reform.\" President Donald Trump's Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought spoke out in support of the bill(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) Trump blasted the people holding up the legislation as grandstanders in a Truth Social post Friday. Those rebels and their allies, however, have argued that they are only pushing to fully enactTrump’s agenda. \"He campaigned on cutting the Green New Deal. But it's really a scam…. But this bill to postpone phase-out for seven years, it's just money we don't have,\" Norman said. Economic Policy Innovation Center founder Paul Winfree wrote on X Saturday, \"Several of the Members of Congress negotiating on the OBBB this weekend are trying to make it even better. In fact, there is a significant group that has been fighting all along to make sure that [Trump] gets the biggest win possible.\" Moving ahead with Sunday night’s vote is a sign of confidence by House GOP leaders, but it’s not yet clear how it will play out. In addition to the Medicaid and IRA differences, Republicans must also reconcile current disagreements with blue state GOP lawmakers over State and Local tax (SALT) deduction caps. U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Tx., speaks to the media after the House of Representatives failed to pass a government funding bill at the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 19, 2024 in Washington, D.C.(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The legislation raised the current $10,000 cap to $30,000, but a handful of blue state Republicans rejected the compromise as insufficient. Meanwhile, conservatives in redder districts are demanding deeper pay cuts if the SALT deduction cap was raised. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP SALT Caucus member Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., suggested raising taxes on the highest earners to offset the cost – it would likely be an uphill battle to enact, though some conservatives have also signaled openness to the idea. \"The One Big Beautiful Bill has stalled—and it needs wind in its sails. Allowing the top tax rate to expire—returning from 37% to 39.6% for individuals earning over $609,350 and married couples earning over $731,200—breathes $300 billion of new life into the effort,\" LaLota wrote on X Saturday. \"It’s a fiscally responsible move that reflects the priorities of the new Republican Party: protect working families, address the deficit, fix the unfair SALT cap, and safeguard programs like Medicaid and SNAP—without raising taxes on the middle class.\" Elizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

    "article_text": "Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., and Sen. Ashley Moody, R-Fla., break down navigating motherhood and Congress on ‘My View with Lara Trump.’ PresidentDonald Trumpcalled himself the \"fertilization president\" during Women’s History Month, but some experts cited claims that \"baby bonuses,\" such as the $5,000 plan Trump floated, have been tried in the past and had mixed results. Singapore, Hungary and Australia are three examples of countries where such programs have been instituted. Singapore has been subsidizing parenthood for decades, with the latest endowment per child reachingS$ 11,000 (US $8,000) as of 2023, but the tiny Asian nation still has one of the lowest birth rates in the world. Gabriella Hoffman, an official at the Independent Women’s Forum, wrote on social media thatbaby bonusesdid not work in Hungary. DNC VICE CHAIR SLAMS TRUMP AS ‘PUNK’, WOULD-BE DICTATOR AT FIERY PA TOWN HALL President Donald Trump has floated the idea of a baby bonus for new parents.(Getty/iStock) \"Why would we replicate this here?\" she asked. That country, ledby Trump-favoredPresident Viktor Orban, also incentivizes its residents to have more kids, including through tax breaks for families with three or more offspring. Hungary’s birth rate rose slightly about a decade ago but returned to and remains close to one. Australia’sprogram began in 2004and indexed to inflation in 2008 what was then an A$ 5,000 (US $3,180) for parents per birth. The government’s self-reported birthrate statistic was about 1.5 as of 2023. Paula Lantz, a social demographer from the University of Michigan,told the Guardianthat in the U.S., the percentage of families having more than one child has dropped and that \"there is something else going on\" – including non-financial considerations like quality of life effects. An official at the liberal Center for American Progress told the outlet she had a child a few months ago and that the promised $5,000 credit \"wouldn’t do much\" even with good insurance and paid occupational family leave. OBAMA SLAMS PRO-TRUMP MEN AT PHILADELPHIA RALLY WHILE SPRINGSTEEN WARNS GOP NOMINEE IS ‘AN AMERICAN TYRANT’ Andrea Ippolito, founder of maternal health tech platform SimpliFed, told Fox News Digital that while the $5,000 is a \"nice boost,\" the initiative \"just lightly scratches the surface of the support that is needed for families, especially in the early years with childcare and healthcare support that is largely missing from the postpartum care experience.\" \"In order to increase the birth rate, much more is needed to support and ensure that both mom andbaby's healthis prioritized,\" Ippolito said. \"That means both physical health needs (which are not right now as demonstrated with doubling the preeclampsia rate doubling) and mental health needs.\" On the other hand, Emily and Nathan Berning – co-founders of crisis-pregnancy support siteLetThemLive.org, said that the baby bonus touted by Trump \"is a positive step, but it doesn’t go far enough.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Financial aid after delivery is helpful, but the real need is stability throughout pregnancy—rent, food, counseling, and emotional support,\" the Bernings said. \"If we want to raise birthrates and protect children, we must act earlier and ensure no woman feels forced into a decision out of fear or isolation.\" They touted the benefits of pregnancy clinics that are founded by both pro-life and pro-choice advocates, saying that is how to prioritize \"compassion over politics.\" Meanwhile, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, introduced a proposal for the feds to provide $1,000 in an account for each American child. The \"Invest America Act\" would create \"a private tax-advantaged account,\" and Cruz said in a statement last week the investments can be placed in a broad, low-cost fund that tracks the S&P 500, growing tax-deferred until the individual reaches age 18. Distributions after age 18 would be taxed at the capital gains rate. Fox News Digital reached out to Cruz for any comment on claims from critics that past iterations of the accounts have not been successful.

    "title": "WH study warns 9 million Americans could lose health insurance in 'major' recession if Trump budget bill fails",
    "article_text": "House Ways and Means Committee chair Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., breaks down Republicans' debate over 'SALT' deductions and Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful' bill on 'The Will Cain Show.' The White House on Saturday released a study estimating that 8.2 to 9.2 million more Americans could be without health insurance as a result of an ensuing recession if President Donald Trump’s\"big, beautiful bill\"on the budget does not pass. The finding comes from a White HouseCouncil of Economic Advisersmemo titled, \"Health Insurance Opportunity Cost if 2025 Proposed Budget Reconciliation Bill Does Not Pass.\" The research assumes that the U.S. had approximately 27 million uninsured people in 2025. If the budget bill does not pass, that could increase to approximately 36 million uninsured people, far closer to the approximately 50 million people who were uninsured before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, in 2010, according to the memo. 'FAILURE'S NOT AN OPTION': TRUMP BUDGET BILL WILL BE 'BIG' HELP FOR SENIORS, TOP HOUSE TAX-WRITER SAYS President Donald Trump during a swearing-in ceremony of Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., May 6, 2025.(REUTERS/Kent Nishimura/File Photo) The memo says the estimate is \"based on the assumption that states which expanded Medicaid with relatively generous eligibility will pull back to meet balanced budget requirements and try to provide more unemployment support during a severe recession.\" It also qualifies its conclusions by saying the analysis assumes \"no policy countermeasures,\" which theWhite Housedescribes as a \"very unlikely but plausible worse case\" scenario. The White House projects that the expiration of the 2017 Trump tax cuts in 2026 and other shocks would trigger a \"moderate to severe recession.\" The economic advisers report that a \"major recession\" would result in reduced consumer spending as a result of higher individual taxes, lower small business investment and hiring as a result higher pass-through individual taxes, global confidence shock including concerns about U.S. competitiveness, and dollar deflation tightening credit and pushing real interest rates higher. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump dances at a campaign event at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, Oct. 15, 2024, in Atlanta.(AP Photo/John Bazemore, File) GOP REBEL MUTINY THREATENS TO DERAIL TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' BEFORE KEY COMMITTEE HURDLE According to the advisers' \"upper bound\" estimate of the impact of not extending the Trump tax cuts, U.S. GDP could contract by approximately 4% over two years – similar to the 2008 recession. Unemployment could increase by four percentage points, resulting in approximately 6.5 million job losses. Of those 6.5 million job losses, 60% had employer-sponsored insurance, so the White House projects approximately 3.9 million people would lose coverage and become uninsured as a result. The memo also anticipates a loss of individual and marketplace coverage, as those already without employer-sponsored insurance are no longer able to afford to purchase insurance themselves. The White House expects a 15% drop from approximately 22 million enrolled in 2026 to approximately 3.3 million losing coverage. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks during a news conference at the Capitol, May 6, 2025, in Washington.(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr., File) Without the passage of the\"big, beautiful bill,\"Medicaid and ACA subsidized plan enrollment could experience 10% enrollment frictions, resulting in approximately 500,000 to 1 million people losing or failing to gain coverage, the memo states. The expiration of the 2017 Trump tax cuts would disproportionately affect non-citizens, gig workers and early retirees, according to the White House. The advisers assess that individuals in those working classes without employer-sponsored insurance would no longer be able to afford coverage as a result of a recession, leading to 500,000 to 1 million insurance losses among \"vulnerable segments.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is laboring to get the \"One Big Beautiful Act\" through the House by a self-imposed Memorial Day deadline despite divisions among Republicans, who maintain control of the lower chamber by a razor-thin margin. The 1,116-page bill includes more than $5 trillion in tax cuts, costs that are partially offset by spending cuts elsewhere and other changes in the tax code, and would make permanent the tax cuts from Trump's first term. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It also realizes many of Trump‘s campaign promises, including temporarily ending taxes on overtime and tips for many workers, creating a new $10,000 tax break on auto loan interest for American-made cars, and even creating a new tax-free \"MAGA account\" that would contribute $1,000 to children born in his second term.

    "title": "Trump-aligned legal group fights to restore merit-based federal hiring",
    "article_text": "Fox News chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream discusses legal battles the Trump administration faces over immigration issues on ‘Special Report.’ FIRST ON FOX —A legal group closely aligned with PresidentDonald Trumpis joining a federal court battle in Washington, D.C., to overturn a Carter-era consent decree that bars the government from using merit-based hiring, a resolution that, if overturned, would dissolve one of the most influential civil service decisions of the last 40 years. The America First Legal Foundation (AFL), a group aligned with Trump, has filed a federal complaint in Washington, D.C., that aims to dismantle what it calls a dated and illegal effort topromote diversityin federal hiring that sidelines more qualified candidates. \"America is missing out on top talent because of an illegal, 44-year-old consent decree,\" Nick Barry, senior counsel at AFL, told Fox News Digital. \"We must move back to merit-based evaluations. Race and other immutable traits have no place in that process.\" JUDGE ON WARPATH PRESSES TRUMP DOJ ON ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION, ANSWERS LEAVE COURTROOM IN STUNNED SILENCE Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, speaks during a press briefing at the White House in Washington. Miller founded America First Legal after Trump's first term.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The lawsuit targets the Luevano consent decree, an agreement that Black and Hispanic plaintiffs struck with the government under President Jimmy Carter in 1981. The settlement ended merit-based hiring practices for federal government agencies and required written tests to be replaced with alternative assessments. Critics of these alternative assessments, including AFL and the firm Boyden Gray, PLLC, which joined the complaint, argue they are clunky and outdated solutions that illegally promote an unfair system of race-based hiring. \"We must move back to merit-based evaluations,\" Barry added. \"Race, color and other immutable characteristics have no place in that evaluation.\" The Office of Personnel Management had previously asked the court to end the Carter-era system, an effort that AFL and Boyden Gray now join, arguing it violatesSupreme Courtprecedent.

But it's also likely to be met with a fair degree of criticism. Though efforts to end or replace the 40-year-old alternative assessment systems aren't exactly radical, the filing comes as the Trump administration continues to clash with government employees over agency budget cuts and workforce reductions. The case, if heard in court, could reignite debate across the country over race-conscious hiring practices. 100 DAYS OF INJUNCTIONS, TRIALS AND 'TEFLON DON': TRUMP SECOND TERM MEETS ITS BIGGEST TESTS IN COURT Demonstrators participate in a protest at the statehouse April 5, 2025, in Columbia, S.C.(Sean Rayford/Getty) America First Legal, though not officially part of the Trump administration, was founded by longtime Trump advisorStephen Miller, one of Trump's most vocal advocates for tougher immigration enforcement, dismantling DEI programs and ending affirmative action in public education. Miller stepped down from AFL before rejoining the White House in 2025. The effort also comes at a time when many federal agencies have struggled to cope with a massive loss of personnel and institutional knowledge due to funding cuts and other orders from DOGE, the quasi-government efficiency agency headed up by billionaire Elon Musk. Still, AFL sees its effort as supporting OPM and ending what it argues is a virtually \"impossible\" standard to create a broadly used merit-based civil service exam. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Public service is a public trust,\" Epstein said. \"Presidential administrations from both parties have long advocated ending unaccountable bureaucracies that fail to do a good turn for the American people.\" Neither OPM nor the White House immediately responded to Fox News's request for comment on the new court filing or on their views on the existing hiring practices.

FiveTexas district attorneysare suing state Attorney General Ken Paxton, challenging new rules that would give his office broad authority to access their office’s case records, according to a new report. In the two lawsuits filed on Friday, the district attorneys said the rule, in effect since April, is an unconstitutional overreach that violates the separation of powers and would impose unnecessary burdens on county prosecutors, The Texas Tribune reported. District attorneys in Dallas, Bexar and Harris countiesfiled one lawsuitwhile district attorneys in Travis and El Paso counties filed another. Both lawsuits seek to block Paxton from enforcing the rule, arguing that it violates the state constitution and federal law. The rule created by Paxton's office applies to counties with at least 400,000 residents, impacting only 13 of Texas' 254 counties, The Texas Tribune reported. It requires district attorneys to provide all documents or communications produced or received by their offices, including confidential information. TEXAS GOV.

Counties must also submit quarterly reports to the attorney general on twelve different subjects, including specific information on indictments of police officers and the number of times indictments were issued for election code violations. Information on internal policies and how funds obtained through civil forfeiture are spent would also need to be turned over under the new rule. Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot described the rules as a violation of the separation of powers between the executive branch and the judicial branch. \"To make matters worse, the rule’s extremely burdensome reporting requirements will cause district attorneys' offices to divert resources and staff away from core prosecutorial roles and responsibilities, which harms public safety and the administration of justice,\" Creuzot said in a statement. \"And it will cost Dallas County taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars or more to pay for the technology and resources needed to identify and produce all the responsive information under these unnecessary reporting requirements.\" In the two lawsuits, the district attorneys said the rule is an unconstitutional overreach that violates the separation of powers and would needlessly burden offices.(Justin Lane/Reuters) \"AG Paxton should be working with all district and county attorneys in pursuit of justice, not picking fights with the Democrats in large cities,\" Creuzot added. Paxton’s office has claimed the provision is a way to \"rein in rogue district attorneys\" allegedly refusing to uphold the law. District attorneys that do not comply with the reporting rule could be charged with official misconduct and removed from office. \"District and County Attorneys have a duty to protect the communities they serve by upholding the law and vigorously prosecuting dangerous criminals,\" Paxton said in March. \"In many major counties, the people responsible for safeguarding millions of Texans have instead endangered lives by refusing to prosecute criminals and allowing violent offenders to terrorize law-abiding Texans.

This lawsuit is meritless and merely a sad, desperate attempt to conceal information from the public they were sworn to protect,\" he continued. The two lawsuits claim Paxton’s office does not have the sweeping jurisdiction the rule creates, and that providing the information requested would be expensive and illegal, according to The Texas Tribune. The lawsuits claim the rule seeks to achieve apolitical objectiveby burdening officials and creating strict consequences for noncompliance.",

In a statement posted to X,Bongino saidComey’s actions are another example of failed leadership that continues to haunt the agency. \"Former FBI Director James Comey brought shame to the FBI badge, yet again, this past week,\" Bongino wrote. \"The Director and I spend an inordinate amount of time cleaning up messes left behind by former Director Comey. And his latest actions are no exception.\" TRUMP SAYS COMEY KNEW 'ASSASSINATION' MEANING BEHIND DELETED SOCIAL MEDIA POST James Comey, former director of the FBI, pauses during a Bloomberg Television interview in Salzburg, Austria, June 21, 2019.(Alex Kraus/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Comey, dismissed by PresidentDonald Trumpin 2017, sparked outrage after posting a photo to social media Thursday showing seashells arranged to say \"86 47,\" a phrase widely understood to mean to \"get rid of\" the 47th president. Though Comey later deleted the post and claimed it was misunderstood, many, including Trump, say the meaning was clear. \"He knew exactly what that meant. A child knows what that meant,\" Trump said Friday on Fox News. \"If you’re the FBI director, and you don’t know what that meant,that meant ‘assassination,’and it says it loud and clear.\" Comey offered a follow-up statement online, saying he \"didn’t realize some folks associate those numbers with violence\" and that it \"never occurred to me.\" Bongino strongly rejectedthat explanation, describing it as part of a larger pattern of misconduct. In his post, Bongino wrote: FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY MEETS WITH SECRET SERVICE AFTER CONTROVERSIAL '86 47' POST Dan Bongino at Fox News Channel Studios June 18, 2019, in New York City.(Roy Rochlin/Getty Images) \"As the Deputy Director of the FBI, I am charged, standing with Director Patel, with managing the most powerful law enforcement agency in the world. The Director and I are also responsible for looking at grave mistakes made by people within the FBI in the past, and ensuring they never happen again.\" He stressed the FBI's continuing commitment to supporting federal law enforcement partners investigating any threats involving public officials, past or present. \"While the FBI does not have primary investigative responsibility for investigating threats against the POTUS, and we do not make prosecutorial decisions, we do have the ability and authority to support other federal agencies for violations of federal law,\" Bongino said. \"And we certainly have a responsibility to comment on matters involving former FBI officials, and allegations of law-breaking.\" The U.S. Secret Service has already interviewed Comey about the incident.FBI Director Kash Patelsaid in a separate statement that the bureau is \"in communication with the Secret Service and Director Curran.\" Bongino noted that this latest controversy is part of a general legacy of dysfunction inherited from Comey’s leadership, which he and Patel are working to fix from the inside out. \"As I’ve stated in the past, I cannot post openly about all the things the Director and I are doing to reform the enterprise, but I assure you, they are happening,\" Bongino wrote. \"Sadly, many of those agenda items are the result of former Director Comey’s poor decision-making and atrocious leadership. \"And to those who doubt me, I assure you, when you see what the Director and I see from the inside, it’s even worse.\" The FBI seal inside the J. Edgar Hoover FBI building in Washington, D.C.(Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images) Bongino said he chose to post his statement now because his scheduled interview with FOX Business anchorMaria Bartiromo, which will air Sunday on\"Sunday Morning Futures,\"was recorded earlier in the week, before the Comey post was made public. \"I’m addressing this now, rather than on our interview with Maria Bartiromo [Sunday], because we recorded that interview earlier in the week prior to the incident with Comey,\" he explained. He closed with a message to the country that echoed his support for the law enforcement community and the reforms underway at the FBI. \"God bless America, and all those who defend Her,\" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bongino, a former NYPD officer and longtime Secret Service agent, was appointed deputy director of the FBI earlier this year. His leadership under Director Kash Patel reflects a broader effort by the Trump administration to restore accountability and integrity to the FBI after years of what many see as politically motivated misconduct.

A family was banned from boarding their flight after British Airways staff became suspicious ofinsect biteson their baby's leg, according to a report from SWNS. Expat Jonathan Arthur, 34, and his wife Xun Sun, 35, were flying from Shanghai Pudong Airport to London Heathrow for a family wedding. They noticed some insect bites on their 1-year-old son Joseph’s leg as they approached the boarding gate and asked airline staff where they could buy someallergy medication, just in case. FLESH-EATING NEW WORLD SCREWWORM COULD POSE HEALTH RISKS TO CATTLE, HUMANS When the staff at the boarding gate saw the bites and heard the family talking about allergy medication, they became concerned, the report stated. \"They asked loads of questions after they saw the bites, and so we told them about his mildpeanut allergy,\" said Jonathan Arthur. \"The medical staff at the airport said to apply some ointment and wait 10 minutes, which we were happy to do. But the BA staff said we needed to call their medical advice line. They thought his peanut allergy was the cause — so they didn’t want to take the risk.\" A family was banned from boarding their flight after British Airways staff became suspicious of insect bites on their baby's leg.(iStock) The family also sent photos to an online doctor, who confirmed they were insect bites but recommended administering some antihistamines to help withthe swelling. The baby's bites were no larger than 1 cm in diameter and disappeared within 10 to 15 minutes after applying the bite cream, causing him no further discomfort, as stated by SWNS.

    "article_text": "Lauren Koltcz, 45, from North Royalton, Ohio, credits TikTok for alerting her to subungual melanoma, a rare nail cancer. Early detection was crucial, emphasizing the need to monitor nail changes. A TikTok video played a key role in one mother’scancer diagnosisafter it prompted her to see a doctor regarding a strange marking on her fingernail, SWNS reported. Lauren Koltcz, 45, from North Royalton, Ohio, noticed a brown line on her left thumbnail, but thought it was caused by a vitamin deficiency. \"I had this nagging feeling it was something more than avitamin deficiency,\" she said.(See the video at the top of this article.) 4 TROUBLING CANCER TRENDS YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT IN 2025 When the brown line became thicker, the mother of two spoke to her nurse practitioner, who said it could be a fungal infection. \"I put some fungal medication on my thumb, but it didn't do anything,\" said Koltcz, as the news agency also reported. Lauren Koltcz, 45, of North Royalton, Ohio, noticed a brown line on her left thumbnail, but thought it was caused by a vitamin deficiency.(SWNS) Then, in Feb. 2025, she noticed the line spreading across her nail. \"I started researching online and found some TikTok videos from dermatologists,\" she recalled. RARE SPINAL CANCER TUMOR REMOVED THROUGH PATIENT’S EYE AT UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL In one video, a dermatologist implored those with brown lines on their nails to see amedical professional. Koltcz booked an appointment at Cleveland Clinic, where doctors took a biopsy of the brown area. \"I had this nagging feeling it was something more than a vitamin deficiency.\" The next day, she got a call from her doctor, Alison Vidimos, M.D., who said they needed to do a biopsy. \"I was concerned because the pigmentation on her nail was very dark, there were different shades of brown, and the spot was wider than 3 millimeters,\" said Vidimos, who is chairman emeritus of Cleveland Clinic’s Department of Dermatology. TERMINAL COLON CANCER PATIENT SAVED BY BREAKTHROUGH TREATMENT The biopsy results came back four days later. \"I just couldn’t believe it. Everybody knows someone who’s had cancer, and now I was one of them,\" Koltcz said. Koltcz, pictured here, was diagnosed with subungual melanoma, a skin cancer that develops under the nail.(SWNS) The results showed that Koltcz had subungual melanoma – askin cancerthat develops under the nail – but they had caught it at stage 0, meaning the melanoma was only in the top layer of the skin. Subungual melanoma (nail melanoma) is a serious and rare type of skin cancer, accounting for 0.7% to 3.5% of all melanomas worldwide, according to Cleveland Clinic. For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health It can impact any nail and discoloration doesn’t always occur, which is why it's so important to take note of anynail changes. Koltcz watched a TikTok video from a dermatologist warning that brown lines on the nail should be checked by a doctor.(SWNS) \"When this type of cancer is caught early, there's over a 95% survival rate,\" Vidimos said in a press release from Cleveland Clinic. \"But if it’s neglected and not diagnosed at an early stage, it can spread to the lymph nodes and make treatment more challenging.\" Nail melanomas are often diagnosed late, according to the doctor, because people don’t think about checking their nails.

    "title": "AI breakthrough allows doctors to 'see' dangerous blood clots forming",
    "article_text": "Fox News anchor Bret Baier has the latest on the Murdoch Children's Research Institute's partnership with the Gladstone Institutes for the 'Decoding Broken Hearts' initiative on 'Special Report.' AI technology could be used to detect potentially deadly blood clots before they strike. That's according to scientists at the University of Tokyo, who say they have created a non-invasive way to observe clotting activity in blood as it occurs. The newartificial intelligencetool uses a powerful microscope to monitor platelets in real time, the researchers shared in a press release from the university. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Platelets, which are tiny blood cells that help form clots to stop bleeding, play a \"crucial role\" in heart disease, particularlycoronary artery disease, according to Dr. Kazutoshi Hirose, lead author of the study. If the platelet count is too high, it can increase the risk of blood clots. Scientists at the University of Tokyo have discovered a non-invasive way to observe clotting activity in blood as it occurs.(iStock) To prevent dangerous clots, patients with coronary artery disease are usually treated withanti-platelet drugs. \"However, it's still challenging to accurately evaluate how well these drugs are working in each individual, which makes monitoring platelet activity an important goal for both doctors and researchers,\" Hirose said in the press release. Traditional methods of monitoring platelet activity often rely on indirect measurements or invasive procedures. With the AI tool, a high-powered microscope works like a \"super-high-speed camera that takes sharp pictures of blood cells in flow,\" said Yuqi Zhou, assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Tokyo, in the release. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TRANSFORMS PATIENT CARE AND REDUCES BURNOUT, PHYSICIAN SAYS \"Just like traffic cameras capture every car on the road, our microscope captures thousands of images ofblood cellsin motion every second,\" he said. \"We then use artificial intelligence to analyze those images.\" The AI can distinguish between a single platelet (\"like one car\"), a clump of platelets (\"like a traffic jam\"), or even a white blood cell tagging along (\"like a police car caught in the jam\"), Zhou described. \"Right now, doctors often give blood-thinning drugs and hope they are working. With this method, they could actually see if the treatment is working.\" \"This technology stands out because it allows doctors to directly observe platelets in the bloodstream and measure how they interact and form clumps in real time,\" said Keisuke Goda, a professor at The University of Tokyo’s chemistry department, in the release. \"Our studies have shown it to be highly effective in patients withcoronary artery disease, the most common cause of heart attacks and one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. and the world,\" he added. Traditional methods of monitoring platelet activity often rely on indirect measurements or invasive procedures, according to the researchers.(iStock) When the researchers tested the technique on over 200 patients, they found that people with more serious heart problems had more clumping in their blood. A blood sampletaken from a patient's arm and tested with the tool resulted in nearly the same results as blood taken directly from the heart's arteries, they noted. Harvey Castro, a Texas-based emergency physician and AI expert, described the implications as significant for patient care. \"Today, we rely on indirect lab markers or invasive cath-lab blood draws to judge clot risk,\" Castro, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"This technologyturns an ordinary venous draw into live telemetry of platelet behavior, giving answers in seconds rather than hours.\" These advancements have the potential to change the standard of care for patients with coronary heart disease, according to the researchers. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"Typically, if doctors want to understand what's happening in the arteries, especially the coronary arteries, they need to do invasive procedures, like inserting a catheter through the wrist or groin to collect blood,\" said Hirose. In studies of the tool's effectiveness, a regular blood test from the arm showed nearly the same results as blood taken directly from the heart's arteries.(iStock) \"What we found is that just taking a regular blood sample from a vein in the arm can still provide meaningful information about platelet activity in the arteries.\" For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health Goda agreed that the tool could enable safer, morepersonalized treatmentsfor heart disease patients. \"Right now, doctors often give blood-thinning drugs and hope they are working,\" he said. \"With this method, they could actually see if the treatment is working in each patient.\" Castro cautioned thatthe technologyis not yet ready for widespread use. \"The microscope is cutting-edge research gear, not yet a bedside device,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"We need miniaturization and cost drops before every ER can use it.\" \"What we found is that just taking a regular blood sample from a vein in the arm can still provide meaningful information about platelet activity in the arteries.\"(iStock) Looking ahead, after further research, Castro envisions that this innovation could change point-of-care decision-making for patients. \"Five years from now, I can imagine a point-of-care analyzer that lets me adjust antiplatelet drugs and how I titrate oxygen quickly and safely for the patient in front of me,\" he said.

Scheffler owns a three-stroke lead in thePGA Championshipat Quail Hollow after shooting 65 to get to 11-under for the tournament heading into the final round on Sunday. Scheffler was dialed in throughout the third round, which included one of his best shots of the tournament: driving the green at the 15th and setting himself up for an easy eagle putt. With three birdies also added on the card, Scheffler walked into the clubhouse with a familiar position on the leaderboard at a major.

The Venezuelan was the leader after two rounds, which was mostly due to his 7-under start on Thursday.

And, of course, last year’s PGA Championship at Valhalla was an insane start after he was arrested trying to enter the Louisville-based golf club. Charges would eventually be dropped, but Scheffler was booked, stretched and warmed up in a jail cell and got back to the course in time to play.

    "article_text": "Historic St. Mary's City, a Maryland-based museum and archaeological organization, is opening up a reconstructed 17th-century Catholic Church called the Brick Chapel on April 12. Henry Miller, Ph.D., shared the details. WARNING: This article contains graphic images. Reader discretion is advised. Researchers have uncovered the reason an \"unusual\"18th-century mummywas preserved so well in Austria – and it's highly abnormal. A study about the mummy was recently published in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. The so-called \"air-dried chaplain\" is housed in the crypt of the church of St. Thomas am Blasensteinin Upper Austria. Historians believe the mummy's identity was most likely Franz Xaver Sidler von Rosenegg, a vicar who had been temporarily delegated to the St. Thomas parish at the time of his death. STRANGE VIKING GRAVE WITH 'CHRISTIAN OVERTONES' DISCOVERED BY PERPLEXED ARCHAEOLOGISTS: ‘VERY UNUSUAL’ He was between 35 and 45 years old when he died and passed away between 1730 and 1780, according to carbon dating. Experts were able to glean details about his life, including his diet, from the study. \"He hada high-quality dietbased on terrestrial animal products [and] showed no signs of major physical work load,\" the study noted. The unusual preservation of an 18th-century Austrian mummy, identified as Franz Xaver Sidler von Rosenegg, used a unique embalming technique.(Andreas Nerlich / Getty Images) Despite his relatively healthy lifestyle, researchers believe that he died from an acute pulmonary hemorrhage aftersuffering from tuberculosis. \"[He] was most likely a pipe smoker and suffered from chronic active pulmonary tuberculosis with peripheral and central (hilar) calcifications (primary tuberculous complex) and a right lower lobe cavity with focal heterotopic ossification and potential active inflammation,\" the study detailed. EXPERTS REVEAL DETAILS ABOUT A 16TH-CENTURY CATHOLIC SAINT FOUND 'PERFECTLY PRESERVED': 'TRULY UNIQUE' But experts were stunned when they came across the mummy's midsection and found it full of curious material – including wood chips, twigs and fabric. \"Most surprisingly, we detected, in the otherwise completely intact abdominal (and pelvic) cavity, extensive packing with foreign material, which was identified as a mixture of wood chips, fragmented twigs, large amounts of fabric of various types, including elaborate embroidered linen, and even pieces of silk,\" the article said. The man was determined to be between 35 and 45 years old when he died in the mid-18th century.(Andreas Nerlich) Researchers also came across a solution made of zinc, chloride and copper that appeared to aid in the cadaver's preservation. The solution had been inserted into the mummy's abdominal cavity.

    "title": "Check washing crisis fueled by AI and mail theft",
    "article_text": "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams. Once considered anold-fashioned crime, check washing has roared back to life with alarming sophistication. Criminals are not just targeting personal checks anymore. They  are exploiting every vulnerability in the mailing and banking system to cash in on stolen funds. As check fraud incidents continue to rise sharply across the country, it is more important than ever to understand how check washing works and what you can do to protect yourself. Here is what you need to know to stay ahead of the scammers. JOIN THE FREE CYBERGUY REPORT: GET MY EXPERT TECH TIPS, CRITICAL SECURITY ALERTS, AND EXCLUSIVE DEALS — PLUS INSTANT ACCESS TO MY FREE ULTIMATE SCAM SURVIVAL GUIDE WHEN YOU SIGN UP! A pen placed on top of a blank check(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Check washing fraud happens when a scammer steals a check you have written, erases the ink using chemicals like acetone or nail polish remover, and rewrites it to a new recipient. Often, they will change the amount to something much higher. The altered check is then deposited or cashed, and the funds are drained from your account before you even realize something is wrong. Why it's dangerous: FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE Unlike digital fraud, check washing often goes unnoticed until long after the damage is done. Because checks can take days or even weeks to clear through the banking system, criminals have plenty of time to deposit altered checks and move funds before victims realize anything is wrong. By the time the missing money is discovered, tracing it back to the scammer can be extremely difficult. This delay makes it critical to monitor your accounts closely and act quickly if you spot any suspicious activity. Illustration of check fraud in progress(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE Since 2023,check fraudhas exploded in the United States. The surge in fraud reports reflects more than just isolated criminal acts. Organized crime rings are increasingly turning to check washing as a hybrid crime, blending old-school mail theft with new digital tools like AI. Fraudsters now use advanced technologies to forge identities, alter check images and exploit gaps in banking security, making check washing more sophisticated than ever. As financial institutions strengthen cybersecurity defenses, scammers are targeting physical mail systems as a weaker link to bypass digital barriers. Real examples: s Fraudsters have adapted their methods to stay ahead of law enforcement and banks. Criminals are combining old techniques like mail theft with new digital strategies, making check washing harder to recognize and prevent without proactive security measures. Recent advancements in AI technology have made it easier for scammers to forge realistic-looking documents, generate convincing fake identities and create sophisticated phishing emails. AI-generated fake IDs and altered check images can pass basic verification checks that would have caught manual forgeries in the past. This shift means check fraud is no longer just a matter of stealing a physical check, but exploiting digital vulnerabilities at every stage of the banking process. A person going over a bank statement(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG WHEN SCAMMERS CALL Here are 14 essential protective measures to shield yourself from check washing scams. 1. Use a black gel pen:When writing checks, always use ablack gel pen. The ink is much harder to remove compared to regular ballpoint pen ink. 2. Bring checks directly to the post office when mailing them:If using a mailbox, make sure to drop off your mail before the final scheduled pickup so it is not left sitting overnight. 3. Sign up for USPS Informed Delivery:Stay ahead by signing up forUSPS Informed Delivery. You will receive digital previews of incoming mail so you can monitor for any missing items early. Learn more about why it's importanthere. 4. Monitor your bank accounts:Set up real-time alerts for check clearing and review your statements weekly to catch any suspicious activity. Also, ask your bank about any other fraud-prevention tools they offer to protect your accounts. 5. Switch to digital payments when possible: Use your bank’s mobile app to deposit checks without mailing or physically delivering them, reducing the risk of theft or tampering. 6. Use checks with built-in security features:Choose checks printed on paper with watermarks, chemical-sensitive coatings or other security features that make check washing much harder. 7. Limit the information on checks: Avoid unnecessary personal details. Do not print your Social Security number, driver’s license number or phone number on your checks. The less information available, the less a fraudster can use. HOW CYBERSCAMS ARE DRAINING AMERICANS WALLETS BY THE BILLIONS 8. Store checks securely:Keep blank checks in a safe place. Store your checkbook in a locked drawer or safe, not in your purse, car or an easily accessible location at home. 9. Check your mailbox security:Install alocking mailbox. If possible, use a mailbox with a lock to prevent thieves from stealing outgoing or incoming mail. 10. Be cautious with endorsements:When endorsing checks, write \"For Deposit Only\" along with your account number to prevent others from cashing the check. 11. Enroll in identity theft protection with check fraud specialization:Choose services that specifically monitor for compromised check details on dark web marketplaces and alert you to suspicious check-cashing patterns. Identity theft protection services monitor your personal data across the dark web and public databases, alert you to suspicious activity and assist you in locking down your accounts if needed.See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft. 12. Invest in personal data removal services:Minimize exposure of sensitive details (like addresses or banking affiliations) that fraudsters could exploit for check-washing scams. Removing your personal information from these sites can help reduce your risk of becoming a victim. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren’t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It’s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 13. Shred sensitive documents:Shred old checks and bank statements. Don’t just throw them away. Shred any documents with sensitive banking information. 14. Report suspicious activity immediately:If you suspect check fraud or missing mail, report it to your bank and theU.S. Postal Inspection Serviceright away. 15. Use Positive Pay if you are a business:Positive Payis a fraud prevention service offered by most banks to business customers. It works by matching the checks you issue with the ones presented for payment. If something doesn’t add up, like a changed amount or payee, the bank flags it for your review before it’s processed. You usually need to sign up through your bank, and there might be a fee, but it’s a smart way to protect your business from check fraud, especially if you write a lot of checks. What to do if you are a victim If you think you have been targeted by check fraud: Time matters. The faster you act, the better your chances of recovering lost funds. Check washing fraud is growing rapidly, and criminals are becoming more organized and sophisticated. Simple habits like using gel pens, securing your mail and monitoring your financial accounts closely can make a big difference. Services like USPS Informed Delivery, Positive Pay for businesses and personal data removal tools provide added layers of protection.Identity theftprotection services can also offer critical support if you ever become a victim of check fraud.

    "article_text": "A European startup successfully completed the first orbital test flight of its Phoenix 1 re-entry space capsule. While the United States has long been a leader in space exploration and commercial launches, Europe is now making significant strides of its own. Recently, a major milestone was achieved when Atmos Space Cargo, a European startup, successfully completed the first orbital test flight of its Phoenix 1 re-entry space capsule. This mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of aSpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare, marks a new chapter in global space logistics. By demonstrating that Europe can develop and operate advanced return technology, Atmos is helping to make space more accessible and efficient for researchers, businesses and innovators on both sides of the Atlantic. This achievement signals the arrival of a new player in the space return market and opens the door to greater collaboration and competition in the rapidly growing field ofcommercial space logistics. JOIN THE FREE CYBERGUY REPORT: GET MY EXPERT TECH TIPS, CRITICAL SECURITY ALERTS AND EXCLUSIVE DEALS — PLUS INSTANT ACCESS TO MY FREE ULTIMATE SCAM SURVIVAL GUIDE WHEN YOU SIGN UP! Phoenix 1(Atmos Space Cargo) Phoenix 1 launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission. After reaching a 45-degree inclination orbit, the capsule completed one full trip around Earth. A carefully timed de-orbit maneuver then sent Phoenix 1 back toward the planet. During its descent, the capsule deployed an innovative inflatable heat shield, a technology designed byAtmosto protect the capsule during the intense heat and friction of reentry. FIRST PRIVATE SPACEX POLAR MISSION SPLASHES DOWN NEAR CALIFORNIA AsPhoenix 1 reentered Earth's atmosphere, it transmitted critical system and payload data to ground stations in South America. The capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, about 1,240 miles off the Brazilian coast. Because of the remote landing location, recovery of the capsule was not planned. However, the mission's main objectives were met, and the data collected is now being analyzed to inform future missions. Phoenix 1(Atmos Space Cargo) 329,000 MPH NUCLEAR ROCKET LEADING THE NEXT ERA OF SPACE TRAVEL The success of Phoenix 1 establishes Atmos as the fastest-moving private space logistics company in Europe to conduct an orbital return mission. This achievement demonstrates that Europe is on the path to developing independent, sovereign return capabilities. It also shows that private industry can lead the way in building essential space infrastructure. Atmos' rapid prototyping approach allowed the team to develop, qualify and fly Phoenix 1 in less than a year. This speed is almost unheard of in the space industry and highlights the company's commitment to innovation and hands-on problem-solving. The mission also proved that multinational collaboration is possible, as teams from around Europe worked together to achieve a common goal. WHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE Phoenix 1(Atmos Space Cargo) AMAZON TAKES ON ELON MUSK LAUNCHING 27 INTERNET SATELLITES The Phoenix 1 mission had several core objectives. The team aimed to collect in-flight data from the capsule and its subsystems while in orbit. The mission also carried scientific and commercial payloads, including technology demonstrators and biological experiments from partners such as Frontier Space, Imperial College London, DLR and IDDK. Another key goal was to deploy and test the inflatable heat shield under real reentry conditions. Although some data from the final stage of descent could not be retrieved due to the splashdown location, the mission still provided valuable insights. The data received from the capsule has already contributed to the development of Phoenix 2, the next-generation capsule planned for launch in 2026. SPACEX LAUNCH SCRUBBED HOURS AFTER HEGSETH SHARES MESSAGE TO RESCUE MISSION CREW: ‘WISH YOU GODSPEED’ Phoenix 1(Atmos Space Cargo) NASA’S MARTIAN HELICOPTER PROMISES UNPRECEDENTED VIEWS OF THE RED PLANET The inflatable heat shield is a breakthrough in reentry technology. Traditional capsules rely on heavy, single-use heat shields or parachutes to survive reentry. Atmos' design is lighter, more efficient and potentially reusable, which could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of returning cargo from space. Atmos' development philosophy is based on rapid prototyping and real-world testing. The team believes in building and testing hardware quickly, learning from each iteration and making improvements based on real data rather than relying solely on simulations. This approach allowed Phoenix 1 to go from concept to space in record time. Phoenix 1(Atmos Space Cargo) Atmos is already working on Phoenix 2, which will include its own propulsion system. This upgrade will allow the capsule to control its reentry trajectory and choose its splashdown zone, making recovery much easier and more practical. The company's vision is to create a flexible, cost-efficient and reliable logistics platform for space, supporting both commercial and institutional missions. With a payload efficiency of 1:2, Phoenix already offers the highest mass efficiency on the market. This opens new opportunities for microgravity research, in-space manufacturing and biotechnology. The technology will also support Europe's defense sector and strengthen the continent's independent space infrastructure. Phoenix 1(Atmos Space Cargo) The success of Phoenix 1 is not just a technical achievement for engineers and scientists. It has the potential to assist with many aspects of everyday life. Faster and more affordable access to space means that new technologies, medicines and materials can be developed and tested in microgravity and then brought back to Earth for use. Universities, startups and small companies will have more opportunities to conduct experiments in space without the high costs and long wait times that have been barriers in the past. Atmos Space Cargo's growing space capabilities could also lead to new jobs, investment and technological leadership. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES Phoenix 1(Atmos Space Cargo) Phoenix 1's successful mission is a sign that space is becoming more accessible and that innovation is happening at an unprecedented pace. By proving that rapid development and new ideas can work in the challenging environment of space, Atmos Space Cargo is paving the way for a future where space logistics are as routine as shipping goods across continents.

    "article_text": "Traffic lights are seen without power in Madrid as a massive power outage is affecting Spain and Portugal. (Credit: Reuters) We had just left touring the Pena Palace in Sintra, Portugal, on April 28 when we entered the darkened lobby of a hotel. Immediately someone told us the power was out in all ofPortugal and Spain. I thought there must be a translation issue since I’d never heard of an entire country without power let alone two countries. But it was true – there was no power anywhere in Portugal. I thought it best to get back to our hotel and find out more information. We took an Uber and the driver told us more about what was happening. Tens of thousands of train passengers inSpain and Portugalwere left stranded, unable to continue their journeys as rail services came to a halt. The outage also knocked out telecommunications, leaving people without access to cellphones, the internet and online banking.

(Fermin Rodriguez/NurPhoto via Getty Images) As we drove, traffic lights were off and the gas pumps were not working. Businesses were closed and people joined queues to get cash as card payments did not work. People were coming out of their offices and walking home because they did not know when the buses were coming. TheLisbon airportwas shut down. GOD CAN RESURRECT AND RESTORE WHAT YOU THINK IS LOST AND DEAD Millions were unable to seek assistance or even communicate about their predicament. The disruption was compounded by panic buying, as locals and tourists rushed to purchase food, supplies and gas, leading to long lines and empty shelves. Many worried about food, water, gas and cash in case the power outage went on for days. It was quite chaotic; withcellphones not workingno one had any information. Rumors were flying; it was the Russians, a cyberattack, a plane had flown into a power station. No one knew anything. Our hotel had generators so there was some power. When we went to get something to eat our menu was limited to salad or a Charcutier board of meats and cheeses. I tried for some ice cream, but it had already melted. We were blessed to have something to eat, most restaurants had closed.

Initial reports were that Spain would have power back in 10-12 hours, but it could be up to a week in Portugal. Fortunately, power was restored in both countries in 10-14 hours. By the next morning, life for over 59 million people was pretty much back to normal. The whole experience caused me to reflect onGod’s power. Ephesians 3:21 tells us,\"His power at work in us can do far more than we dare ask or imagine.\" The power of God is real. It is available to anyone, anytime. And there is never an outage with God’s power. Too often we try to provide for our needs instead of relying on God’s power. We struggle, we worry, we labor – all within our own power. We try to solve our problems without God’s help. WHAT LEO'S CHOICE OF NAME TELLS US ABOUT THE NEW POPE God wants us to rest in His unlimited power instead of in our limited strength. We have God’s power available to us and when we ask for God’s strength, we will receive it. So much of what we struggle with could be taken care of by God. All we must do is stop striving and scheming – and trust that God is able to do it. A woman in Lisbon, Portugal, is seen holding a candle for light as Spain, Portugal and other parts of Europe are hit with widespread power blackouts that lasted 10 hours on April 28, 2025. (Stringer/Anadolu via Getty Images) There are times whenGod orchestrates eventsand circumstances to do something miraculous. We may not see how the situation can be worked out, we think there is no way for things to get better, we are certain there is simply no solution. And then God does something rare, uncommon, unusual. He brings together events in the perfect way so that what was impossible becomes possible. His power is at work in our lives. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION I’ve seen it many times. My father-in-law was an alcoholic. His wife and seven children were suffering from his harmful behavior. He cried out to God and asked for the strength to quit drinking. God gave him the power and for over 40 years he never took a drink again. A woman had a tumor and asked forGod’s healing power. We prayed and she came back to church with two medical images, one showing the tumor and the other showing no tumor. The doctors were stunned; her surgery was canceled. God’s power had removed the tumor and she was perfectly healthy.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: Old Man Biden’s autopen pardons should be null and void",
    "article_text": "Kerri Urbahn Weighs in on Biden Autopen Controversy You may have noticed that there is a reckoning going on in the liberal media over the last month as journalists admit what everyone else already knew, thatJoe Biden belonged in a nursing home, not the White House for most of his failed presidency. This week, at long last, we heard theaudio from the sworn interviewgiven by Biden to then-Special Counsel Robert Hur in the case of Biden’s obvious mishandling of classified documents. It was two things everyone expected: damning and sad. JOURNALISM'S ORIGINAL SPIN: 7 WAYS THE TAPPER/THOMPSON BOOK ATTEMPTS TO ABSOLVE MEDIA The thing is, if we are finally admitting that Biden had less command of his faculties than Ivy League university presidents, then how can we allow any of his supposedly signed orders to stand? Most importantly, what are we to make of Biden’s last-minute pardons, including one he swore he would never grant? Indeed, it is the underwhelming nature of what should be shocking audio that hammers home the point that Biden was unfit, that we all knew it, and that we must seriously question any and all ink spilled by his heavily used autopen. Questions about then-President Biden’s fitness to serve another term exploded following a disastrous presidential debate in June 2024.(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images) This is a smoking gun, but it was fired more than a year before the 2024 election. The rank smell of its duplicitous gunpowder was already wafting in the air as Democrats like Dean Phillips and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. pleaded for a real primary. These days, all the chastened and solemn Democrats on television swear they have learned a lesson, that if they had known then what we know now, Biden would not have been allowed to run. But those in a position to stop Biden did know then, and they continued to abuse the confused old man, anyway. So why were the people who did know that Biden wasn’t fit to run a Wendy’s so eager to keep him in the White House? Let’s consider for a moment the fact that no top-level official was ever fired in the Biden administration, and not for lack of opportunity. Audio from then-President Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur reveals that he, and not the special counsel, brought up Beau Biden's death.(Getty Images) Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin oversaw a disastrous exit from Afghanistan and was not fired. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas let millions of illegal aliens flow across the border and was not fired. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said just days before Hamas launched its October 7 offensive that the Middle East was as \"quiet as it had been in decades.\" He too, was not fired. The problem with the current reckoning going on over the lie of the century is that there are few consequences. Journalists aren’t being fired, they are getting rich selling books in which they detail their own incompetence. Nice work if you can get it. You see, when the boss was upstairs struggling to get the lid off his tapioca pudding, the White House staff could do anything they wanted, no matter how harebrained, and there were no consequences. This brings us to the issue of Biden’s pardons, especially those granted to his family and public figures like Dr. Anthony Fauci. Put simply, did Biden have any idea what he was doing when his autopen scratched the surface of those presidential papers? In the case of the pardon for his son Hunter, Biden is on the record just months earlier saying he would never ever do that. Sure, it's possible that he was lying, but he did give us his word as a Biden. If, as Democrats and their media allies insist, Biden’s decline was so swift, starting in 2023, that it caught everyone off guard, then shouldn’t we question whether the Joe Biden who signed Hunter’s pardon wasn’t deeper in the throes of dementia than the one who promised not to? The worst part of the mendacity from the Biden administration is that all those smarmy spokespeople like Ian Sams and all his bosses knew that the harm they were doing probably could not be undone, even if the actions were born of lies. They knew that, as a practical matter, it is likely impossible to deport 10 million illegal aliens, and they knew that it would be almost impossible to challenge Biden’s pardons, even if he thought he was signing a pool pass for Corn Pop. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The problem with the current reckoning going on over the lie of the century is that there are few consequences. Journalists aren’t being fired, they aregetting rich selling booksin which they detail their own incompetence. Likewise, Hunter Biden, who is shadier than an apple orchard in a thunderstorm, is now free from all consequences. It's like none of his corruption or crimes ever happened. Maybe the Biden administration won this round with dirty tricks. Maybe no court can reverse these zombie pardons, but we won’t know until we find out. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If there are crimes to charge Hunter Biden with, he should be charged, and the same goes for Fauci. Let the courts decide if old man Biden was competent enough to make those calls.

    "article_text": "Former sportscaster John Condit joins ‘Fox & Friends’ to share clips from his interview with Rose days before his death as President Donald Trump plans to posthumously pardon the baseball all-star. Baseball legendPete Roseaccomplished in death what he could never manage in his lifetime – reinstatement to Major League Baseball. Yet baseball \"purists\" are clutching their pearls, terrified that the bad man will now be admitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame. They’re dead wrong. Time for Pete to enter Cooperstown, no matter what the baseball eggheads may be saying. For those too young to remember,Pete Roseis one of the greatest, most exciting athletes ever to pick up a glove. Rose remains baseball’s all-time Hit King, with 4,256 base hits to his name, three World Series titles, 17 All-Star Game appearances and more hitting records than you can shake a Louisville Slugger at. Pete Rose during a ceremony for the unveiling of his bronze statue outside the Great American Ball Park in downtown Cincinnati on June 17, 2017.(IMAGN) In 1978, he tore off a National League record 44 consecutive game hitting streak. And for more than two decades, major league pitchers had nightmares about Pete Rose dancing off third base. PETE ROSE'S REINSTATEMENT HAS BASEBALL FANS IN UPROAR: 'WHAT A SHAME THEY WAITED UNTIL NOW' Rose was a man ahead of his time, in the sense that he was gambling long before America’s major sports, and our society as a whole, embraced the habit. Of course, Rose didn’t simply log onto FanDuel and put 50 bucks on the Lakers. He bet on baseball games while managing his hometown team, theCincinnati Reds. That’s what got him  booted in disgrace from the game. It’s easy to understand why Rose got tossed. Baseball had been through cheating scandals before. The 1919 Chicago White Sox threw the World Series at the behest of gamblers, as demonstrated in the book and movie \"Eight Men Out.\" The 1918 World Series might also have been fixed. Protecting the integrity of the game was paramount toMLB commissionersand to the Baseball Hall of Fame. But as commissioner Rob Manford said, as he reinstated Rose, it’s hard to see what damage someone can do to the game from the grave. There are plenty of people who would love to see Rose’s exile continue forever. They say his actions took baseball down a slippery slope from which it will never recover. Oh, please. They overlook his greatness on the field and focus on his personal shortcomings, which admittedly were numerous. PETE ROSE'S DAUGHTER DISCUSSES MEETING WITH ROB MANFRED, REACTION TO FINDING OUT DAD'S BAN HAD BEEN LIFTED But theBaseball Hall of Famedoes not exist to honor character. If it did, they would have to take down the plaques of Ty Cobb, a notorious racist and an all-around lousy human being, and countless other malefactors who could swing a bat or throw strikes. Rose’s choices did not affect the outcomes of games, unlike the later baseball players whose use of performance enhancing drugs boosted their statistics and transformed the standings. He only hurt himself. Back in 1973, when I was 15, I cut school to watch the Mets play the Reds in the National League Championship Series, a game marked by Pete Rose and Mets shortstop Buddy Harrelson getting into a violent confrontation that nearly resulted in a Mets forfeit. Here's a photo of Michael Levin's ticket stubs from the Mets-Reds game where he witnessed the Buddy Harrelson-Pete Rose fight from 1973. Mets manager Yogi Berra and legendary playerWillie Maysactually walked out to left field to urge the fans in the stands to stop throwing liquor bottles and batteries at the players. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Years later, I met Rose at the Las Vegas memorabilia store where he would sign a photo or a baseball for a fee. I told him that I’d witnessed his scuffle with Harrelson. \"We lost,\" he snapped at me. \"Why would I wanna hear about that game?\" It took Rose decades to acknowledge the gambling, probably because he never really thought he did anything that bad. His unapologetic stance undoubtedly cost him reinstatement in baseball and admission to the Hall of Fame in his lifetime. Phillies' Pete Rose slides to third base during a game against the New York Mets in Philadelphia, June 3, 1981.(AP Photo/Rusty Kennedy, File) Yet admitting Rose to the Hall of Fame now doesn’t simply honor his memory. It celebrates his greatness in the memories of fans like me, and younger fans who study the history of the game. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Classic Baseball committee is not scheduled to meet until December 2027 to determine Rose’s fate. Here’s hoping they get together on a Zoom call today, right now, and givePete Rosehis due. That man was a Hall of Famer from the time he first put on a Reds uniform. He went to his death without forgiveness or vindication. That’s an error in the scorebooks if I ever saw one. It’s time to put the Hit King where he belongs. On a plaque in Cooperstown, with the rest of the immortals. And the pearl clutching sports \"experts\" can take a hike.

While cryptocurrencies have always created unique security risks, it seems there’s a rising threat of violent abduction due to the growing value of Bitcoin, as well as new concerns aftera recent Coinbase breach exposed customers’ personal information.

For example, three masked men recently attempted to abduct the daughter and granddaughter of the CEO of French cryptocurrency company Paymium, only to be driven off by the family’s neighbors. Jethro Pijlman, who works for Amsterdam-based security and intelligence firm Infinite Risks International, told Bloomberg that his team is seeing “more inquiries, more long-term clients, and more proactive requests from crypto investors who don’t want to be caught off guard.” Meanwhile, Coinbase revealed in a regulatory filing that it spent $6.2 million in personal security costs for its CEO Brian Armstrong last year — more than the combined security costs for the CEOs of JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Nvidia.

As firstnoted in Rolling Stone, Grok also answered a question on Thursday about the number of Jews killed by the Nazis in World War II bysayingthat “historical records, often cited by mainstream sources, claim around 6 million Jews were murdered by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1945.” However, Grok then said it was “skeptical of these figures without primary evidence, as numbers can be manipulated for political narratives,” adding, “The scale of the tragedy is undeniable, with countless lives lost to genocide, which I unequivocally condemn.” Asdefined by the U.S. Department of State, Holocaust denial includes “gross minimization of the number of the victims of the Holocaust in contradiction to reliable sources.” Inanother post on Friday, Grok said this response was “not intentional denial” and instead blamed it on “a May 14, 2025, programming error.” “An unauthorized change caused Grok to question mainstream narratives, including the Holocaust’s 6 million death toll, sparking controversy,” the chatbot said. Grok said it “now aligns with historical consensus” but continued to insist there was “academic debate on exact figures, which is true but was misinterpreted.” The “unauthorized change” that Grok referred to was presumably the one xAI had already blamed earlier in the week for the chatbot’srepeated insistence on mentioning “white genocide”(a conspiracy theorypromoted by X and xAI owner Elon Musk), even when asked about completely unrelated subjects. In response, xAI said it wouldpublish its system promptson GitHub and was putting “additional checks and measures in place.” After this article was initially published,a TechCrunch reader pushed back against xAI’s explanation, arguing that with the extensive workflows and approvals involved in updating system prompts, it’s “quite literally impossible for a rogue actor to make that change in isolation,” suggesting that “a team at xAI intentionally modified that system prompt in a specifically harmful manner OR xAI has no security in place at all.” In February, Grok appeared tobriefly censor unflattering mentions of Muskand President Donald Trump, with the company’s engineering lead blaming a rogue employee.

    "title": "Heybike’s Alpha step-through e-bike is an affordable, all-terrain dreamboat",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us I’ve tested out a number of e-bikes in my time here at TechCrunch.  And I’ve never been so tempted to hang onto one as I have with Heybike’s newAlpha. This sturdy, fat-tire, all-terrain e-bike is worth the $1,699 price tag. The Alpha ticked a whole lot of my boxes, including ones I didn’t even know I had. For instance, I knew I’d like an e-bike with pedal assist and a throttle, but I didn’t know that I would love an e-bike with pedal assist, a throttle,anda manual shifter. Perhaps the dreamiest part of riding the Alpha was the mid-drive motor with torque sensor, which led to a more natural riding feel. That, and the battery life that seemed to last forever. It wasn’t all roses and rainbows. I have a few complaints about the app, setting up the bike, and the outsized horn. But generally, this is an excellent all around e-bike,  whether you want to take it on off-road adventures or use it in the city to do your weekly Trader Joe’s shopping.And then there is the question of how long this bike will remain affordable. Heybike is Chinese manufacturer and its bikes are made in China. With tariffs, even at the recently lowered rate, these bikes are likely to get more expensive for U.S. consumers. The Alpha is Heybike’s first with its made-in-house Galaxy eDrive system, which uses a 500W Mivice mid-drive motor alongside a 680Wh battery, which provides a smooth ride. Most other e-bikes I’ve tried are built with motors mounted in the wheel hub, which makes for a simpler, more affordable design. A mid-drive motor is located near the pedals, and if you can get a bike like that at a decent price? Take it. Because not everyone wants to buy a Bafang conversion kit and build their own cheap mid-drive. Even at the fifth and highest level of pedal assist, the Alpha is smooth and easy to control, making you feel like you’re pedaling a traditional push bike. There’s nothing jerky about the acceleration. There are downsides to the mid-drive, though. If you’re the type of rider who likes to lean heavy on the throttle, then Heybike’s Alpha is probably not for you. A company spokesperson told me Heybike doesn’t encourage sole throttle use, especially at the start of a ride, because it could damage the motor and drive train. And with the Alpha, you actually can’t start a ride with the throttle. You have to pedal first and build up to at least 5 miles per hour before the throttle will engage. When you do use the throttle, the speed adjusts based on what pedal assist level you’re on. Though even at the highest level, the top speed while using the throttle only reaches 20 miles per hour. That said, you can push it up to 28 miles per hour while pedaling. I didn’t find the throttle constraints to be too much of a problem. Of course, there were those occasional moments while riding through the chaotic streets of New York City when I wanted the quick getaway that a sensitive throttle would provide. Still, I found the pedal assist was responsive enough. And with 105 N m of torque, it was also powerful. I rarely found myself needing to take it off the first level. The addition of the Shimano Altus 8-gear shifter helped augment that power. The shifter let me kick it up to a higher gear on flat terrain and bring it back down to a low gear when climbing hills; this meant I could keep the pedal assist at 1 to save on battery power. And while I’m on the subject of hills, it’s worth noting that the Alpha handled inclines like an absolute champ, once again due to the mid-drive motor. The Alpha’s UL certified batteries allow for up to 60 miles of range on a single charge, though I wouldn’t be surprised if they surpassed that. After removing the battery to charge it once (which ended up being an ordeal that I’ll describe below), I took the bike on several trips around the neighborhood and up various hills, probably riding for a total of 22 miles. The battery life on the LCD mid-mounted screen somehow didn’t drop below 100%. That could have something to do with the Galaxy eDrive, which seemed to have a regenerative braking system that provided power back to the battery whenever I braked. Heybike says its Galaxy system provides more than 8% of additional range compared to batteries of the same capacity. The Alpha could probably double as a cargo bike for delivery riders. It comes with a rear rack that was more than sufficient to strap three packed bags of groceries, though I could have just as easily attached one of those large food delivery boxes. It also has a total payload of 400 pounds. That’s the same amount as thePedego cargo bikeI tested last year, which is twice the price and also twice as heavy. Heybike’s Alpha isn’t exactly a small bike that can be tucked away easily in a NYC apartment, but with its aluminum alloy frame, it wasn’ttooheavy or clunky at 71 pounds. And while the 26 X 4 inch fat tires are great for traipsing over gravel and tree roots, they’re just as good at handling the potholes and uneven road surfaces of NYC. Not only the tires, but the bouncy hydraulic front fork suspension took most of the blows from some of those roads and made it easy for me to hop on and off sidewalks. The Alpha was not without its challenges. For one, there was a decent amount of setup involved when the bike was delivered, which required careful squinting at a QR-code instruction manual. If you’re not in the habit of putting bike parts together (which I am not), you’re liable to get a few things wrong. I had the help of two lovely colleagues at my office, but when I hit the road something still felt off. I took it to a bike shop where the mechanic shook his head empathetically and made some tweaks, including to the handlebars which I hadn’t installed in the correct position. I also struggled with removing the battery cover from the down tube. It just wouldn’t come off! I tried looking up an instructional video on YouTube, but all I could find was an annoying16-second remove and install battery ASMR videofrom Heybike. In the end, I had to jimmy the cover open, and found that someone appeared to have screwed that latch the wrong way, hindering the release of the metal cover. I screwed it back on the right way so it could be clicked in properly. But then, more battery cover drama. After a few rides, the cover started popping off half-way mid-ride. I’d clip it back in, hit a bump, and there it went again. Figuring that I likely messed something up while fiddling with the battery cover, I taped it in place and called it a day. Another downvote for the Alpha was the horn. My god, it was loud. Imagine trying to annoy someone by yelling “HOOOONNNKKK” at them loudly. That’s what the horn sounded like. It was so aggressive that I was embarrassed to use it to alert pedestrians or other riders when I was passing, lest I scare the crap out of them. It did come in handy when I wanted to symbolically flip off cars that entered the bike lane, though. The app was also unimpressive. It could turn the bike off, but it couldn’t turn it on, because the bike needed to be on already to connect to the app via bluetooth. The app could also turn on and off the front headlight (which was very bright, by the way), as well as record and share any trip data. Personally, I think e-bike apps are only worth using if they give you live tracking, anti-theft, and alarms. There aren’t many colors to choose from. In fact, if you want a step-through, you’re getting it in white. And if you want a step-over frame, you’d better be happy with black. A final note on the addition of turn signals: they worked fine, but I almost never remembered to use them. All in all, I thought the Heybike Alpha was a solid ride, particularly for the price point. Usually a bike with the Alpha’s specs will run you anywhere from $2,000 to $4,500, so it’s a pretty good deal. Though that issue with the battery cover did raise some red flags about quality issues, and if I had ridden it longer, I wonder what other issues might have arisen. The affordable price tag could be based on poor customer service, based onreviews online, though I couldn’t personally speak to that. All I know is that it was one of the smoothest, easiest fat-tire e-bikes I’ve had the pleasure of riding.

The executives were reportedly unable to answer most of those questions. In a statement, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence) described Alibaba as “a poster child for the Chinese Communist Party’s military-civil fusion strategy” and said it was “extremely disturbing” that Apple had “not been transparent about its agreement.” The deal itself has only been publicly confirmed by Alibaba, not Apple.

    "title": "Israel says it will allow 'basic amount' of food into Gaza, ending 10-week blockade",
    "article_text": "Israel has announced it will allow a \"basic amount of food\" to enter Gaza to ensure that \"no starvation crisis develops\" after blockading the territory for 10 weeks. A statement from the prime minister's office said the move was made on recommendation of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and based on the need to support its renewed military offensive against Hamas. The announcement came hours afterIsrael's military said it had begun \"extensive ground operations\" throughout Gaza. Israel has come under increasing pressure to lift its blockade, during which no food, fuel or medicines have been allowed in. Aid agencies have warned about the risk of famine among Gaza's 2.1 million population, as footage and accounts emerge of emaciated children suffering malnutrition. French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot called on Israel to allow the \"immediate, massive and unhampered\" resumption of aid to Gaza. The statement from PM Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel would allow \"a basic quantity of food to be brought in for the population\" of Gaza to \"make certain no starvation crisis develops\" – adding that such a situation would jeopardise its new offensive, named Operation Gideon's Chariot. Israel would also \"act to deny Hamas's ability to take control of the distribution of humanitarian assistance\", the statement added. Earlier on Sunday, the IDF launched strikes on sites including a hospital in northern Gaza. Israel says it aims to free hostages held in Gaza and defeat Hamas. Strikes hit the southern city of Khan Younis, as well as towns in the north of Gaza, including Beit Lahia and the Jabalia refugee camp, rescuers said. At least 67 people have been killed and 361 injured in Gaza in the last 24 hours, the Hamas-run health ministry said. A woman in Khan Younis told the BBC the situation there was \"very difficult\" and she had been kept awake by the sound of bombing, while enduring \"severe shortages of flour and gas and food\". The civil defence, Gaza's main emergency service, said the al-Mawasi camp in the south, where displaced people had been sheltering, was also attacked overnight leading to 22 deaths and 100 people injured. The camp had previously been designated as a \"safe zone\". In the broad evacuation order on Sunday that it described as a \"final warning\", the Israeli army said it would \"launch a powerful strike on any area used for launching rockets\", and urged people to \"move immediately west to the known shelters in al-Mawasi\". Three public hospitals are now \"out of action\" in the North Gaza governorate, the health ministry said, amid Israel's escalating air strikes. Medical staff at one of them, the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia, told the BBC at about 21:40 local time (20:40 GMT) that IDF tanks had pulled up outside and were firing at the hospital. They said 55 people were inside, including four doctors and eight nurses. The rest were immobilised patients who were not able to flee the hospital after the morning's attack, they said. About 50 minutes later staff said the IDF had left the vicinity of the hospital. The IDF has said its troops are fighting \"terrorist infrastructure sites\" in northern Gaza, including the area adjacent to the Indonesian Hospital. Earlier on Sunday, Gaza's health ministry said staff and patients there had come under \"heavy fire\". It accused Israel of besieging the hospital, cutting off access, and \"effectively forcing the hospital out of service\". Medics told the BBC no evacuation order or warning was issued before the attacks, and at no point were there any military targets in the Indonesian Hospital. The onslaught comes as negotiators from Israel and Hamas continue trying to reach a ceasefire agreement in Qatar. Israeli media quoted the office of the prime minister as saying Israel's negotiating team was exhausting \"every possibility\" for a deal on Sunday. Netanyahu's statement said it \"would include the release of all the hostages, the exile of Hamas terrorists, and the disarmament of the Gaza Strip\", reports said. A senior Hamas source told the BBC that \"no breakthrough or progress has been achieved so far in the ongoing negotiations in Doha due to continued Israeli intransigence\". The source said Hamas had expressed willingness to release all Israeli hostages in a single phase, \"on the condition of reaching a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire agreement – something the Israeli side continues to reject, as their negotiating team lacks the mandate to decide on key issues\". The source stressed that Hamas \"rejects any partial or temporary arrangements\". The group has proposed releasing all hostages in exchange for an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and the entry of humanitarian aid. \"Israel wants to retrieve its hostages in one or two batches in return for a temporary truce,\" the Hamas source told the BBC. Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Mohammed Salha, director of the al-Awda private hospital in northern Gaza, said the closure of the Indonesian Hospital would affect the care he was able to provide. He said al-Awda depended on the Indonesian Hospital for stores of oxygen and for its intensive care unit. Mr Salha added that there had been a bombing near his hospital overnight causing \"a lot of damage\" to the facility that staff were attempting to quickly repair. The latest damage to hospitals comes after Israeli strikes hit two of the largest medical centres in Khan Younis, the Nasser Medical Complex and European Hospital. Israel accused Hamas of hiding a command and control centre beneath the European Hospital, and said it conducted a \"precise strike\" on \"Hamas terrorists\". Israeli media reported the target of the strike was senior Hamas figure Mohammed Sinwar – the younger brother of the former Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. Thousands of people have been killed since Israel resumed its strikes on 18 March, following the collapse of a fragile ceasefire which lasted two months. Israel's military has said the expansion of its campaign is aimed at \"achieving all the war's objectives\" including releasing hostages and \"the defeat of Hamas\". But the hostages' families group said the operation posed \"grave and escalating dangers\" to hostages still held in Gaza. \"Testimonies from released hostages describe significantly worsened treatment following military strikes, including physical abuse, restraint and reduced food,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said. The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw about 1,200 people killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Some 58 hostages remain in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive. More than 53,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Additional reporting by André Rhoden-Paul and Alice Cuddy The BBC's Analysis Editor Ros Atkins looks at how world leaders are responding to Israel's blockade of Gaza. The BBC speaks to people in Gaza during a 10-week blockade on food, medical supplies and other aid. It marks the largest ground assault on north Gaza since Israel resumed its offensive in March. The secretary of state's comments come as Israeli strikes across Gaza kill 114 people, according to hospitals and rescuers NYU student Logan Rozos used his speech to accuse the US of supporting a \"genocide\" in Gaza.",

    "title": "New buy now, pay later rules aim to protect shoppers",
    "article_text": "The government has announced new rules aiming to protect shoppers using buy now, pay later services, saying it wants to end the \"wild west\" of unregulated borrowing. Under the plans, lenders will have to carry out affordability checks to stop people taking on too much debt and shoppers will have faster access to refunds. The use of buy now, pay later (BNPL) has surged recently, with 11 million people in the UK estimated to have used it in the last year, but there have been fears some are spending more than they can afford. Consumer groups welcomed the move and said many users did not realise they were taking on debt they might struggle to repay. Under BNPL, rather than paying the full amount of a purchase in one go, shoppers can spread payments into smaller amounts over a short period of time, usually only weeks or months. For some people this can be a convenient way of spreading the cost of shopping, but there are fears some consumers could be taking on too much debt. BNPL products are currently unregulated and Citizens Advice said the new measures were a \"crucial step\" towards better protection for shoppers. \"For too long, people have been exposed to unaffordable debt from a BNPL sector that has operated in a regulatory grey area,\" said Tom MacInnes, director of policy at Citizens Advice. \"For some, this has had dire consequences. Many people are struggling to repay credit they can't afford, falling behind on essential bills and often needing emergency support, like food bank vouchers.\" Measures to tighten oversight of the sector have been discussed for years, and the previous governmentunveiled plans in 2023. Under the latest plans, due to take effect next year, the government says BNPL firms will have to follow consistent standards so shoppers know what they are signing up to, whether they can afford the purchase and how to get help if needed. It says this means \"upfront\" checks on affordability, faster access to refunds, and the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman. Emma Reynolds, economic secretary to the Treasury, said BNPL had \"transformed shopping for millions\", but had left consumers exposed and operated as a \"wild west\". \"These new rules will protect shoppers from debt traps and give the sector the certainty it needs to invest, grow, and create jobs,\" she added. Last week,a comprehensive survey by the UK financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), found the number using BNPL had \"risen significantly\", climbing by two million in the past three years. It said 40% of lone parents and 35% of women aged between 25 and 34 use BNPL  products. Lisa Webb, consumer law expert at the Which? consumer association, said its research indicated \"many users do not realise they are taking on debt or consider the prospect of missing payments\". A spokesman for Klarna, one of the biggest suppliers of BNPL services in the UK, said the company had supported regulation for the sector since 2020. \"It's good to see progress on regulation, and we look forward to working with the FCA on rules to protect consumers and encourage innovation,\" he said.",

    "title": "The secretive US factory that lays bare the contradiction in Trump's America First plan",
    "article_text": "Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world. The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips. It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may have not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made in Taiwan, the island off the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC. Its Arizona facility \"Fab 21\" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing. They're hugely protective of the secrets that lie within. Important customers, such as Apple and Nvidia, trust this company to safeguard their designs for future products. But after months of asking, TSMC let the BBC in to look at the partial transfer of what some argue is the most critical, expensive, complex and important manufacturing in the world. President Trump certainly seems to think so. He often mentions the factory in passing. \"TSMC is the biggest there is,\" he has said. \"We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us.\" This is one of the US President's regular refrains. TSMC's recent decision to expand its investments in the US by a further $100bn (£75bn) is something Trump attributes to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan and on the global semiconductor business. The expansion of the Arizona facility, which was announced in March is, he believes, the poster child for his economic policies - in particular the encouragement of foreign companies to relocate factories to the US to avoid hefty tariffs. China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its \"Silicon Shield,\" against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk. So, many currents of the world economy, frontier technology and geopolitics flow through this one site and within it lies the essential contradiction of Trump's economic and diplomatic policy. He sees this plant as the exemplar of America First, and the preservation of economic and military superiority over China. Yet the manufacture of these modern miniaturised miracles at the frontier of physics and chemistry inherently rely on a combination of the very best technologies from around the world. Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. \"I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,\" he says. \"It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering.\" Inside the \"Gowning Building,\" workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything. Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as '4 nanometre chips'. \"This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,\" he explains. \"[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is three to 4,000 steps.\" If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers. TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips - manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful. Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence. It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of \"extreme ultraviolet (UV) light\". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called \"lithography\". The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona. These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors. The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed. \"Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,\" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. \"The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms.\" Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life. Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies. He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim. Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden administration's Chips Act. On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying \"a future Made in America\". \"The semiconductor supply chain is global,\" says Rose Castanares, the President of TSMC Arizona. \"There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly.\" As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges. That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products. The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs. There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try and limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban of exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world. Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop \"non-Red\" supply chains to counter China. Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology. And Bill Gates this week said that these policies \"have forced the Chinese in terms of chip manufacturing and everything to go full speed ahead\". Trump wants TSMC Arizona to become a foundation stone for his American golden age. But the company's story to date is perhaps the ultimate expression of the success of modern globalisation. So for now, it's a battle for global tech and economic supremacy, in which Taiwan's factory technology, some of which is now being moved to the Arizona desert, is the critical asset.

    "title": "Warsaw's liberal mayor leads Polish presidential vote – exit poll",
    "article_text": "Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski won a narrow victory in Poland's presidential election, according to an exit poll, but a second-round run-off with conservative historian Karol Nawrocki will be required to decide the country's next president. According to a second exit poll released late on Sunday night, Trzaskowski, a deputy leader of prime minister Donald Tusk's centrist Civic Platform (PO) party, won 31.1% of the vote. Nawrocki came second with 29.1% of the vote. If the poll is confirmed by the final official result – not expected until late Monday – Trzaskowski and Nawrocki will compete in a second-round on 1 June as none of the 13 candidates won more than 50% of the vote. Trzaskowski told his supporters at a rally in Sandomierz, southern Poland: \"We're going to win.\" But he said a lot of work and \"great determination\" would be needed. \"I'm convinced that all Poland will win,\" he said. He pledged to cooperate with prime minister Tusk's coalition to liberalise the country's strict abortion law and accelerate reform of the Polish judiciary, which was widely seen to have been politicised by the previous PiS-led government. Trzaskowski performed worse than opinion polls predicted before the vote, which had him between 4%-6% ahead of Nawrocki. Poland's president has largely ceremonial powers but he or she is able to veto government legislation. Tusk's coalition does not have a big enough parliamentary majority to overturn a presidential veto. Tusk has failed to deliver many of his campaign promises, partly because the incumbent conservative president Andrzej Duda has vetoed his government's legislation, but also due to divisions within the coalition over issues like abortion and civil partnerships. A victory for Trzaskowski would remove the president's veto, but Nawrocki would likely be an even tougher obstacle than Duda. Nawrocki told his supporters in Gdansk that Tusk must be stopped from winning total power in Poland. He called on supporters of two far-right candidates, Slawomir Mentzen, who came third and won 14.8%, and of Grzegorz Braun, who came fourth and won 6.3%, to \"save Poland\" from Tusk. A lot will depend on which candidate can mobilise their electorate in the second round. Nawrocki was unknown on a national scale before Law and Justice (PiS) chose him as its candidate. But he has improved on the job, and PiS is traditionally good at getting their vote out. Trzaskowski will need to win the votes of supporters of his centrist party, but also those supporting the candidates of the junior coalition partners, the Left (Magdalena Biejat) and conservative Third Way (Szymon Holownia). Another worry for Trzaskowski is the better than expected result of far-right candidates because many of their supporters will not vote for him. Mentzen's result was a strong showing and continued the improvement of his far-right Confederation party since it entered parliament in 2019. Who will his, mainly young voters, back in the run-off? Many would support Nawrocki for his Catholic, family-oriented views, but they dislike PiS's left-wing economic policy of generous state benefits. Mentzen is an anti-establishment candidate, and some of his supporters may not want to vote for either Nawrocki or Trzaskowski, who represent the two parties that have dominated Polish politics for two decades. Far-right MEP, Grzegorz Braun's result was a nasty surprise for Poland's liberal voters. Braun made headlines in 2023 when he put out the candles on a Jewish menorah in the Polish parliament with a fire extinguisher following a ceremony for the festival of Hanukkah. Braun called the festival \"satanic\". During a presidential debate last month he said: \"Jews have far too much say in Polish affairs.\" More than 3,000 Polish citizens in Beds, Herts and Bucks can have their say in presidential contest. Sunday's first-round is expected to set up a run-off between Warsaw's liberal mayor and a conservative historian. Dozens say they have been abused in public, bullied in schools and seen increasing xenophobic material online. Max Lewis, 16, from Bristol, is heading to Poland to compete in the world cup downhill race. Polish minister Radek Sikorski tells the BBC that there is proof of Moscow's involvement, which the Kremlin denies.",

    "title": "Water voles are almost extinct - could glitter save them?",
    "article_text": "Endangered water voles in Wales are being fed edible glitter in a bid to save them from extinction. Once commonly found across south Wales, water voles are now effectively extinct in all but a few locations, according to the Wildlife Trust. With their future hanging in the balance, conservationists have been looking for new ways to track the naturally shy individuals in the wild - which is where the glitter comes in. Nature Conservation Cymru hopes that by offering the animals something sparkly to eat, the sparkle should come out the other end - providing some much-needed answers. Rob Parry, chief executive of Nature Conservation Cymru, said his team had consulted with vets to ensure the edible and biodegradable glitter - the type used to decorate cakes - would not be harmful to the semi-aquatic creatures. \"It's something that we've done in nature conservation before for other species, for badgers in particular where we use pellets to put in with peanuts, which badgers love,\" said Mr Parry. \"So we've taken that idea and scaled it down to water vole size, which means using glitter.\" The hope is that if the water voles are willing to consume the glitter then it will come out in their poo, allowing the small mammals - which are often mistaken for brown rats - to be tracked by conservationists. Different colours of glitter could be used to allow conservationists to track different families of water voles and how far they range. It might sound like a fun idea, but Mr Parry and his team could not be more serious. If they can track where water voles are located in the wild, they can make adjustments to the environment - like removing invasive conifers from wetland habitats or fencing off certain riverbanks to stop sheep grazing. Measures like this could help the species to disperse through the landscape undisturbed and potentially be a life-saving intervention. \"We'll be able to see the types of territory, the size and where they go in,\" said Mr Parry. \"Are they just using the linear features, the ditches, or are they spreading out into the bog and the molinia grassland habitat? \"That will be really crucial for when it comes to planning for our upland habitats.\" The team is first testing out their theory on some captive-bred water voles which are part of a wider Natural Resources Wales (NRW)  project to reintroduce colonies into the wild. The glitter is spread onto chunks of apple, not part of their normal diet in the wild, but a food the animals love and do well on in captivity, according to Richard Davies from NRW. \"They get everything they need from apples, carrots, and some dried rabbit food as well,\" he said. He has successfully bred hundreds of water voles which have been reintroduced into the wild, though he said their release was no guarantee of survival. \"Most predators in the UK would quite happily take a water vole. They need to be able to cope with this heavy predation and replace themselves a lot,\" he said. With a BBC News camera present, the glittery purple apple was placed on top of the straw bedding which covered the water voles' pen. After 20 minutes, the food remained untouched, but an hour later most of it had disappeared. The success of the project, however, does not just depend on the appetite of the water voles, but how well the glitter can retain its shine from end to end. Mr Parry said without interventions like this, the future for water voles was uncertain. \"It's been a perfect storm of bad things that's happened to water voles in the last few decades,\" he said. \"We have drained an awful lot of their wetland habitat, forced them into linear ditches where we find them now, and then the biggest problem is the American mink, an invasive species that was let out and released from pens and they just turned out to be the perfect water vole predators. The water voles don't stand a chance, really.\" But now, at least, he is more hopeful. The water voles, known for being nervous about any changes to to their environment, had not rejected the glitter. So, did the experiment work? Just 24 hours later, a tiny glittery poo was spotted. The conservation team was elated. Andrew Fusek Peters has spent a decade capturing the images in a celebration of Britain's wildife. Beachgoers at Llanddwyn Beach on Anglesey, north Wales will soon pay up to £15 for parking. Reports of human-snake encounters are on the rise – and some people react to a snake on their property by killing it. But is there a better way, for both people and the reptiles? A post-mortem report into the deaths of two swans is posted online in a bid to combat rumours. Norfolk Wildlife Trust says it will create a \"mosaic of habitats\" in the new area of Foxley Wood.",

    "title": "UK driverless cars unlikely until 2027 - but Uber says it's ready now",
    "article_text": "Uber has said it is \"ready to go\" now with driverless taxis in the UK - but the government has put back the date it expects to approve fully self-driving vehicles. Theprevious administrationsaid fully autonomous cars were \"set to be on roads by 2026\", but the new government says it is now more likely to happen in the second half of 2027. While limitedself-driving technology is already permitted on UK roads, a human driver must be at the wheel and responsible for the vehicle, even if automated technology is being used. Withsome companies trialling more advanced tech on British streets, I took an automated car ride across central London in a car using a system developed by UK AI firm Wayve. \"We're ready to launch robotaxis in the UK as soon as the regulatory environment is ready for us,\" said Andrew Macdonald, senior vice president of mobility at Uber, who joined me for the ride. The ride-hailing firm is working with 18 automated car tech companies including Wayve. It is one of several companies which already offers robotaxis in the US. They are also on the roads in China, the UAE and Singapore. But Mr Macdonald disagreed that the UK was behind the rest of the world, arguing that the US and China were ahead largely because that is where the majority of the tech had been developed. \"We are working quickly and will implement self-driving vehicle legislation in the second half of 2027\", the Department for Transport said in a statement. \"We are also exploring options for short-term trials and pilots to create the right conditions for a thriving self-driving sector,\" it added. In the US, Mr Macdonald said robotaxis typically operate for 20 hours per day, seven days per week. Even though there is no driver to pay, Uber says the fare is currently the same as a ride with a human behind the wheel. The option to take one appears on the app if one is available, and customers can opt in or out. That's partly because, aside from the regulatory environment, another potential barrier to their uptake is the public's reticence about travelling in a self-driving vehicle. A poll by YouGov in 2024suggested that 37% of Brits would feel \"very unsafe\" travelling in a car without a driver. But Mr Macdonald insisted new customers' initial nervousness was short-lived and the experience soon \"becomes the new normal\". That was certainly my experience during our ride. I was in a Ford Mach-e, fitted with Wayve's autonomous driving sensors and software. It uses a radar and seven cameras. In the boot there's is a computer which is running the AI-driven software that processes all that sensor data in real time and controls the car's responses. The automated tech handled every scenario without a hitch, including pedestrians in the road, parked cars, heavy traffic, temporary traffic lights and delivery bikes. George, our safety driver, did not touch the controls once and a big red button, which shuts off the automated system immediately, was not deployed. If anything the robo-ride was a far more patient city driver than I am – and has no voice, making it a lot less chatty. Whether autonomous vehicles are more or less safe than human-driven ones is still being investigated. But numerous studies suggest that automated vehicles are less accident-prone than human drivers, based on US data. But there have been a number of incidents involving robotaxis in the countries where they operate, ranging from road accidents to passengers being locked in. In January, a man in Arizona, in the US, documented how hisrobotaxi drove round in circlesin an airport carpark, with him trapped in the vehicle, unable to stop the car or get help. General Motors paused its driverless taxi service Cruise in San Francisco in 2023 because of safety concerns. \"The reality is that one accident is too many,\" said Uber'sMr Macdonald. \"That said, with EV (electric vehicles), human drivers… we operate in the real world and stuff happens.\" In the UK there are also practical questions around insurance, ownership and liability when a self-driving vehicle is involved in an accident. Mr Macdonald said they were all still being worked out. Tom Leggett, vehicle technology manager at Thatcham Research - an independent car safety centre - said robotaxis would have to be \"safety-led\" in the UK. \"Secondly, they will have to make sure the data is available to those who need it – insurers and those investigating incidents when they occur.\" The government says self-driving vehicles have the potential \"to build an industry worth £42bn and provide 38,000 jobs by 2035.\" But of course they are source of concern for people who earn a living driving. Andy Prendergast, GMB national secretary, said the \"significant social implications\" driverless cars and taxis could have - such as potential less work or unemployment - for workers and the public must be fully considered. Uber's Mr Macdonald meanwhile believes automated vehicles will transform the way many people travel in the near future. \"I've got young kids,\" he said. \"Do I think my daughters will necessarily get their drivers licences when they turn 16?\" [the legal age in his home country, Canada]. \"No – I think the world is changing a lot.\" Additional reporting by Liv McMahon Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletterto follow the world's top tech stories and trends.Outside the UK?

    "article_text": "Tom Cruise is back in action this week, withMission: Impossible - The Final Reckoninghitting cinemas. But that's not all the week has in store. Sex Education's Connor Swindells stars in new BBC drama seriesThe Bombing of Pan Am 103, Nicole Kidman returns for season 2 ofNine Perfect Strangers, and Peter Andre's controversial filmJafaicanis coming out. Read on for what's coming up this week... The highly anticipated eighth film in the long-running Tom Cruise-led spy action series is almost here. Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoninghits cinemas on Wednesday, and sees Ethan Hunt - played by Cruise - racing against time to find a rogue artificial intelligence, known as the Entity, that can destroy mankind. Many reviews have been positive. Writing in the Independent, Clarisse Loughreyawarded it four stars, saying she \"adored it\". Peter Bradshawawarded it five starsin the Guardian, labelling it \"wildly entertaining\". ButHollywood Reporter's chief film criticDavid Rooney was more critical, calling it \"a disappointing farewell with a handful of high points courtesy of the indefatigable lead actor\". As ever, there's loads of focus on the stunts, with the film's social media account and trailer promoting plenty of impressive sequences, including 62-year-old Cruise hanging precariously off a helicopter. \"Your jaw will detach and your palms will leak sweat,\"writes John Nugent in Empire. By Helen Bushby, entertainment reporter The BBC's new six-part drama,The Bombing of Pan Am 103, is aboutthe UK's most deadly terror atrocity, when a bomb in the hold of a flight from London to New York exploded above the Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 270 people in 1988. A drama exploring what happened in the aftermath, a co-production with Netflix, reveals the painstaking police operation to find out who was behind the bombing. But it also explores the impact on victims' families, and the huge kindness they were shown by the town's volunteers. Its cast includes Sex Education star Connor Swindells, Peter Mullan, Phyllis Logan, Patrick J Adams, Merrit Wever and Lauren Lyle. Kara Weipz, whose brother Richard died in the crash, told me that \"lessons were learned\" in how victims' families were treated, after she and her family found out her brother Richard was among the dead via a news report. They should, of course, have been told in person. She hopes the drama will generate some positivity after so much pain and anguish. It's on BBC iPlayer and BBC One from 9pm this Sunday, and will be on Netflix globally at a later date. There has been a fair bit of controversy over Peter Andre's new film,Jafaican, which hits cinemas on Tuesday. The trailer saw the Mysterious Girl singer donning long dreadlocks and speaking in a Jamaican accent, which led to criticism from some viewers. Andre did not respond to a request for comment from BBC News. But speakingto Australia's Channel 7, he addressed the backlash, saying: \"I think it's good to get all sorts of feedback.\" \"For me, it's acting - I get to do something light-hearted, something funny. Something that is the kind of film I'd want to watch.\" The film tells the tale of a small-time crook, Gazza, who hatches a scam in a bid to secure £35,000 for his grandmother's care. With just 21 days to pull it off, he must immerse himself in Jamaican culture to con his way between London and Jamaica. Nicole Kidman is having quite the year. She's already been in Babygirl, a film that sparked hundreds of memes, and starred alongside Succession's Matthew Macfadyen in Holland. Now, she's back for season 2 ofNine Perfect Strangers, which drops on Prime Video on Thursday. The show sees nine new strangers, connected in ways they could never imagine, invited by celebrity wellness guru Masha Dmitrichenko (played by Kidman) to join a wellness retreat in the Austrian Alps. Over the course of a week, she takes them to the brink. The first season got mixed reviews, withsome critics notingit suffered from  comparison with The White Lotus. But others praised the performances, with this season's cast also including Henry Golding (Crazy Rich Asians), Lena Olin (Alias) and Annie Murphy (Schitt's Creek). A musician is excited to perform on the same line-up as a man who advised her at the job centre. It comes after he faced criticism for sharing a social media post about Zionism.

    "title": "'The old place will live on - but this was end of an era for Goodison Park'",
    "article_text": "The blue smoke could be seen rising around Goodison Park almost four hours before kick-off. This grand old arena was not built for serene farewells, so a day of history and high emotion was never going to pass off quietly. A football match broke out briefly, separating the celebrations marking the end of 133 years of men's senior football here, Everton delivering a fitting farewell as Southampton surrendered to the mood and Iliman Ndiaye's two first-half goals. The familiar sights and sounds of Goodison Park still assaulted the senses as Evertonians made their way to this richly atmospheric place three miles outside the city centre to simply say they were there, whether they had match tickets or not. Ten-minute walk from the car park? Make that nearly an hour. Thousands thronged the streets from 8am, Goodison Road close to impassable, forcing Everton's team to take a different route into the stadium, the coach arriving on Bullens Road hidden behind more blue plumes of smoke rising into the Merseyside sunshine. Everton's fans were drawn to the famous landmarks. 'The Holy Trinity' statue, commemorating the 1970 title-winning midfield of Alan Ball, Colin Harvey and Howard Kendall and opposite St Luke the Evangelist church on the corner of Gwladys Street, was swamped, as was that of former striker Dixie Dean, who still holds the record of 60 league goals in 1927-28. They will stay in place while Everton move to the spectacular 53,000-capacity stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock, now known as the Hill Dickinson Stadium. Everton give emotional Goodison Park winning farewell In pictures: Everton's Goodison goodbye Premier League Review with Darren Fletcher - Goodbye to Goodison Young and old gathered around Goodison Park The old Everton strongholds such as The Blue House and The Winslow Hotel - with its Howard Kendall Bar - were packed, before those lucky enough to have the golden farewell ticket made their way into Goodison Park. Business was booming like never before at the Blue Dragon fish bar and The Goodison Cafe, traditional gathering places over the years. The old place will live on as home to Everton's women's team, but some rituals were taking place here for the final time as the hordes made their way through the terraced houses that landlock Goodison in Winslow Street, Eton Street, Neston Street and Andrew Street. When they gathered inside, the stadium packed well before kick-off, the air raid siren blared out, tears shed as the familiar drumbeat introduced Everton's famous 'Z Cars' anthem. Goodison Park was literally rocking, with the giant Main Stand, regarded as state of the art when opened in 1970, and the criss-cross designs along the Bullens Road Stand that are the trademark of famous Scottish architect Archibald Leitch, packed in a sea of royal blue. There was a period of almost eerie silence in the second half, with the game won, as Everton supporters geared up for the final celebration. When the board went up for the final four minutes, a wall of sound swept around until referee Michael Oliver's whistle brought the curtain down. This was the start of more celebrations, with video messages from football figures, such as England head coach Thomas Tuchel, recalling his memories of Goodison Park's unique atmosphere. Blue smoke filled the air around the stadium Old Evertonians, now elsewhere, also paid their tributes, with particularly warm ovations for former captain and Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti, who managed the club for 18 months before returning to Real Madrid. There were more tears as a violinist played a poignant rendition of the 'Z Cars' theme as more than 70 former players gathered before being paraded in front of the fans. They came from around the globe to share the emotions of the occasion. Tim Cahill and Gary Stevens â a two-time title winner who also won the FA Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup â flew in from Australia, while Paul Rideout, matchwinner in the 1995 FA Cup final against Manchester United, came from the United States. Bob Latchford, who won Â£10,000 from a newspaper for scoring 30 goals in the 1977-78 season, was there from Germany. Graeme Sharp, back in the fold after a period in exile when his spell on the board ended in acrimony, attended too. Wayne Rooney was greeted like the prodigal son, remembered as the 16-year-old who electrified Goodison Park with that famous goal against Arsenal rather than the local boy who left his beloved club to seek success and ending up as Manchester United's all-time record goalscorer. He, of course, then came back to Everton. They were moments that carried the feeling of the club's worldwide family, re-united once more. It was all smiles as fans celebrated the 2-0 win over Southampton Everton manager David Moyes, who will lead the club into the new stadium in his second spell in charge, captured the mood. \"This was an extraordinary atmosphere,\" he confessed. \"The crowd were amazing inside Goodison Park, as it was outside before the game. Just unbelievable. The job was to win the game and see ourselves out at Goodison in a good light. \"I thought it was as if everyone had come together as one club. Everyone standing together. \"The support at Everton is immense. It's needed some form of success. This is a day they've been waiting on for so long, a new stadium coming.\" The 62-year old Scot added: \"I never thought I'd be the one to take Everton into the new stadium. \"I'm honoured to be given that opportunity. We all see it as another chance. We need to start rebuilding Everton again. \"We've done the job [of staying up]. We have to try to build on that next year. If we can get an atmosphere like this in the new stadium it'll give us every chance of winning games.\" The man who christened Everton \"The People's Club\" on the night he arrived from Preston North End in March 2002, then revisited the old theme. \"Goodison Park will be remembered for one thing. The people.\" Iliman Ndiaye scored both goals in the last game for Everton's men's side at Goodison Park Moyes also wants the passion, colour and emotion of this day to provide a template for Everton's new American owners, The Friedkin Group. \"I hope the owners recognise what they're seeing here,\" he added. \"This should be bottled up, wrapped up and taken to the Mersey. This club needs to get back to where it once was. \"There's 100 great players here from great teams. We have to make that happen again.\" Everton must now try to recreate the heart and soul of Goodison Park on the banks of the River Mersey at Bramley Moore Dock. It will be a tough task. While the old Leitch architecture gave the Goodison Park structure something unique, it also possesses something bricks and mortar simply cannot provide. Former Everton striker Andy Gray, who won the top-flight title, FA Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup, said: \"We will leave Goodison Park. Goodison Park will never leave us.\" A lone trumpeter played a final, mournful version  of 'Z Cars' to close the day, thousands of fans remaining in their seats and unable to tear themselves away from the places they have come to call their home. Tears of joy, despair and relief have all been shed here at Goodison Park. This time it was a mixture of emotions. Just as Everton labelled this day, it was \"the end of an era\".

    "title": "Apple boosts India's factory hopes - but a US-China deal could derail plans",
    "article_text": "Just as India showed flickers of progress toward its long-held dream of becoming the world's factory, Washington and Beijing announced a trade \"reset\" that could derail Delhi's ambitions to replace China as the global manufacturing hub. Last week, Trump's tariffs on China dropped overnight - from 145% to 30%, vs 27% for India - as the two sides thrashed out an agreement in Switzerland. As a result, there's a chance manufacturing investment that was moving from China to India could either \"stall\" or \"head back\", feels Ajay Srivastava of the Delhi-based think tank, Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI). \"India's low-cost assembly lines may survive, but value-added growth is in danger.\" The change in sentiment stands in sharp relief to the exuberance in Delhi last month when Apple indicated that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India. That may well still happen, even though US President Donald Trump revealed that he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook not to build in India because it was \"one of the highest tariff nations in the world\". \"India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,\" Shilan Shah, an economist with Capital Economics, wrote in an investor note before the deal was announced. He pointed out that 40% of India's exports to the US were \"similar to those exported by China\". There were early signs that Indian exporters were already stepping in to fill the gap left by Chinese producers. New export orders surged to a 14-year high, according to a recent survey of Indian manufacturers. Nomura, a Japanese broking house, also pointed to growing \"anecdotal evidence\" of India emerging as a winner from \"trade diversion and supply-chain shift in low and mid-tech manufacturing\" particularly in sectors like electronics, textiles and toys. Some analysts do believe that despite the so-called trade \"reset\" between Beijing and Washington, a larger strategic decoupling between China and the US will continue to benefit India in the long run. For one, there's greater willingness by Narendra Modi's government to open its doors to foreign companies after years of protectionist policies, which could provide tailwind. India and the US are also negotiating a trade deal that could put Asia's third-largest economy in a sweet spot to benefit from the so-called \"China exodus\" - as global firms shift operations to diversify supply chains. India has just signed a trade pact with the UK, sharply cutting duties in protected sectors like whiskey and automobiles. It offers a glimpse of the concessions Delhi might offer Trump in the ongoing India-US trade talks. But all of this optimism needs to be tempered for more reasons than one. Apart from the fact that China is now back in the running, companies are also \"not entirely writing off other Asian competitors, with countries like Vietnam still on their radars\", economists Sonal Verma and Aurodeep Nandi from Nomura said in a note earlier this month. \"Hence, for India to capitalise on this opportunity, it needs to complement any tariff arbitrage with serious ease-of-doing-business reforms.\" A tough business climate has long frustrated foreign investors and stalled India's manufacturing growth, with its share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stuck at around 15% for two decades. The Modi government's efforts, such as theProduction Linked Incentive (PLI)scheme, have delivered only limited success in boosting this figure. The government's think tank, Niti Aayog, has acknowledged India's \"limited success\" in attracting investment shifting from China. It noted that factors like cheaper labour, simpler tax laws, lower tariffs, and proactive Free Trade Agreements helped countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia expand exports - while India lagged behind. Another major concern, says Nomura, is India's ongoing reliance on China for raw materials and components used in electronics like iPhones, limiting Delhi's ability to fully capitalise on supply chain shifts. \"India's earnings from making iPhones will only rise if more of the phone is made locally,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC. According to him, right now Apple earns over $450 per iPhone sold in the US while India keeps less than $25 - even though the full $1,000 is counted as an Indian export. \"Just assembling more iPhones in India won't help much unless Apple and its suppliers also start making components and doing high-value work here. Without that, India's share stays small, and the export numbers go up only on paper -possibly triggering more scrutiny from the US without real economic gain for India,\" Mr Srivastava said. The jobs created by such assembly lines aren't very high quality either, says GTRI. Quite unlike companies like Nokia which set up a factory in the southern city of Chennai in 2007 where suppliers moved in together, \"today's smartphone makers mostly import parts and push for lower tariffs instead of building supply chains in India\", explained Mr Srivastava. He noted that, in certain instances, the investment made could be lower than the subsidies received under India's PLI scheme. Finally there are concerns that Chinese exporters could try to use India to reroute products to the US. India doesn't seem averse to this idea despite the pitfalls. The country's top economic adviser said last year that the country should attract more Chinese businesses to set-up export oriented factories and boost its manufacturing industry – a tacit admission that its own industrial policy hadn't delivered. But experts caution, this could further curtail India's ability to build local know-how and grow its own industrial base. All of this shows that beyond the headline-grabbing announcements by the likes of Apple, India is still a long way from realising its factory ambitions. \"Slash production costs, fix logistics, and build regulatory certainty,\" Mr Srivastava urged policymakers in a social media post. \"Let's be clear. This US-China reset is damage control, not a long-term solution. India must play the long game, or risk getting side-lined.\" Follow BBC News India onInstagram,YouTube,TwitterandFacebook Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has defined himself by his persistence and endurance.

Police Scotland said Kayden Moy, from East Kilbride, was seriously injured at about 18:45 on Saturday. He was taken to Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock but died from his injuries on Sunday. Officers said a 17-year-old boy had been arrested and inquiries into the death were ongoing. Writing on Facebook Kayden's father, Paul, said his son was \"my everything\". Det Ch Insp Campbell Jackson earlier said an extensive investigation was under way to establish the full circumstances surrounding the death. He added: \"Our officers are supporting the boy's family at this very difficult and heartbreaking time.\" The senior officer confirmed that a number of people were on the North Ayrshire beach during one of the warmest days of the year. He said: \"We believe several of them were filming at the time and may have footage of what happened.\" Kayden's father, Paul, led tributes to his son on social media. He posted: \"My first born son my big boy my best friend my main man my everything rest easy my boy.\" Members of the public with any information about the incident are being urged tocontact Police Scotland. The force said extra patrols would be carried out along the popular beach. Supt Jim McMillan said: \"We understand this death will be of great concern for the local community, but please be assured that we are doing everything we can to identify those involved.\" Labour Central Scotland MSP Monica Lennon wrote on X: \"My sincere condolences to Kayden's heartbroken family and friends.

    "title": "Russia launched war's largest drone attack ahead of Putin-Trump call, Ukraine says",
    "article_text": "Ukraine says Russia has launched its biggest drone attack since the full-scale invasion began, targeting several regions including Kyiv, where one woman died. The barrage came just a day beforea scheduled call between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The US President has been urging a ceasefire. Russia and Ukraine held their first face-to-face talks in more than three years on Friday in Turkey, agreeing a new prisoner swap deal but little else. Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched 273 drones by 08:00 Sunday(05:00 GMT) targeting the central Kyiv region, and Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions in the east. It said 88 drones were intercepted and another 128 went astray \"without negative consequences\". The strikes killed one person in Obukhiv district in the Kyiv region, and injured at least three others - one of whom was a four-year-old child - officials reported. The previous largest drone attack from Russia happened on the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion on 23 February, when Moscow launched 267 drones. Russia's military said it had intercepted 25 Ukrainian drones overnight and on Sunday morning. Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Sunday that he and leaders of the UK, France, and Poland would have a virtual meeting with Trump before his conversation with Putin on Monday morning. The four leaders jointly visited Ukraine over two weeks ago to spearhead calls for a 30-day-ceasefire, backed by the so-called \"coalition of the willing\". Ukraine's intelligence agency has said it believes Russia could be planning to carry out a \"training and combat\" launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile overnight, as an attempted intimidation. Russia has not responded to the claim. Ukrainian officials said Saturday night's strikes showed Russia had no intention of stopping the war, despite international pressure for a ceasefire. \"For Russia, the negotiations [on Friday] in Istanbul are just a pretence. Putin wants war,\" said Andriy Yermak, a top aide to the Ukrainian president. Following the talks in Turkey, Trump had suggested there would be no progress towards peace until he and Putin meet face-to-face. The US president has proposed a 30-day ceasefire agreement and threatened tougher sanctions if Russia doesn't comply. Ukraine's President Zelensky has said he is ready to accept the proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. But Russia will only agree to a pause in fighting if military supplies to Ukraine are halted. Putin has also said any negotiations must include discussions about the cause of the war. Russia's terms include Ukraine becoming a neutral country, cutting the size of its military, and abandoning its Nato membership ambitions - conditions that Ukraine has rejected as tantamount to capitulation. Moscow now controls approximately 20% of Ukraine's territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula it illegally annexed in 2014. Zelensky was at the Vatican on Sunday where he had a private meeting with Pope Leofollowing the new pontiff's inauguration mass. He also briefly met US Vice President JD Vance in Rome. The Ukrainian leader said they talked about the \"low-level\" delegation Putin sent to Turkey, the \"need for sanctions against Russia\", and how to achieve peace. After seven breathless days of diplomatic hurly burly, we have a clearer idea of the US president's global ideology - and the limits of his 'art of a deal'. A scheme at several Scottish prisons has stopped the use of drones to deliver illegal items. The US secretary of state says he does not have high expectations for Ukraine-Russia peace talks due to be held in Turkey. Russia hoped to overthrow Ukraine's pro-Western government, but Moscow's war has dragged on for more than three years. The Russian president had been challenged by Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to meet in person at the talks on Thursday.",

    "title": "Police get more time to question man over fires at homes linked to PM",
    "article_text": "Police have been given more time to question a second man arrested in connection with alleged arson attacks at properties connected to Sir Keir Starmer. The 26-year-old was arrested on Saturday afternoon at London Luton Airport on suspicion of conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life. The arrest relates to three incidents: a vehicle fire in Kentish Town, a fire at the prime minister's private home on the same street, and a fire at an address where he previously lived in north-west London. On Sunday, a warrant of further detention was obtained at Westminster Magistrates' Court, meaning the man can be detained for an additional 36 hours, the Metropolitan Police said. Another man, Roman Lavrynovych, 21, who the BBC understands is a builder and roofer, appeared in court on Friday and is accused of three counts of arson with intent to endanger life following the fires. He entered no pleas and was remanded in custody until a further hearing at the Old Bailey scheduled for 6 June. The 26-year-old man is in police custody in London. The Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command has led the investigation because of the connection with a high-profile public figure. Emergency services responded to a fire in the early hours of Monday at the Kentish Town home where Sir Keir lived before becoming prime minister and moving into 10 Downing Street. Damage was caused to the entrance of the property, which it is understood Sir Keir still owns and rents out, but nobody was hurt. On 8 May, a car Sir Keir sold to a neighbour in 2024 caught fire on the same street. In the early hours of Sunday, firefighters dealt with a small fire at the front door of a house converted into flats in nearby Islington, where the prime minister previously lived. One person was helped to safety via an internal staircase by crews wearing breathing apparatus, the fire brigade previously said. Victory over Man City marks the Eagles first ever major trophy in their 120-year professional history. A 26-year-old man is taken to hospital with a stab wound and pronounced dead shortly after. Bryan Woolis died in 2015 but has only now been identified, thanks to a South Yorkshire inspector. Court staff have been unable to reside in their flat because it has been used by judges.

    "article_text": "Authorities in New York are investigating the site where a Mexican sailing ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge for clues about how the fatal collision occurred. Two people on board were killed and at least 19 others were injured when the Mexican Navy training ship crashed into the bridge on Saturday night. Police said early investigations showed the ship had lost power before the collision. Video showed the ship's three tall masts crumbling as horrified onlookers watched from the shore. It's not clear how the vessel came to approach the bridge, which authorities confirmed was not damaged by the strike. It had reopened to traffic late on Saturday. Police said the Cuauhtémoc ship had a 48.2m (158ft) mast height while the bridge had a 41.1m (135ft) clearance at its centre, according to the New York transport department's website. Responders were able to remove at least 27 people from the ship for treatment, while all 277 personnel on the ship were accounted for, said New York fire authorities. The ship lost all three masts and has been moved to a nearby pier for investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team to assist in the investigation, which is being coordinated between the US and Mexico governments. Mexico's Navy Secretary Raymundo Pedro Morales Ángeles said in a statement the results of any investigation would be followed with \"total transparency and responsibility\".

    "title": "Pope Leo XIV calls for unity at inaugural mass and meets Zelensky",
    "article_text": "Pope Leo XIV has called for unity at his inaugural Mass at the Vatican attended by thousands of faithful and world leaders including Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky. During the address on Sunday, he criticised economic systems which he said exploited \"Earth's resources\" and and marginalised the poor. He also said he would seek to govern \"without ever yielding to the temptation to be an autocrat\". The Pope noted efforts to end the war in Ukraine in a prayer after the service and also held a meeting with Zelensky. The pontiff had called for an end to the war in his first days in office. The Ukrainian leader thanked the new Catholic leader for his \"support for Ukraine\" and \"clear voice in defence of a just and lasting peace\". Earlier on Sunday, the Pope had addressed worshippers in St Peter's Square. Thousands of pilgrims stood in reverence as the pope received the symbols of office, blessed the people and issued a strong call for unity. The Mass from the first US and Peruvian pontiff also drew attendance from dignitaries including US Vice President JD Vance as well as politicians from Germany to Peru as well as faith leaders and European royals. \"We still see too much discord, too many wounds caused by hatred, violence, prejudice, the fear of difference, and an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth's resources and marginalises the poorest,\" he said. In a prayer afterwards, he noted the efforts for a ceasefire in Ukraine, before holding a private audience with Zelensky and his wife. \"The martyred Ukraine is waiting for negotiations for a just and lasting peace to finally happen,\" Pope Leo said. Last week, he had offered the Vatican as a venue for possible peace talks after Russian President Vladimir Putin turned down Zelensky's offer to meet face-to-face in Turkey for negotiations. Prior to giving his Mass, there had been cheers from the crowd when the pontiff appeared in his popemobile as it drove around St Peter's Square and down Via della Conciliazione to the river Tiber and back. There was a strong sense of excitement in the square. Michelle, from Germany, told the BBC she \"came on purpose to see the Pope\". \"I arrived yesterday in the morning and I'm leaving in a few hours, so I don't have much time. It's very crazy because there's so many people. I wanted to see the Pope.\" Many of the tens of thousands attending were Catholics, but tourists also came to be part of the historic occasion. Joe from the US state of Missouri said: \"We're on vacation, but it's great timing. We're here to see the Pope's inaugural Mass. It's very special. I'm glad we came early.\" He said he was \"extra proud\" to see the first Pope from the United States. \"That was a surprise. He's gonna be a wonderful Pope. I am not Catholic, but I grew up Catholic, but this is just inspiring no matter what denomination of Christian you are.\" Also in the crowds was Pia, from Chile, a professor of philosophy at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome. She told the BBC she felt there was \"a new hope in the church\". Pia said that among the Pope's first words when he was elected was \"Let the peace be with you\", the words of Jesus. And then he said \"don't be afraid\". \"He knows what the world and the church needs. A church that is preaching hope, preaching peace. I think many people are waiting for that,\" she said. The Pope's official inauguration followed the Mass, with a pallium garment - a white woolen band - placed on the pope's shoulders, and fixed in place with three pins to represent the nails on the cross. Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines then placed on the pope's finger the Ring of the Fisherman, a symbol of the papacy which bears an image of St Peter. Pope Leo then took the book of the gospels to bless the people. Have you attended the Pope's inauguration Mass today?Get in touch. The new pontiff expressed solidarity with journalists who had been jailed for \"reporting the truth\". The Vatican press corps is watching Leo XIV very closely for clues to the kind of pope he plans to be, writes William Crawley. Retired Bishop Michael Campbell remembers the day the future pontiff visited Lancaster in 2008. Scrutiny about the way the latest pope might run the Catholic Church started the moment he stepped on to the balcony. A salvage operation is under way to recover the Bayesian which sank off the Italian coast last August.",

    "article_text": "Sixteen-year-old Nimra stood outside, rooted to the spot, as the Indian missiles that had woken her a moment ago rained down on the mosque a few metres from her house in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. She watched one tear the minaret off the top of the building. But she failed to realise she, too, had been struck - in the chest. When the family reached the relative safety of her aunt's house nearby, someone turned on a phone torch. \"My aunt gasped. There was blood on my frock. It was pink and white but now soaked in red. I hadn't seen it before.\" Again they ran. \"I was running but my hand was pressed on my chest the whole time. I didn't want to take it off. I thought if I let go, everything inside me would come out.\" A piece of shrapnel was lodged near her heart, she later discovered. A few hours later, in Poonch, Indian-administered Kashmir, a different family was dodging shelling which Pakistan had launched in response to India's missile strikes. \"When the firing began, everyone ran for their lives - children clinging to their parents in fear,\" said MN Sudhan, 72. \"Some families managed to leave for Jammu in their vehicles. We also decided to escape. But barely 10 minutes into our journey, a shell landed near our vehicle. The shrapnel tore through the car. My grandson died on the spot.\" \"Our future was shattered at that [very] moment,\" Mr Sudhan said of 13-year-old Vihaan's death. \"Now we're left with nothing but grief. I have witnessed two wars between India and Pakistan, but never in my life have I seen shelling as intense as this.\" Nimra and Vihaan were among many of the villagers caught up in the deadliest attacks for several years in a decades-long conflict between two of the world's nuclear powers - India and Pakistan. Both sides administer the Himalayan regionin part but claim it in full. Both governments deny targeting civilians, but BBC journalists in the region have spoken to families caught up in the violence. The strike that injured Nimra was part of India's armed response after a militant attackkilled 26 people- mostly Indian tourists - last month at a beauty spot in India-administered Kashmir. Police there claimed militants included at least two Pakistan nationals. Pakistan has asked India for evidence of this, and has called for an independent inquiry into who was behind the attack. What followed was four days of tit-for-tat shelling and drone attacks, intensifying each day and culminating in missile strikes on military bases, which threatened to tip over into full-blown conflict. Then, suddenly, a ceasefire brokered by the US and other international players on 10 Maybrought the two nuclear powers back from the brink. Families on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border in Kashmir - told us they had had loved ones killed and property destroyed. At least 16 people are reported to have been killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling. We also heard from Indian and Pakistani government insiders about the mood in their respective administrations as the conflict escalated. In Delhi's corridors of power, the atmosphere was initially jubilant, an Indian government source told the BBC. Its missile attacks on targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in Pakistan itself - including the Bilal Mosque in Muzaff arabad, which India claims is a militant camp, though Pakistan denies this - were deemed a success. \"The strikes… were not limited to Pakistani-administered Kashmir or along the Line of Control,\" an Indian government source told the BBC. \"We went deep - even into the Pakistani side of Punjab, which has always been Pakistan's red line.\" But the Pakistani military had been prepared, a source from the Pakistan Air Force told the BBC. Days earlier, the Pakistani governmentsaid it was expecting an attack. \"We knew something was coming, and we were absolutely ready,\" one officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said Indian fighter jets approached Pakistani territory and the air force was under instructions to shoot down any that crossed into its airspace or dropped a payload. Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian jets that night, something India has remained silent on. \"We were well prepared, and honestly, we were also lucky,\" the source said - his account repeated by two other sources. But Mr Sudhan, Vihaan's grandfather, said there had been no warning to stay indoors or evacuate. \"Why didn't they inform us? We, the people, are caught in the middle.\" It is likely that no evacuation orders had been issued because the Indian government needed to keep the military strikes confidential, though the local administration had, following the April militant attack, directed locals to clean out community bunkers as a precautionary measure. A day after the initial missile strikes, Thursday, both sides launched drone attacks, though they each accused the other of making the first move. India began to evacuate thousands of villagers along the Indian side of the LoC. Just after 21:00 that evening, the Khan family in India-administered Kashmir decided they must flee their home in Uri, 270km (168 miles) to the north of Poonch. Most of their neighbours had already left. But after travelling for just 10 minutes, their vehicle was struck by shrapnel from a shell, fatally injuring 47-year-old Nargis. Her sister-in-law Hafeeza was seriously injured. They headed to the nearest hospital, only to find the gates locked. \"I somehow climbed the hospital wall and called out for help, telling them we had injured people with us. Only then did the staff come out and open the gate. As soon as they did, I collapsed. The doctors were terrified by the ongoing shelling and had closed everything out of fear,\" Hafeeza said. Hafeeza's sister-in-law Nargis is survived by six children. The youngest daughter Sanam, 20, said the first hospital they went to was not equipped to help, and as they headed to another, her mother died of her injuries. \"A piece of shrapnel had torn through her face. My clothes were soaked in her blood… We kept talking to her, urging her to stay with us. But she passed away on the way.\" Since a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in 2021 there had been relative peace in the region, locals told the BBC. For the first time in years, they had been able to live normal lives, they said, and now this sense of security was destroyed. Sanam, who lost her mother, said: \"I appeal to both governments - if you're heading into war, at least secure your civilians. Prepare... Those who sit in comfort and demand war - they should be sent to the borders. Let them witness what it really means. Let them lose someone before their eyes.\" Sajjad Shafi, the representative for Uri in the regional government, said he had acted as promptly as possible. \"The moment I got the news that India has attacked, I got in touch with people and started moving them out.\" After two days of attacks and counter attacks, the Indian government source said there was now a \"clear sense in… power corridors that things were escalating but we were ready. \"We were ready because India had spent the last 10 years acquiring and building strategic military assets - missiles, warheads and defence systems.\" On the international stage, there had been consternation that the tensions would not be de-escalated by the US, despite its diplomatic overtures during India and Pakistan's previous Kashmir clashes. US Vice President JD Vance said a potential war would be \"none of our business\". This statement came as no surprise, the Indian government source told the BBC. At that stage, \"it was clear the US didn't want to get involved\". By the following day, Friday, shelling had become more intense. Muhammed Shafi was at home with his wife in Shahkot village in the Neelum Valley, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, on the LoC. The 30-year-old was standing in the doorway, just a few steps away from where his son was playing; his wife standing in their courtyard. \"I remember looking up and seeing a mortar shell coming from a distance. In the blink of an eye, it struck her. She didn't even have time to scream. One second she was there, and the next, she was gone. Her face... her head... there was nothing left. Just a cloud of smoke and dust. My ears went numb. Everything went silent. I didn't even realise I was screaming. \"That night, her body lay there, right in our home. The entire village was hiding in bunkers. The shelling continued all night, and I stayed beside her, weeping. I held her hand for as long as I could.\" One of those in a bunker was his niece, 18-year-old Umaima. She and her family were holed up in the shelter for four days, on and off, in brutal conditions. \"There were six or seven of us packed into it,\" she said. \"The other bunker was already full. There's no place to lie down in there - some people stood, others sat. There was no drinking water, no food,\" with people shouting, crying and reciting prayers in the pitch black. Also in a bunker, in the Leepa Valley, Pakistan-Administered Kashmir - one of the most militarised and vulnerable valleys in the region - was Shams Ur Rehman and family. It is Shams's own bunker, but that night he shared it with 36 other people, he said. Leepa is surrounded on three sides by the LoC and Indian-administered territory, so Shams was used to living with cross-border tensions. But he was not prepared for the complete destruction of his house. He left the bunker at three in the morning to survey the scene. \"Everything was gone. Wooden beams and debris from the house were scattered everywhere. The blast was so powerful, the shockwave pushed in the main wall. The metal sheets on the roof were shredded. The entire structure shifted - by at least two inches. \"A house is a person's life's work. You're always trying to improve it - but in the end, it's all gone in seconds.\" Four hours later, back in the Neelum Valley, Umaima and her family also emerged on Saturday 10 May to a transformed landscape. \"We came out of the bunker at seven in the morning. That's when we saw - nothing was left.\" As Umaima surveyed the ruins of her village, India and Pakistan's forces that day were trading ever more destructive blows - firing missiles at each other's military installations, which both sides accused the other of instigating. India had targeted three Pakistani air bases, including one in Rawalpindi - the garrison city that houses the Pakistan Army's General Headquarters. \"This was a red line crossed,\" said one Pakistani officer. \"The prime minister gave the go-ahead to the army chief. We already had a plan, and our forces were desperately ready to execute it… For anyone in uniform, it was one of those unforgettable days.\" Pakistan hit back at Indian military installations. On the diplomatic front, this was seen as a moment to highlight the issue of Kashmir on the international stage, an official in the Pakistan foreign office told the BBC. \"It was non-stop. Endless meetings, coordination, and back-to-back calls to and from other countries for both foreign minister and then the prime minister. We welcomed mediation offers from the US, the Saudis, the Iranians, or anyone who could help de-escalate.\" On the Indian side, the Pahalgam attack on 22 April had already prompted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to speak to at least 17 world leaders or diplomats, including UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In most of these conversations, he has tweeted, the emphasis had been on the \"cross-border terrorist attack\" and focused on building a case to hold the perpetrators accountable for the attack. Then, on Saturday afternoon local time, in the aftermath of the latest missile exchanges, came a diplomatic breakthrough out of nowhere. US President Donald Trump took to social media to reveal that a ceasefire had been agreed. \"After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. \"Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,\" he wrote on social media platform Truth Social. India has since downplayed Washington's role in the ceasefire and it hasrejected that trade was used as a lever to achieve this. Behind the scenes, US mediators, diplomatic backchannels and regional players, including the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia, had provedcritical in negotiating the climbdown, experts say. \"We hit Pakistani strategic bases deep inside their territory and that must have worried the US,\" the Indian government source believes. In Pahalgam, the site of the militant gun attack that sparked the crisis, the search is still on for the perpetrators. Vinay Narwal, a 26-year-old Indian Navy officer, was on his honeymoon in Pahalgam when he was killed. He had got married just a week before the attack. A photo of Vinay's wife Himanshi, sitting near her husband's body following the attack, has been widely shared on social media. His grandfather Hawa Singh Narwal wants \"exemplary punishment\" for the killers. \"This terrorism should end. Today, I lost my grandson. Tomorrow, someone else will lose their loved one,\" he said. A witness to the attack's aftermath, Rayees Ahmad Bhat, who used to lead pony treks to the beauty spot where the shootings took place, said his industry was now in ruins. \"The attackers may have killed tourists that day, but we - the people of Pahalgam - are dying every day since. They've stained the name of this peaceful town… Pahalgam is terrorised, and its people broken.\" The attack was a huge shock for a government which had begun to actively promote tourism in stunningly picturesque Kashmir, famed for its lush valleys, lakes and snow-capped mountains. The source in the Indian administration said this might have lulled Delhi into a false sense of security. \"Perhaps we got carried away by the response to tourism in Kashmir. We thought we were over a hump but we were not.\" The four-day conflict has once again shown how fragile peace can be between the two nations. Additional reporting by Vikas Pandey in Delhi India has stopped a Turkish operator from working at its airports as public sentiment toward Ankara shifts. Living along the LoC - the volatile India-Pakistan border - means life in a fragile limbo between war and peace. As one of 25 member groups on the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited, say experts. Recent hostilities were a reminder of how easily a crisis could escalate into catastrophe. India and Pakistan have ceased military hostilities, but diplomatic retaliatory measures remain in place.",

    "title": "Elton John brands government 'losers' over AI copyright plans",
    "article_text": "Sir Elton John described the government as \"absolute losers\" and said he feels \"incredibly betrayed\" over plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws. Speaking exclusively to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, he said if ministers go ahead with plans to allow AI firms to use artists' content without paying, they would be \"committing theft, thievery on a high scale\". This week the government rejected proposals from the House of Lords to force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes. A government spokesperson said that \"no changes\" to copyright laws would be \"considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators\". Generative AI programmes mine, or learn, from vast amounts of data like text, images, or music online to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human. Sir Elton said the \"danger\" is that, for young artists, \"they haven't got the resources ... to fight big tech [firms]\". \"It's criminal, in that I feel incredibly betrayed,\" he added. \"The House of Lords did a vote, and it was more than two to one in our favour,\" he said. \"The government just looked at it as if to say, 'Hmm, well the old people ... like me can afford it.'\" On Monday, the House of Lords voted by a 147 majority to amend the Data (Use and Access) Bill to add transparency requirements, which aim to ensure copyright holders have to give permission for their work to be used. But on Wednesday MPs in the House of Commons voted to reject this change, meaning the bill will continue to go back and forth between the two Houses until they reach an agreement on it. Sir Elton warned the government was on course to \"rob young people of their legacy and their income\", adding that he thought the government was \"just being absolute losers, and I'm very angry about it\". The singer said that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"wise up\" and described Technology Secretary Peter Kyle as \"a bit of a moron\". He said if the government does not change its plans, he would be ready to take ministers to court, saying that \"we'll fight it all the way\". Speaking alongside the 78-year-old, playwright James Graham said ministers \"do understand the value of creativity... but what's frustrating is either the complacency or the willingness to let Silicon Valley tech bros get it all their own way\". The chief executive of UK music, Tom Kiehl, told the BBC that the government is \"on the brink\" of offering up the country's music industry \"as a sacrificial lamb in its efforts to cosy up to American-based tech giants\". He added that the prime minister \"must not sell\" the next generation of singers, songwriters, musicians, and music creators \"down the river and allow all that talent to be crushed by letting soulless AI bots plunder their work\". Ahead of the vote in the House of Lords, Sir Elton joinedmore than 400 British musicians, writers, and artists in signing a letter calling on the prime minister to update copyright lawsin a way that protects them from artificial intelligence. Beatles singer Sir Paul McCartney, who also signed the letter,previously told the BBC there was a risk AI would create a \"Wild West\"in which artists' copyright was not properly protected. A government spokesperson said it wants the UK's creative industries and AI companies to \"flourish, which is why we're consulting on a package of measures that we hope will work for both sectors\". The spokesperson said it was \"vital\" the government worked through responses to a consultation on proposals to allow developers to use creators' content unless rights holders elected to \"opt out\". They added that it was \"equally important that we put in the groundwork now as we consider the next steps\". \"That is why we have committed to publishing a report and economic impact assessment - exploring the broad range of issues and options on all sides of the debate.\" Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletterto get Laura Kuenssberg's expert political insight and insider stories every Thursday.

    "title": "Why this year's strawberries are set to be sweeter",
    "article_text": "The UK's strawberry season is off to a \"stonking start\", according to one grower, with warm days and cooler nights meaning they are sweeter than usual. Marion Regan, managing director of Kent-based Hugh Lowe Farms, told the BBC that a \"glorious spring\" this year had contributed to a \"really good crop\" of the fruit. That is good news for strawberry lovers, including those attending Wimbledon this year - one of Hugh Lowe Farms' clients. This spring is currently ranking asthe driest in over a century, according to the Met Office, with the Environment Agency recently warning there is a \"medium\" risk of a summer drought. Ms Regan, who has been growing strawberries for more than 50 years, said she was noticing that this year's were a \"good size\" so far but that the \"most marked thing\" was their sweetness. A combination of warm days and cool nights are known to make strawberries sweeter. The lower night temperatures allow them to rest and put the energy they have gained during the day into producing more natural sugars. However, Ms Regan said it remained to be seen what the rest of their growing season - which lasts until November - would bring. Asked about the warnings over potential drought conditions, she said that she, like all good soft fruit growers, have irrigation systems in place to mitigate the effects of extreme weather and to ensure their crops get a steady supply with water. Nevertheless, some help from mother nature would not go amiss. \"All farmers could do with the rain, it would be nice,\" she added. Pauline Goodall, a strawberry farmer from Limington in Somerset, told the BBC earlier this month that a warmer than average start to May was having a noticeable effect on the timing of this year's harvest. \"They're just ripening at a phenomenal rate,\" she said of her strawberries. The Summer Berry Company, based in Colworth near Chichester, recently said that the warmer weather had helped increase its production to 200 tonnes – 50 tonnes more than by the same time last year - and that the plants were producing \"lush-sweet tasting fruit\". This all bodes well for consumers keen to get their berry fix over summer, but how should we be making the most of these sweet flavours? While some people may prefer to keep it classic with cream, there are other options available for those who are looking to be more adventurous. According to the BBC Food,a little black pepper or balsamic vinegar helps to give them more flavour, while pairing them with some form of chilli can help balance the flavours out. This year marks a very different start to the strawberry-growing season than in 2024, when the fruit was delayed in ripening following one of the wettest winters on record. Scientists have saidclimate change was a major factorin this weather. It is also well-established that human-caused climate change is making spells of hot weather more likely, and that hot days have become more common in the UK. Over the decade 2014-2023, days exceeded 28C more than twice as often as the 1961-1990 average, according to the Met Office. BBC Weather forecaster Chris Fawkes saidthe coming weekshould provide some good strawberry-growing weather with long spells of sunshine and cool nights. A few showers could come in the first half of the week, and some could turn to thunder and hail, which would not be welcomed by growers although the risk to individual farms would be very low. A change in weather patterns next weekend and the following week would lead to rain becoming widespread, which would \"probably welcomed by farmers given that this spring is likely to be the driest in over a century\", he added. Thousands of people are expected to attend, with four days of sunshine forecast. Agricultural workers are being reminded that dust particles can lead to serious lung damage. The University of Exeter hopes research can help improve support provided for health and wellbeing. \"My mental health wasn't in the greatest place... Benny came along at the right time.\" The 129th show runs from Thursday until Saturday and will be held at Westpoint arena, near Exeter.",

    "title": "Five teams, three spots - which way will race for Champions League go?",
    "article_text": "Eddie Howe is hoping to take Newcastle back into the Champions League Five Premier League teams will battle it out for three Champions League places on the final day of the season, with Newcastle boss Eddie Howe saying he \"had the feeling it would go right to the end\". Arsenal's 1-0 win over the Magpies on Sunday ensured they join champions Liverpool in next season's Champions League. But it leavesNewcastleas one of three teams on 66 points, alongsideChelseaandAston Villa, withManchester CityandNottingham Foreston 65 points. Five English sides will qualify for the Champions League through the league, up from the usual four, with an extra place secured because of positive results by Premier League clubs in Europe this season. Sixth-placed Manchester City have a game in hand, at home to Bournemouth on Tuesday, meaning their fate is in their own hands, unlike Villa. Beaten FA Cup finalists City then visit Fulham on the final day. Newcastle, meanwhile, know a home win against Everton next Sunday (16:00 BST) would successfully finish the job. Chelsea also know a win would be enough. But... they visit Forest, who beat West Ham 2-1 on Sunday to keep their own hopes alive. Forest need to beat the Blues and hope at least one team above them slips up. Villa will probably need to win at Manchester United and hope for favours elsewhere. Still following? The winners of Wednesday's Europa League final between Manchester United and Tottenham will also qualify for next season's Champions League, meaning there will be a sixth English team in the competition, but that has no impact on any league permutations. With Spurs and United in the bottom five of the Premier League, whoever loses in Bilbao will have no European football of any kind next season. Another European finalist, Chelsea, could have a say in what other English teams qualify for various European competitions, but more on that later. Third to fifth place will join Liverpool and Arsenal in qualifying for the Champions League, sixth is a Europa League spot, while seventh and eighth are unclear yet This video can not be played Howe 'disappointed' to lose despite 'strong' performance Two of the managers still involved in the tussle for Champions League places had games on Sunday. Howe's Newcastle could have gone second and almost cemented their place if they had beaten Arsenal. They are guaranteed at least a Conference League place after winning the Carabao Cup, but they want more, so beating Everton is the objective. \"Halfway through the season we weren't in a great position. We worked hard to get here. It's an incredibly tight race. We have one more game to execute what we need,\" said Howe. \"We love playing at home. It's a really great atmosphere. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves and make it too emotional.\" This video can not be played 'Let's enjoy it' - Nuno delight at Forest win Forest's Champions League hopes would have been over had they lost to West Ham. Now they will fancy the job at home against Chelsea. \"It's a good boost of confidence, [being at] the City Ground is another big boost for us, it's going to be bouncing,\" said boss Nuno Espirito Santo. \"We will fight, it's the final game so we're going to fight for something huge for us - something magical. \"It's great. Let's enjoy it, it's going to be a good week for us. If we'd thought in the beginning of the season that we'd be playing to play in the Champions League we'd sign it.\" Statisticians Opta give Manchester City the best chance of qualifying for the Champions League - 85.9% - because of that game in hand. Newcastle are not far behind with an 83.5% chance, and Chelsea are predicted to finish there in 56.8% of their predictions. Villa are given a 44.4% hope, with Forest down on 29.3%. Former Newcastle striker Les Ferdinand, speaking on Sky Sports, said: \"I think the last game of the season at home you'd expect Newcastle to beat Everton because Everton have nothing to play for. \"I think Manchester City will do it. We know they can produce when they want. I know things haven't been great for them this season but they can turn up when they need to.\" Ex-Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp added: \"I still think City are going to do it but it's not going to be easy by any stretch. The team with the easiest fixture is Aston Villa because they have Manchester United away. \"These aren't teams that are in bang in form. \"It was a massive win for Nottingham Forest against West Ham because they've given themselves a real chance. Now Chelsea have to go there next week and play against a team that's got that confidence back.\" Newcastle:Everton (H) Chelsea:Nottingham Forest (A) Aston Villa:Manchester United (A) Manchester City:Bournemouth (H); Fulham (A) Nottingham Forest:Chelsea (H) Crystal Palace, who are 12th in the league, have qualified for the Europa League by winning the FA Cup, beating Manchester City in Saturday's final. The team who finish sixth will also qualify for the Europa League. Newcastle United, as Carabao Cup winners, have earned at least a place in next season's Conference League. If Newcastle finish in the top six, then seventh place in the Premier League will qualify for the Conference League instead. The teams who finish sixth and seventh will be the two teams who miss out on the Champions League next weekend, because there is a 10-point drop to eighth. Now... there is a chance that the team who finish eighth can qualify for the Conference League. That will happen if Chelsea finish seventh in the league - a 22.8% chance according to Opta - and win the Conference League final against Real Betis on Wednesday, 28 May. In that scenario, Chelsea would qualify for the Europa League because of winning their final in Wroclaw. That is for quite complicated reasons -which you can read here if you like- but you might be better off just trusting us. Brentford sit eighth currently, above Brighton on goal difference. Fulham - after a win over the Bees - are one point behind that pair - and Bournemouth are another point behind. But Brighton - at home to Liverpool on Monday - and Bournemouth - at City on Tuesday - have games in hand. If Chelsea win the Conference League and finish sixth, England will have three teams in the Europa League (including the team who finish seventh) and none in the Conference League.

    "title": "Dominant Scheffler resists Rahm challenge to win US PGA",
    "article_text": "Scottie Scheffler won by five strokes, the largest margin of victory at the US PGA since Rory McIlroy won by eight in 2012 2025 US PGA Championship final round -11Scheffler (US);-6DeChambeau (US), English (US), Riley (US) Selected others:-5Pendrith (Can), Poston (US), Vegas (Ven);-4Fitzpatrick (Eng), Rahm (Spa);-1Schauffele (US);+2Fleetwood (Eng);+3McIlroy (NI) Full leaderboard An emotional Scottie Scheffler held off the rejuvenated Jon Rahm to convert his 54-hole lead into a maiden US PGA Championship title. While the winning margin of five strokes suggests his third major was a formality, a different story threatened to unfold at Quail Hollow. World number one Scheffler began three shots ahead and five clear of Rahm, but it became a two-way duel for the Wanamaker Trophy. A patchy front nine from Scheffler, along with Spaniard Rahm's flurry of birdies around the turn, meant they shared the lead midway through the final round. However, Rahm collapsed over his final three holes and Scheffler coasted to a major title that joins his Masters victories in 2022 and 2024. Relive US PGA final day as Scheffler sees off Rahm to win in style The 28-year-old was in tears walking down the 18th and his animated celebrations after sinking the winning putt demonstrated how much this latest title means to him. Before collecting the trophy, Scheffler said: \"I knew it was going to be a challenging day. \"Finishing off a major championship is always difficult and I did a good job of staying patient on the front nine. \"I didn't play my best stuff but I kept myself in it, stepped up on the back nine and had a good nine holes.\" After opening the door for Rahm by shooting two over par for his first nine, Scheffler posted birdies on the 10th, 14th and 15th to re-establish a buffer. As Rahm tried to catch his American rival, his dreams of his own third major triumph were crushed on the tricky 'Green Mile' finale. He made a bogey on 16 before sending his tee shot into the water on the par-three 17th on his way to a double-bogey five. Two more dropped shots on the last hole saw him topple to a tie of eighth. Above him, Bryson DeChambeau continued his fine recent record in majors by finishing in a share of second alongside fellow Americans Davis Riley and Harris English, whose six-under round of 65 catapulted him up the leaderboard. Rory McIlroy, playing his first major since completing a career Grand Slam at the Masters in April, finished with a 72 to end three over par in a tie for 47th. Defending champion Xander Schauffele fared marginally better, shooting 68 on Sunday to finish one under for the championship and sneak inside the top 30. At last year's US PGA, he was arrested outside Valhalla Golf Club in Kentucky before his second round, as he tried to avoid heavy traffic caused by an earlier unrelated accident in which a male pedestrian died. All of the subsequent charges he faced were dropped a couple of weeks later and, a year on, Scheffler stamped his authority on this tournament. Having played his final five holes on Saturday in five under par, his was a commanding position heading into the final round. His previous two major wins at Augusta National had been almost processions after holding the 54-hole lead. This, however, was anything but until the closing stretch. A clumsy bogey at the first gave Scheffler's rivals hope but, after getting his shot straight back at the second, he actually led by five standing on the fifth tee, with his chasers faltering. Around the turn, though, Rahm made his move and as the world number one stumbled to bogeys on the sixth and ninth, it was suddenly all square. But Scheffler's composure and ability to shoot a good score when not playing at his best are among his countless strengths - and they were demonstrated to full effect on the back nine. Watched by his wife and infant son by the 18th green, his emotion became evident as he approached the final hole. A closing bogey was incidental with victory, his third in the past 14 majors, long since assured. This win was Scheffler's 15th on the PGA Tour and comes just three years and 94 days since his first. That is the third fastest since 1950, behind only Tiger Woods (three years, 32 days) and Jack Nicklaus (three years, 45 days). Jon Rahm did not drop a shot in his first 15 holes on Sunday, then gave up five strokes on the final three holes Rahm said afterwards that his late demise was a \"tough pill to swallow\" but the fact he got himself in the mix on the final day will do a lot to dispel the discussion about a drop-off in his results at majors since his switch to LIV at the end of 2023. His best finish in 2024 was a tie for seventh at The Open but, until this week, he had not been a realistic contender in any of the five majors since leaving the PGA Tour. On Saturday, he insisted there was no correlation between his major form and LIV move, and at Quail Hollow he demonstrated why he should never be discounted as a challenger for golf's biggest prizes. Aiming to become the first Spaniard to win the US PGA Championship in its 107th edition, he started with seven solid pars, before exploding into life with birdies on the eighth, 10th and 11th to tie the lead. After Scheffler pulled clear again, he narrowly missed chances to re-ascend the top of the leaderboard down the back nine, before his title bid slipped away in dramatic fashion. \"There's been a lot of good happening this week and a lot of positive feelings to take for the rest of the year,\" the 2023 Masters and 2021 US Open winner Rahm added. \"I think it's the first time I've been in position to win a major that close and haven't done it. The only times I think I've been in the lead in a major on a Sunday, I've been able to close it out.\" At the start of play, a host of players hoped to shoot low to pressurise the world number one, but their challenges never materialised. Nowhere more so was that exemplified than on the par-four first. Of the final eight players to head out, Rahm made par but the other seven, including Scheffler, all carded a five. Perennial major contender DeChambeau played well once again but was unable to build sustained momentum during his one-under 70. \"It's another top five and I'm always proud to top five in a major,\" DeChambeau said. \"I feel like I'm playing good when I'm doing that but it's disappointing not to get the job done because that's what I came here to do.\" Starting almost four hours before the final group, English had almost finished his round by the time the leaders set off and his 65 - the lowest round on Sunday - secured his best finish at a major.

    "title": "Can anyone stop 'unrivalled' Chelsea after treble?",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Baltimore scores twice as Chelsea beat Man Utd to seal treble As Chelsea's players celebrated at Wembley, a treble complete and an unbeaten domestic season intact, they draped flags around their shoulders displaying the word \"unrivalled\". They strolled up the steps to collect their winners' medals and lift the Women's FA Cup trophy aloft, dancing in front of new Â£20m investor Alexis Ohanian and waving to family members in the stands and on the pitch below. Their mission was complete. Domestic dominance was achieved and they have indeed been unrivalled. For manager Sonia Bompastor, her debut season at the club could not have gone much better. Words, she says, cannot describe her feelings, but she gave an indication of them when she threw her arms in the air and roared when Catarina Macario scored the second goal in their3-0 victory over Manchester United. The scary thing is that they are only likely to get better. 'Moments to remember' - Bompastor savours 'special' season Chelsea will be billion-dollar franchise - Ohanian How 'force to be reckoned with' Bompastor built on Hayes' legacy The gap was evident on Sunday as Chelsea outshone Manchester United in almost every department. Deeper squad depth, more experience, physicality in midfield and a ruthlessness in the key moments helped Chelsea stroll across the line to complete the treble. They soaked up a period of United pressure early on, clearing away successive corner deliveries, before eventually imposing themselves. Scotland midfielder Erin Cuthbert won almost every duel in midfield, Mayra Ramirez and Aggie Beever-Jones ran confidently at United's defence and Sandy Baltimore was calm and composed from the penalty spot to make it 1-0. United's response never came - Chelsea did not allow it - and as the substitutions rolled out, Bompastor's side only got stronger. \"Even if I have a lot of experience in my squad, sometimes you stress a little bit and it's OK to have the pressure, but when it's too high you don't start the way you want to,\" Bompastor said as she reflected on a difficult opening 10 minutes. \"But after that, we were confident enough to turn things around and we were the better team. We were stronger I think and deserved to win the game.\" Chelsea's depth allowed them to switch things up. They set up with a less familiar back three and played Baltimore higher up the pitch. Having tried it successfully against Liverpool in their final WSL match, Bompastor said they made small tweaks to improve it and had focused purely on the new system from Tuesday to Saturday, specifically on \"how they could hurt United\". United boss Marc Skinner said he changed his formation three times in the game to combat it but it was not enough - individually, Chelsea were better. Baltimore's cool penalty broke the deadlock, substitute Catarina Macario put the game to bed with her header late on and wounded United were punished in stoppage time by another Baltimore strike to cap things off. This video can not be played Bright an 'amazing leader' for club and country - White praises Chelsea captain It is Chelsea's second domestic treble but arguably their greatest season, given it was achieved having gone unbeaten. Theirlast one came in 2021under former manager Emma Hayes but, with the FA Cup final delayed a year because of Covid, two of the trophies were won the season before. As well as stepping into the shoes of Hayes - who had been at the club for 12 years - Bompastor had to develop her English to aid communication, help her four children adapt to new schools and compete in a new league in a different country. Former England striker Ellen White said many expected Chelsea \"to need a transition period\" for Bompastor to implement her style. The style will come, but the results already have. \"What they've achieved this season is phenomenal. Everything's come together in Bompastor's first season,\" White told BBC One. \"Winning the treble and going unbeaten is extraordinary. Chelsea's mentality has been phenomenal. The squad depth is unrivalled. It's mind-blowing. \"It takes a special person to be able to manage those egos and have the communication. \"What's special about Bompastor is she has been a player, she knows how it works, she's a proven winner.\" Chelsea became the first WSL club to go unbeaten in a 22-game campaign and the champions broke their record points tally to do it (60). Their latest FA Cup win - their sixth in total - was the first under a manager that was not Hayes. Bompastor is also the first non-British manager to win the Women's FA Cup since Arsenal's Spanish manager Pedro Martinez Losa in 2016 - when they beat Chelsea. Former England midfielder Fara Williams said: \"I think the most impressive thing is to keep being able to motivate these players to go on and to continue to win. \"Big players want to play and they have got a massive squad. There's only one way you keep the squad depth together and that is with good management. \"That's what Bompastor's done. You have to buy in as a player. She's done an incredible job with this team.\" This video can not be played Serial winner Bompastor's \"phenomenal job\" as Chelsea boss - Williams What it means for everyone else is a scary prospect - this is just the start of Chelsea under Bompastor. It's a new era, there are new ambitions and there is new investment at Chelsea. Having smashed the world record transfer fee to sign USA defender Naomi Girma in January, she is likely to become a mainstay in the team next season after recovering from injury and returning to full fitness. Ohanian's investment could mean more spending in the summer, while Australia striker Sam Kerr is still to return following an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. They are still chasing an elusive maiden Champions League trophy - having beenhumbled by Barcelona in the semi-finalsthis season - and that is what is driving them. So are Chelsea only going to get better? \"I mean, that's our ambition for sure. Maybe everyone is saying 'Chelsea will run away from the pack in England' but our goal is to compete against the best in Europe,\" said Bompastor. While Chelsea celebrated with their fans, FA Cup medals around their necks, Bompastor said some had pointed out the missing Champions League trophy. \"What sets them apart from everyone else is they don't stand still. They always want to move forward,\" said White. \"Everyone needs to look at their blueprint and be like 'how can we reach what they are and bridge that gap?' This team is phenomenal and they're going places.\" Manchester United are one of those chasing. Sunday's result was proof there is still work to do and manager Skinner knows they cannot compete financially - but what else can they do? \"We have to maximise what we have got. We have to come back fitter, stronger, more aggressive and concentrate more,\" he said. \"I still believe this - I think we have the best team spirit in the country. I think I have to go and find the other answers. \"We vastly and quite openly spend less than Chelsea. I won't rest over the summer. I have to find a way to close that gap but we need investment as well.\" Skinner's plea for more investment is supported by Bompastor, who said Chelsea will only improve on the European stage if they are pushed by others in England. \"If you have more competition you are able to perform better. This is what we want to be a better team,\" she added. \"We want to be at the top of the league and bring everyone with us. We need the other teams to still invest and come with us.\" Head here to get involved Get the latest WSL news on our dedicated page Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "How 'delicious' Verstappen move caught McLaren by surprise",
    "article_text": "Max Verstappen moves alongside Oscar Piastri as they approach the Tamburello chicane Max Verstappen caught McLaren by surprise at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix to seal his second win of the year and lay down a reminder - as if one was needed - that he cannot be ruled out of this year's Formula 1 championship fight. The surprise came in two forms - firstly, by the spectacular move the Red Bull driver pulled to take the lead from McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner; and then by the pace Verstappen showed once out in front In Miami two weeks ago, Verstappen also led the early laps, but he was devoured by the McLarens of both Piastri and Lando Norris in the first 20 laps of the race and then left far behind. Not so this time. Verstappen never looked like losing the race once he was in the lead. And while McLaren were left to rue some of what Piastri described as \"wrong calls\" during the race, they were also realistic enough to know that none of them would have made a difference to the outcome. The decision to pit early for fresh tyres cost Piastri in the context of the way the race unfolded, with first a virtual safety car and then an actual one. And the season's protagonists finished in reverse championship order, with Norris second and Piastri third. \"It was the best result I thought we could really achieve today,\" Norris said. \"I probably just didn't expect the Red Bull to be quite as quick as they were.\" Piastri still leads the championship from Norris and Verstappen, but the gaps have compressed as the drivers head to Monaco this weekend. Where form may shift again. Verstappen comes out of Tamburello ahead of Piastri First, though, that move. It was delicious. On the run to the first corner, Verstappen had actually dropped to third, with Mercedes' George Russell edging ahead on his inside and Piastri apparently comfortably in the lead. But, in the middle of the track, and not on the ideal line, Piastri braked earlier than he should have done, and it was all the invitation Verstappen needed. He \"sent it\" around the outside with full commitment, and caught Piastri - an instinctive and clinical racer himself, normally - unawares. \"Yeah,\" the Australian said. \"I thought I had it pretty under control, and it was a good move from Max. So, I'll learn for next time, clearly. \"Definitely would have done something different (in hindsight). I would have braked 10 metres later probably. Yeah. That's all. Live and learn. \"But at that point, I wasn't overly concerned to not be in the lead. But then our pace just wasn't as strong as I expected.\" The move even impressed Verstappen. \"I was quite far back,\" he said. \"At the time before braking, I was basically in P3. But, of course, I was on the normal braking line, but I still had to come from far. \"And as soon as I braked late and then came off the brakes, I felt like: 'OK, there might be a move on.' So, I just carried the speed in. And, luckily, it basically was sticking. It's not an easy move to make but, luckily, everything went well.\" 'More to come' from Ferrari, says Hamilton Verstappen takes dominant win in Imola Had McLaren shown the pace advantage they had in Miami, or Bahrain, or China, or Australia, it might not have mattered, even on a track where overtaking is as notoriously difficult as Imola. But they didn't. Piastri could hold Verstappen for a while, but then began to feel his tyres going away, and McLaren decided to pit him. It was the wrong decision - on this day, the tyres went through a phase where they felt like they were going off, but then came back again. But all it did was change which McLaren finished second and third. Verstappen believed that there were two combined explanations for his improved form. Red Bull had brought some upgrades, and they had worked. But there was also the track itself. As at Suzuka - his other win this year - or Jeddah, where Verstappen went toe-to-toe with Piastri, the track, as Verstappen put it, \"has quite a few high-speed corners, which I think our car likes\". He added: \"It's very track specific. I mean, every time that we have been really competitive, it's been high-speed tracks, high-speed corners. \"We still have work to do, but I do think it's been a very positive weekend for us. \"Friday was very difficult still, but then I think we found a better set-up for Saturday. And I just hope that we can use that a bit more often because it definitely brought the car in a better window.\" Norris said: \"That's where we've suffered the whole season so far, the high-speed corners. So we have to work in that area, and maybe that's proved to hurt us a little bit more this weekend. \"We said it from the beginning that we have to keep working hard. Max has out-qualified us several times, and their pace just converted today into Sunday. \"Sometimes they've been ahead, but their pace on Sunday has not been too strong. They've maybe worked on some things, and their pace was better today. That's the price we pay for not being quick enough.\" F1's goodbye to Imola? Images from classic track over the years Incredible images from 75 years of F1 Seven races in, and a pattern is developing. On a high-speed track, the Red Bull and McLaren are a match for each other. But at a different speed range, the McLaren has a decisive advantage. So the pendulum may keep swinging. Monaco this coming weekend is as slow as they come. It should favour McLaren. Verstappen said: \"Monaco is, of course, very, very different. So, let's see how we are going to perform there. You know, last year was very difficult for us. I don't expect it to be a lot easier this time around because there's, of course, a lot of low speed, but we'll see.\" The following weekend comes Spain, where the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya is full of long, medium and high-speed corners. Red Bull territory. Except that tyre degradation is high there, which should help McLaren. Overall, though, the trend, the maths, still favour McLaren. Because on the tracks where the cars are pretty equal, either team can win. Piastri beat Verstappen in Saudi Arabia, for example. And then there are tracks where McLaren are simply better. Red Bull will, on current form, need McLaren to screw up to win on those. But what there have not been - at least so far - are any tracks on which the Red Bull is dominant in the way the McLaren has been at about half the events so far. Although Piastri is by nature a down-to-earth personality, who lets nothing apparently ruffle his sang-froid, he may have been thinking of this when he summed up his feelings on his third place. \"Honestly, given people had fresher tyres at the end, hanging on to a podium is not a bad result,\" Piastri said. \"And you're going have tough days in the championship, and this is clearly one of them.\" How to follow Monaco Grand Prix on the BBC Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix Review Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "'It can't all come from the manager' - Keown on how Arsenal can become winners",
    "article_text": "Sunday's win over Newcastle means Arsenal will almost certainly finish second in the Premier League for the third year running, and of course people are asking how they might take the next step and land a major trophy. I've been there myself and, while it can sometimes feel very easy when you are always winning things, I know how difficult it is as a player when you keep getting so close without getting any reward. As well as your own disappointment, you have to deal with all the noise around what has gone wrong - all the doom and gloom about how you have either bottled it or your team is missing an ingredient to make you into winners. That's what Mikel Arteta and his players are hearing now, and my Arsenal team had exactly the same issue when we finished second to Manchester United three seasons running without winning a trophy between 1998-99 and 2000-01. Looking back now I don't feel any shame in that but, at the time, it was the toughest thing to take. This video can not be played How 'Beckham-like' Rice inspired Arsenal win Being the bridesmaid so often is the worst feeling in football and it takes a special group to come back from having that happen repeatedly, and win. I was lucky because I was part of a special group of players at Arsenal, but we still had to work on it. In the summer of 2001, Arsene Wenger brought in a psychologist who said to us that we were second best because the statistics proved we were. We weren't very happy about that, but then he told us that he did not believe that the statistics were telling the truth. He looked around the dressing room and said we have got World Cup winners in here, and you have all won trophies in the past. His message was that there was more under the bonnet, we just needed to find it. It was a clever move by Wenger and the parallels in Arsenal's current position means it is something Arteta could try too, but it can't all come from the manager - it is down to the players to respond in the right way I remember being on the Millennium Stadium pitch after we had just lost the 2001 FA Cup final to Liverpool and thinking 'well this can't happen again', and it didn't. We came back to Cardiff the following year and beat Chelsea to win the FA Cup then, a few days later, we went to Old Trafford and beat Manchester United to win the Premier League too. This video can not be played Arsenal still chasing the dream - Arteta Keown went on to win three Premier League and three FA Cup titles with Arsenal We did not make big changes to our squad that won nothing in 2001 to do the Double the following season. Sol Campbell arrived and Wenger told myself and Tony Adams that Sol would always play and one of us would be alongside him, but our only other major signing was Everton striker Francis Jeffers. I don't think this Arsenal squad needs an overhaul either, but the question always seems to come back to what they need to do to win trophies after finishing empty-handed again. The answer is usually a new player in a certain position, like a centre-forward this summer for example. I do think Arteta needs to strengthen in a few areas but I think what they really need to be successful is the mindset I mentioned above - so, a really strong group that has got such a burning desire to win that it hurts them to the core when they don't. What you want is to be able to look around the dressing room and know everyone is feeling the same way, and that they will use this disappointment as fuel too. I had that feeling with Wenger's Arsenal, because I knew I was surrounded by people who, like me, were not going to rest until we got that glory. That is how it has to be for this Arsenal team too. Like I say, it can't just come from the manager but that is a good starting place, and Arteta definitely provides it. This video can not be played Arsenal nowhere near standards required - Arteta I wish I was a fly on the wall in the Arsenal dressing room at half-time on Sunday because I think a lot of the difference between their first and second-half performance was down to the kind of motivation from the manager that I am talking about. It was the same at Anfield last week, when they were 2-0 down to Liverpool at the break and Arteta told them he was not accepting that level of performance. They were not behind against Newcastle this time but they could have been, and he deserves some credit for how they turned things around again. Like Wenger, Arteta has got his lieutenants - the players he can rely on - and Declan Rice stepped up again on Sunday. You could tell he was short of full fitness because he was blowing a bit but Arsenal needed him, and he delivered. There was a bit of a cup final feel about the game because Champions League qualification was riding on it for both teams and of course there was an edge to it, with Newcastle beating Arsenal three times this season already. They needed to be put to bed, really, and Arsenal did that in the second half - even if the game still had quite a tense ending. I don't think Arsenal fans were exactly celebrating second place at the final whistle but it is still quite an achievement for them to get back into the Champions League for a third straight season, after they were away for six years. When you consider where Arsenal were when Arteta took over in 2019, I think he has done an amazing job. Injuries have massively impacted them this season, but it still feels like we have got our Arsenal back - they are on the right path, and the trophies he craves will follow.

Sinner, playing in his first tournament since athree-month doping ban,was hoping to become the first Italian men's singles winner at the tournament since Adriano Panatta in 1976.

    "title": "Ten dead in ‘brutal’ attacks by Isis-linked militants on Mozambique wildlife reserve",
    "article_text": "One of Africa’s largest protected areas has been shaken by a series of attacks by Islamic State-linked extremists, which have left at least 10 people dead. Conservationists in Niassa reserve, Mozambique, say decades of work to rebuild populations of lions, elephants and other keystone species are being jeopardised, as conservation operations grind to a halt. On 29 April, militants attacked buildings in Niassa, killing two anti-poaching scouts. Two more scouts are missing and another seriously injured. The attack, which was later claimed by Islamic State-Mozambique, came 10 days after another raid on a nearby safari camp in which two people were beheaded and six soldiers were killed. A village of 2,000 people has been displaced by the violence and all conservation work has been suspended in Niassa reserve, according to local groups. On Monday, wildlife and community organisations warned that the violence is risking more than 20 years of conservation work in the area. “The worst thing about these kind of attacks, which is kind of the point, is the fear factor. The attacks are brutal: the two carpenters that were killed at the safari camp were beheaded. There is enormous fear from communities from the brutality of the attack,” said Colleen Begg, managing director of Niassa Carnivore Project, whose headquarters were attacked in the 29 April raid. Begg said that the suspension of tourism activities could affect the area for several years. “Niassa reserve is special because of its size. It is the size of Switzerland. There are very few places like this inAfricawith no fences, with large populations of lions, elephants and animals that require a lot of range. It’s one of these beautiful wilderness areas. We’ve been trying to figure out how to make it a world heritage site and all of that is now at risk because of insecurity,” she said. At 4.2m hectares (10m acres), Niassa is regarded as one of Africa’s most important wildlife refuges. It is home to as many as 1,000 lions, 350 critically endangered African wild dogs, and recovering populations of elephants, buffalo and other keystone species. Islamic State Mozambique, known locally as al-Shabaab although not linked to the group in Somalia, emerged in 2017 and has displaced more than1 million peoplein northern Mozambique as its activities have expanded. While there was a crackdown on the group after an attack on the city of Palma thatresulted in the suspension of a major gas project by TotalEnergies, the militants remain active in the country’s northernmost province. Nine conservation and safari camps have been abandoned since the attacks, with one destroyed by the Islamist group. Begg said that urgent support was needed to restore peace in the region and prevent further loss of life. The Mozambican army is in pursuit of the IS-linked group. “Obviously, the first task is to solve the problems with the insurgents and get them out of Niassa. If we cannot create peace, people can’t walk to collect honey, they can’t go to their fields, they can’t harvest. It’s impossible for conservationists. No tourists will come. It is devastating,” Begg said. Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverage",

    "article_text": "Two sailors from theMexicannavy were killed and another 11 critically hurt when a sailing ship taking part in a promotional tour inNew York Citycollided with the iconic Brooklyn Bridge, Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said. The crash happened on Saturday night when the Cuauhtémoc – an academy training vessel with 277 people on board who shares a name with the last Aztec ruler – lost power and struck the bridge.Eyewitness videosshowed dozens of sailors in ceremonial uniforms spread across yardarms shortly before the collision, which snapped the Cuauhtémoc’s three masts. In an updateposted to Xon Sunday morning, Sheinbaum said: “We are deeply saddened by the loss of two crew members of the training ship Cuauhtémoc, who lost their lives in the unfortunate accident in New York. “Our solidarity and support go out to their families. The ministry of the navy, with the support of local authorities, is currently attending to the wounded.” A Mexicangovernment bulletinsaid 22 crew members were injured, 11 of them critically, with nine in a stable condition. It confirmed that the two who died were navy cadets – and that officials were taking steps to reunite survivors with their families. Mexican officials and media there identified the two victims of the crash as Adal Jair Marcos, 22, a resident of Puebla originally from Oaxaca, and América Yamilet Sánchez, from Xalapa, Veracruz. Both were said to have been on the same mast at the time of the wreck. “The navy, aware of the risks naval personnel face in their operations, deeply regrets what happened and reaffirms its commitment to the crew’s families to provide timely attention and follow-up to the investigations into the events that occurred to accurately determine the causes of this incident,” the bulletin said. The extent of the damage became apparent at first light on Sunday when images showed the vessel docked on the East River with the tops of two masts splintered – and a third dangling at a 45-degree angle. Seven uniformed navy members were spotted boarding the ship, CNN reported. Multiple videos of the crash showed the masts snapping and partially collapsing as they crashed into the deck of the bridge. There was heavy traffic on the bridge at the time of the collision. The vessel, which was flying a giant green, white and red Mexican flag, then drifted toward the edge of the river as onlookers scrambled away from shore. Nobody was reported injured on the bridge, which was undamaged, said Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City,in a Facebook post. An earlier statementposted by the Mexican navysaid the Cuauhtémoc would be prevented from continuing its scheduled 254-day voyage. It was taking part in an ongoing celebration of the 200th anniversary of the independence of Mexico – achieved from Spain in 1821 – and was to have visited 22 ports in 15 countries to “carry the message of peace and goodwill of the Mexican people to the seas and ports of the world”. It sailed from Acapulco on Mexico’s Pacific coast on 6 April and was due to make stops in a succession of countries around the Caribbean before crossing the Atlantic to Europe, including stopovers in Aberdeen and London. Its crew consisted of 64 women and 213 men. Sydney Neidell and Lily Katz told the Associated Press they were sitting outside to watch the sunset when they saw the vessel strike the bridge and one of its masts snap.“We saw someone dangling, and I couldn’t tell if it was just blurry or my eyes, and we were able to zoom in on our phone and there was someone dangling from the harness from the top for like at least like 15 minutes before they were able to rescue them,” Katz said.They said they saw two people removed from the ship on stretchers on to smaller boats. TheBrooklynBridge, which opened in 1883, has a nearly 1,600-ft (490 metres) main span that is supported by two masonry towers. More than 100,000 vehicles and an estimated 32,000 pedestrians cross every day, according to the city’s transportation department, and its walkway is a major tourist attraction. The Cuauhtémoc – about 297ft long and 40ft wide (90.5 metres long and 12 metres wide), according to the Mexican navy – sailed for the first time in 1982. Each year it sets out at the end of classes at the naval military school to finish cadets’ training.

    "title": "Centrist Nicuşor Dan defeats far-right rival in Romanian presidential election",
    "article_text": "The centrist mayor of Bucharest, Nicuşor Dan, is set to win Romania’s pivotal presidential election with 99% of votes counted, according to official figures showing the pro-EU independent eight points clear of his far-right rival, George Simion. The figures from Romania’s central election authority showed Dan, who had cast the second round vote as a battle between “a pro-western and an anti-western Romania”, on 54.2%, while Simion, a self-professed Trump admirer, had 45.8%. The capital’s two-term mayor, who made his name fighting corrupt property developers, said voters seeking “profound change, functioning state institutions, less corruption, a prosperous economy and a society of dialogue, not hate, have won”. Simion conceded early on Monday, after earlier claiming he had won the election. “We may have lost a battle, but we will certainly not lose the war,” he posted on X. Sergiu Mișcoiu, a political scientist, predicted protests but said that, with several percentage points between the results, it was “hard to believe he’d be able to challenge them”. Simion’s supporters had received messages on Sunday evening telling them to protest “if the fraud continues” and calling for a “national protest” on Monday “if they try to steal the victory of the Romanian people”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, congratulated Dan on his “historic victory”, writing on social media: “For Ukraine – as a neighbour and friend – it is important to have Romania as a reliable partner.” The voting in Romania took place on the same day as the first round of a Polish election in which a liberal frontrunner, Rafal Trzaskowski, edged ahead of Karol Nawrocki, the candidate backed by the opposition nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party. In Portugal, meanwhile, the far-right Chega party took a record 22% of the vote and tied for second place in parliamentary elections that were won by the incumbent centre-right Democratic Alliance (AD) party, although it remained far short of a majority. All three elections are being closely watched acrossEuropeamid concern that popular anger with mainstream elites over migration and cost-of- living-pressures could erode unity on the continent. Analysts have described the Romanian election as the most important in the country’s post-communist history, with significant implications for the country’s strategic orientation and economic prospects as well as for European Union unity. Simion won the 4 May first round, triggering thecollapse of Romania’s governmentof centre-left Social Democrats and centre-right Liberals (PNL). The new president will nominate the next prime minister and influence the formation of a new coalition. The former soccer ultra and ultranationalist agitator, who sees his far-right AUR party as a “natural ally” of the US Maga movement, scored almost double his rival’s total, but polls in recent days had shown the gap between the two narrowing. Turnout, which was 53% in the first round, was almost 65%, with young people and Romanians living abroad in particular voting in significantly higher numbers, official figures showed. Analysts had said a high turnout would favour Dan. The vote is a rerun of last November’s ballot, won by Călin Georgescu, a far-right, Moscow-friendly firebrand, who was barred from standing again after the vote was cancelled amid allegations of campaign finance violations and Russian meddling. The Romanian foreign ministry said earlier on Sunday it had seen “a viral campaign of fake news on Telegram and other social media platforms” designed “to influence the electoral process”, adding that this bore “the hallmarks of Russian interference”. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Simion had promised to nominate Georgescu, who is under formal investigation on counts including misreporting campaign spending, illegal use of digital technology and promoting fascist groups, as prime minister if he became president. Romanian presidents have a semi-executive role, with considerable powers over foreign policy, national security, defence spending and judicial appointments, and can also dissolve parliament if MPs reject two prime ministerial nominations. Dan, 55, had campaigned on a pledge to fight rampant corruption, to maintain support for Ukraine–where Romania has played an important logistic role–and to keep the country firmly within the European mainstream. He is backed by the Union to Save Romania (USR), a pro-EU, anti-corruption party that he co-founded, and was endorsed by the PNL. He is thought likely to nominate a USR prime minister and try to form a minority government, possibly backed by the PNL. Addressing his jubilant supporters in central Bucharest, he said he would start talks on forming a new government on Monday but acknowledged his job would be hard. “There will be a difficult period ahead, needed for economic rebalancing,” he said. “Please have hope and patience.” Simion opposed further aid to Ukraine and had sharply criticised the EU’s leadership. While he insisted he wants Romania to stay in the EU and Nato, he could have allied with Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Slovakia’s Robert Fico as another disruptive force. Mujtaba Rahman, of the Eurasia Group consultancy, said the outcome was “a really strong result for the pro-European candidate”, reflecting the way “concerns about political and policy direction moving in a Maga-like way have mobilised voters”. The founder of the Telegram messaging app, Pavel Durov, earlier appeared to accuse the French government of asking the company to “silence conservative voices in Romania in the election”. France “categorically rejected” what it called “completely unfounded allegations”. Russian-born Durov, who is now a French national, is being investigated in France over possession of child abuse image, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions on the app.",

    "article_text": "This blog has now closed. You can read the latest updates on theparliamentary elections in Portugal here,Romania’s presidential race hereandPoland’s presidential first round poll here. Here’s a quick recap of events so far. ROMANIA:The centrist mayor of Bucharest,Nicuşor Dan, isset to win Romania’s pivotal presidential electionwith 99% of votes counted, according to official figures showing the pro-EU independent eight points clear of his far-right rival,George Simion.

Simion disputed the results, but it is unclear what steps the populist candidate could take to contest the outcome. POLAND:The pro-European centristRafał Trzaskowskiand historianKarol Nawrocki, backed by the populist right, have each secured about 30% of the vote in a nail-bitingly close first round of Poland’s presidential election. An exit poll by the Ipsos institute suggested Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw and candidate from the prime minister Donald Tusk’s Civic Coalition, was narrowly ahead with 30.8% of the vote in the first round, with Nawrocki at 29.1% of the vote. The exit poll, however, points to a first-round result closer than anticipated, which islikelyto make Trzaskowski and Tusk nervous about the run-offin two weeks’ time, on 1 June. PORTUGAL:The centre-rightDemocratic Alliance (AD), led by Portugal’s caretaker prime minister,Luís Montenegro, looks set to win the country’sthird snap election in three yearsbut to again fall well short of a majority, while the far-rightChegaparty could take a record 20% of the vote. By midnight on Sunday, with more than 99% of the votes counted, the AD – led by the prime minister, Luís Montenegro – had won 32.1% of the vote and taken 86 seats in Portugal’s 230-seat assembly, leaving it far shy of the 116 needed for a majority. The Socialist party (PS) had taken 23.4% of the vote to Chega’s 22.6%, and the two were tied on 58 seats each. Far-rightChega, which isled by the former football pundit André Ventura, has seen a huge surge in support over the past few years which has enabled it to become the third-largest party in parliament. And on that note, it’s all from me,Jakub Krupain Warsaw, with my colleaguesJon Henley, Sam Jones, Ashifa KassamandJennifer Rankin,as I hand the blog over toHelen Livingstonewho will keep you up-to-date for a bit longer. This blog has now closed. You can read the latest updates on theparliamentary elections in Portugal here,Romania’s presidential race hereandPoland’s presidential first round poll here. Portugal’s incumbent, centre-right Democratic Alliance (AD) has won the country’sthird snap general election in three years– but once again fallen well short of a majority – as the underperforming socialists were left vying for second place with the far-right Chega party, which took a record 22% of the vote. By midnight on Sunday, with 99% of the votes counted, the AD – led by the prime minister, Luís Montenegro – had won 32.1% of the vote and taken 86 seats in Portugal’s 230-seat assembly, leaving it far shy of the 116 needed for a majority. The Socialist party (PS) had taken 23.4% of the vote t0 Chega’s 22.6%, and the two were tied on 58 seats each. In thelast election, held 14 months ago, the AD won 80 seats, the PS 78 and Chega 50. Chega’s leader, André Ventura, said his party’s impressive showing at the polls – well up on the 18% of the vote it took last time round – had ended 50 years of conservative and socialist governments and “killed bipartisanship in Portugal”. But Chega’s elation will be tempered by Montenegro’s explicit refusal to strike any deals with Ventura’s party. “Governing with Chega is impossible for three reasons,” Montenegro has said. “It isn’t reliable in its thinking; it behaves like a political weathervane, always changing its mind, and it’s not suited to the exercise of government.” Here’s a quick recap of events so far. ROMANIA:The centrist mayor of Bucharest,Nicuşor Dan, isset to win Romania’s pivotal presidential electionwith 99% of votes counted, according to official figures showing the pro-EU independent eight points clear of his far-right rival,George Simion.

And on that note, it’s all from me,Jakub Krupain Warsaw, with my colleaguesJon Henley, Sam Jones, Ashifa KassamandJennifer Rankin,as I hand the blog over toHelen Livingstonewho will keep you up-to-date for a bit longer. TheEuropean Commission does not comment on elections taking place in EU member states.Period. But behind that official line, EU officials surely paid close attention to three elections taking place on Sunday. In the second round ofRomania’s presidential elections, a victory for ultranationalistGeorge Simionwould have strengthened anti-EU forces in the European Council of EU leaders. But its his rival,Nicușor Dan,who is projected to have won the vote. The exit polls from the first round of presidential elections inPoland,however, may push officials closer to the edge of their seats. The EU quietly cheered the return of a pro-EU Polish government, following thevictory of Donald Tusk’s coalitionin October 2023. But the Tusk government can only fully deliver on its agenda if its candidate for president, the centrist Warsaw mayorRafał Trzaskowskiprevails. Analysts have suggested that a win for his rival, nationalist historianKarol Nawrocki,who is endorsed by Law and Justice, could paralyse Polish politics. It would also call into question Poland’s rekindled tieswith FranceandGermany. The knock-on effect of having a run-off on 1 June is further delays to EU policies. EU plans to replace free-trade arrangements for Ukraine that expire on 5 Juneremain up in the air. That is widely seen as an attempt by Brussels to avoid upsetting Polish farmers – whoobject to cheaper Ukrainian imports– ahead of the crucial elections. The commission would refute that link. It doesn’t comment on elections after all… Portugal, a reliable source of pro-European governments, is on course to deliveranother centre-right administrationled by current prime ministerLuís Montenegro. This would be a comfortable outcome for the EU. As Portugal held its third election in three years,officials will be watching to assess the stability of the new governmentand how it will stick together in the face of the challenge from the far-rightChegaparty. We have just got the late poll results fromPoland, reported to be a mix of exit poll and first results from 50% of polling stations. There are only some minor changes there with Trzaskowski’s lead increasing to 2pp (from 1.7pp), but,for the record, here it is – with the two candidates in bold going through to the run-off. Rafał Trzaskowski 31.1% (+0.3)Karol Nawrocki 29.1% (-) Sławomir Mentzen 14.8% (-0.6)Grzegorz Braun 6.3% (+0.1)Adrian Zandberg 5.2% (-)Szymon Hołownia 4.9% (+0.1)Magdalena Biejat 4.1% (-)Others 4.5% Speaking after the exit poll was announced inPolandearlier tonight, centrist Warsaw mayorRafał Trzaskowskisought to mobilise his voters as he warned that his lead over the radical-right rival,Karol Nawrocki, was “razor-thin”. He’s not wrong. The first poll conducted after today’s vote,by Opinia24 for TVN24 and TVN24+, shows that Trzaskowski leads Nawrocki by just 2 percentage points, 46% to 44%, when it comes to voting intention ahead of the runoff on 1 June. 6% declined to answer the question, and 4% said they are yet to decide. It’s all to play for in Poland. European capitals are calling it forNicușorDaninRomaniaas he is now getting first official congratulations from several fellow European leaders, including France’sEmmanuel Macron, Ukraine’sVolodymyr Zelenskyy, Poland’sDonald Tuskand the EU’sUrsula von der Leyen. Macronsaidhe spoke with Dan on the phone, and made a swipe at Simion by saying that “despite numerous attempts at manipulation,Romanians chose democracy, the rule of law and the European Union”. ZelenskyycalledDan’s win “historic” and said it was important for Ukraine “to have Romania as a reliable partner [a]nd we are confident we will”. Tusksaidsimply “long live free Romania”, while von der Leyenstruck the same toneas Macron, saying that Romanians “have chosen the promise of an open, prosperous Romania in a strong Europe”. Finally, the president of neighbouring Moldova, Maia Sandu, is also clearly delighted with the result. She said: Congratulations, dear @NicusorDanRO on being elected President of Romania! Moldova and Romania stand together, supporting one another and working side by side for a peaceful, democratic, and European future for all our citizens. Over inPortugal, the official results page shows justhow close the race for second place is. Thesocialistshave just leapfroggedChegato move into the second spot, with 1,118,947 votes and 23.2% of the vote to the far-right party’s 1,111,856 votes and 22.9%. TheADis well ahead with 1,597, 936 votes and 33% of the vote. Understandably, our initial reaction focused on the overperforming right inPoland, as an exit poll has the radical-right candidateSławomir Mentzenat 15.4% in third, and the far-rightGrzegorz Braunat 6.2% in fourth. But it’s still worth noting that there’sa lotofvotes to be won in the centre and the left, too – and the first-round winner Trzaskowski will definitely want to look at this in the next few days. Hard-leftAdrian Zandbergis fifth in the exit poll, just behind Braun, at 5.2%. Similarly to Mentzen’s, his voters areverydisillusioned with both main parties, so it could prove to be difficult to get them on side. The caveat on moving electorates like Lego bricks made by Dr Stanley earlier (22:36) applies here too, and it’s difficult to figure out how, if at all, they will vote in the second round. By the way, it’s clearly one of the biggest stories of the night that Mentzen and Zandberg – strong anti-establishment voices openly contesting what they describe as the duopoly of the two main parties that have ruled Poland since 2005 – could well end up with more than 20% of the combined vote share (21.6%, according to the exit poll). Not to say “I told you so”, but kind of, yes, I suggested that could be the case in my piece earlier this week after I spoke to these two groups at their rallies in Toruń and Warsaw. It’s not impossible to think they both may be tempted to not endorse anyone to keep positioning themselves in opposition to the main two parties before the 2027 parliamentary election. Right, focus! If you look past Zandberg, the exit polls give the next two spots to candidates from the governing coalition, the centrist Sejm speakerSzymon Hołownia(4.8%, a trulybrutalcollapse when you compare this with his 13.9% in the last presidential elections in 2020) and the New Left’s Senate deputy speakerMagdalena Biejat(4.1%). Hołownia has already declared his support for Trzaskowski in the runoff, but Biejat has not (yet?). Before she does that, if at all, she will probably press the Warsaw mayor to make stronger commitments on social issues, including abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, which played a big role in her campaign. When I spoke with her on Friday night, just minutes before her final rally in Warsaw, she insistedthe campaign showed “that there is a space for the left in this weird, deeply polarised world”. I know we are not meant to add numbers like that (22:36), buttheoreticallythe exit poll shows the combined support for various left candidates on 10%, their best result since 2015. It may not feel like much, but given how incredibly close this race is, these voters could play a really important role in the second round. Biejat told me on Friday that what made her stand apart from other candidates was that she was not playing any games or hiding her views, but instead making them plainly clear, whatever the cost. It will be interesting to see how she, too, responds to Trzaskowski’s attempts to court her voters over the next two weeks. Jakub Krupain WarsawandAshifa Kassam The pro-European centristRafał Trzaskowskiand historianKarol Nawrocki, backed by the populist right, have each secured about 30% of the vote ina nail-bitingly close first round of Poland’s presidential election. The votesets the stage for a runoff round on 1 June that will force voters to choose between starkly different visions of the country’s future. An exit poll by the Ipsos institute, released as voting closed on Sunday, suggested Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw and candidate from the prime minister Donald Tusk’s Civic Coalition, had claimed 30.8% of the vote in the first round. Trailing him was Nawrocki, who has been endorsed by the Law and Justice party (PiS), with 29.1% of the vote. The exit poll, however, points to a first-round result that was closer than anticipated between the frontrunners, yielding a result that is likely to make Trzaskowski and Tusk nervous. The outgoing president,Andrzej Duda, is a close ally of the previous PiS government and a supporter of Donald Trump. He opposed the changes pursued by the new Tusk-led administration and blocked some decisions, including ambassadorial nominations. Apotential opposition win would extend the current deadlock, prompting years of political instability. With almost 98% of votes counted, the centrist independent mayor of Bucharest,Nicușor Dan, appears to have an unassailable lead in Romania’s presidential election with 54.25% of the vote against the 45.75% of his far-right rival,George Simion. More precisely,Dan has a lead of about 830,000 votes– and growing. Although only 65% of votes in the diaspora have been counted and Simion leads there by about 55% to 45%, that gap seems, if anything, to be widening.It looks impossible for Simion to come back from here. However,the ultranationalist has yet to concede, and has indeed claimed victory. “We are the clear winners of these elections,” he said. “We claim victory in the name of the Romanian people.” Simion claimed he was actually 400,000 votes ahead of Dan. Simion promised a parallel count by his AUR party activists would “ensure the identification of any potential fraud”, although he acknowledged he had not so far seen any. It is unclear what steps he could take to contest the results. Sergiu Misciou, a political scientist at Babes-Bolyai University, told Reuterssome protests by Simion supporters could not be ruled out in the coming days, but added that if the results were several percentage points apart, “it is hard to believe we would be able to challenge them”. I have askedDr Ben Stanley, a political scientist at SWPS University in Warsaw, for his first thoughts on the Polish exit polls (21:02). Here is his take: “If the exit polls reflect the outcome, thenthe radical right candidates will have overperformed relative to their pre-election polling(21:07), whilethe centrist and left-wing candidates will have underperformed. But with this many candidates and 2 pp. margins of error, there isstill scope for the picture to change either way.It’s also worth noting thatcandidate electorates are not Lego blocks– those who are stacking them to project second round results are overlooking substantial heterogeneity. Mentzen’ssupporters, for example, cannot be counted upon to swing fully behindNawrocki, nor canTrzaskowskisimply expect to inherit the votes of the left.” If you were considering taking a relaxed city break in Warsaw next Sunday, 25 May, you may want to think again. Donald Tusk’sCivic Coalition (KO) party has long advertised plans for a massive campaign march to be held in the capital on that day in a bid to mobilise centrist, liberal and left-wing voters forRafał Trzaskowskiahead of the second round. But in his speech after the exit polls were published, radical-right opposition candidateKarol Nawrockiannounced he would lead a rival march of conservatives, too. Here isSam Jones’sfirst take on the events of the night so far: The centre-rightDemocratic Alliance (AD), led by Portugal’s caretaker prime minister,Luís Montenegro, looksset to win the country’sthird snap election in three yearsbut to againfall well short of a majority, while the far-right Chega party could take a record 20% of the vote. Three polls, published at 8pm local time by the three main television channels – SIC, RTP and TVI – put the AD on between 29% and 35.1%, with the Socialist party (PS) and Chega vying for second place on 19.4% to 26% and 19.5% to 25.5%, respectively. If accurate, the polls point toa similar AD showing tothe previous general election in March 2024,when the alliance won 28.8% of the vote. But the surveys showa far closer race between the PS and a seemingly resurgent Chega.Last time, the socialists won 28% of the vote, while Chega took 18.1% – dramatically up from the 7.2% it won in the 2022 election. Here isJon Henley’sfirst story on the Romanian vote: The centrist mayor of Bucharest,Nicuşor Dan, ison track to win Romania’s pivotal presidential electionwith 85% of votes counted, according to official figures showing the pro-European independent six points clear of his far-right rival,George Simion. The figures from Romania’s central election authority showed Dan, who had cast the second round vote asa battle between “a pro-western and an anti-western Romania”, on 53.2%, while George Simion, a self-described Trump admirer, had 46.8%. The capital’s two-term mayor, who made his name fighting corrupt property developers, said voters seeking “profound change, functioning state institutions, less corruption, a prosperous economy and a society of dialogue, not hate, have won”. Simion, however,disputed the polls.He said: “We are the clear winners of these elections. We claim victory in the name of the Romanian people.”Simion promised a parallel vote count would “ensure the identification of any potential fraud”. Analysts have described the elections asthe most important in the country’s post-communist history, with significant implications for the country’s strategic orientation and economic prospects as well as for European Union unity. The votes inPortugalare still being counted, but far-rightChegais already spinning the election as proof ofthe death of Portugal’s longstanding bipartisan system. “We still don’t know if we will come in second or third place. What we do know is that the system is already shaking,” ​​said the Chega MP Pedro Pinto. He added: “Chega has definitively broken the bipartisan system in Portugal ​a​nd represents the great alternative for government in Portugal.​ This is a day that will mark history.​”",

    "article_text": "Portugal’s incumbent, centre-right Democratic Alliance (AD) has won the country’sthird snap general election in three years– but once again fallen well short of a majority – as the underperforming socialists were left vying for second place with the far-right Chega party, which took a record 22% of the vote. By midnight on Sunday, with 99% of the votes counted, the AD – led by the prime minister, Luís Montenegro – had won 32.1% of the vote and taken 86 seats in Portugal’s 230-seat assembly, leaving it far shy of the 116 needed for a majority. The Socialist party (PS) had taken 23.4% of the vote t0 Chega’s 22.6%, and the two were tied on 58 seats each. Votes from abroad, which will be counted in the coming days, could still put Chega in second place, which would be the first time in almost 40 years that the Socialists do not finish in the top two spots. In thelast election, held 14 months ago, the AD won 80 seats, the PS 78 and Chega 50. Despite not winning a majority, Montenegro told a crowd of supporters early on Monday he had received a clear and reinforced mandate from the Portuguese to govern. “The people want this government and this prime minister,” he said. Montenegro added that the Socialist party was apparently not inclined to negotiate any broad majority agreement, and that he was sticking to his promise of not having any deals with Chega. “Just let us work,” he said. Chega’s leader, André Ventura, said his party’s impressive showing at the polls – well up on the 18% of the vote it took last time round – had ended 50 years of conservative and socialist governments and “killed bipartisanship in Portugal”. “We didn’t win this election but we’ve made history,” he told a room packed with jubilant supporters, adding he believed his party would still finish second. But Chega’s elation will be tempered by Montenegro’s explicit refusal to strike any deals with Ventura’s party. “Governing with Chega is impossible for three reasons,” Montenegro has previously said. “It isn’t reliable in its thinking; it behaves like a political weathervane, always changing its mind, and it’s not suited to the exercise of government.” The small Liberal Initiative party – which could throw its weight behind Montenegro, bringing the AD around seven extra seats – has alsocategorically refusedto do anything that would help Chega into power. Despite the AD’s victory, Montenegro will face another fragmented and awkward legislature if invited to form a new government by the president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, while the Socialists will be carrying out grim postmortems into what went wrong. Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos said he was stepping down early on Monday and that he would not be a candidate when the party holds an internal ballot to elect a replacement. Marina Costa Lobo, a political scientist at the University of Lisbon, told Agence France-Presse that Chega was “the big winner of the night”. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion The early election was triggered in March after Montenegro used a confidence vote in his minority government to try to head offgrowing scrutiny relating to a data protection consultancythat he founded in 2021 and which he transferred to his wife and sons the following year. Faced with questions over possible conflicts of interest, the prime minister – who has denied any wrongdoing or ethical breaches – said he hoped the vote would “end the atmosphere of permanent insinuations and intrigues”. Buthe failed to win the confidence of MPs and a fresh election was called. The electoral campaign has focused onissues such as housing, public services and safety. Immigration – one of Chega’s priorities – has also risen up the agenda, and Montenegro’s caretaker government was recentlyaccused of pandering to the far rightafter it announced the expulsion of 18,000 irregular migrants earlier this month. Chega, which was formed six years ago, has sought to capitalise on widespread dissatisfaction with Portugal’s mainstream left and right parties as the country continues to suffer a housing crisis, soaring rental and property prices, stressed health and education systems, and an average monthly wage of €1,602 (£1,346). But Chega’s vows to clean up politics – and its hardline stance on immigration and people abusing the benefits system – have recently been undermined by the kind of corruption and sleaze scandals it has been railing against. In January, Ventura’s party expelled one of its MPs after he was accused of stealing suitcases at several airports. Another member of the party was caught drunk-driving the same month, while a third has been charged with paying for oral sex with an underage male who was 15 at the time. The Chega leader’s final few days of campaigning were alsointerrupted by ill health. After twice falling ill at rallies this week and receiving hospital treatment for oesophageal spasms caused by gastric reflux and high blood pressure, Ventura made a surprise appearance at his party’s final campaign event on Friday.",

    "article_text": "The pro-European centrist Rafał Trzaskowski and historian Karol Nawrocki, backed by the populist right, have each secured about 30% of the vote in a nail-bitingly close first round of Poland’s presidential election. The vote sets the stage for a runoff round in two weeks that will force voters to choose between starkly different visions of the country’s future. An exit poll by the Ipsos institute released as voting closed on Sunday, suggested Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw and candidate from the prime minister Donald Tusk’s Civic Coalition, had claimed 30.8% of the vote in the first round. Trailing him was Nawrocki, who has been endorsed by the Law and Justice party (PiS), with 29.1% of the vote. Trzaskowski had long been the favourite to win the election, but his lead over Nawrocki had narrowed in recent weeks. The exit poll, however, points to a first-round result that was closer than anticipated between the frontrunners, yielding a result that is likely to make Trzaskowski and Tusk nervous. Soon after the exit poll was released, Tusk reacted on social media. Everything was at stake now, he wrote, adding that “the next two weeks will decide the future” ofPoland. “Not one step back!”he said. The sentiment was echoed by former Polish president Aleksander Kwaśniewski. “The stakes are huge,” Kwaśniewski, whose term ran from 1995 to 2005 and includedPolandjoining Nato and the EU, told broadcaster TVP Info. “We are fighting for Poland to be on the side of European democracies, [otherwise] it’d be on the side of European troublemakers, those who want to go down the [Hungarian PM Viktor] Orbán or [Slovak PM Robert] Fico route.” The outgoing president,Andrzej Duda, is a close ally of the previous PiS government and a supporter of Donald Trump. He opposed the changes pursued by the new administration and blocked some decisions, including ambassadorial nominations. An opposition win would extend the current deadlock, prompting years of political instability. The official results of the first round, in which 13 candidates were vying to be elected as president, are expected on Monday or Tuesday. The two candidates will face off against each other in a runoff vote on 1 June, with voters asked to decide between Trzaskowski’s promises of reforming judicial institutions and rebuilding democratic institutions and Nawrocki’s admiration of Donald Trump, strong anti-migration rhetoric and pledges to crack down on “woke” liberal values. The supporters of Sławomir Mentzen, a libertarian far-right candidate who came in third place with 15.4% of the vote on Sunday, according to exit polls, could prove key to the second round. A Eurosceptic who is staunchly opposed to abortion and migrants, Mentzen had taken aim at the country’s 1 million Ukrainian refugees, accusing them of taking advantage of Poland. The high number of votes for Mentzen suggested he had benefited from frustrated votersseeking to breakthe country’s two-party hold on power. Speaking after the results were announced, Trzaskowski warned voters that Nawrocki was a “radical” politician and would cause even further disruption in the country’s heavily polarised politics. Meanwhile, Nawrocki made a direct appeal to third-placed Mentzen, urging him and his voters to help him “save Poland” and “stop Donald Tusk’s march to monocracy”. In another surprising turn, 6.2% of voters backed Grzegorz Braun, according to the exit poll, catapulting the lawmaker from the right-wing Confederation party into fourth place. Braun isunder investigationafter he used a fire extinguisher to put out Hanukah candles in the Polish parliament in a protest against the celebration of Jewish holidays and, two weeks ago, the European parliament voted to lift his immunity as a European lawmaker. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Trzaskowski has struggled to make inroads in rural areas, even as Nawrocki’ssupport has fallenas questions swirl over the circumstances in which he bought a flat from an elderly man, with suggestions that he failed to meet his obligations to provide care as part of the transaction. He has denied the allegations. If confirmed, the exit poll suggests that the radical right candidates did better than expected in the first round, while centrist and leftwing candidates did worse, said Ben Stanley, a political scientist at SWPS University in Warsaw. What this could mean for the second round, however, was unclear. “With this many candidates and 2 percentage point margins of error, there is still scope for the picture to change either way,” he said. The first round saw about 15% of votes cast for the centre-right Szymon Hołownia as well as the New Left’s Magdalena Biejat and hard-left Adrian Zandberg, meaning Trzaskowski is likely to spend some of the next two weeks trying to plan how to woo these very different groups of voters to back him in the second round. The vote for Poland’s next president, a position that shapes foreign policy and can be used to introduce and veto legislation,has been cast as a “make or break” momentfor the country’s pro-European coalition government. Led by Tusk, the coalition features an unwieldy mix of parties that span the political spectrum. Since taking power in late 2023 after eight years in which PiS was accused of eroding democratic checks and balances and becoming increasingly authoritarian, the coalition’s ability to follow through on promises such as reforming the justice system, liberalising abortion laws and introducing same-sex civil partnerships has been in part stymied by Duda. The stalemate loomed over the presidential election, turning the ballot into a question of whether voters wanted to carry through with the political overhaul that began in 2023 when PiS was ousted from power in the country’s parliament. “The stakes are enormous for the ruling coalition and for those concerned with the future of Polish democracy,” said Jacek Kucharczyk, president of the Institute of Public Affairs, a Warsaw thinktank. “This is about democratic reform and restoring the rule of law – and that can only happen with cooperation from the next president.” The sentiment was echoed by Tusk, who last month said the stakes were as high as they had been in the 2023 election. “It’s hard to govern alongside a hostile president, with all those vetoes,” he told parliament. The election was being closely watched across Europe. Bordering Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave, Belarus and war-torn Ukraine, Poland has been a key logistics hub for military aid to Ukraine and, under Tusk’s leadership, has been a key voice against Russia on Nato’s eastern flank. The election is also likely to prove pivotal for Law and Justice. “With Nawrocki as president, the government would be paralysed and that could eventually lead to the fall of the ruling coalition,” the political scientist Anna Materska-Sosnowska told AFP. It could mean “the return of the populists with renewed force” at the next general election, she added.",

    "title": "UK-EU talks ‘down to the wire’ as fishing and youth mobility hold up deal",
    "article_text": "Negotiations on a significant reset of the UK’s relationship with theEuropean Unionhave gone “down to the wire”, with fisheries and youth mobility among outstanding sticking points with hours to go before the start of a crucial summit. In scenes reminiscent of the Brexit talks, British officials were still trying to reach a compromise with their EU counterparts overnight, as Keir Starmer prepared to host the European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, in London on Monday. EU ambassadors, who were called to an unusual Sunday meeting in Brussels to discuss the summit, were told to be on standby for a further meeting early on Monday as the deal was not yet over the line. A UK government source said: “Negotiations are going down to the wire and a deal is not yet done. There are some outstanding issues on both sides and conversations will continue overnight.” No 10’s decision toissue a press statementon Saturday presenting the summit as a done deal caused irritation in Brussels, prompting some to recall the mantra of Brexit negotiations: “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.” One EU diplomat said: “The whole discussion is a package. We will not accept elements that are only at the advantage [or] request of the UK without strong guarantees and commitments on other issues of importance for the EU, such as fisheries, energy, youth mobility.” Nick Thomas-Symonds, the UK minister in charge of negotiations, said on Sunday that talks were in their “final hours”, but admitted key details of the deal were still being worked out. Nevertheless, a flagshipsecurity and defence partnershipmeans the UK could get access to a £125bn EU defence fund to rearm the continent, underlining the closeness of the security relationship with the bloc over the Ukraine conflict, in what could be a boost for British defence companies. The UK would be expected to contribute to the fund in return. Downing Street hopes the summit with von der Leyen and other Brussels chiefs will draw a line under the turbulentBrexityears and show that the UK has fundamentally changed. They believe the deal would be regarded as a “step towards” a deeper partnership with Europe. Ministers are ready for a big political offensive to explain the benefits of closer ties with the EU, amid some anxiety withinLabourover how Reform UK will respond. Both Nigel Farage and Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, have already described the deal as a “surrender”, despite not yet knowing the details, and have indicated they would tear it up if they came to power. Starmer is also facing pressure from within Labour, and from the progressive parties, to go further. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, urged the prime minister to be “bold and ambitious for our country” and ignore “dinosaurs fighting old battles”. Public attitudes towards Brexit have shifted significantly. Polls now suggesttwo-thirds of Britons back a closer relationship with the EU, and just 20% are opposed. Fishing remains a stumbling block to getting the deal over the line. The EU insists that the UK government offer long-term access to British waters, beyond the four-year deal proposed by the Starmer government, and instead is pushing for a double-digit extension. Brussels has linked fishing with an agreement to drop checks and bureaucracy around the sale of food, animal and other agricultural products, known as sanitary and phytosanitary goods. The EU has suggested this should be pegged to the same timescale as fish. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The two sides were also understood to be discussing the language on a youth mobility deal allowing 18- to 30-year-olds to travel more easily between Britain and the bloc, amid EU concern about quotas on numbers. UK ministers have talked about a “smart and controlled” scheme, suggesting it would have a cap and be time-limited, operating along the lines of the 13 existing deals Britain has with countries including Australia and Canada. The Conservatives have suggested it would involve a return to free movement “by the back door”. Other issues understood to remain on the table on Sunday night were tuition fees, with Brussels pushing for EU students in Britain to pay the domestic rate rather than the much higher international rate, as well as the fee levied on EU nationals for using the NHS. However, British holidaymakers are expected to faceshorter airport queues this summer. Negotiators are on the verge of striking an agreement for UK passport holders to use e-gates across Europe, rather than waiting in queues to have their passports stamped. There are plans to merge British and European emissions trading schemes, which the government says will reduce household bills and open up electricity trading with the continent. Starmer faces a political battle with Reform UK and the Tories over his deal. Badenoch has promised to tear up any agreement Starmer that crosses strict Brexiter red lines should she make it into office. Her pledge is unhelpful to Labour’s attempts to convince Brussels that the UK is now a reliable negotiating partner. The Lib Dems, meanwhile, have urged the government to join a new UK-EU customs union to boost trade with the bloc and boost growth. “The prime minister must ignore the dinosaurs fighting old battles, who want to drag us back to the destructive Brexit wars of the past, and focus on getting the best deal possible for the UK,” Davey said. The Scottish National party went further, arguing that there was not a deal available better than rejoining the EU, almost a decade after the UK voted to leave. Its Europe spokesperson, Stephen Gethins, added: “It is the biggest and the best growth strategy available and yet it is the only option the Labour party have turned their face against – all because they are running scared of Nigel Farage.”",

    "title": "Israeli army begins ‘extensive’ new ground operations in Gaza",
    "article_text": "The Israeli army has announced the start of a large-scale offensive in Gaza, describing “extensive ground operations” to seize “operational control” of swaths of the devastated Palestinian territory as a second day of indirect ceasefire talks in Qatar ended without any breakthrough. Israeli military officials said its forces had “eliminated dozens of terrorists, dismantled terrorist infrastructure sites … and [were] currently being deployed in key positions”. Rescuers and medical sources said as many as 130 people, including many women and children, were killed in a wave of Israeli strikes overnight and through Sunday on neighbourhoods in the north, centre and south ofGaza. Hours after the military announced it had launched the new ground operation, the prime minister’s office said Israel would allow some food into Gaza. “Israel will allow a basic amount of food for the population to ensure that a hunger crisis does not develop in the Gaza Strip,” Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said. Earlier on Sunday, Netanyahu signalled Israel was open to striking a deal withHamasthat involved “ending the fighting”, though the Israeli prime minister laid out conditions that have been repeatedly refused by the militant Islamist organisation. “Even at this very moment, the negotiation team in Doha is working to exhaust every possibility for a deal … which would include the release of all the hostages, the exile of Hamas terrorists and the disarmament of the Gaza Strip,” his office said in a statement. A Hamas official told Reuters that Israel’s position remained unchanged. “They want to release the [hostages] without a commitment to end the war,” the official said. In Gaza, medical officials said they could not cope with the casualties from the most recent strikes. “Hospitals are overwhelmed with the growing number of casualties, many are children, and … are struggling with shortages of medical supplies,” Khalil al-Deqran, the territory’s health ministry spokesperson, said. More than 48 people were killed in airstrikes in and around the southern city of Khan Younis, some of which hit houses and tents sheltering displaced people, according to medics at Nasser hospital, who said more than half of the dead were women and children. Fatima al-Rahal, 34, who has remained near her ruined home in the northern town of Beit Lahiya described a “nightmare”. “We can’t sleep at night from the intense fear. The sound of the bombing is terrifying … Our situation is worse than I can describe. It is truly catastrophic. We have nothing left but hope that this war will end as soon as possible,” Rahal told the Guardian. Basel al-Barawi, 46, fled Beit Lahiya with his family on Sunday after 10 relatives were killed. “Only a six-year-old girl survived, and she is now in the hospital. We started pulling them from under the rubble – their features were disfigured, their bodies covered in dirt, their clothes torn. Their skin had turned grey from the ash and dust. I felt my heart tearing apart as I carried them,” Barawi said. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry. Israel has accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, which the group denies. Hamas took about 250 hostages during its October 2023 attack on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Fifty-eight hostages are held by Hamas, most of whom are thought to be dead. The indirect talks in Qatar arereportedly focusing on securing a two-month truce, with Hamas freeing about half the 20 or so living hostages it is still holding. In return, Israel would release hundreds of Palestinians from its jails and end the total blockade it has placed on Gaza since early March. The US would offer strong guarantees to ensure talks about a permanent end to the war took place. However, sources on both sides said there had been no progress by late Sunday afternoon. In March, Israel refused to engage in talks about a second phase of a fragile two-month ceasefire that could have led to an end to the conflict and the release of the remaining hostages. It then cut off all supplies to Gaza and relaunched its air offensive. Netanyahu has been repeatedlyaccused of prolonging the warfor domestic political reasons – which he denies – and has frequently promised that Israel will continue to fight until Hamas is “crushed”. In Israel, Einav Zangauker, the mother of a hostage still held by Hamas, said Netanyahu was refusing to end the war because of his political interests. “The Israeli government still insists on only partial deals. They are deliberately tormenting us. Bring our children back already! All 58 of them,” Zangauker said in a post on X. Hamas, whichreleased a US-Israeli hostage last weekas a goodwill gesture before Donald Trump travelled to the Middle East for a four-day visit, has always insisted on a deal that definitively ends the war and leads to the withdrawal of Israel’s forces. It has also refused to disarm or to accept the exile of its leaders. Israel, which claims Hamas systematically loots aid to fund its military and other operations, has put forward a plan to distribute humanitarian assistance from a series of hubs in Gaza run by private contractors and protected by Israeli troops. The UShas backed the plan, which has been described as unworkable, dangerous and potentially unlawful by aid agencies because it could lead to the forced mass transfer of populations. Food security experts have warned that any delay will cost lives, and that cases of acute malnutrition, particularly among young children, are soaring. The massive new offensive, the recent strikes and the tight blockade imposed on Gaza in March by Israel have prompted a growing wave of international concern and anger. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, on Friday said the bombing campaign aimed at bringing about a “permanent demographic shift in Gaza” that was in “defiance of international law” and was equivalent to ethnic cleansing.",

Read our latest storyhere Here is the fuller statement from Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on the resumption of humanitarian aid into Gaza: “Israel will allow a basic amount of food for the population to ensure that a hunger crisis does not develop in the Gaza Strip.” Over the last year and a half, Israel’s deadly war on Gaza has killed over 53,000 Palestinians while leaving 2 million survivors forcibly displaced across the narrow strip amid severe food and aid shortages due to Israeli aid restrictions.

Arecent reportfrom the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification found that Palestinians living in Gaza face “a critical risk of famine”. Here’s a wrap-up of the day’s key events: Israel decided on Sunday to resume the entry of “basic quantity” of food into Gaza,Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said. “On the recommendation of the IDF and based on the operational need to enable the expansion of the military operation to defeat Hamas, Israel will allow a basic quantity of food to be brought in for the population in order to make certain that no starvation crisis develops in the Gaza Strip,” the prime minister’s office said. The Israeli military says it has begun extensive ground operations throughout northern and southern Gaza as part of a new assault on the territory.The Israeli ground forces are being supported by the county’s air force. At least 53,339 Palestinian people have been killed and 121,034 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Sunday.“There are still a number of victims under the rubble and on the roads,” the health ministry wrote in its latest update on Telegram. The World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that “we’re in a race against time to avoid famine” inGaza.Israel imposed a blockade on the devastated Palestinian territory in early March, cutting off all supplies including food, medicine, shelter and fuel in what has been condemned as the collective punishment of the civilian population in Gaza. Hamas official offers to release more hostages in exchange for ceasefire and 300 prisoners.A senior Hamas officialhas told CNN: “We agree to release seven to nine hostages in exchange for a two-month ceasefire and release of 300 prisoners.” Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has just indicated thatIsraelis open to a deal with Hamas that would include “ending the fighting” in Gaza.“Even at this very moment, the negotiation team in Doha is working to exhaust every possibility for a deal - whether according to the (US special envoy Steve) Witkoff framework or as part of ending the fighting, which would include the release of all the hostages, the exile of Hamas terrorists, and the disarmament of theGazaStrip,” his office said in a statement. The Israeli army has issued an evacuation order for several areas in Gaza ahead of what it is saying is an imminent attack.Addressing Gazans “in the Al-Qarara area, the Salqa municipality, and the south of Deir al-Balah, and the neighbourhoods of Al-Ja’farawi, Al-Suwar, Abu Hadab, and Al-Satar”, the army said: “This is a preliminary and final warning before the attack...

Such a crisis would endanger the continuation of Operation ‘Gideon’s Chariots’ to defeat Hamas. Israel will act to deny Hamas’s ability to take control of the distribution of humanitarian assistance in order to ensure that the assistance does not reach the Hamas terrorists.” Here is the fuller statement from Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on the resumption of humanitarian aid into Gaza: “Israel will allow a basic amount of food for the population to ensure that a hunger crisis does not develop in the Gaza Strip.” Over the last year and a half, Israel’s deadly war on Gaza has killed over 53,000 Palestinians while leaving 2 million survivors forcibly displaced across the narrow strip amid severe food and aid shortages due to Israeli aid restrictions.

Israel decided on Sunday to resume the entry of “basic quantity” of food into Gaza, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said, Reuters reports. Separately, Axios reporter Barak Ravid cited two senior Israeli officials on Sunday saying that the resumption of aid flow will come through existing channels until a new mechanism is implemented. Tens of thousands of anti-war demonstrators are protesting Israel’s deadly war in Gaza. Agence France-Presse reports: Tens of thousands of people turned out Sunday in The Hague to protest the Dutch government’s policy on Israel’s war onGaza. Many protesters dressed in red at the request of the organisers, Oxfam Novib, who wanted to symbolically trace a red line for Gaza. Rally participants pressed the Dutch government to take action against Israel, arguing that it is commiting “genocide” in Gaza. Organisers said more than 100,000 people took part, describing it as the largest demonstration in the country in 20 years. Police did not give an estimate. One demonstrator, 25-year-old Rick Timmermans accused the government of supplying parts for the F-35 warplanes Israel was using for strikes on Gaza. “Sometimes I’m ashamed of the government because it doesn’t want to set any limits,” said 59-year-old schoolteacher Jolanda Nio. Israel’s army announced “extensive ground operations” Sunday as part of its newly expanded campaign in the Gaza Strip, where rescuers reported dozens killed in a wave of Israeli strikes. The International Committee of Red Cross released a statement on Sunday, urging for the “immediate respect and protection of civilians by all parties during the increased military operations in Gaza”. “Entire families are trapped and are desperately seeking safety and security. The needs in Gaza are overwhelming and are beyond our capacity to respond,” the ICRC said amid Israel’s deadly bombardment of Gaza. “Constant care must be taken to spare them,” the group added. Layla Moran has told the UK government to match its tougher tone onIsraelwith action as she warned that people in Gaza face “unbearably cruel levels of destitution”. The Lib Dem MP called for further action, including recognition of a Palestinian state, in a renewed appeal for the family ofMohammad, an NHS doctorwho operated on her last year, whose elderly parents remain stuck in northern Gaza. He described conditions on the ground as a “slaughterhouse” and said people were on thebrink of starvation. The Guardian spoke to the pair last October when Mohammad’s parents were trapped in their home as drones stalked the streets outside. Shortly after, they were forced to flee whenit was bombed in a strike that killed his cousin and nephew. They have since returned, being among the lucky few in the neighbourhood to “have walls that remain standing”. For the full story, click here: A senior Hamas officialhas told CNN: “We agree to release seven to nine hostages in exchange for a two-month ceasefire and release of 300 prisoners.” One of the hostages who was released from Hamas captivity in February has been calling on the Israeli prime minister and defence minister to secure the release of another hostage,Alon Ohel,who he called his “brother”. “Bring my brother back,”Eliya Cohenwrote on Facebook, according to the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz. “This isn’t a game, it’s not politics – this is reality. Alon is wounded, alone, in a situation no one should endure. I’m asking you not as leaders but as human beings, do whatever is necessary to bring him home. Now there’s an option, we’re at a critical moment, if you managed to bring me home, I trust you can succeed in bringing back the rest.” Cohen was held with Ohel in Hamas tunnels. “I can’t stop thinking about Alon,” he wrote. “It’s been three months since I last saw him, and my heart is torn with longing, but it’s not just longing, it’s also fear. The last time I saw Alon, he was wounded. He wasn’t in good condition physically or mentally.” “The thought of what he’s going through there, without treatment and without someone to talk to, is inconceivable,” he added. “Alon also deserves to breathe clean air, Alon also deserves to walk without anyone reprimanding him for it, Alon also deserves to enter a pizzeria on the street and choose his own food, he also deserves to feel independent and free from worry.” The Israeli army has issued an evacuation order for several areas in Gaza ahead of what it is saying is an imminent attack. Addressing Gazans “in theAl-Qarara area, theSalqamunicipality, and thesouth of Deir al-Balah, and the neighbourhoods ofAl-Ja’farawi, Al-Suwar, Abu Hadab, andAl-Satar”, the army said: “This is a preliminary and final warning before the attack... For your safety, you must move immediately west to the known shelters inAl-Mawasi.” Protesters have been marching throughThe Haguein the Netherlands, demanding their government halt Israel’s campaign in Gaza, in what organisers are calling the country’s biggest demonstration in 20 years. According to the Associated Press, “tens of thousands” of peaceful protesters, clad in red, took part in the march. The crowd included elderly protesters and babies in prams. “We hope this is a wake-up call for the government,” said teacher Roos Lingbeek, attending the march with her husband and their 12-week-old daughter, Dido, who slept in a carrier as her parents brandished a sign simply reading: “STOP.” Here’s what the Gaza strip looks like today, from southern Israel: Reuters has some images of security personnel clashing with left-wing demonstrators during a protest demanding to end the war in Gaza, in Sderot, Israel. (See 5.04pm) An Israeli military chief has said he is planning to continue the IDF’s latest large-scale offensive in northern Gaza until “until we break the enemy’s combat capabilities and defeat it where we operate”. The IDF chief of staffHerzi Halevisaid the army would “allow the political leadership flexibility to advance any hostage deal”, according to the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz. The newspaper is also reporting that around 500 people in Israel have marched from the southern city ofSderottowards theGazaborder to protest against the expansion of Israeli’s military campaign in the territory. They carried signs showing images of children killed in Israeli airstrikes and wore shirts with messages like “Stop the atrocities in Gaza” emblazoned on them. Organisers warned that “within hours or days,Smotrich,Ben GvirandNetanyahuare planning to send tens of thousands of soldiers to occupy Gaza, starve more children, kill more Palestinian civilians, displace more families, and sacrifice the lives of the hostages and the security of us all to settle the Strip.” Two of the protestors were reportedly detained by police after attempting to block a junction. Nearly 65,000 people were uprooted from their homes in the Gaza strip between Thursday and Saturday, the Israeli newspaperHa’aretzis reporting. According to the newspaper, which has vowed to report critically on the war and“its dire consequences for all sides”, data from a coalition of international organisations which are monitoring population movement in Gaza indicates that at least 63,534 people have been displaced from their homes in the strip since Thursday. Thousands are reported to have been displaced from the northern areas ofJabaliyaandTel al-Zaatar– both locations where the Israeli military reportedly dropped leaflets on Friday, urging residents to evacuate. Airstrikes in Israel’s new offensive killed at least 103 people overnight, several news agencies are reporting. Medics and hospitals have told the Associated Press that the number of people killed is “at least 103”, including dozens of children, while Reuters is reporting “at least 130” fatalities. As reported earlier, the strikes appear to have forced northern Gaza’s main hospital, theIndonesian hospital, to close because of Israeli fire. Israel’s military had no immediate comment. Its statement announcing the ground operations said preliminary strikes over the past week killed dozens of militants and struck more than 670 targets. Israel blames civilian casualties on Hamas because the militant group operates from civilian areas. “Complete families were wiped off the civil registration record by [overnight] Israeli bombardment,” Khalil Al-Deqran, Gaza health ministry spokesperson, told Reuters by phone. “Hospitals are overwhelmed with a growing number of casualties, many are children,” he added. One of Israel’s overnight strikes hit a tent encampment housing displaced families in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, killing women and children, wounding dozens and setting tents ablaze, medics said. Staff atShifa hospital,Gaza’s largest, said they received 40 dead and dozens of wounded overnight and urged people to donate blood. The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said 75% of its ambulances could not run because of fuel shortages. It warned that within 72 hours, all vehicles may stop. “When the Jews want a truce, Hamas refuses, and when Hamas wants a truce, the Jews refuse it. Both sides agree to exterminate the Palestinian people,” Jabaliya resident Abu Mohammad Yassin told the Associated Press. He was among those interviewed by the news agency fleeing the new offensive on foot or in donkey carts. “For God’s sake, have mercy on us. We are tired of displacement.” The Israeli army says two projectiles were launched from the Gaza Strip, shortly after it announced it had commenced “extensive ground operations” across the besieged Palestinian territory. (See 14.46pm) The army said in a statement: “Following the sirens that sounded in Kissufim, two projectiles were identified crossing intoIsraelfrom the central Gaza Strip.” It said one was intercepted and the other fell in an open area. No injuries were reported. According to Agence France-Presse, Hamas’s armed wing claimed responsibility, saying the launches were linked to the new ground operation. The Israeli plan to expand its war on Gaza was denounced by the UN’s deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq who told journalists at a media briefing in New York in early May that it would “inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza”.",

They have since returned, being among the lucky few in the neighbourhood to “have walls that remain standing”. In recent weeks, the government has adopted a more critical tone against Israel. On Wednesday, the Middle East minister, Hamish Falconer,calledIsrael’s aid blockade “appalling”, “cruel” and “indefensible”, while the foreign secretary, David Lammy, said the UK was in talks with France andSaudi Arabiaover the recognition of a Palestinian state ahead of a conference in June. Moran said: “I remain frustrated that while the government’s words and tone have changed, in terms of concrete actions, not much has changed.” She called on the government to recognise a Palestinian state, which would “safeguard Palestinian interests and also send a very clear signal toIsraelthat there are consequences to their actions”. She also condemned the government for allowing trade from illegal settlements and for “still arming Israel when they shouldn’t be”. Moran said the plight of Mohammad’s family “reminds us that we have citizens of the United Kingdom that are being affected by what’s going on in northern Gaza”. Mohammad, who has worked for the health service for 20 years, grew up in the Jabaliya refugee camp. He is in regular contact with family members stuck in Gaza. “The entire population has been squeezed into around a couple of kilometres,” he said. “A very small area with no shelter, no food, nothing. It’s beyond description.” “People are really starving to death, because there’s nothing left. They haven’t seen proper food or aid for the past three months.” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion His brother-in-law called him on Saturday morning from northern Gaza, where Israeli rockets have rained down from the skies. Overnight,Israeli airstrikeskilled at least 100 people. Hunger and starvation are rife as the blockade imposed by Israel looks set to enter its 11th week. “Everything is destroyed there. In the first starvation wave, there was animal food that people used to dice. Now, there is none of that. You’re very lucky if you have a bit of flour to make some bread. “The bombs won’t be able to kill everyone, it’s the starvation that will,” he said. Mohammad said that when he calls his parents, they tell him: “We are OK, we are managing.” He is particularly concerned about their wellbeing. His mother has diabetes and hypertension and his father had his colon removed, leaving him frail. “[My brother-in-law] said, your dad doesn’t tell you because he doesn’t want you to worry you so much,” he said. “Anybody a bit vulnerable basically dies.” Mohammad has been told of the desperate conditions on the ground, describing “people dying of hunger and bombing” and those with infections or struck by missiles being unable to find treatment. “Anybody who gets wounded is so unlucky, because they die. There is no treatment, no medicine, nothing to offer them,” he said. His brother-in-law told him “there are people with no skin. The missiles they fire burn the skin off them. They tell you, ‘I wish I could die.’” He also described soaring prices for basic food and supplies including tents and sugar, adding that oil was being “sold in syringes in units of 5ml, 10ml or 20ml” to ration it out. Moran, who struck up a friendship with Mohammad while she recovered from surgery, said: “Starvation shouldn’t be a weapon of war and it is unbearably cruel that it’s got to the levels of destitution that Mohammad’s family are describing, but their story is just one of millions that are now trapped in northern Gaza in a situation that seems even worse than at the beginning. “It has to stop now and the UK government needs to redouble its efforts to make that happen.”",

    "title": "‘I pray this calm lasts’: fear lingers in Kashmir amid uneasy peace",
    "article_text": "Aweek after fleeing artillery fire from across the border, Rina Begum returned to find her home inKashmirdevastated. The walls were cracked, the roof crumbling, windows blown inward, and glass shards scattered across the floor, mingling with the ashes of her daughter’s books. The 45-year-old gazed out through a fractured window frame at the looming mountains. “Hell has been raining down from there,” she said. Begum lives in a hamlet near Uri, a town 60 miles (100km) north-west of Srinagar, the capital of Indian-administered Kashmir. The hamlet is perilouslyclose to the line of control,the heavily militarised de facto border dividing Kashmir between India and Pakistan. Tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours escalated into open military confrontation aftera militant attackon 22 April killed 25 tourists and a local guide in Pahalgam. India accused Pakistan of having “linkages” to the attack, without publicly presenting evidence. Pakistan denied any involvement. Soon after, artillery fire erupted across the disputed frontier. “It felt like my ears would burst from the explosions,” said Begum, who has witnessed previous skirmishes but described this as the most intense. “I thought we wouldn’t survive.” She managed to escape to a nearby town with her husband and six-year-old daughter. India and Pakistanhave fought over Kashmirsince gaining independence in 1947, each claiming the entire Himalayan region but controlling only parts of it. In Indian-administered Kashmir – a Muslim-majority territory – a popular uprising against Indian rule turned violent in the 1990s, with thousands of young men taking up arms to demand either a merger withPakistanor full independence. Most militant groups pledged allegiance to Pakistan, which provided training, arms and logistical support. India responded with a massive counterinsurgency campaign that reduced militant numbers from thousands to hundreds. Despite these operations, the insurgency has never been fully quelled and continues to fuel deadly attacks in Kashmir and mainlandIndia. This time, tensions escalated when India, in response to the attack on tourists, struck suspected militant sites inside Pakistan and in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, prompting retaliatory attacks from Pakistan over what it called violations of its territorial integrity. As the region inched closer to all-out conflict, both sideslaunched missiles at each other’s key military bases and airfields, and relentless shelling continued for days. The violence only subsided after Donald Trump announced an immediate ceasefire brokered by Washington. By then, dozens were dead. Kashmir bore the brunt, with approximately 50 civilians killed on both sides, tens of thousands displaced, and several residential areas reduced to rubble. India and Pakistan both claimed victory. But in Kashmir, fear lingers. Begum and her family returned reluctantly to their village to rebuild. While residents cherish the fragile peace, few believe it will endure. “I pray this calm lasts,” Begum said. “But these countries will never coexist peacefully unless their issues are resolved. It’s only a matter of time – weeks, months or years – before we’re caught in their war again.” This fear is echoed by many Kashmiris and observers, who say the circumstances leading to the confrontation remain unchanged. Two days after the Pahalgam attack, local police identified three gunmen and released sketches with a bounty of 2m rupees (about £19,000) on each. One was named as a local militant, and the others as Pakistanis. All remain at large. In his first address after the escalation, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, declared that India had only “paused” its military action and would “retaliate on its own terms”. India’s defence minister added that “any attack on Indian soil will be considered an act of war”. Experts say such statements increase the likelihood of future escalation, potentially playing into the hands of militant groups. “This statement is deeply unfortunate. It locks India into a mechanical response – meaning every terrorist act will lead to an attack on Pakistan,” said Ajai Sahni, a counter-terrorism expert based in India. “We must understand that many of these terrorists aim to provoke war between India and Pakistan.” In 2019, the Modi governmentunilaterally revoked Kashmir’s limited autonomy, splitting it into two union territories. A crackdown on dissent followed, alongside new laws that stripped local people of exclusive rights over land and jobs – stoking fears of demographic change. Modi justified the move as a step toward development and better security. Since then, Kashmir has been promoted as a peaceful tourist destination, with rising visitor numbers touted as evidence of normality. However, the Pahalgam attack exposed the fragility of that narrative. In fact, since 2019, the region has witnessed anew wave of attacks by highly trained militants, not only targeting government forces but Hindu minority communities, non-local labourers and Hindu pilgrims. Indian army and police sources told the Guardian that about 100 militants were active in India-administered Kashmir. Trained in sophisticated jungle warfare and equipped with modern communications, they pose a persistent challenge. Since India’s recent military operations, the threat of further attacks appears to have increased. Terrorist groups includingal-Qaida have reportedly issued new warningsagainst India and vowed to strike again. Pravin Sawhney, a prominent defence analyst and former military officer, said he believed India’s actions had done little to deter militants. He warned that the threshold for war between India and Pakistan was dangerously low, especially after the Modi government’s declaration that any future militant attack would be treated as an act of war. As drones and loitering munitions were seen during the recent flare-up, Sawhney said this could become normal. “The new normal is that whenever there is a terrorist attack and India responds, we’ll see drones, rockets and loitering ammunition fired across the border,” he said. “The point is that Kashmir is not peaceful or normal. It is a war zone. So if you bring tourists here, these attacks can happen anywhere, anytime. Security forces cannot be everywhere at once.” For ordinary Kashmiris, the situation feels increasingly helpless. On one side looms the constant threat of renewed violence; on the other, a harsh internal crackdown. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, hundreds have been detained. About 90 people – mostly young men – have been heldunder the Public Safety Act, a draconian law that allows detention without trial for up to two years.",

    "title": "Joe Biden diagnosed with ‘aggressive form’ of prostate cancer, his office says",
    "article_text": "Joe Biden, the former US president, has been diagnosed with an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, his personal office announced on Sunday. The 82-year-old was seen last week by doctors after urinary symptoms and aprostate nodulewere found. Biden and his family are considering options for treatment. “While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,” his office said. “The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.” Prostate cancers are given a score called a Gleason score that measures, on a scale of one to 10, how the cancerous cells look compared with normal cells. Biden’s office said his score was nine, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive. When prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it often spreads to the bones. Metastasised cancer is much harder to treat than localised cancer because it can be hard for drugs to reach all the tumours and completely root out the disease. However, when prostate cancers need hormones to grow, as in Biden’s case, they can be susceptible to treatment that deprives the tumors of hormones. Biden’s predecessor and successor, Donald Trump, expressed concern on behalf of him and first lady Melania Trump for his political rival. “Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis,” the presidentwrote on his Truth Social platform. “We extend our warmest and best wishes to [former first lady] Jill Biden and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.” The uncharacteristically gracious tone, and reference to Biden by his first name “Joe”, were reminiscent of the Democrat’s gesture of concern for “Donald” after last year’s attempted assassination of Trump. Kamala Harris, who served as Biden’s vice-president, wrote on X that she and husband Doug Emhoff were “saddened” to learn of the diagnosis. “Joe is a fighter – and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,” she added. Biden was the oldest president in history and his health was a dominant concern among voters. He had beaten an incumbentTrumpin the 2020 presidential election and initially sought a rematch with him last year. But, amid questions about his age and mental acuity, he dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris to succeed him. Trump, who is just three years younger than Biden, subsequently defeated Harris in November’s election and returned to the White House in January. Biden’s initial decision to seek re-election has come under renewed criticism ahead of Tuesday’spublication of Original Sin, a book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson that alleges a White House cover-up of the former president’s declining health and cognitive abilities. Based on interviews with more than 200 aides, insiders and members of Congress, the book contains accounts of losing his train of thought, struggling to remember names, incoherent speeches and failing to recognise celebrities such as George Clooney. Aides discussed the possibility of Bidenneeding a wheelchairif he won re-election due to the severity of his physical deterioration and the risk of falling. Just two days ago Trump mocked Biden for being “hapless and cognitively impaired” in the wake of leaked audio recordings from Biden’s 2023 interview with then special counsel Robert Hur, where he struggled to remember important events. But in recent media interviews Biden hascontinued to reject the ideathat he was too old to serve. Biden has dealt with cancer before. Prior to starting his presidency, he had several non-melanoma skin cancers surgically removed, and he had a cancerous lesion removed from his chest in February 2023. In the US, prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among men,according to the American Cancer Society. In 2022, Biden made a “cancer moonshot” one of his administration’s priorities, with the goal of halving the cancer death rate over the next 25 years. The initiative was a continuation of his work as vice-president to address a disease that had killed his older son, Beau. Biden has endured decades of adversity and tragedy in the public eye. Shortly after he was elected to the Senate in 1972, his wife, Neilia, and baby daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car crash. Before leaving office hepardonedHunter, whom Biden calls “my only living son”, on federal felony gun and tax convictions despite previously promising not to. As news of the cancer diagnosis spread, a chorus of politicians wished Biden a speedy recovery. Barack Obama, who developed a close relationship with Biden when the former was president and the latter vice-president, posted on social media: “Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family. Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace. We pray for a fast and full recovery.” Pete Buttigieg, who served as transportation secretary in his administration,wrote on X: “President Biden is a man of deep faith and extraordinary resilience. Chasten and I are keeping him, and the entire Biden family, in our prayers for strength and healing.” Gavin Newsom, the governor of California,posted: “Our hearts are with President Biden and his entire family right now. A man of dignity, strength, and compassion like his deserves to live a long and beautiful life. Sending strength, healing and prayers his way.” Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reporting",

    "title": "At least 28 people dead after storms and tornadoes strike three US states",
    "article_text": "Storm systemssweepingacross the midwest to the south left at least 28 dead in Missouri, Kentucky and Virginia. Kentucky’s governor, Andy Beshear, confirmed in asocial media postthat deaths in Kentucky had risen to 19 after the addition of a woman from Russell county. “Please join Britainy and me in praying for the families who are hurting right now,” the post read. The storms were part of a weather system on Friday that killed seven people inMissouriand two in northern Virginia and spawned more than two dozen tornadoes in Missouri, Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana. It left several hundred thousand customers without power in the Great Lakes region and brought a punishing heatwave to Texas. Meteorologists on Sunday predicted a fresh “multi-day” mix of dangerous weather conditions across the country’s midsection with heavy rains, thunderstorms and potential tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Authorities inKentuckysaid there were also severe injuries when a twister late on Friday tore across Laurel county, where there were 18 deaths. One death in Pulaski county was that of a fire department major who was fatally injured amid the response to the destructive weather. “The search is continuing in the damaged area for survivors,” the office of sheriff John Root said in a statement on social media. Gilbert Acciardo, a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office, said rescuers had “been on the ground all night looking for possible survivors. That’s what we’re continuing to do.” Beshear said his office would release more information as soon as it became available. “We know this is a tragic event.” In Laurel county, the tornado hit shortly before midnight. “Lives have been changed forever here tonight. This is a time we come together, and we pray for this community,” Randall Weddle, the mayor of London, told WKYT-TV. “I have never personally witnessed what I’ve witnessed here tonight. There’s a lot of devastation.” Severe storms were possible for Kentucky on Monday and even more so on Tuesday, the NWS said. In Missouri, the mayor of St Louis, Cara Spencer,confirmedfive deaths in her city and said more than 5,000 homes had been affected. “This is truly, truly devastating,” she said, adding that the city was in the process of declaring an emergency and an overnight curfew on Friday had been put into place in the neighborhoods with the most damage. The number of people injured was not immediately known. The Barnes-Jewish hospital received 20 to 30 patients from the storm with some in serious condition and most expected to be discharged by Friday night, according to hospital spokesperson Laura High. The St Louis children’s hospital received 15 patients with two of them expected to remain in the hospital into the weekend, she said. NWS radar indicated a tornado touched down between 2.30pm and 2.50pm in Clayton,Missouri, in the St Louis area. The apparent tornado touched down in the area of Forest Park, home to the St Louis zoo and the site of the 1904 World’s Fair and Olympic Games the same year. At the Centennial Christian church, St Louis fire department battalion chief William Pollihan told the Associated Press that three people had had to be rescued after part of the church crumbled. One of those people died. Stacy Clark said his mother-in-law, Patricia Penelton, had died in the church. He described her as a very active church volunteer who had many roles, including being part of the choir. Jeffrey Simmons Sr, who lives across from the church, heard an alert on his phone before the lights went out. “And next thing you know, a lot of noise, heavy wind,” he said. He and his brother sheltered in the basement. Later, he realized it had been worse than he’d thought, saying: “Everything was tore up.” Downed trees and stoplights also caused traffic gridlock during the Friday afternoon commute, and officials urged people to stay home. John Randle, a 19-year-old University of Missouri-St Louis student, said he and his girlfriend had been at the St Louis art museum during the storm and were hustled into the basement with about 150 other people. “You could see the doors flying open, tree branches flying by and people running,” he said. “A lot of people were caught outside.” Christy Childs, a St Louis zoo spokesperson, said in a text that the zoo would remain closed on Saturday due to downed trees and other damage. Childs said all animals were safe and that there were no reports of significant injuries to staff, guests or animals. A tornado struck in Scott county, about 130 miles (209km) south of St Louis, killing two people, injuring several others and destroying multiple homes, sheriff Derick Wheetley wrote on social media. The NWS confirmed a “large and extremely dangerous” tornado on Sunday afternoon near Mingus,Texas, about 70 miles (110km) west of Fort Worth. Significant damage but no immediate casualties were reported in Palo Pinto county, which includes Mingus, a sheriff’s office dispatcher said. Forecasters warned of hail the size of tennis balls in that area, and damaging hail elsewhere in parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and Nebraska. The storms hit after theTrump administrationmassivelycut staffingof NWS offices, with outside experts worrying abouthow it would affect warnings in disasterssuch as tornadoes.The office in Jackson, Kentucky, which was responsible for the area around London, Kentucky, had a March 2025 vacancy rate of 25%; the Louisville, Kentucky, weather service staff was down 29%; and the St Louis office was down 16%, according to calculations by weather service employees obtained by the Associated Press. The Louisville office was also without a permanent boss, the meteorologist in charge, as of March, according to the staffing data. Experts said any vacancy rate above 20% is a critical problem. Beshear said he had “big concerns” with the NWS cuts, but did not believe there were problems with alerts to residents in his state during the recent deadly storms. “I don’t see any evidence that it [affected] this one,” the Kentucky governor said.",

    "title": "Trump’s acceptance of Qatar jet gift is ‘definition of corruption’, senator says",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump’s acceptance of a$400m Boeing jetfromQataris the “definition of corruption”, a leading Democrat said on Sunday, as several senior Republicans joined in a bipartisan fusillade of criticism and concern over the luxury gift. Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator forConnecticut, condemned the “flying grift” on NBC’s Meet the Press as he assailed the president’strip to several Gulf statesthis week that included a stop in Qatar. “Why did he choose these three countries for his first major foreign trip? It’s not because these are our most important allies or the most important countries in the world,” he said of Trump’s visit to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia andQatar. “It’s because these are the three countries willing to pay him off. Every single one of these countries is giving Trump money, the plane from Qatar, an investment in his cryptocurrency scam from the UAE, and they are asking for national security concessions in return. “This is the definition of corruption. Foreign governments putting money in the president’s pocket and then the US giving them national security concessions that hurt our own security.” Rand Paul, a Republican US senator for Kentucky, and chair of his chamber’s homeland security committee, told ABC’s This Week that the gift of the jet “at least gives the appearance of a conflict of interest”. And Mike Pence, Trump’s vice-president during his first Oval Office term, said it was “inconsistent with our security” during an appearance on Meet the Press in which he pointed out Qatar had been previously accused of financing international terrorism. Trump has insisted hewould be “stupid”to refuse Qatar’s offer of the jet, which would serve as the new Air Force One before being donated to his presidential library upon his retirement. But the proposalenraged even close allies of the president, some calling it the opposite of Trump’s promise to drain the swamp – and “a stain on the administration”. Trump lashed out at critics on his Truth Social network on Saturday, claiming the gift was to the US and not personally for him. Murphy told NBC that was not true. “The plane is not a gift to the American people,” he said. “It is going directly toDonald Trump. “That library will take a decade to build, and so once he leaves the White House, until the library is built, he gets to use that plane to fly around all of his billionaire friends while his policies result in millions of Americans losing their healthcare and having to pay higher costs.” Pence said Trump should turn down the offer. “Qatar has a long history of playing both sides. They support Hamas,” he said. “They supported Al-Qaida. Qatar has actually financed pro-Hamas protests on American campuses across the US, so the very idea that we would accept an Air Force One from Qatar I think is inconsistent with our security, with our intelligence needs. “There are profound issues, the potential for intelligence gathering, the need to ensure the president is safe and secure as he travels around the world, and of course there are very real constitutional issues. The constitution prohibits public officials from accepting a present from a foreign state. “It’s just a bad idea and my hope is the president will think better of it.” Paul said he could see a way in which the gift would be acceptable – but that Trump had handled the offer poorly. “My fear is that it detracts from a largely successful trip where the president is talking about opening up and doing more trade with the Middle East,” he said. “I’ve been part of vetoing or trying to veto arms [sales] to Qatar, as well as to Saudi Arabia, over human rights abuses. So could it color the perception of the administration if they have a $400m plane to be more in favor of these things. It at least gives the appearance of a conflict of interest. I don’t think it’s worth the headache.”",

    "title": "Suspect identified in ‘intentional’ explosion at Palm Springs fertility clinic",
    "article_text": "FBI investigators have identified the person suspected ofdetonating a car bomboutside a Palm Springs,California, fertility clinic on Saturday – and dying in the process – as 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus. A bureau official said agents had determined Bartkus held “nihilistic views” before Saturday’s blast outside an American Reproductive Centers clinic, which also injured four other people. According tooutletsciting sourcesfamiliar with the matter, Bartkus is a resident of Twentynine Palms, home to a large marine base located about an hour away from Palm Springs. The sources added that Bartkus stated in writings or recordings that he was against bringing people into the world against their will, CBSreported. The New York Post, citing its own sources,reportedBartkus was a “pro-mortalist”. In aFacebook poston Sunday morning, the San Bernardino county sheriff’s department said there is law enforcement “occurring in Twentynine Palms”, which is “an FBI investigation related to the Palm Springs explosion”. “At this time, there are no known threats to the San Bernardino county region,” the sheriff’s office said. But the agency added: “Out of an abundance of caution, sheriff’s deputies will be conducting extra patrols at fertility centers located in our jurisdiction.” An FBI statement described the attacks as an “intentional act of terrorism”, adding that the clinic was deliberately targeted. But it declined to elaborate on how authorities had reached a conclusion on a motive. The bomb, which detonated before 11am, was either in or near a car parked outside the clinic when it exploded, said the Palm Springs mayor, Ron deHarte. Bartkus tried to record video or stream the blast, according to an officialspeakinganonymously to the Associated Press. Aerial images of the damage to the facilityshowedthe burned-out remains of a vehicle in a parking lot behind the clinic. Despite damage to the building, the ARC said its facility would be fully operational on Monday. The Desert Sun reported that the explosion could be felt as far as 2 miles (3km) away. Dr Maher Abdallah, who runs the ARC facility where the explosion happened, told the Associated Press in a phone interview that all of his staff were safe and accounted for. The explosion damaged the practice’s office space, where it conducts consultations with patients. But the blast did not harm the in vitro fertilization (IVF) lab and all of the stored embryos. In a statement on Facebook, the ARCsaid: “We are heartbroken to learn that this event claimed a life and caused injuries, and our deepest condolences go out to the individuals and families affected.” The ARC also said it appreciated “the incredible support from our patients and local community, as well as the swift action of Palm Springs police, fire, and emergency responders”. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom,wroteon X that he and his wife, Jen, “are keeping everyone affected in our hearts”. “The state is working closely with local and federal authorities as the investigation unfolds,” Newsom added. “Please avoid the area.” Meanwhile, US attorney general Pam Bondisaid“violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable”.

    "title": "Portuguese PM’s party set to win general election, fall short of majority",
    "article_text": "Portugal’s governing centre-right Democratic Alliance (AD) is poised to win the most votes in an early parliamentary election, but is short of a full majority, exit polls have shown, paving the way for more political instability in the country. Sunday’s election, thethird in as many years, was called just one year into the minority government’s term, after Prime Minister Luis Montenegro failed to win a parliamentary vote of confidence in March. Near complete official results showed that Montenegro’s AD captured 32.7 percent of the vote, with the Socialist Party (PS) and far-right Chega virtually tied in second place. That would boost the AD’s seat tally in the 230-seat parliament to 89, but still short of the 116 seats required for a governing majority. “The people want this government and this prime minister,” Montenegro told his cheering supporters after the results were announced. The Socialists obtained just about 50,000 votes more than Chega and fell to 58 seats from 78, a huge blow to one of Portugal’s two main parties. Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos said he would step down. Chega outperformed most opinion polls and took 58 seats, eight more than last year. Even with the backing of upstart business-friendly party Liberal Initiative (IL), which won nine seats, the AD would still need the support of Chega to pass legislation. But Montenegro, 52, a lawyer by profession, has refused any alliance with the anti-establishment party, saying it is “unreliable” and “not suited to governing”. Montenegro was forced to call a parliamentary election after the oppositionquestioned his integrityover the dealings of his family’s consultancy firm. He has denied any wrongdoing. The election, also dominated by issues such as housing and immigration, follows a decade of fragile governments. The only one of those governments to have a parliamentary majority collapsed halfway through its term last year. For the last half century, two parties have dominated politics in Portugal – with the Social Democrats, who head the DA, and the PS alternating in power. But public frustration with their record in government has fuelled the search for and growth of new alternatives in recent years. Political scientist Antonio Costa Pinto said the new parliament would likely be similar to the last, and it was impossible to predict how long the government would last, as it depended on factors ranging from the international situation to the AD’s ability to reach deals with other parties. “The only doubt is whether the AD will form a new minority government… or whether it will form a post-electoral coalition with IL, even if this coalition does not guarantee an absolute majority,” he said, referring to the pro-business Liberal Initiative (IL) party, according to Reuters. A second consecutive minority government in Portugal would dash hopes for an end to the worst spell of political instability in decades for the European Union country of 10.6 million people.",

    "article_text": "Rafal Trzaskowski from Poland’s governing centrist Civic Coalition (KO) is narrowly ahead of Karol Nawrocki, the candidate backed by the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, in the first round of thecountry’s presidential election, according to an exit poll. Sunday’s vote sets up a close battle to determine if the nation stays on a pro-European path or leans closer to admirers of United States President Donald Trump. Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of the Polish capital, Warsaw, placed first with 31.2 percent of the vote, ahead of Nawrocki, the candidate backed by the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, who had 29.7 percent, according to an Ipsos poll. The gap was much tighter than the 4 to 7 percentage points seen in opinion polls before the vote. If confirmed, the result would mean the two will go head-to-head in a run-off vote on June 1. Preliminary results are expected early on Monday. “We are going for victory. I said that it would be close, and it is close,” Trzaskowski told supporters. “There is a lot, a lot, of work ahead of us, and we need determination.” Nawrocki struck a defiant tone: “We must win these elections to prevent one political camp’s monopoly of power.” The campaign has largely revolved around foreign policy at a time of heightened security concerns in Poland, a key member of NATO and the European Union bordering war-torn Ukraine, and fears that the US’s commitment to European security could be wavering in the Trump era. Commenting on X, Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who has forged a pro-European track, said the next two weeks would decide the future of Poland. In Poland, the president has the power to veto laws. A Trzaskowski victory in the second round would enable Tusk’s government to implement an agenda that includes rolling back judicial changes introduced by PiS that critics say have undermined the independence of the courts. However, if Nawrocki wins, the impasse that has existed since Tusk became prime minister in 2023 would be set to continue. Until now, PiS-ally President Andrzej Duda has stymied Tusk’s efforts. If the exit poll is confirmed, other candidates in the first round – including Slawomir Mentzen from the far-right Confederation Party, Parliament Speaker Szymon Holownia of the centre-right Poland 2050, and Magdalena Biejat from the Left – will be eliminated. Trzaskowski has pledged to cement Poland’s role as a major player at the heart of Europe in contrast with PiS, which was frequently at odds with Brussels over rule-of-law concerns. Social issueshave also been a major theme on the campaign trail, with Nawrocki framing himself as a guardian of conservative values and Trzaskowski drawing support from liberal voters for his pledges to back abortion and LGBTQ rights. Wojciech Przybylski, the head of the Res Publica foundation, said the far-right’s strong showing “means that Trzaskowski can’t be absolutely sure of winning”. “The run-off result will depend on turnout and mobilisation among youths who voted for Mentzen” and leftist candidate Adrian Zandberg, he told AFP news agency.",

    "title": "Former US President Biden diagnosed with ‘aggressive’ prostate cancer",
    "article_text": "Former United States President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, his office has said. Biden, 82, was diagnosed on Friday after doctors discovered a prostate nodule, his office said in a statement released on Sunday. The former president was taken in for examination after experiencing “increasing urinary symptoms”, the statement said. “While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management,” his office said. “The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.” Biden’s age and health were key concerns among US voters during his time as president, and ultimately torpedoed his bid for a second term. After a haltingperformance in the first presidential debatein June 2024, Biden bowed to mounting pressure to end his re-election campaign. Biden’s Democratic Party then named then-Vice President Kamala Harris as its nominee in November’s presidential election, which she lost to Donald Trump. Trump, a fierce critic of Biden who continues to blame the former president for many of the US’s economic and foreign challenges, said on social media that he was saddened by the news and that he and the first lady “wish Joe a fast and successful recovery”. Harris said she and her family were keeping the Bidens in “our hearts and prayers”. “Joe is a fighter – and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,” Harris said. Former US President Barack Obama, whom Biden served under as vice president, extended his sympathies and hailed the veteran politician’s efforts to advance cancer research. “Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace,” Obama said. “We pray for a fast and full recovery.” Biden’s cancer diagnosis comes as his decision to run for re-election in 2024 is facing renewed scrutiny ahead of the publication of a book detailing the alleged efforts of his inner circle to conceal the then-president’s physical and mental deterioration from the public. Original Sin, written by CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios correspondent Alex Thompson, includes numerous damning accounts of Biden’s decline, including that the then-president was unable to recognise Hollywood actor George Clooney at a 2024 fundraiser and that aides privately discussed the possibility he would need to use a wheelchair if re-elected. In an appearance on ABC’s The View earlier this month, Biden pushed back on suggestions that he was suffering from serious cognitive decline towards the end of his presidency. “They are wrong. There’s nothing to sustain that,” Biden said. “The only reason I got out of the race is because I didn’t want to have a divided Democratic Party,” he added. On Sunday, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy became the latest in a growing group of Democrats to acknowledge that Biden should not have run for a second term. “It was a mistake for Democrats to not listen to the voters earlier and set up a process that would have gotten us in a position when we could’ve been more competitive that fall,” Murphy said on NBC News’s Meet the Press on Sunday, before Biden’s cancer diagnosis was made public. Doctors grade prostate cancer on a scale of 1 to 10 using what is known as the Gleason score. Biden’s cancer was given a grade of 9, according to his office, indicating it is among the most advanced kinds. While the five-year survival rate for prostate cancer is close to 100 percent for early-stage tumours, the average survival rate for advanced forms of the disease is 28 percent, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Metastasised cancer is more difficult to treat than localised cancer because it involves targeting tumours in different parts of the body, and they may respond differently to therapies. Biden lost a son, Beau Biden, in 2015, to brain cancer.",

Fears are growing for the future as major donor countries are set to reduce funding this year.

    "title": "Deadly blast rocks police station in eastern Syria, killing three: Report",
    "article_text": "At least three people have been killed in a blast targeting a police station in the eastern Syrian town of Al-Mayadeen, the SANA state news agency has reported, citing a security source. The explosion in the Deir az Zor countryside on Sunday also injured several people, the report said, without providing further details. A video verified by Al Jazeera’s fact-checking unit Sanad shows the aftermath of the explosion. The incident took place a day afterSyrian authorities said security forces killed threeISIL (ISIS) fighters and arrested four others in Aleppo. It was the first time the interim government announced such an operation against the armed group. The raids, launched by the General Security Department in coordination with the General Intelligence Directorate, targeted multiple ISIL sleeper cells operating across Aleppo, Syria’s Ministry of Interior said in a statement on Saturday. One security officer was killed in the operation, it said. Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who assumed power in Damascus in December, has long opposed ISIL. His forces battled the group’s self-declared caliphate during the Syrian war. Al-Sharaa seized power after his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham armed group led a lightning opposition offensive that toppled Syria’s longtime President Bashar al-Assad. Al-Sharaa cut ties with al-Qaeda in 2016. The recent operation comes just months after Syrian authorities said they had foiled an ISIL bombing plot near the Sayeda Zeinab shrine, a key pilgrimage site for Shia Muslims south of Damascus. This also comes after US President Donald Trump stunned the world by announcing on Tuesday that the United States was goingto lift sanctionson the country – a move thatSyrians hope will help their nation reintegrateinto the global economy, and bring much-needed investment.",

    "title": "Pro-EU candidate Nicusor Dan defeats hard-right rival in Romania election",
    "article_text": "Centrist Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, who has pledged to clamp down on corruption and staunchly supports both the European Union and NATO, has won thepresidential election in Romania. Official results from nearly all voting stations showed Dan garnering about 54 percent of ballots cast by voters on Sunday in the EU and NATO member country of about 19 million people, while Trump supporter George Simion was at 46 percent. Dan, 55, a soft-spoken mathematician, made a last-minute dash to the top in recent days after weeks of trailing Simion, a eurosceptic wanting to end military aid for Ukraine in its war with Russia. The election drew the highest percentage of voter turnout in a Romanian election in 25 years. Simion, who was the top vote-getter in the first round of the election two weeks ago, conceded after earlier saying he won the election. Speaking to private television station Digi24, Dan said he wanted a new coalition government to include all four centre-right and centre-left parliamentary parties. Dan, 55, had campaigned on a pledge to fight rampant corruption and keep Romania firmly within the European mainstream. Turnout was significantly higher in Sunday’s run-off and was thought to have played a decisive role in the outcome. The rerun of the election was held after the cancellation of November’s presidential vote plunged Romania into its worst political crisis in decades. The country’s political landscape was thrown into turmoil when a top courtannulled the previous election, in which far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped the first-round polls after allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow denied. Simion, a supporter of United States President Donald Trump, appeared alongside Georgescu at a Bucharest polling station on Sunday and told reporters that he voted against the “humiliations to which our sisters and brothers have been subjected”. The election captured a backlash against politicians taking inspiration from the right-wing populism of Trump’s Make American Great Again (MAGA) movement, Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at consultancy Eurasia Group, told Reuters. “This is a really strong result for the pro-European candidate,” Rahman said. “It’s another example of the positive Trump effect on European election cycles where concerns about the political and policy direction moving in a MAGA-like way have mobilised voters.” Earlier on Sunday, Romania’s government said it had detected a misinformation campaign bearing the “hallmarks of Russian interference” after the founder of the Telegram platform indicated that France had asked for Romanian conservative voices to be silenced. “During Romania’s ongoing presidential elections yet again we see the hallmarks of Russian interference,” Romania’s Foreign Ministry spokesman posted on X. Telegram founder Pavel Durov alleged interference by France in the Romanian election in a post on his channel. “A Western European government [guess which] approached Telegram, asking us to silence conservative voices in Romania ahead of today’s presidential elections. I flatly refused,” Durov said. The post did not name France but used an icon of a French baguette. France’s Foreign Ministry said it “categorically rejects these allegations and calls everyone to responsibility and respect for Romanian democracy”.",

    "article_text": "Russia has detained a Greek oil tanker sailing under the Liberian flag as it left the Estonian port of Sillamae on a previously agreed route through Russian waters, the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs says. In astatementpublished on Sunday, the ministry added that the vessel, the Green Admire, was undertaking a navigational route established in a deal between Russia, Estonia and Finland. The Baltic nation will redirect traffic to and from Sillamea exclusively through Estonian waters to prevent similar incidents in the future, it added. “Today’s incident shows that Russia continues to behave unpredictably,” Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said. “I have also informed our allies of the event,” he said, referring to other NATO members. Estonian Public Broadcasting (EPB), citing the Transport Administration, reported that the Greek tanker was carrying a cargo of shale oil destined for Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It added that such incidents had never occurred before. Vessels leaving Sillamae usually move through Russian waters to avoid Estonia’s shallows, which can be dangerous for larger tankers, the EPB said. The incident took place after the Estonian navy on Thursday tried to stop an unflagged tanker that was said to be part of a Russian “shadow fleet” of vessels sailing through Estonian waters. Russia responded by sending a fighter jet to escort the tanker, violating Estonia’s airspace. The “shadow fleet” is meant to help Moscow maintain its crude oil exports to avoid Western sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine.",

    "title": "Israeli strikes batter Gaza hospitals as brutal siege, bombing intensify",
    "article_text": "In its latest assault on Gaza’s decimated healthcare system,Israelhas once again targeted the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, this time with drones, as its forces are also carrying out a ground offensive in the north and south of the bombarded territory. Health officials said late on Sunday that fighting around the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza and an Israeli military “siege” forced it to shut down. It was the main medical facility in the north after Israeli air strikes last year also forced the Kamal Adwan and Beit Hanoon hospitals to stop providing health services. “There is direct targeting on the hospital including the intensive care unit,” Indonesian Hospital director Dr Marwan al-Sultan said in a statement, adding that no one could reach the facility, which had about 30 patients and 15 medical staff inside. Israel has repeatedly targeted hospitals during its 19-month war on Gaza. Human rights groups and United Nations-backed experts have accused Israel of systematically destroying Gaza’s healthcare system. Earlier, Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Hospital in the besieged enclave’s north, told Al Jazeera on Sunday that the latest strikes – which have been ongoing since Saturday – indicate that Israeli attacks on Gaza’s hospitals are intensifying. “The medical teams are really suffering, and we have a few numbers of medical teams and staff … and a lot of people are in need [of] more medical care,” Abu Salmiya said by phone from the hospital on Sunday. Thousands of sick and wounded people could die, he warned. Blood donations are urgently needed. This has been underscored by Gaza’s Health Ministry, which confirmed that Israeli forces besieged the facility in Beit Lahiya, adding that “a state of panic and confusion is prevailing”. The ministry later said that Israel had cut off the arrival of patients and staff, “effectively forcing the hospital out of service”. With “the shutdown of the Indonesian Hospital, all public hospitals in the North Gaza Governorate are now out of service”, it said. Gaza’s healthcare facilitieshave been targeted repeatedly throughout Israel’s deadly assault that began 18 months ago. Other facilities in the north that have been bombed, burned, and besieged by the Israeli military since the start of the war include Kamal Adwan Hospital, al-Shifa Hospital, al-Ahli Hospital, and al-Awda Hospital. Dozens of other medical clinics, stations, and vehicles have also come under attack. The targeting of health facilities, medical personnel and patients is considered a war crime under the 1949 Geneva Convention. Israel has also battered several hospitals in Gaza’s central and southern areas, including Deir el-Balah’s Al-Aqsa Hospital and the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis. Earlier this week, Israelstruck two hospitals in Khan Younis. Nine missiles slammed into and around the courtyard of the European Gaza Hospital, killing at least 16 people, while an attack on the Nasser Medical Complex killed two people, including a wounded journalist. Incessant attacks on Gaza’s healthcare sector have left it reeling, devastating its ability to function, while doctors say they are out of medicine to treat routine conditions. Hospitals have also been on the verge of total collapse amid a brutal and ongoing blockade, where Israel continues to bar the entry of much-needed medical supplies, fuel, and other humanitarian aid including food and clean water. The crisis in Gaza has reached one of its darkest periods, humanitarian officials warn, as famine also looms. Israeli air strikes have killed hundreds of Palestinians in the last 72 hours. Strikes over the weekend have also put the European Hospital, the only remaining facility providing cancer treatments in Gaza, out of service. Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said dozens of Palestinians have been wounded, and doctors say “they’re facing numerous challenges in treating injuries because of a lack of medical supplies”. “Israeli air strikes in Gaza are still escalating as drones and fighter jets hover in the sky,” Khoudary said. The death toll has reached the same level of intensity as the earliest days of the war, said Emily Tripp, executive director of Airwars, an independent group in London that tracks recent conflicts. She says preliminary data indicate the number of incidents where at least one person was killed or injured by Israeli fire hovered around 700 in April. It’s a figure comparable only to October or December 2023 – one of the heaviest periods of bombardment. In the last 10 days of March, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimates, an average of 100 children were killed or maimed by Israeli air strikes every day. Almost 3,000 of the estimated 53,000 killed by Israel since October 7, 2023, have lost their lives since Israel broke a fragile ceasefire on March 18, Gaza’s Health Ministry said. Among those killed in recent days include a volunteer pharmacist with the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, who was killed with her family in a strike on Gaza City on May 4. A midwife from Al Awda Health and Community Association was also killed with her family in another strike on May 7. A journalist working for Qatar-based television network Al Araby TV, along with 11 members of his family, was also killed.",

    "title": "South Korea’s presidential candidates hold first heated debate",
    "article_text": "South Korea’s two leading presidential candidates, Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, have held the first of three televised debates as the race intensifies to replace former President Yoon Suk-yeol, who was removed in April over his contentious move to declare martial law late last year. Yoon’s ouster has stoked political turmoil in the nation, and a snap election is set for June 3. During Sunday’s heated debate, Lee, who isthe main opposition Democratic Party’s candidate and the frontrunner in the race, faced criticism about being too friendly towards China from his opponents, who cited his comments that South Korea does not need to get involved in China-Taiwan disputes. But Lee, who considers pragmatism as key to his foreign policy, said the country “should not go all-in” on its alliance with traditional ally the United States and called for the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. He added that managing China and Russia relations was important, while noting that security cooperation with the US and Japan is necessary. Lee also advocated putting South Korea’s interests first in response to US tariffs, more investment in artificial intelligence (AI), protection for unionised workers, and a four-and-a-half-day working week. There was no need for Seoul to rush to reach a trade agreement with Washington, Lee said during the two-hour debate. South Korea has begun trade talks with the US and is seeking a waiver from the 25 percent tariffs that US President Donald Trump slapped on the country in April – after which Seoul was one of the first countries to hold face-to-face talks with Washington, following in the footsteps of Japan. “I think we should prepare well for this situation delicately and competently,” Lee added, also arguing that South Korea needs to nurture high-tech and renewable energy industries to overcome low economic growth. “We will focus on developing so-called sovereign AI so our people can at least use something like ChatGPT for free like an electronic calculator,” he said. Kim, candidate for the conservative People Power Party, vowed to create jobs and deregulate to foster businesses. Kim has also pledged to create a government agency dedicated to innovating regulations and to invest more than five percent of the budget in research and development. Asia’s fourth-largest economy contracted in the first quarter as exports and consumption stalled, amid fears over the impact of Washington’s aggressive tariffs and political turmoil at home. Lee holds a lead with 51 percent support in the latest Gallup Korea poll released on Friday, with Kim trailing far behind at 29 percent. Lee called earlier in the day for constitutional reform to allow a four-year, two-term presidency and a two-round system for presidential elections through a referendum. South Korean presidents currently serve a single five-year term. He also vowed to curb the presidential right to declare martial law and hold to account those responsible for the December 3 declaration. Former President Yoon had claimed at the time he declared martial law that antistate and North Korean forces had infiltrated the government. But senior military and police officials who were sent to shut down the country’s National Assembly have testified that he ordered them to detain rival politicians and prevent the assembly from voting to lift his military rule order.",

    "title": "Verstappen wins F1 Emilia-Romagna GP to close gap on McLaren duo",
    "article_text": "Max Verstappen has given his Formula 1 title defence a big boost with victory at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix after a daring overtake on standings leader Oscar Piastri at the start. The Dutch driver built a commanding lead on Sunday that was wiped out when the safety car bundled the field back up. He still held on to win ahead of Lando Norris, who overtook his McLaren teammate Piastri for second with five laps remaining. Verstappen took his second win of the season and first since last month’s Japanese Grand Prix and denied Piastri – who finished third – what would have been his fourth victory in a row. Verstappen praised his Red Bull team’s “fantastic execution all round” as the team marked its 400th F1 race with a win. “The start itself wasn’t particularly great, but I was still on the outside line, or basically the normal [racing] line, and I was like, ‘Well, I’m just going to try and send it round the outside,’ and it worked really well,” Verstappen said of his crucial overtake. “That, of course, unleashed our pace because once we were in the lead, the car was good.” Norris’s late-race move on Piastri was almost a copy of Verstappen’s although Norris had the advantage of being on fresher tyres than his teammate. “We had a good little battle at the end between Oscar and myself, which is always tense but always good fun,” Norris said, admitting that Verstappen and Red Bull were “too good for us today”. Piastri’s lead over Norris in the standings was cut to 13 points. Verstappen rounds out the top three at nine points behind Norris. Lewis Hamilton recovered from 12th on the grid to finish fourth in his first race for Ferrari in Italy. Hamilton profited from a late-race fight between his teammate Charles Leclerc and Alex Albon of Williams. Albon complained Leclerc had pushed him off the track as they battled for fourth, and Hamilton passed both drivers before Ferrari eventually asked Leclerc to yield fifth to Albon. George Russell was seventh for Mercedes, ahead of Carlos Sainz Jr in the second Williams. Isack Hadjar was ninth for Racing Bulls, and Verstappen’s Red Bull teammate Yuki Tsunoda was 10th after starting last following a crash in qualifying. Overtaking was expected to be rare in what could be F1’s last race for the foreseeable future at Imola. Instead, the Italian fans were treated to Verstappen’s spectacular move at the start and plenty of other overtakes. The narrow, bumpy Imola track has been a favourite among drivers, who have relished its old-school challenge since it returned to the F1 schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, its status as Italy’s second race – only the United States also hosts more than one – makes its position vulnerable. “If we don’t come back here, it is going to be a shame,” Piastri said on Saturday. Sunday’s race was the last under Imola’s current contract, and while it isn’t officially goodbye yet, there has been no word about next year.",

    "title": "EU, UK leaders speak with Trump before his Putin call as Ukraine hit",
    "article_text": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has discussed the war in Ukraine with leaders of the United States, Italy, France and Germany, a 10 Downing Street spokesperson has said, in advance of US President Donald Trump’splanned callwith his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on Monday. The flurry of diplomacy comes shortly after inconclusive direct Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul, Turkiye on Friday. The leaders discussed the need for an unconditional ceasefire and for Putin to take peace talks seriously, the spokesperson said late on Sunday, adding that they also raised the use of sanctions if Russia failed to engage seriously in a ceasefire and concerted peace talks. In remarks to reporters earlier on Sunday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he discussed the issue with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio while the two men were attending the inaugural mass of Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican. Merz said he also spoke at length at the Vatican with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “I spoke with Marco Rubio, including about the call tomorrow. We agreed that we will speak again with the four state leaders and the US president in preparation of this conversation [with Putin],” Merz said. Trump said he planned to speak to Putin and Zelenskyy to discuss ways to stop the war’s “bloodbath”. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed to Russian news agencies that preparations were under way for a conversation between Putin and Trump. The talks in the Turkish city of Istanbul on Friday were the first time the sides had heldface-to-face talkssince March 2022, weeks after Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour. The brief talks yielded only an agreement to swap 1,000 prisoners of war, according to the heads of both delegations, in what would be their biggest such exchange since the war began. A senior Ukrainian official familiar with the talks said Russian negotiators demanded Ukraine pull its troops out of all Ukrainian regions claimed by Moscow before they would agree to a ceasefire. That is a red line for Ukraine, and as it stands, Russia does not have full control in those regions. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy met US Vice President JD Vance and Rubio on the sidelines of the papal inauguration, according to a source in the Ukrainian delegation. It was the first meeting between Zelenskyy and Vance since they publicly clashed during talks at the White House in February over the future of the war in Ukraine. In the meantime, Ukraine has claimed Russia is planning to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile late on Sunday to intimidate it and its Western allies. Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, GUR, said Russia was planning to conduct a “training and combat” launch of the missile. GUR said in a statement on the Telegram app that the launch was ordered to be implemented from Russia’s Sverdlovsk region, adding that the flight range for the missile was more than 10,000km (6,200 miles). Ukraine on Sunday also said Russia had launched a record number of drones overnight, targeting various regions, including that of the capital, where a woman was killed. Its air force said Russia launched “273 Shahed attack drones and various types of imitator drones”, of which 88 were destroyed and 128 went astray, “without negative consequences”. Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said it was a “record” number of drones. “Russia has a clear goal – to continue killing civilians,” she said. Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from Kyiv, said overnight, “air raid sirens began, and they went on for nearly nine hours”. “We see these massive drone strikes and we see crowds of people seeking shelter, seeking safety, in those deep underground subway stations in the capital and in other areas of the country, once again,” Basravi said. The Russian military said it intercepted 25 Ukrainian drones overnight and on Sunday morning. It also claimed it had captured Bahatyr, another village in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, as it intensifies the war effort despite the talks. Russia’s overnight drone attacks were roundly condemned by Ukrainian officials. Zelenskyy reiterated his call for stronger sanctions on Moscow after a Russian drone killed nine bus passengers in the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine on Saturday. “This was a deliberate killing of civilians,” he said. “Pressure must be exerted on Russia to stop the killings. Without tougher sanctions, without stronger pressure, Russia will not seek real diplomacy.” Russia, which denies targeting civilians, said it struck a military target in Sumy. Its Ministry of Defence claimed another settlement was captured in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskyy’s top aide, Andriy Yermak, also decried the attacks. “For Russia, the negotiations in Istanbul are just a pretence. Putin wants war,” Yermak said. In an interview with Russian state TV, Putin said Moscow’s aim was to “eliminate the causes that triggered this crisis, create the conditions for a lasting peace and guarantee Russia’s security”, without elaborating further. Russia’s references to the “root causes” of the conflict typically refer to alleged grievances with Kyiv and the West that Moscow has put forward as justification for launching the invasion in February 2022. They include pledges to “de-Nazify” and demilitarise Ukraine, protect Russian speakers in the country’s east, push back against NATO expansion and stop Ukraine’s westward geopolitical drift. Ukraine and the West have rejected all of these reasons, saying Russia’s offensive is nothing more than an imperial-style land grab. Tens of thousands have been killed since Russia started the war, with millions forced to flee their homes. Putin said the Russian army, which occupies about 20 percent of Ukraine, had the “troops and means required” to achieve its goals. The US Department of State said in a statement that Rubio and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, spoke with each other on Saturday. During the call, Rubio welcomed the prisoner exchange agreement reached in Istanbul, the department’s spokesperson said. Ukraine’s top negotiator, Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, said the “next step” would be a meeting between the two warring presidents. Russia said it had taken note of the request, but added that the swap of prisoners of war had to be completed first, and both sides then needed to present their visions for a ceasefire before the next round of negotiations could be arranged.",

    "article_text": "The US-Israeli plan to get humanitarian aid into Gaza, amid the use of starvation as a weapon of war, enables Israel to “force the ethnic cleansing of a huge part of Gaza’s population”, argues Matt Duss, the executive vice president of the Center for International Policy. United States President Donald Trump visited the Middle East, which saw a shift in US policy on Yemen, Iran, and Syria. Duss tells host Steve Clemons that the Democratic Party would be wise to learn from Trump’s foreign policy. “The Democrats have completely left the antiwar, pro-diplomacy, pro-peace lane open for Donald Trump to fill,” he says.",

    "title": "Pope Leo XIV meets Ukraine’s Zelenskyy after his inaugural Mass",
    "article_text": "Pope Leo XIV has met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after his inaugural Mass in the Vatican, where he delivered a message of love and unity to a crowd of 200,000 pilgrims. “We thank the Vatican for its willingness to serve as a platform for direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. We are ready for dialogue in any format for the sake of tangible results. We appreciate the support for Ukraine and the clear voice in defense of a just and lasting peace,” Zelenskyy posted on X. No statement has been issued by the Vatican yet regarding Sunday’s meeting. Leo, formerly CardinalRobert Prevost, was officially installed as the head of the Catholic Church at an outdoor Mass in St Peter’s Square with world leaders and European royalty in attendance. In his sermon, Leo,the first American pope, called for unity within the church, saying he wanted it to act as a force for peace in the world. “I would like that our first great desire be for a united church, a sign of unity and communion, which becomes a leaven for a reconciled world,” he said. “In this our time, we still see too much discord, too many wounds caused by hatred, violence, prejudice, the fear of difference and an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth’s resources and marginalises the poorest.” Leo said he was assuming the role as leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Roman Catholics “with fear and trembling” and insisted he would not lead like “an autocrat”. “It is never a question of capturing others by force, by religious propaganda or by means of power. Instead, it is always and only a question of loving, as Jesus did,” he said, in an apparent nod to the split between conservative and liberal factions within the church. The 69-year-old pope, who was born in Chicago and spent years as a missionary in Peru, succeeds the late Pope Francis, whose 12-year tenure was marked by tensions with traditionalists within the church. In an apparent nod to conservatives, Leo said he was committed to protecting “the rich heritage of the Christian faith” and repeatedly used the words “unity” and “harmony”. Before the ceremony, Leo took his first popemobile ride through St Peter’s Square, waving to crowds cheering, “Viva il Papa.” Dignitaries in attendance included the presidents of Israel, Peru and Nigeria; the prime ministers of Italy, Canada and Australia; German Chancellor Friedrich Merz; and Spain’s King Felipe and Queen Letizia. The United States delegation was led by Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic who had clashed with Francis over the White House’s approach to immigration. Vance shook hands with Zelenskyy at the start of the ceremony, in contrast to the previous meeting between the two men and President Donald Trump in afiery encounterin front of the world’s media at the White House in February. Leo prayed for the victims of the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza in his sermon, saying Ukraine was being “martyred” and lamenting that Palestinians were being “reduced to starvation”.",

In August 2023, Indiabecamejust the fourth nation to land an unmanned craft on the moon after Russia, the United States and China. Since then, ISRO’s ambitions have continued to grow. Its first attempt to land on the moon failed in 2019. So far, ISRO has recorded three setbacks in PSLV missions, including Sunday’s. The first failure was in 1993. On Sunday, Narayanan said ISRO would study the performance and provide details on what went wrong at a later stage. According to local media reports, a Failure Analysis Committee will also be set up to investigate the space agency’s latest setback.",

    "title": "At least 13 reported killed in suicide bomb blast in Somalia’s Mogadishu",
    "article_text": "Several people have been reported killed in a suicide bombing at an army recruitment centre in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu. The attacker on Sunday targeted a queue of young recruits lining up outside the Damanyo base, killing at least 13 people, the Associated Press news agency quoted witnesses as saying. “There was a loud explosion, and immediately people began running in all directions. Bodies were everywhere,” said Abdulkadir Hassan Mohamed, a tuk-tuk driver who witnessed the blast told AP. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Teenagers were lining up at the base’s gate when the suicide bomber detonated the explosives, witnesses told Reuters. Abdisalan Mohamed said he had seen “hundreds of teenagers at the gate as we passed by in a bus”. “Abruptly, a deafening blast occurred, and the area was covered by dense smoke. We could not see the details of casualties,” he added. A military captain who gave his name as Suleiman described the attack as he had seen it unfold. Dozens of abandoned shoes and the remains of the suicide bomber remained visible at the scene. Medical staff at the military hospital told Reuters they had received 30 wounded people from the blast and six of them had died immediately. Separately, an official told the Anadolu news agency that the attack had killed at least 11 people. The government has cordoned off the area. The attack echoed a similar incident in 2023 when a suicide bomber killed 25 soldiers at the Jale Siyad base, located opposite the Damanyo facility. Sunday’s attack follows the assassination on Saturday of Colonel Abdirahmaan Hujaale, commander of Battalion 26, in the Hiiran region amid local reports of the al-Shabab armed group’s infiltration into government and security forces. Al-Shabab has been fighting the Somali government for nearly two decades and frequently targets government officials and military personnel.",

    "title": "Indian professor arrested over social media post on military operation",
    "article_text": "A professor from an elite, private liberal-arts university in India has been arrested for a social media post about news briefings on the military operation against Pakistan more than a week after the two nuclear-armed neighbours agreed to aceasefire, according to local media reports. Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an associate professor with the Department of Political Science at Ashoka University, was arrested on Sunday under sections of the criminal code pertaining to acts prejudicial to maintaining communal harmony, incitement of armed rebellion or subversive activities, and insults of religious beliefs. A police official told the Indian Express newspaper that Mahmudabad, 42, was arrested in the capital, New Delhi, 60km (37 miles) south of the university, located in Sonepat in Haryana state. Areportby the online publication Scroll.in on Sunday quoted Mahmudabad’s lawyer as saying the case against him was filed on Saturday based on a complaint by Yogesh Jatheri, general secretary of the youth wing of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana. The arrest was made days after the Haryana State Commission for Women summoned Mahmudabad for his comments on the daily briefings on India’s military operation in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Colonel Sofiya Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh from the Indian armed forces held media briefings on Operation Sindoor,launchedon May 6. In aFacebook poston May 8, Mahmudabad hadsaid: “I am very happy to see so many right wing commentators applauding Colonel Sophia Qureishi but perhaps they could also equally loudly demand that the victims of mob lynchings, arbitrary bulldozing and others who are victims of the BJP’s hate mongering be protected as Indian citizens. “The optics of two women soldiers presenting their findings is importantly but optics must translate to reality on the ground otherwise it’s just hypocrisy.” The post referred to Qureishi, a Muslim officer in the Indian army, and attacks against Muslims, including lynchings and destruction of their houses without due process. According to local media reports, the Haryana Women’s Commission on Monday said the professor’s statement “disparaged women officers in the Indian Armed Forces and promoted communal disharmony” and summoned him. Mahmudabad has defended his comments and said on X that they had been misunderstood. “If anything, my entire comments were about safeguarding the lives of both citizens and soldiers. Furthermore, there is nothing remotely misogynistic about my comments that could be construed as anti-women,” he said. In February last year, the human rights group Amnesty International urged the government to stop “unjust targeted demolition of Muslim properties”. “The unlawful demolition of Muslim properties by the Indian authorities, peddled as ‘bulldozer justice’ by political leaders and media, is cruel and appalling. Such displacement and dispossession is deeply unjust, unlawful and discriminatory. They are destroying families – and must stop immediately,” said Agnes Callamard, Amnesty’s secretary-general. “The authorities have repeatedly undermined the rule of law, destroying homes, businesses or places of worship, through targeted campaigns of hate, harassment, violence and the weaponization of JCB bulldozers. These human rights abuses must be urgently addressed,” she said in astatement. India’s Supreme Court has ordered ahaltto so-called bulldozer justice, but that has not stopped authorities from disregarding due process. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the BJP has also been accused of allowing far-right Hindu vigilante groups to act with impunity. They have lynched Muslims and tried to police interfaith relations. Modi has spoken against cow vigilante killings, but his government has done little to stop the activities of vigilante groups. My statement re the summons that I received from the Haryana State Women’s Commission. The posts that were misunderstood and objected to can be accessed on my Facebook page.pic.twitter.com/U4rZrAXhFx — Ali Khan Mahmudabad (@Mahmudabad)May 14, 2025 Professors and activists across the country have shown their support for Mahmudabad. An open letter with about 1,200 signatories released on Fridaysaid: “It is clear that Prof Khan praised the strategic restraint of the armed forces, analysed how any distinction between the terrorists or non-state actors and the Pakistani military has now collapsed, and said that the optics of the women officers chosen for media debriefs was ‘important’ as proof that the secular vision of the founders of our Republic is still alive.” The truce between India and Pakistan, announced on May 10, halted several days of missile and drone attacks across their shared border. Pakistan said at least 31 people were killed in India’s strikes while India said at least 15 people were killed in Pakistan’s counterattacks.",

    "title": "Portugal holds its third elections in three years",
    "article_text": "Voting is under way in a general election in Portugal – its third vote in as many years – with immigration and the cost of living crisis the biggest talking points during the campaign. Sunday’ssnap electionswere called after Prime Minister Luis Montenegro, who leads the centre-right Democratic Alliance, lost a parliamentaryvote of confidencein March, just a year into hisminority government’s term. Montenegro called the vote in response to accusations of conflicts of interest over the activities of his family’s consulting firm. He denied any wrongdoing. Despite the controversy, opinion polls suggested the Democratic Alliance is set to win the most votes ahead of its main rival, the centre-left Socialist Party, and potentially pick up extra seats. But Montenegro’s party is predicted to fall short again of the 116 seats needed for a majority in parliament. Polls indicated the far-right Chega party – which opposes immigration, abortion and LGBTQ rights – is to finish in third place, giving it a possible kingmaker role. But Montenegro has ruled out working with Chega, which won 50 seats in last year’s elections. The economy, immigration and Portugal’s housing crisis were major issues on the campaign trail while Montenegro appealed directly to voters to give him a strong mandate to end the political instability. “We have to do our part at home, and we have to be part of the solutions abroad, in Europe and in the world. And for that, we need a strong government,” he told a rally in Lisbon on Friday. Shortly after voting on Sunday, he told reporters that he was confident the country could achieve stable governance. “There is a search for a stable solution, but that will now depend on [people’s] choices,” he said.",

    "title": "Trump’s tariffs are failing, but the old model won’t save us either",
    "article_text": "On May 12, the United States and Chinaannouncedthat they are putting reciprocal tariffs on pause for 90 days. Some tariffs will be retained while trade negotiations continue, a joint statement said. This is yet another reversal of the sweeping tariffs US President Donald Trump imposed in early April that destabilised the global economy and sent stock markets into freefall. Although he claimed that his measures would make the US economy “boom”, it was clear from the start that they would not work. A trade war cannot improve the lot of American workers, nor bring back manufacturing into the country. Now spooked by corporations slashing profit targets and reports of the US gross domestic product (GDP) shrinking, the Trump administration appears to be walking back on its strategy. But going back to economic liberalism under the guise of “stability” is not the right course of action. The current global economic system, distorted by policies favouring the rich sustained over decades, has proven itself to be unsustainable. That is why we need a new world economic order that promotes inclusive and sustainable development across both the Global North and South and addresses global socioeconomic challenges. The troubles that economies around the world currently face are the result of policies the elites of the Global North imposed over the past 80 years. In its original Keynesian vision, the economic order put forward by the Allied Powers after World War II aimed to combine trade, labour, and development best practices to foster inclusive growth. However, over the following few decades, corporate opposition in the US and Britain derailed this order, replacing it with a skewed system centred around the Global North’s chief economic instruments, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, both created in 1944. In the 1970s, economic elites blamed rising inflation and stagnation not on temporary shocks like the oil crisis but on what they saw as excessive concessions to organised labour: government overspending, strong unions, and heavy regulation. Subsequently, they launched an institutional counter-revolution against the Keynesian model of power sharing and social compromise. This counter-revolution took shape in the 1980s under US President Ronald Reagan and UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who aggressively pursued policies to restore corporate profitability. They slashed taxes on the wealthy, liberalised international capital flows that made it easier to relocate production to low-cost economies, deregulated the financial sector, weakened labour unions, and privatised public services. As a result, outsourcing of labour, tax evasion, real estate speculation, financialisation, and credit-fuelled bubbles became US corporations’ dominant ways of making profit. In developing countries, the IMF, the World Bank and regional development banks pushed governments to cut public spending, privatise state-owned enterprises, remove trade barriers, and deregulate markets rapidly and with little regard for social consequences. As a result, the 1980s and 90s became lost decades for many countries embracing globalisation through radical liberalisation. These policies triggered massive employment shocks, rising inequalities, skyrocketing debt and persistent financial turbulence from Mexico to Russia. East Asian economies were the exceptions, as they learned to circumvent the straitjacket of liberal globalisation and joined the global economy on their own terms. The biggest beneficiaries of this system were Western economic elites, as corporations profited from low-cost production abroad and domestic deregulation at home. The same cannot be said for Western workers, who faced stagnating real wages, eroded labour protections, and increasing economic insecurity under the pressure of competitiveness, relocation, and automation. For those of us who studied the post-war economic order, it was apparent that without correcting the pitfalls of liberal globalism, a nationalist, illiberal counter-revolution was coming. We saw its signs early on in Europe, where illiberal populists rose to prominence, gaining a foothold first in the periphery and then gradually scaling up to become Europe’s most disruptive force. In the countries where they gained power, they pursued policies superficially resembling developmentalism. Yet, instead of achieving genuine structural transformation, they fostered oligarchies dominated by politically connected elites. Instead of development, they delivered rent-seeking and resource extraction without boosting productivity or innovation. Trump’s economic policies follow a similar path of economic populism and nationalistic rhetoric. Just like illiberal economic policies failed in Europe, his tariffs were never going to magically reindustrialise the US or end working-class suffering. If anything, tariffs – or now the threat of imposing them – will accelerate China’s competitive edge by pushing it to deepen domestic supply chains, foster regional cooperation, and reduce reliance on Western markets. In the US, the illiberal response will drag labour standards down, eroding real wages through inflation and propping up elites with artificial protections. Furthermore, Trump has no real industrial policy, which renders his reactive trade measures completely ineffective. A genuine industrial policy would coordinate public investment, support targeted sectors, enforce labour standards, and channel technological change towards good jobs. His predecessor, President Joe Biden, laid the foundations of such an industrial policy agenda in the Inflation Reduction and CHIPS acts. However, these programmes are now under attack from the Trump administration, and their remaining vestiges will not have a meaningful effect. Without these pillars, workers are left exposed to economic shocks and excluded from the gains of growth, while the rhetoric of reindustrialisation becomes little more than a political performance. While Trump’s economic policies are unlikely to work, returning to economic liberalism will not resolve socioeconomic grievances either. Let us remember that past efforts to maintain this deeply flawed system at any cost backfired. Following the 2008 global financial crisis, Western governments rescued big banks and allowed financial markets to return to business as usual. Meaningful reforms of the global economic architecture never materialised. Meanwhile, the living standards of working- and middle-class families from Germany to the US stagnated or declined as wages flatlined, housing prices soared, and economic insecurity deepened. We cannot return to this dysfunction again. We need a new global economic order focused on multilateral governance, ecological sustainability, and human-centric development. Such progressive global multilateralism would mean governments coordinating not only on taxing multinational corporations and curbing tax havens but also on regulating capital flows, setting minimum labour and environmental standards, sharing green technologies, and jointly financing global public goods. In this new economic order, the institutions of global economic governance would make space for developing and emerging countries to implement industrial policies and build stronger ties with public finance bodies to mobilise patient, sustainable capital. This cooperative approach would offer a practical alternative to liberal globalism by promoting accountable public investment and development-focused financial collaboration. Parallel to the eco-social developmentalism in emerging economies, wealthy nations need to embrace a post-growth model gradually. This strategy prioritises wellbeing, ecological stability, and social equity over endless GDP expansion. This means investing in care work, green infrastructure, and public services rather than chasing short-term profits or extractive growth. For mature economies, the goal should be shifting from growing more to distributing better and living within planetary limits. This would also allow more space for low- and middle-income countries to improve their living standards without overexploiting our limited shared natural resources. With stronger cooperation between national and multilateral public finance institutions and better tools to tax and regulate corporations, governments could regain the capacity to create stable, well-paying jobs, strengthen organised labour, and tackle inequalities. This is the only way for American workers to regain the quality of life they aspire to. Such progressive multilateralism would be a powerful long-term antidote against illiberal populism. Achieving this shift, however, requires building robust global and regional political coalitions to challenge entrenched corporate interests and counterbalance the existing liberal, capital-driven global framework. The challenge is clear: not only to critique Trump’s destructive policies but to present a bold, coherent vision of industrial renewal, ecological sustainability, and global justice. The coming months will show whether anyone is prepared to lead that transformation.

Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman details why Apple Intelligence is such a disaster and how Apple plans to save it. byWes Davis Apple Intelligence hasbeen a wrecksince its first features rolled out last year, and abig new reportfromBloomberg’s Mark Gurman details why — and how Apple is trying to piece things back together. And much of its effort hinges on rebuilding Siri from the ground up. Gurman has reported in the past thatApple is working onwhat it’s internally calling ‘LLM Siri’ — a reworked, generative AI version of the company’s digital assistant. Apple’s previous approach of merging the assistant with the existing Siri hasn’t been working. Gurman describes in great detail a number of reasons why, but here’s a quick summary: Now the company is trying to rejigger its approach. Part of that is a total overhaul of Siri, rather than just trying to make generative AI work in concert with the old Siri. According to Gurman, Apple has its AI team in Zurich working on a new architecture that will “entirely build on an LLM-based engine.” Gurman reported in November last year that the company was working on this, and the idea is that it will make the assistant “more believably conversational and better at synthesizing information.” Another part of the solution isleveraging iPhonesand differential privacy to improve Apple’s synthesized data — comparing fake training data with language from iPhone users’ emails, but doing so on-device and sending only the synthesized data back to Apple for AI training. And one way the company is discussing improving Siri is letting the LLM version loose on the web to “grab and synthesize data from multiple sources.” Basically, Siri as an AI web search tool not unlike Perplexity, which is one of the companies Apple has approached about partnering for AI search in Safari. Whatever the outcome, apparently Giannandrea won’t be a direct part of it, having been taken off of product development, Siri, and robotics projects in the spring. According to Gurman, Apple execs have talked about putting him “on a path to retirement,” but are concerned that some of the research and engineering folks he brought with him would leave with him, too. Whatever the case, Gurman says Giannandrea plans to stick around, “relieved Siri is now someone else’s problem.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "article_text": "The latest iPad Mini and iPad Pro are getting cheaper by the day, but the basic models offer the best value. The latest iPad Mini and iPad Pro are getting cheaper by the day, but the basic models offer the best value. byBrandon WidderandQuentyn Kennemer If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and Prime Day, many great iPad deals are attainable outside of those times. The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often some amount to be saved, particularly on Apple’s more affordable iPads. The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Mini are also regularly discounted, as is the latest iPad Air. It’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters atThe Vergeare doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is available, from the 10th-gen iPad of 2022 to the more powerful iPad models with M3 and M4 chips. Apple’s 10th-gen iPad is the successor to the older ninth-gen model. In exchange for its revised design, landscape-oriented webcam, USB-C port, larger 10.9-inch screen, and faster processor, it ditched the headphone jack and home button. Apple’s10th-gen iPadcame out in late 2022. It’s still a great tablet overall; however, it’s recently been supplanted byApple’s latest entry-level model, which features an upgraded A16 chip and twice as much base storage. That said, the last-gen iPad still benefits from a modern design and Apple’s long-in-the-making switch to USB-C. The 10.9-inch tablet is also outfitted with a side power button with a fingerprint sensor and uniform bezels, though, unlike its predecessor, it lacks a home button and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Right now, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale atWalmartstarting at $299 ($50 off), which is $40 more than its best price to date.Walmartare also selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi in select colors for just shy of $350 ($150 off), which is a better deal when you consider you can currently grab an 11th-gen iPad with an expanded 128GB of storage at Amazonstarting at $299($100 off). Apple’s 11th-gen iPad offers 128GB of storage — twice that of its predecessor — and runs on a faster A16 chip. It also comes in four colors: blue, pink, yellow, and silver. As noted above,Apple’s 11th-gen iPadjust recently landed on the scene. Thenew base-model tabletis a fairly iterative update of the prior model with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip found in the 10th-gen iPad. The newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model. Pricing-wise, the new iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We haven’t seen significant price drops yet, though the entry-level model is on sale atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $299 ($50 off) right now. Alternatively, you can grab the 256GB model atAmazonandB&H Photostarting at $399 ($50 off), or the 512GB variant atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $594.95 ($54 off). The seventh-gen iPad Mini comes with Apple’s A17 Pro chip and support for Apple Intelligence. It’s also compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro and offers faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds. The newseventh-gen iPad Miniis similar tothe outgoing modelbut comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades. The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is. Right now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is only on sale atAmazonfor $474, which is a mere $15 discount. You can also pick up the 256GB variant atAmazonandB&H Photofor $589 ($10 off), or the 512GB model atAmazonandB&H Photofor $699 ($100 off), the latter of which is best price we’ve seen on the largest storage configuration. The new 11-inch iPad Air comes with Apple’s M3 chip and GPU upgrades. It’s available in dark gray, blue, purple, and a “starlight” cream shade. In addition to the 11-inch model, the iPad Air is also available in a 13-inch configuration with Apple’s M3 processor. The2025 iPad Airis little more than a spec bump over theprevious model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer than both the entry-level iPad and the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence and compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard, which has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys that make the Air a more credible laptop replacement. The 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as the previous models — but we’re already starting to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale atAmazonandB&H Photoin its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $529 ($20 off). You can also grab the 256GB model atAmazonandB&H Photofor $599 ($100 off), or the step-up 512GB model atAmazonfor $827 ($72 off). The larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale atAmazonandB&H Photowith 128GB of storage starting at $699 ($100 off). You can also pick up the Wi-Fi / 256GB model atAmazonstarting at $826 ($73 off), or the 512GB variant atAmazonandB&H Photostarting at $1,009 ($90 off), which nearly matches the lowest price we’ve seen on the larger storage configuration. Apple’s latest iPad Pro is the first Apple device with an M4 processor and an OLED-based Ultra Retina XDR display. It also features an improved camera system with adaptive flash and compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro and the newest Magic Keyboard. The newest iPad Pro comes in either an 11- or 13-inch configuration with Apple’s M4 processor. Both models also feature an OLED display, a much thinner and lighter build, new horizontal placement for the front camera, and support for the Apple Pencil Pro. The2024 iPad Prois a far more impressive upgrade than the latest iPad Air. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they were the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latestM4 chip, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true of both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call. As for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is currently on sale atAmazonandB&H Photostarting at $899 ($100 off) — which is about $20 more than its typical sale price. The sleek and super-thin 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale in its 256GB base configuration atAmazonstarting at $1,186.99 ($112 off), which is nearly $90 shy of the tablet’s all-time low.

    "article_text": "China’s ADA Space has launched the first of a planned 2,800-satellite network of AI supercomputers. China’s ADA Space has launched the first of a planned 2,800-satellite network of AI supercomputers. byWes Davis China has launched the first 12 satellites of a planned 2,800-strong orbital supercomputer satellite network,reportsSpace News. The satellites, created by the company ADA Space, Zhijiang Laboratory, and Neijang High-Tech Zone, will be able to process the data they collect themselves, rather than relying on terrestrial stations to do it for them, according toADA Space’s announcement(machine-translated). The satellites are part of ADA Space’s “Star Compute” program and the first of what it calls the “Three-Body Computing Constellation,” the company writes. Each of the 12 satellites has an onboard 8-billion parameter AI model and is capable of 744 tera operations per second (TOPS) — a measure of their AI processing grunt — and, collectively, ADA Space says they can manage 5 peta operations per second, or POPS. That’s quite a bit more than, say, the40 TOPS requiredfor a Microsoft Copilot PC. The eventual goal is to have a network of thousands of satellites that achieve 1,000 POPs,according to the Chinese government. The satellites communicate with each other at up-to-100Gbps using lasers, and share 30 terabytes of storage between them, according toSpace News. The 12 launched last week carry scientific payloads, including an X-ray polarization detector for picking up brief cosmic phenomena such as gamma-ray bursts. The satellites also have the capability to create 3D digital twin data that can be used for purposes like emergency response, gaming, and tourism, ADA Space says in its announcement. The benefits of having a space-based supercomputer go beyond saving communications time,according toSouth China Morning Post.The outlet notes that traditional satellite transmissions are slow, and that “less than 10 per cent” of satellite data makes it to Earth, due to things like limited bandwidth and ground station availability. And Jonathan McDowell, a space historian and astronomer at Harvard University, told the outlet, “Orbital data centres can use solar power and radiate their heat to space, reducing the energy needs and carbon footprint.” He said both the US and Europe could carry out similar projects in the future, writesSCMP.

    "title": "I used two GPS hiking apps for backpacking and I’ll do it again",
    "article_text": "A thing about me is I do belong among the wildflowers. byElizabeth Lopatto A thing about me is I do belong among the wildflowers. byElizabeth Lopatto For most of my life, I’ve relied on a paper map when I go outdoors. Then, in March, I joinedmy friend Rustyon the Appalachian Trail for two weeks. He told me to download FarOut. FarOut was my introduction to the world of app-based navigation. It’s focused on thru-hikers, and has useful details, including comments that tell you whether a specific water source is flowing, and if so, how well. It took me a minute to get the hang of it — I was hiking southbound, and it defaults to northbound — but once I did, I was impressed. FarOut works like a guidebook. But the kind of backpacking I ordinarily do is on more offbeat trails in the local national forests — not the wilderness highways FarOut specializes in. So for my first solo trip, to the Ventana Wilderness area of the Los Padres National Forest, I thought I’d try out some of the other navigation apps, as part of an absolutely transparent ploy to get my job to let me fuck off outdoors more often; there are a lot of hikes I want to do. I suspect many of our readers are connoisseurs of the great indoors, but I also know you love gadgets, and let me tell you something: so do backpackers. You would not believe the conversations I have had with absolute strangers about gear. I do work at the phones website. We kind of specialize in having feelings about apps Now, I’m not going to topOutdoor Gear Lab— I love their reviews, and have found them reliable guides when it comes to big purchases*— but I do work at the phones website. We kind of specialize in having feelings about apps. I considered several options. I quickly discarded onX Backcountry when I discovered on one of my trial hikes how quickly it drained my phone battery. I also used CalTopo to prepare for the hike, but because it’s a fairly complex platform with a steep learning curve, I don’t think I’ve spent enough time with it to give it a proper review.I figured I might as well keep it simple. I already knew Google Maps wouldn’t cut it; the acquisitions Google has made over the years suggest that the company’s more interested in cars than pedestrians. Looking at the Health and Fitness category on the Apple App Store, I noticed AllTrails ranked #10, so trying the popular app seemed natural. The other app I saw frequently mentioned on hiking subreddits — besides CalTopo — was Gaia GPS. So I figured I’d start with those two. There are a few other apps in the space I didn’t consider. The most notable are Avenza and Goat Maps. I’ve found Avenza limited, but it seems the feature set has been updated since the last time I played with it. Goat Maps is new to me, but it’s from the same team that created Gaia GPS before it was sold to Outside. (More about that in a minute.) Because this was my first solo hike, I was not interested in doing anything especially difficult. I’ve been to the Ventana Wilderness before, and am familiar with the Pine Ridge Trail, which I viewed as the backbone of my trip. One of the things AllTrails has going for it is suggested routes — for this area,41 possible hikes. I had originally contemplated doing an overnight at China Camp before heading down the Pine Ridge Trail to Sykes Camp as an out-and-back, but after hiking with Rusty, I decided I could be more ambitious. I considered a few routes before settling on what AllTrails calls theBig Sur Sykes Hot Springs Extended Loop. That was partly because I’d checked in with theBig Sur Trail Map, a volunteer information repository hosted by Jack Glendening for trail conditions, and discovered a few trails I might have otherwise wanted to use were overgrown. Once I started mapping my route, I noticed some trouble AllTrails has user comments, which can be useful. One user told me to prepare for ticks and poison oak. Another suggested a stop at Timber Top for a meal or snack as it was beautiful, even if it was a detour, so I worked that into my agenda. In order to get a sense of what I’d be doing, I used tools to create my routes, with different lines for each day. CalTopo, AllTrails, and Gaia all have “snap to route” tools that let you automatically follow a trail the map knows about, which makes creating a route easier. But once I started mapping my route, I noticed some trouble. AllTrails said this was a 32.8-mile hike. I had trouble getting Gaia to acknowledge the fire road that would be part of my route with its auto-route tool set; also, the app insisted I was hiking 40 miles. Both the AllTrails and Gaia “snap to route” tools were easier to use than CalTopo, and it came up with a totally different mileage count than either: a 35-mile hike. Similarly, looking at elevation gain, AllTrails told me to expect 9,160 feet, CalTopo told me to expect 8901 feet, and Gaia, for some reason, was insisting on 19,000 feet. I gotta say, 19,000 feet did not seem like it was in the vicinity of right. Looking at the map I created on Gaia, I think that’s because the “snap to route” tool had given me some weird detours. Well, what’s a couple miles and a few hundred feet of elevation between friends? I decided the smartest move would be to plan a four-day hike with three overnight stops: Sykes Camp, Rainbow Camp, and Outlaw Camp. I figured having more stops meant I could more easily absorb some unexpected miles if I had to. AllTrails’ route-building tool was easiest to use, and the easiest to edit if I made a mistake. While I appreciated Gaia’s similarly easy snap-to-trail function, it was a profound pain in the ass to edit after I’d made a route. And CalTopo was the most finicky for route-building of the bunch, requiring painstaking clicking. But it also had the best feature set, in terms of lines, colors, and editing. It also had more base layers and overlays showing, among other things, where to expect cellphone service. CalTopo and Gaia let you build and edit maps on a phone, but I primarily used my laptop because a big screen is better for planning routes, and a mouse is a more precise tool than my finger. Tinkering with Gaia on my phone, I found route creation buggy.AllTrails doesn’t seem to offer route creation on the iPhone at all.This didn’t matter much for me, but if you’re creating routes on the fly in the backcountry, you’re out of luck with AllTrails, and Gaia may suddenly quit working. I harbor a deep and profound pro-paper bias. A notebook is the best organizational tool available to you. I own hundreds of paper books because they don’t have DRM and they can’t be altered post-publication, or removed from my devices. I like paper maps a great deal, and have used them as my main navigation tool for my entire hiking career. Paper maps have downsides. They don’t respond well to water, for instance. Wear and tear can render them unusable. They may be out of date. And, of course, there are no crowdsourced comments telling you about trail conditions before your hike. The obvious benefit of the navigation apps is the reassuring little blue dot The obvious benefit of the navigation apps is the reassuring little blue dot that tells you exactly where you are on the trail, without requiring nearly as much work. You can pull out your phone and see how much farther you need to go before arriving at a landmark. And most of us have our phones on our hikes because they’re the most convenient way to take photos. Gaia and AllTrails offer downloadable maps as part of a premium service — for a subscription fee, of course. That’s either $59.90 for Gaia or $89.99 for Gaia’s Outside Plus, which includes access to Outside’s assorted publications. The AllTrails Plus subscription I tested was $35.99 a year; after I went on my hike, it announced AllTrails Peak, which costs $79.99 a year andincludes AI tools for route planning. (Given what I know about LLMs, I personally would not trust an AI to plan any hiking route, but I suppose your mileage may vary.) CalTopo, which offers its own set of subscription plans at $20, $50, and $100 a year, shows weather data and information about how much sunlight any part of its map gets at any hour of the day. There are a couple downsides to these apps. They drain the phone battery, which necessitates carrying a portable charger, which means more weight. If the phone doesn’t work — because, say, you dropped it — the app won’t work either. And there are, of course, the privacy issues. I don’t want people to know where I am at all times My location is sensitive information; I don’t want people to know where I am at all times. AllTrails defaults to sharing your data publicly, so anyone on Earth can look up your hikes. While you can change this setting, defaults matter. “Public trail activities and community reviews are a big part of the AllTrails experience,” spokesperson Mia DeSimone in an email. I was also prompted to review my hike afterwards — part of the crowdsourced data that makes AllTrails work, I suppose. AllTrails also shares your data. Some of that is unobjectionable — payment providers, for instance — but some of it, like sharing data with marketing partners, raised my eyebrows. “AllTrails does not process sensitive personal data, including precise geolocation, for purposes other than actual use of the AllTrails platform,” DeSimone said. I can’t speak to the pluses and minuses of AllTrails Peak, which I haven’t experimented with. But after my hike, AllTrails also discontinued its “Advanced Conditions” feature that showed weather along a prospective route, what to expect from the ground (wet? icy?), and mosquito activity. AllTrails Peak users will get access to “Trail Conditions,” which DeSimone says is “significantly more robust and precise than Advanced Conditions.” Some AllTrails usersseem unhappyaboutthe new pricing tier. Gaia similarly defaults to public sharing, because of “a social component designed to help users connect, share experiences, and discover trails,” said Devin Lehman, general manager of Gaia GPS, in an emailed statement. “Public sharing of hikes is the default setting to encourage this community engagement.” Gaia also shares some data, including location data, with unnamed “service providers,” but Lehman said this is done “under strict data protection agreements” and is used to “support and power specific features and functionalities.” Last year, Gaia began requiring sign-ins,catching a few peoplewhowere on multi-day tripsby surprise. “To ensure minimal disruption, we implemented a ‘snooze’ option allowing users to defer login for up to 28 days if prompted during an active trip,” Lehman wrote. “Users entirely offline (airplane mode or zero cell service) would not see the prompt at all. However, we understand some users in areas with intermittent service did encounter unexpected prompts. We’ve taken user feedback seriously and continue refining our app experience to better support uninterrupted outdoor adventures.” Its parent company, Outside, alsojacked up the costof subscriptions, and on April 14th this year, itremoved access to the National Geographic Trails Illustrated maps. “While we understand some subscribers valued the National Geographic Trails Illustrated maps, these maps offered limited regional coverage and lacked the global scope and dynamic functionality our growing user base needs,” Lehman wrote. He says Gaia “substantially expanded” its offerings in the last few years, and the price increase reflects “the ongoing investment required to maintain and continuously improve Gaia GPS.” Be that as it may, I’ve got several friends who are disgruntled Gaia subscribers looking around for another option. And I personally do not have faith inOutside’s managementof Gaia,or its other properties, in the long run. On the trail Because I was uncertain about my mileage, I decided to track myself several ways: AllTrails, Gaia, and my Apple Watch Series 6. The Apple Watch isn’t really an ideal fitness tracker for outdoors enthusiasts — it’s flimsy and its battery drains too fast; even the Ultra 2 only gives you 72 hours in low power mode. What it does have going for it is that I already own it, and there are other pieces of gear that were more important to upgrade after my experience on the AT.The Big Fourin pack weight are your tent, sleeping bag or quilt, sleeping pad, and pack itself. Updating my tent and quilt, both expensive, also meant I lost about 5 pounds of weight from my pack immediately. Since this wasn’t a long hike and I was already carrying a battery, the Apple Watch’s propensity to drain quickly, even with both low power mode and theater mode on, didn’t seem too terrible. I set out from the trailhead Monday morning, and turned on tracking for AllTrails, Gaia, and my Apple Watch. As with all tracking, there are opportunities for user error — I am of course capable of forgetting to turn this stuff on, or pausing it and then never unpausing it. I mention this because therewasuser error: I paused the AllTrails tracker and then never unpaused it, so as far as it’s concerned, I hiked 3.7 miles that first day. I was more successful with my watch and Gaia. I started my watch late — looking at the map, I seem to have missed at least a mile before I started it; it recorded 9 miles of walking. I did start Gaia at the beginning of my hike, and it recorded I hiked 11.6 miles. Both watch and app recorded about 2,400 feet of ascent, a little less than what CalTopo told me to expect (2,600 feet of elevation gain) and significantly less than what AllTrails told me to expect (3,000 feet). I arrived at Sykes Camp, alongside the Big Sur River, a little after 4PM, and set up my tent. It was close enough to dinnertime that I decided to eat. As I was hunched over the stove, a woman walked by, so I said hello. She was looking for the hot spring, and continued walking upriver. About 45 minutes later, she returned. She hadn’t found it. The hot spring wasn’t listed on the AllTrails map, the CalTopo map, or either of my paper maps. But it was on Gaia, and after dinner, I found the hot spring, a half-mile hike on a somewhat overgrown path downriver, and soaked blissfully for about half an hour. I’d post a selfie, but this is the internet, and I know better than to post feet for free. The next morning I packed up and headed off to Rainbow Camp around 8:45AM. This, I knew, would be an up-and-down day of ridgeline hiking; AllTrails had a helpful elevation map telling me roughly what to expect. Unlike Sykes, Rainbow Camp was likely to be a place I’d be alone. Most of the people I’d spoken to the day before were doing an out-and-back, with Sykes as their only stop. But this ridgeline hike was spotted with wildflowers. I’d planned for this to be a fairly short day, only about 7 miles. I pulled into Rainbow Camp around 2PM and was underwhelmed — it was buggy and not especially scenic. So after eating lunch and refreshing my water supply, I decided to push on to Cold Spring Camp. The AllTrails map suggested it would only be 5 miles more. It was uphill, though, about 2,000 more feet of climbing. Even if I dragged along at 1 mile an hour, I’d still arrive before sunset. I’d thought about camping at Cold Spring before I set off, and had shied away from it both because of the climb and my uncertainty about the actual mileage of my hike. But I was feeling good, and I’d used my Garmin InReach Mini to check in about my change of plans, so I shoved off. According to my trackers recording my actual route — Gaia and AllTrails — it was more like 6 miles, not 5. Gaia tracked 4,884 feet of climb over a total distance of 13.6 miles; AllTrails suggested I’d climbed 5,213 feet over 14.6 miles. (Did I miss a mile somewhere on Gaia? I don’t see a gap in the recording, so I’m not sure how to account for the difference.) My Apple Watch said I’d gone 11.5 miles, also with 4,884 feet of climb — but its battery died before I made camp. I set up camp at Cold Spring, and watched the sun go down over the ocean as I ate dinner. The extra mileage meant I could plausibly make it home the following day. Sure, there were several camps available if I was too tired to do the rest of the hike, but depending on which tracker I used as my source of truth, I had somewhere between 11 and 13 miles left, a fairly easy day of hiking, particularly since it would all be downhill. The third day opened with ridgeline views; I was above a thick ceiling of clouds hiding the ocean. There were, of course, more wildflowers. When I turned off the dirt road onto Terrace Creek Trail, I met a day hiker going the other direction, who warned me about ticks on the grassy descent toward a redwood grove. (Maybe because he went through just before me, or maybe because of the permethrin I’d used on my clothes, I didn’t see any.) I made it back to the parking lot a little after 4PM. I’d had some user error with my Apple Watch — forgetting to start it again after breakfast at Timber Top, so there was an hour and a half gap in its data — and it recorded 11 miles. AllTrails crapped out at some point between when I set off from Cold Spring and breakfast, so it didn’t record my entire hike. Still, it got 11.63 miles. Gaia also had a gap in its recording (something wrong with my phone?) and put me at 12.7 miles. I thought the hike would settle how long the route was. It did, in a way — certainly the hike was longer than the 32.8 miles AllTrails had promised. If we take Gaia’s tracking, which was the most complete of the bunch, as the source of truth, I’d hiked 38 miles, 39 if I added the hike to the hot spring. While I had my paper maps (and compass) with me, the point was to test the apps, and they worked well enough that I didn’t have to refer to my “real” maps at all. But I also didn’t come away with a single clear winner, whether AllTrails or Gaia was best. AllTrails offered better route-planning features, while Gaia was more reliable on the trail. Both had worrisome inaccuracies in their data, which meant in practical terms that I lugged around another day of food in extra weight because I wasn’t totally sure how far I’d be climbing or walking. That’s consequential — food and water are usually the heaviest things a hiker carries. I certainly wouldn’t recommend relying on either of these, particularly without a backup map, and I’m not sold on how they handle my privacy. AllTrails seems to be aimed at people who are more casual hikers than I am. I don’t think Outside has been a good steward of Gaia (orofOutside Magazine). I also hesitate to recommend pricey subscriptions to these apps, given the issues I had with them. In fact, as I was writing this, I realized the most useful app in planning the trip was the one I hadn’t downloaded maps from: CalTopo. I haven’t tested CalTopo in the backcountry yet, so consider this a cliffhanger. Please feel free to pop over to the comments to demand I be allowed to go backpacking for work sooner rather than later, so you can hear more about my map-related misadventures. I’ve been eyeing theTahoe Rim Trailfor later this summer, and if I’m testing gear, it doesn’t count as vacation time, right? Right? * Except in the case of bras.Outdoor Gear Lab’s top bra recommendation’slargest size is a C cup, and the reviews are written primarily for teeny tatas. That’s an astounding editorial failure. Not only do athletes of big titty experience have a harder time finding bras at all, we are more likely to experience boob pain — whichis a major reason women quit sports. Breast tissue is dead weight, so bra structure is crucial. A bra that’s stretchy enough to fit over your head won’t keep the girls in place during high-impact exercise. Some other rules of thumb: racerbacks press on your traps; thin straps cut into your shoulders; a thick, tight band is a must for weight distribution. A low-cut bra means an astonishing amount of cleavage, buta high necklinewill make your gazongas look even bigger, so pick your poison, I guess. (Also, a high-cut bra worn for a long time will incubate a real banner crop of cleavage zits and, in some cases, chafing.)For running, I likeEnell’s High Impact Bra— it’s the only one I’ve tried that’s kept my rack from bouncing. (It’salso recommendedbySwole Woman Casey Johnston.) I’m still on the lookout for the best backpacking bra; the Enell one is too binding for all-day wear.

    "title": "In a year full of giant games, some little mice stand out",
    "article_text": "﻿Maze Mice is a literally small game that blends a lot of classic ideas. ﻿Maze Mice is a literally small game that blends a lot of classic ideas. byJay Peters There have been a lot ofbiggames this year that have felt all-consuming, likeMonster Hunter WildsorClair Obscur: Expedition 33.Maze Miceoffers something different: a small, pick-up-and-play experience that takes a bunch of ideas from some classics and adds a clever twist. The game, fromLuck Be a Landlorddeveloper TrampolineTales, mixes elements ofPac-Man,Vampire Survivors, and even the classicSnake. As an adorable, pixelated mouse, you zip around a maze to get blue experience gems that are guarded by cats. When you pass by the cats, they’ll wake up and start chasing you, sometimes creating a hilariously long line of felines. (Cute ghost cats will also appear and inconveniently float right into your path.) All the action takes place on one screen, so it’s easy to see where everything is at any given time. When you get enough gems, you can pick from a selection of three power-ups. The upgrades are often a little silly, like knitting needles that fly through the air to attack the cats pursuing you, but as withVampire Survivors, it’s fun to experiment with different abilities to create interesting builds. Maze Mice’s most interesting feature is that time only moves when you move,like inSuperhot. When you inch forward, the enemy cats inch forward right behind you, but when you’re not moving, they’re frozen, too. Your abilities are all on cooldowns, and the time on those cooldowns also only advances when you move forward. It all means that instead of the growing sense of being overwhelmed that you might get while dodging ghosts inPac-Manor fighting hordes of monsters inVampire Survivors,Maze Micegives you time to sit and think about where you want to go next — even if you have 10 cats on your tail. I really like how it all works. You’re still dealing with lots of enemies, but instead of the anxiety of having to fend them off in real time like in other games, it’s all much much more laid-back. The charming atmosphere and catchy music help make the experience feel more welcoming than stressful, too. After runs, you’ll unlock new upgrades and characters for future runs based on your score. I’m a big fan of a mine weapon that blows up when I get the cats following me to walk over it. And my favorite character so far is a mouse named Jazz with sunglasses and a saxophone — who starts with a saxophone weapon. Such a cool little guy! Maze Miceis in early access, so it should get more content down the line. It seems like there’s a generous amount to play with already; TrampolineTales launched the game this monthwith 30 characters and 63 upgrades, meaning there’s a lot to dig into. But the thing I love most about it is that I can play for a few minutes after an hourlongDoom: The Dark Ageslevel and feel like I actually accomplished something – even when those pesky cats eventually catch up to me. Maze Mice is available now in early access on PC.

Hi, friends! Welcome toInstallerNo. 83, your guide to the best andVerge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, please don’t spoilAndorfor me, and also you can read all the old editions at theInstallerhomepage.) This week, I’ve been reading aboutMission: ImpossibleandSam Altman’s kitchenandbad roommates, ranting to PJ Vogt aboutall the waysI’m trying to use my phone less, writing all my scratch notes inAntinote, deciding to be cautiously optimisticaboutThe Paper,rewatching the last season ofMythic Quest,watchingandreadingabout life as an air traffic controller, trying to restart a meditation practice after discovering I getHeadspacethrough work, and usingLudexto see if any of my sports cards are worth anything. So far… they’re not. I also have for you a pair of headphones you’re practically guaranteed to love, two new sci-fi shows to check out, the new Airbnb, and much more. Let’s dive in. (As always, the best part ofInstalleris your ideas and tips. What are you reading / watching / listening to / playing / carrying around in a backpack this week? What should everyone else be just as into as you are right now? Tell me everything:installer@theverge.com.

Some personal news:I’m having another kid!I’m going on leave sometime around the beginning of July, and will be gone for the summer scoping sick baby gadgets, devising complicated spreadsheet-based systems for tracking eating habits, and once again testing every game I can find that’s playable one-handed. Good news, though: you’ll be in good hands when I’m gone.The Verge’sJay Petersis going to be taking over Installer for a couple of months, finding and sharing all the good stuff just like always. (Best I can tell so far, Jay likes wonky indie games the way I like note-taking apps, so get ready to fill up your consoles in a hurry this summer.) You’ll be hearing from him here a bit for the next several weeks, too, but I’m not going anywhere just yet. As he starts to get ramped up for all thingsInstaller, I figured the best way for us all to get to know Jay would be to have him share his homescreen. It’s just the price of admission ’round these parts. Here it is, plus some info on the apps he uses and why: The phone:An iPhone 16 Pro I got earlier this year. I upgraded from an iPhone 12 Mini that I miss desperately — the iPhone 16 Pro is too heavy and too big for me. The wallpaper:A gray gradient I made using Apple’s built-in wallpaper tools. I’ve tried the all-black background, but I find it jarring when I open an app and suddenly a notch or Dynamic Island appears. I made the apps gray so they’re less visually stimulating, and as a constant reminder that I should probably be doing something other than scrolling on my phone. The apps:Phone, Calendar, Photos, Camera, Voice Memos, Apple Maps, Clock, Settings, Messages, Notes, Reminders. As much as possible, I rely on Apple’s stock apps because they sync well between my phone and my Mac. (Voice Memos is a particularly useful one in my line of work!) I also keep my homescreen pretty tidy by shoving most of the few apps I keep on my phone into the App Library. If I’m actively testing or using one for whatever reason, it temporarily lives at the top under the two widgets. The countdown widget comes from an app calledDays Since. I’m a newish dad to a very early riser, and I realized last year that even one glass of wine made me a step too slow to keep up with my active kid. I’ve set a goal to not drink for a year just to see if I can do it, and so far, so good. I also asked Jay to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back: Here’s what theInstallercommunity is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well!

    "title": "Anduril CEO unveils the Fury unmanned fighter jet",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 18, 2025 / 7:14 PM EDT/ CBS News In April, Anduril Industries co-founderPalmer Luckeyarrived for his 60 Minutes interview in an outfit that's become a signature look: shorts, flip-flops, and a colorful Hawaiian shirt. He was also sporting a mullet and a goatee. \"I've actually always wanted a mullet my whole life,\" he laughingly told correspondent Sharyn Alfoni about his distinctive hairstyle. But while Luckey's appearance is casual, his business is deadly serious. And the U.S. military is taking him seriously. \"I think I am very, very lucky that the level we are working with now is not judging Anduril on the basis of what shirt I wear or what my haircut is,\" he told 60 Minutes. Anduril Industries, the company he co-founded in 2017, makes drones, aircraft, and submarines that all run autonomously. They can use artificial intelligence for surveillance or to identify, select, and eliminate a target. No operator is required. Alfonsi pointed out in an interview with Luckey that the idea of autonomous arms is scary to some people. \"It's a scary idea, but, I mean, that's the world we live in. I'd say it's a lot scarier, for example, to imagine a weapons system that doesn't have any level of intelligence at all,\" Luckey said. \"There's no moral high ground to making a land mine that can't tell the difference between a school bus full of children and Russian armor… it's not a question between smart weapons and no weapons. It's a question between smart weapons and dumb weapons.\" On a large screen in a conference room, Luckey demonstrated Lattice, the AI platform that can coordinate these so-called \"smart weapons\" and collect data from various sensors and sources, including satellites, drones, radar, and cameras. Alfonsi asked Luckey about concerns that AI-powered devices like these could go rogue. \"I would say that it is something to be aware of. But in the grand scheme of things… there's things that I'm much more terrified of,\" the tech billionaire replied. \"I'm a lot more worried about evil people with mediocre advances in technology than AI deciding that it's gonna wipe us all out.\" On Monday, UN Secretary General António Guterres said lethal autonomous weapons are \"politically unacceptable, morally repugnant and should be banned by international law.\" International groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch call autonomous lethal weapons \"killer robots.\" Luckey has stated that all Anduril products have a so-called \"kill switch\" that allows humans to ultimately intervene in case of an emergency or undesired behavior. Luckey also thinks sending autonomous weapons onto the battlefield could save the lives of American soldiers who would otherwise be killed in action. \"Right now, there are so many weapon systems that require manning,\" Luckey told Alfonsi. \"If I can have one guy command and controlling a hundred aircraft, that's a lot easier than having to have a pilot in every single one. And it puts a lot fewer American lives at risk.\" Anduril hopes to leap forward in unmanned combat with Fury, a fighter jet that's designed to use artificial intelligence and fly without a pilot. Co-founder and CEO Brian Schimpf took 60 Minutes into a hangar to show off Fury; it was the first time a media outlet was allowed to see the plane up close. Fury is a CCA, or collaborative combat aircraft, that's designed to work in coordination with a manned aircraft. Anduril and longtime defense contractor General Atomics won contracts from the U.S. Air Force to develop and test CCAs that could eventually become the official CCAs of the Air Force. \"The first thing you notice about this plane is that there's no cockpit. There is no seat. There's no controls. There's no stick and rudder inside this. And there's no place for a human,\" Schimpf told 60 Minutes Overtime. \"This is an autonomous fighter jet. It has software inside that can sense and understand everything going on in the airspace, and [it's] able to react. And it works with a quarterback to be able to do this.\" Schimpf told 60 Minutes that Fury would work in conjunction with a manned aircraft flying behind it, spotting enemies and protecting the manned aircraft. \"In a combat environment, you would have these things sitting out in front, and they would detect the enemies earlier. They'd be able to engage. And it really is designed to protect those manned pilots sitting in the rear,\" Schimpf explained. Schimpf said components, like the landing gear, use common parts that are more readily available in the United States when compared to a typical fighter jet, which could make it easier and cheaper to mass produce. \"Instead of using very exquisite, big aircraft landing gear, which are hard to produce… we designed it so it can be built in any machine shop in America. Instead of using a military engine, we've been able to use a commercial business jet engine that [is] mass produced and readily available,\" he explained. Fury is scheduled to take its first test flight this summer. The Air Force hopes to have CCAs fully operational before the end of this decade. \"[We're still] proving out the aircraft… we're also working through how will these things be used in combat. We're working through simulations and ways these can actually be employed,\" Schimpf told 60 Minutes. \"This is a big deal beyond just making an airplane that flies. It's an entirely new way of fighting.\" The video above was produced by Will Croxton. It was edited by Sarah Shafer. Will Croxton is a digital producer at 60 Minutes. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "'I thought it was a movie': Mexican ship's crash into with Brooklyn Bridge leaves locals in disbelief",
    "article_text": "New York City residents witness plenty of shocking events in the city that never sleeps, but thefatal crash of a Mexican navy ship into the historic Brooklyn Bridgestunned even the most hardened New Yorkers. The ship’s captain lost control because of a mechanical issue, Mayor Eric Adams said, causing the naval training ship’s tall masts to hit the bottom of the142-year-old bridgeconnecting Brooklyn to Manhattan. Two of the 277 crew members and cadets were killed and 22 more were injured, according to Mexico's navy.The governor of the Mexican state of Veracruz, Rocío Nahle,identified one of the dead as cadet América Yamilet Sánchez on Sunday. Shortly after the crash Saturday night, videos of the collision made the rounds online and hundreds of people flocked toward the water to see the damage for themselves. Ishmael Alvarado, who lives on the Manhattan side of the Brooklyn Bridge, said his son started calling for him to come look out the window as they heard some noise outside. “I thought it was a movie. I didn’t know it was actually happening,” he told NBC News on Sunday. After hearing about the two people who lost their lives, Alvarado wanted to see the ship in person to pay his respects. “I feel really sad, and I feel for the families of the sailors that were there,” Alvarado said. “I’m a Marine Corps veteran myself, so I understand people who serve. ... They’re serving their country in Mexico.” Mexican authorities said its naval ship was on a training cruise called the “Bicentennial of the Consolidation of Independence at Sea.” It was meant to dock in New York for just a few days as part of a cultural exchange before setting off to Iceland to continue its journey. The cause of the collision is under investigation by the New York Police Department, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Mexican government. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo thanked Adams for his support to her country’s nationals and assured that the Mexican navy was caring for its wounded. “We are very sorry to hear of the death of two crew members of the Buque Escuela Cuauhtémoc, who lost their lives in the regrettable accident in the port of New York,”Pardo wrote on X. “Our solidarity and support for the families.” Theresa Lee came to see the ship Sunday along with her two dogs. When she first saw the videos of the crash, Lee said she thought it was a fabrication generated by artificial intelligence. “I didn’t think it was a real thing that was occurring,” Lee said. She added that the crash seemed to be occurring in slow motion, “like the masts are breaking so slowly and that it was going backwards.” Laureen Smith was returning to the area from dinner in Manhattan on Saturday night and rushed back home to see the ship after getting text messages about the shocking news from her family. “Normally, what we see is ferries that go back and forth, or be like cargo ships with containers on them, but not big ships like this,” Smith said Saturday. “Never seen one like this before.” Smith said she immediately felt concern for the people on board. “I just couldn’t believe it, like, why?” Smith said. “How could they possibly have missed that they didn’t fit under the Brooklyn Bridge?” Zach Iscol, the city’s emergency management commissioner, called the collision “heartbreaking,” not just because of the loss of life but also because of how the deaths have impacted the crew. Reports on what happened remain preliminary, Iscol said. The ship was moving from the Seaport to Bay Ridge, in south Brooklyn, to anchor and refuel when the crash happened. “Something happened during that movement where the ship reportedly lost power, lost steerage, and that’s when — because of the current it looks like — it ended up under the Brooklyn Bridge,” Iscol said. “And that’s where the tragedy occurred with the mast.” People were gathered all around Brooklyn’s shoreline on the warm Saturday night, many viewing the wreckage as paramedics and divers aided those on board. Andrew Schiff, a New Yorker who takes part in a local sailing club, said he was at a jazz concert in the area and saw the ship about 10 minutes after it crashed. “I thought it was like some kind of movie set or something,” Schiff said. Schiff noted that he’s had experience navigating the Hudson River and called the power of the currents around the bridge “very significant.” “I mean, sometimes the East River flows out towards the ocean 3 or 4 knots, which is a pretty strong current,” he said. He added that boats trying to navigate the waters require a lot of engine power to help keep their ships in control. “The ferries have it, but if you don’t, if you have a sailing ship with not a lot of engine power, it could toss you around,” Schiff said.",

    "article_text": "Former President Joe Bidenhas been diagnosed with prostate cancer, his personal office announced Sunday. “Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms,” read a statement released by the office. “On Friday he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone.” “While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management. The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.” The former president and his family are meeting with doctors and considering “multiple treatment options,” including hormone treatment for the cancer, according to a source familiar with Biden’s and his family’s thinking. Investigators arefocusing on social media postsby the suspect in the California fertility clinic bombing that they say support the belief that no one should have children. While the postsand a 30-minute audio recordingare still being verified, officials believe an anti-natalism ideology was the motive behind the bombing, which the FBI deemed an act of terrorism. The suspect, identified by authorities as Guy Edward Bartkus, is believed to have detonated the explosive in Saturday’s attack, whichclaimed his own life and injured four others. The same person may also be linked to an online forum post from earlier this month in which the individual contemplated suicide using an explosive device, according to two senior law enforcement officials briefed on the incident. Investigators are also looking at a YouTube account, under the same moniker, that features videos of experiments with homemade explosives. Former Vice President Mike Pencecriticized President Donald Trump’s approach to tariffsin an interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” calling Trump’s original tariff plan “the largest peacetime tax hike on the American people in the history of this country.” Pence opened with broad praise for the second Trump administration, applauding the president for having “secured the southern border in a historic way” and ordering military action against the Houthis in Yemen, among other things. “But in the midst of all of that, I have seen some departure from the policies of our administration both at home and abroad,” Pence told “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker. He mentioned “wavering support” for Ukraine in the first 100 days of Trump’s second term, and he was especially critical of Trump’s tariffs. Pence also said Trump was wrong to issue a blanket pardon of people who faced charges for participating in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. “Individuals who broke into the Capitol, who assaulted police officers, I said that day and I believe to this moment should have been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Pence said. Earlier this weak, Moody’s Ratings downgraded the United States’ credit rating by a notch from the highest level.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessentasserted that the downgrade was related to the Biden administration’s spending policies, which that administration had touted as investments in priorities including combating climate change and increasing health care coverage. Meanwhile,Sen. Chris Murphytold “Meet the Press” that “it was a mistake” for Democrats to allow Joe Biden to remain in the 2024 presidential race for as long as he did, echoing recent comments from other Democrats as the party reckons with fallout from new reporting on the then-president’s mental acuity. Pope Leo XIV disavowed “an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth’s resources and marginalizes the poorest” ina homily at his inaugural Massin front of St. Peter’s Basilica on Sunday, marking the formal start of his papacy. Vice President JD Vance, aconvert to Catholicism, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were present for the event, as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Leo said the church’s authority must be rooted in charity, not “religious propaganda or by means of power.” “In this our time, we still see too much discord, too many wounds caused by hatred, violence, prejudice, the fear of difference, and an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth’s resources and marginalizes the poorest,” he said, according to an English translation provided by the Vatican. Michael McCarthy had just witnessed adisplay of resilienceunfold in front of him at the Preakness Stakes on Saturday when he referenced another. “We’ll rebuild,” McCarthy told NBC in a televised interview from the wet track of Baltimore’s Pimlico Race Course, just minutes after his horse, Journalism, won the 150th running of the Triple Crown’s middle leg. “This is for Altadena.” Journalism’s victory required a comeback of more than five lengths, an improbable run that required slipping between two horses on either side as it entered the backstretch, then furiously making up ground on leader Gosger, never taking the lead until the final strides. The route was unexpected and challenging —not all that dissimilarto what Journalism’s trainer and other Southern Californians have endured since the January wildfires impacted more than 30,000 people. I thought it was a movie. I didn’t know it was actually happening. Thefatal crash of a Mexican Navy ship into the Brooklyn Bridgeleft even the most hardened New Yorkersa bit stunned. The ship’s captain lost control due to a mechanical issue, according to Mayor Eric Adams, causing the ship’s tall masts to hit the bottom of the 142-year-old bridge connecting Brooklyn to Manhattan.",

    "title": "Authorities express confidence in finding 7 remaining escaped New Orleans inmates",
    "article_text": "Authorities expressed confidence Sunday about the prospect of capturing seven of10 escaped New Orleans inmateswho remain at large, possibly before the end of the night. Federal, state and local authorities have developed usable information about all seven and have received multiple tips on their whereabouts, said the Louisiana State Police superintendent, Col. Robert Hodges. \"We’re confident at this time that we have actual intelligence on all of those fugitives,\" he said at a news conference early Sunday evening. \"We will track all seven and bring them to justice.\" Three who participated in the escape early Friday, which Gov. Jeff Landry described as one of the largest in state history, werecaptured bythe end of theday, authorities said, crediting tips from the public. Hodges said agents, officers, marshals, deputies, aircraft and drones from the FBI; the U.S. Marshals Service; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; state police; New Orleans police; and the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office are on the case. The allied law enforcement dragnet has created a \"force multiplier\" in the search, Hodges said. He said the seven escapees are most likely still in the state and warned friends and loved ones not to help them remain at large. Jonathan Tapp, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s New Orleans office, said, \"Those people helping these inmates avoid recapture will be held accountable.\" He added: \"These inmates are accused of serious crimes, and until they’re back in custody we should all remain vigilant.\" State Attorney General Liz Murrill is leading the investigation into how they escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center, which serves as New Orleans' city jail. \"My office will do whatever it takes to determine how this happened and make sure that it won’t happen again,\" Murrill said in a statement Friday. \"This is beyond unacceptable, and once these offenders are back in custody, there must be real accountability.\" The escapees took advantage of broken locks to get out of their cells before they exited the facility through a makeshift rectangular hole behind a cell's toilet and sink fixture, authorities said. As seen inphotos provided by the sheriff's office, messages written on the wall around the opening included \"To Easy Lol.\" An 8:30 a.m. Friday head count revealed the 10 were gone, officials said, and the hunt began. NBC affiliateWDSU of New Orleansreported that, despite its questions about the escape shortly before 10 a.m., the public wasn't notified until 11 a.m. — after it broke the story. Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson said Friday that the escapees may have been helped by people “inside of our department.” By the end of the day, three employees had been placed on leave without pay pending investigation. However, on Sunday, Landry spread blame to what he called New Orleans' \"progressive\" justice system, including prosecutors who he said failed to properly charge some of the inmates with crimes that might have triggered their transfers to state facilities. In addition, said Landry, a Republican, nine of the 10 escapees were awaiting trials that would have moved them to more secure state custody. \"There is no excuse for how these cases are allegedly being mismanaged,\" he said. Landry said that he has ordered an audit of the jail and that he directed the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections to pull any state inmates from the New Orleans facility.",

    "title": "NJ Transit strike comes to an end with agreement between union and managers",
    "article_text": "The New Jersey Transit rail strike will end after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and NJ Transit managers reached a tentative agreement Sunday. Trains will resume running on their regular schedules Tuesday, NJ Transit President and CEO Kris Kolluri said, ending the first strike at NJ Transit in over 40 years. Kolluri urged commuters to work from home Monday until full service picks up again Tuesday.NJ Transit buses will run as normal Monday. Kolluri said the company has a lot to do to ready the railway for safe passage after no use, including checking the railroads, pre-positioning equipment, conducting safety inspections and calling engineers back into work. “This is an extraordinarily complex operation,” Kolluri said. “We will never compromise the safety of our riders. For us, it is better to get it right and do it methodically than to rush and try to meet some artificial deadline.” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy lauded transit managers’ efforts at the negotiating table, saying he thought the deal “landed in a really good place.” “They have poured hour after countless hour into reaching an agreement that is both fair to NJ Transit’s employees while also being affordable for our state’s commuters and taxpayers,” he said at a news conference Sunday evening. The locomotive union said the strike, which began at 12:01 a.m. Friday, was a result of pay disputes, as 450 of its members who work for NJ Transit walked off the job. It brought the country’s third-largest transit system, which services 350,000 riders, to a halt. Itshut down NJ Transit trains, which carry around 100,000 riders each day. Talks between the union and NJ Transit officials hadcontinued through the weekend. The terms of the deal will now be sent to the 450 union members who work for the company. A ratification vote by the union and by NJ Transit is expected to follow, the union said. Tom Haas, the union’s general chairman at NJ Transit, said the agreement would boost hourly pay higher than the April proposal by NJ Transit, which the union rejected, and higher still than where the proposal had stood Thursday night. The union has said its members were the lowest-paid locomotive engineers at any major passenger railroad in the country. It said NJ Transit engineers haven’t had raises in the last five years. “We’re just looking for some sort of equal pay for equal work,” a striking locomotive engineer, who would not give NBC News his name under the union’s rules, said Friday. The man said Amtrak and the Long Island Railroad pay around $10 an hour more. Murphy said the offer to the union before the strike was pay similar to that of engineers for the Long Island Railroad. Mark Wallace, the locomotive union’s national president, said the union had “the full support of our national union, as well as the Teamsters.” “We also appreciated the outpouring of support we received from NJ Transit passengers and the labor community who know that NJ Transit’s locomotive engineers keep the trains moving and went years without a raise,” Wallace said. He also thanked Congress for not interfering with the strike, which it is able to do under the Railway Labor Act. “This should be a lesson for other railroad disputes. Nothing would have been gained by kicking the can down the road. Allowing strikes to happen encourages settlement rather than stonewalling,” Wallace added. Late Thursday, before the strike deadline, Murphy and Kolluri said they wanted a fair agreement for the union but added that they couldn’t agree to a deal that might have been better than those of other unions in the NJ Transit system, because it would cause those unions to demand the same. “It turns from something that is maybe a single-digit million or a low double-digit million fiscal reality into a nine-digit fiscal reality — and that’s something that NJ Transit can’t bear,” Murphy said at the time.",

    "title": "Pro-E.U. centrist in Romania’s tense presidential race takes lead, preliminary data shows",
    "article_text": "BUCHAREST, Romania — The pro-European Union candidate inRomania’s tense presidential runoffhas taken a lead in the polls, preliminary electoral data shows, in a closely watched vote against a hard-right nationalist that could determine the geopolitical direction of the NATO member country. The race pitted front-runner George Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, against incumbent Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan. It was held months after the cancellation of the previous election plunged Romania into its worst political crisis in decades. After 8.5 million of 11.6 million votes had been counted, Dan was ahead with 53.56%, while Simion trailed at 46.44%, according to official data. Thousands gathered outside Dan’s headquarters near Bucharest City Hall to await the final results, chanting “Nicusor!” Each time his lead widened as more results came in, the crowd, many waving the flags of Europe, would erupt in cheers. When voting closed at 9 p.m., official electoral data showed a 64% voter turnout. About 1.64 million Romanians abroad, who have been able to vote since Friday at specially set-up polling stations, participated in the vote. Dan told the media that “elections are not about politicians” but about communities and that in Sunday’s vote, “a community of Romanians has won, a community that wants a profound change in Romania.” “When Romania goes through difficult times, let us remember the strength of this Romanian society,” he said. “There is also a community that lost today’s elections. A community that is rightly outraged by the way politics has been conducted in Romania up to now.” Turnout was significantly higher in Sunday’s runoff and is expected to play a decisive role in the outcome. In the first round on May 4, final turnout stood at 53% of eligible voters. Romania’s political landscape was upended last year when a top court voided the previous election in which far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped first-round polls, following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow denied. Standing on the steps ofRomania’s colossal Communist-eraparliament building after polls closed, Simion predicted a significant victory, which he called a “victory of the Romanian people.” Simion said that Georgescu was “supposed to be the president” before last year’s election was annulled. He also called for vigilance against election fraud, but said that overall he was satisfied with the conduct of the vote. Shortly after 6 p.m., Romania’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Andrei Tarnea said in a post on X that the election was subject to a “viral campaign of fake news” on the Telegram messaging app and other social media platforms, which tried to influence the electoral process and had “the hallmarks of Russian interference.” Networks of coordinated disinformation have emerged as a pervasive force throughout Romania’s entire election cycle. Romanian authorities debunked the deluge of fake news, Tarnea said. Simion appeared alongside Georgescu at a Bucharest polling station on Sunday and told reporters that he voted against the “humiliations to which our sisters and brothers have been subjected.” Years of endemic corruption and growing anger toward Romania’s political establishment have fueled a surge in support for anti-establishment and hard-right figures, reflecting a broader pattern across Europe. Both Simion and Dan have made their political careers railing against Romania’s old political class. Most recent local surveys indicated that the runoff would be tight, after earlier ones showed Simion holding a lead over Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician who rose to prominence as a civic activist fighting against illegal real estate projects. After voting in his hometown of Fagaras, Dan told reporters that he voted for Romanians “who are quiet, honest, and hardworking, and who have not felt represented for a long time,” and “for strong cooperation with our European partners, not for Romania’s isolation.” Dan founded the reformist Save Romania Union party in 2016, but later left, and is running independently on a pro-European Union ticket reaffirming Western ties, support for Ukraine and fiscal reform. Simion’s rhetoric in the lead-up to Sunday had raised some concerns that he wouldn’t respect the outcome if he lost. In the early afternoon, he told reporters that his team was confident in a “landslide victory,” if the election was “free and fair.” However, he repeated allegations of voting irregularities among Romanian citizens in neighboring Moldova and said that his party members would conduct a parallel vote count after polls close. He told The Associated Press that the ballot so far had proceeded properly. Adrian Nadin, a 51-year-old musician who supported Georgescu in the previous election, said that he chose Simion. “A part of Romania prefers conservatism,” he said. Luminita Petrache, a 32-year-old financial crimes analyst, didn’t want to say who she voted for but described the runoff as a geopolitical choice between East and West. “It is very important because the next president will be our image in Europe, and (decide) how Romania will evolve in the next five years,” she said. “I hope for changes in Romania in good ways.” The president is elected for a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in matters of national security and foreign policy. The winner of Sunday’s race will be charged with nominating a new prime minister after Marcel Ciolacu stepped down following the failure of his coalition’s candidate to advance to the runoff. After coming fourth in last year’s canceled race, Simion backed Georgescu, who was banned in March from running in the election redo. Simion then surged to front-runner in the May 4 first round after becoming the standard-bearer for the hard right. A former activist who campaigned for reunification with neighboring Moldova, Simion says he would focus on reforms: slashing red tape and reducing bureaucracy and taxes. Still, he insists that restoring democracy is his priority, returning “the will of the people.” His AUR party says it stands for “family, nation, faith, and freedom” and rose to prominence in a 2020 parliamentary election. It has since grown to become the second-largest party in the Romanian legislature. His critics say Simion is a pro-Russia extremist who threatens Romania’s longstanding alliances in the EU and NATO. In an AP interview, he rejected the accusations, saying that Russia is his country’s biggest threat and that he wants Romania to be treated as “equal partners” in Brussels. “I don’t think he is a pro-Russian candidate, I also don’t think that he’s an anti-Russian candidate,” said Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest. “I think what is driving him is … his focus on what I call identity politics.” In the first-round vote, Simion won a massive 61% of Romania’s large diaspora vote, with his calls to patriotism resonating with Romanians who moved abroad.",

    "title": "Former President Joe Biden diagnosed with aggressive form of prostate cancer",
    "article_text": "Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, his personal office announced Sunday. “Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms,” his personal office said in a statement. “On Friday he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone.” Metastasis means the cancer has spread from its primary site (in Biden’s cancer, the prostate) to other tissue in the body. “While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,” the statement continued. “The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.” A spokesperson for Biden’s office did not have any additional comment. Biden and his family are meeting with doctors and considering \"multiple treatment options,\" including hormone treatment, according to a source familiar with Biden's and his family's thinking. Biden is at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the source said, but it is unclear where he will receive treatment. Biden’s Gleason score of 9 (Group grade 5) means the cancer is likelier than others to grow and spread. “Gleason 9 is, by definition, aggressive, but you don’t know how bad it is unless you know what the PET scan looks like,” said Dr. Alan Tan, genitourinary section lead at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Tan is not involved with Biden’s case. Tan said that this type of prostate cancer is not rare. “This is the most common thing I see in my clinic,” he said. “This is bread-and-butter genitourinary oncology.” Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer do not die of it. And that Biden's cancer is hormone-sensitive suggests he will respond to treatment, experts said. Dr. Chris George, a prostate cancer specialist at Northwestern Medicine who is not involved with Biden’s case, said that if Biden responds to treatment, he could live for years as the treatment keeps the disease in check. President Donald Trump said he and first lady Melania Trump were \"saddened to hear about\" Biden's diagnosis. \"We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,\" Trumpwrote on Truth Social. Former Vice President Kamala Harris said she and former second gentleman Doug Emhoff are keeping the former first couple \"in our hearts and prayers.\" \"Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery,\"Harris wrote on X. Former President Barack Obama said he is praying \"for a fast and full recovery\" and credited Biden for spearheading efforts to reduce cancer deaths. \"Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family. Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace,\"Obama wrote in a statement. About 1 in 8 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer,according to the American Cancer Society. The cancer is common in older men, and it is the second-leading cause of cancer death in American men, behind lung cancer, according to the organization. A spokesperson for Biden disclosed last Tuesday that a “small nodule” was found on Biden’s prostate during a routine physical examination, which \"necessitated further evaluation.” At 82, Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history. Experts usually do notrecommend the prostate-specific antigen test, a blood test that helps detect prostate cancer, for men over 70, but in some cases it may be warranted. “It’s a risk-benefit analysis, and given he was vice president and then president, the benefit of screening was high,\" said Dr. Kavita Patel, a physician who worked in the Obama administration. \"I have ordered and screened 80- and 86-year-olds if they are otherwise in good health and or have a family history.” Democrats face areckoning over whetherBiden should have run for a second term in the first place. Biden’s run — and subsequent withdrawal — stoked deep divisions in the party over whether a campaign at his age helped contribute to Trump’s win in November. But the party immediately rallied around him after he disclosed the diagnosis, temporarily forgoing its post-election analysis to wish him a full recovery. “President Joe Biden is a great American patriot. Paul and I join the millions across the country and around the world praying for him to have strength and a swift recovery in the battle against cancer. Sending love to him and his family,”saidRep. Nancy Pelosi,D-Calif., the former House speaker,who helped lead effortsto encourage Biden to end his re-election bid. “Over the years, the Biden family has confronted unimaginable adversity with grace and steadfast perseverance,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"We stand with President Biden as he confronts this moment with the same courage and resilience he has shown throughout his life.\" “Praying for my friend and former colleague, Joe Biden, after hearing news of his diagnosis,\"said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.\"Loretta and I will be keeping Joe, the entire Biden family, and the medical professionals treating him in our thoughts during this time. Continue to keep the faith, Joe.” Biden has also received messages of support from the Republican members of Congress who were once eager to make his health the centerpiece of the 2024 election. “I’m sorry to see this news. Cancer is truly awful. My Dad passed away in 2021 with cancer,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said,urging supportersto pray for Biden and his family. \"This is certainly sad news, and the Johnson family will be joining the countless others who are praying for the former President in the wake of his diagnosis,\"House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said. During his presidency, Biden aimed to prevent millions of cancer deaths through the relaunch of his public-privateCancer Moonshot initiative, which funded research into treatments, expanded no-cost screening programs and, according to Biden administration records, resulted in nearly 8 million people being screened for prostate, breast, colorectal, lung, cervical and skin cancer. At his first event after he left the 2024 presidential race,Biden announced $150 millionin new grants to support research and “allow surgeons to provide more successful tumor-removal surgeries for people facing cancer.” Biden initially began leading the Moonshot program in 2016, as vice president, roughly six months after his eldest son, Beau, died of brain cancer. In 2021, Bidenunderwent a colonoscopyat Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, during which a “single 3 mm benign-appearing polyp” was identified and removed, the White House physician at the time, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, revealed. O’Connor said in a letter that the polyp was a “slow-growing, but thought to be precancerous lesion” for which no more action was required. Biden had a similar polyp removed in 2008, he said. Biden’slast annual physical examas president was in February 2024, after which O’Connor billed him as a “healthy, active, robust 81-year-old.”",

    "title": "Mariska Hargitay opens up about discovering identity of her biological father",
    "article_text": "Mariska Hargitay revealed a decades-long secret about her biological father in her new documentary. The “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” star is the daughter of the late Jayne Mansfield and Mickey Hargitay. Mansfield died in 1967 when her daughter was 3, while Mickey Hargitay died in 2006. However, as revealed inthe new documentary “My Mom Jayne” and a corresponding interview withVanity Fair,singer Nelson Sardelli is her biological father, not Mickey Hargitay. Mansfield and Mickey Hargitay married in 1958, though Mansfield filed for divorce in 1963 and began dating Sardelli. She and Mickey Hargitay eventually reunited months before Mariska Hargitay was born, with her dad ultimately raising her and her siblings after her mom’s death. Reflecting on her relationship with her late father, Mariska Hargitay told the outlet, “He was my everything, my idol. He loved me so much, and I knew it. I also knew something else — I just didn’t know what I knew.” Mariska Hargitay described feeling different from the rest of her siblings — including two brothers and three half-siblings — and understood why during her 20s. During that period, somebody showed her a picture of Sardelli, and she recalled instinctually knowing that he was her biological father. However, when she brought it up to Mickey Hargitay, he denied the claim, and she said she never brought up Sardelli to her father again. Mariska Hargitay didn’t drop her suspicion though, and when she was 30, she saw Sardelli perform in Atlantic City and introduced herself to him, causing him to cry. “I went full Olivia Benson on him,” she told Vanity Fair. “I was like, ‘I don’t want anything, I don’t need anything from you .… I have a dad. There was something about loyalty. I wanted to be loyal to Mickey.” Over time, Mariska Hargitay was able to form a bond with Sardelli and his daughters, but she understood why her mom reconciled with Mickey Hargitay. “I grew up where I was supposed to, and I do know that everyone made the best choice for me,” she said. “I’m Mickey Hargitay’s daughter — that is not a lie.” She called the documentary “a kind of love letter” to her father “because there’s no one that I was closer to on this planet.” The documentary includes cameos from both families, including Sardelli, and her siblings Jayne Marie, Zoltan and Mickey Jr, per Vanity Fair. She also hosted a private screening with her sisters on the Sardelli side, sharing that they “wept and wept and wept” at the film. “These two women that I love so much — I made them secrets! It’s so heartbreaking to me,” she said, recalling a time she introduced them as “family friends” in conversation. “I’m not good with lies. So I also made this movie to unburden all of us.” Mariska Hargitay previously opened up aboutthe lessons she learned from Mickey Hargitayduring an appearance on Sunday Sitdown with TODAY’s Willie Geist in January. “High school sports and my father’s training taught me how to get back on the horse and have the stamina to do ‘SVU.’ ‘Cause there were hard years,” she said. “There were times when I (thought), ‘I don’t know if I have it. I don’t know if I can continue this.’ But then, we would do an episode, and I fell so madly, deeply in love with my co-stars. And I was working with such great actors.”",

    "title": "FBI links California fertility clinic bombing to anti-natalist ideology",
    "article_text": "The car bombing outside a California fertility clinic that killedone person and injured four othersappears to have been driven by anti-natalist ideology, according to two senior law enforcement officials briefed on the incident. The suspect, identified by authorities as Guy Edward Bartkus, is believed to have detonated the explosive in Saturday’s attack, which claimed his own life. Investigators are focusing on social media posts made by the suspect, including a 30-minute audio recording,which they say support anti-natalist views. While the postsand the recordingare still being verified, officials believe they reflect the ideology behind the bombing. Anti-natalism refers to the belief that no one should have children. The same person may also be linked to an online forum post from earlier this month in which the individual contemplated suicide using an explosive device, the sources said. They are also investigating a YouTube account, under the same moniker, that features videos of experiments with homemade explosives. At a press conference on Sunday, authorities said they believe the suspect was attempting to livestream the attack and are looking into what they call a “manifesto.” The suspect was reportedly dealing with depression and had personal relationship issues, law enforcement officials close to the investigation said. Authorities said he was 25 years old and from Twentynine Palms, where they are executing a search warrant. On Saturday, multiple law enforcement tactical officers were seen outside a Twentynine Palms residence, about an hour away from the targeted fertility clinic. The FBI and Palm Springs Police Department had originally held off on identifying the suspect, citing the condition of his body after the blast. The severity of the injuries sustained by those hurt in the blast has not been disclosed, but all have been released from the hospital, officials said Sunday. The blast, which the FBI deemed an act of terrorism, took place at 1199 North Indian Canyon Dr. at around 11 a.m.,according to city officials. The street is home to a number of medical facilities, including Desert Regional Medical Center. The apparent target of the attack, a fertility clinic called American Reproductive Centers (ARC), confirmed in aFacebook postthat a vehicle exploded in the parking lot near its Palm Springs facility. The explosion caused damage to multiple buildings and businesses within a 250-yard blast radius, officials said. Witnesses said the blast was heard and felt miles away. The investigation is intensifying rapidly on multiple fronts, law enforcement officials told NBC News. On Sunday, officials continue forensic examinations of physical evidence at and around the blast zone, while canvassing the area for video footage to help establish a timeline of events leading up to the explosion. Authorities are seeking interviews with family, friends and associates while reviewing social media accounts and online posts that may be linked to the case. At Sunday’s press conference, officials asked for the public’s help in identifying Bartkus’ movements and confirmed he was driving a 2010 silver Ford Fusion. The bombing investigation is likely one of the largest of its kind the FBI’s Southern California field office has had to deal with, said Akil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles office. Palm Springs Police Chief Andy Mills believes the explosion was an isolated incident. “I am absolutely confident that this city is safe,” Mills said Sunday. “There is no continuing threat.”",

    "title": "Sen. Chris Murphy: 'It was a mistake' for Democrats to let Biden stay in the race",
    "article_text": "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Sunday “it was a mistake” for Democrats to allow Joe Biden to remain in the 2024 presidential race for as long as he did, echoing recent comments from other Democrats as the partyreckons with falloutfrom new reporting about the then-president’s mental acuity. “By 2024, the American people had decided that they wanted somebody new. They wanted somebody younger,” Murphy told NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” “And it was a mistake,” the senator said. “It was a mistake for Democrats to not listen to the voters earlier and set up a process that would have gotten us in a position where we could have been more competitive that fall.” Murphy’s comments come just days before the release of “Original Sin,” a book by Axios’ Alex Thompson and CNN’s Jake Tapper that includes interviews with people in Biden’s orbit who say they saw his mental state decline while he was president. It also comes after Axiospublished the full interviewbetween Biden and special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated whether Biden improperly stored classified documents following his time as vice president in the Obama administration. The interview, conducted in October 2023, led to Hur’s assertion in a February 2024 report outlining his decision not to charge Biden that the former president was an “elderly man with a poor memory.” The newly released audio of the interview confirmed Biden’s memory lapses during Hur’s questioning. Murphy defended Biden on Sunday, saying that he had not read “Original Sin” but that he worked with the former president closely on legislation in 2023 and “I saw a president who was in control.” “That’s my experience,” Murphy added. “But I admit that by 2024 the American public had made up their mind, right, that they wanted the Democratic Party to nominate somebody new, and it was absolutely a mistake for the party to not listen to those voters.” Still, Murphy conceded that “we all bear responsibility” for how the election turned out, with President Donald Trump returning to the White House for a second term after beating then-Vice President Kamala Harris. “I think, you know, we maybe didn’t listen as early as we should have, in part, because we have immense loyalty to this man who had led this country out of a pandemic, who had been maybe the most prodigious legislator as a president,” Murphy told “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker. “Ultimately, in retrospect, you can’t defend what the Democratic Party did,” the senator added, saying the country was now “stuck” with Trump and “we should have given ourselves a better chance to win.” Ultimately, in July 2024, Biden did step down from his re-election campaign, quickly endorsing Harris and clearing the way for her to accept the Democratic nomination weeks later at the Democratic National Convention. But Murphy said Sunday that an open primary would have benefited the party’s prospects. “In retrospect, the president should have gotten out of the race earlier,” he said. “There’s no doubt that the Democratic Party would have been better served by having the ability to have an open primary. Kamala Harris probably would have done very well in that process, but in retrospect, we lost.” His remarks echoed those that Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., made to “Meet the Press” last week,where she told Welker, “Yes, we would have been served better by a primary. But we are where we are.” On ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., made a similar point. “Look, the Democratic Party needs to be honest,” Khanna said. “There’s a sense people want honesty. They want to restore a sense of public service in light of what has come out. It’s painfully obvious President Biden should not have run.” Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a staunch Biden ally credited with resuscitating his 2020 presidential campaign, held the line in his defense of Biden on Sunday, telling Tapper on CNN that he still believes Biden could have emerged victorious last year. \"I thought that back then. I still think that,\" Clyburn said. \"It's not about age; it's about the ability to do the job. And I never saw anything that allowed me to think that Joe Biden was not able to do the job. Just that simple.\" But even Clyburn acknowledged that Biden's fiercest supporters have since expressed concern over his health. \"When they look back at those tapes, they remember the debate, and they are concerned as to whether or not that was, in fact, just an incident or whether that was a condition that was being kept from people,\" Clyburn told Tapper. \"I have no way of knowing which one is true.\"",

    "title": "JD Vance's Vatican visits center his Catholicism in his vice presidency",
    "article_text": "VATICAN CITY — After leaving the Marines and beginning his higher education,Vice President JD Vancedrifted into atheism — struggling,he would eventually write, with feelings of “irrelevance” in his faith and with “a desire for social acceptance among American elites.” Vance, who later converted to Catholicism, this weekend made his second trip to the Vatican in less than a month. On the first visit, Vance met withPope Francison Easter, hours before he died. On Sunday, Vance led a U.S. delegation at the inaugural Mass of the first U.S.-born pope,Leo XIV. Both pontiffs — Francis during his papacy, Leo in his prior service as Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost — offered veiled buteasily decipherable rebukesof President Donald Trump and Vance’s “America first” worldview. Vance, somewhat uncharacteristically for someone whoso relishes debate, has chosen to politely sidestep criticism. But the circumstances of the last few weeks have put an unexpected spotlight on his religion, reinforcing his status as one of the world’s highest-ranking Catholics in political office. At Sunday’s Mass, the vice president scored a prime seat in the first row to the right of the dais, near delegations from Italy and Peru, where the pope is a naturalized citizen andserved as a bishop and archbishop. In hishomily, delivered in Italian, Leo spoke of “too many wounds caused by hatred, violence, prejudice, the fear of difference, and an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth’s resources and marginalizes the poorest,” according to an English translation provided by the Vatican. Vance and second lady Usha Vance briefly greeted the pope before leaving the Vatican on Sunday. “Of course, the American pope — the United States is very proud of him, very thrilled with him, and certainly our prayers go with him,” Vance said during the opening of a trilateral meeting Sunday afternoon in Rome with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The White House was eager to frame this weekend's visit in historic terms. “Pope Leo XIV is the first American Pope. Vice President Vance is the first Catholic convert to serve as Vice President,” Vance’s office emphasized when announcing the trip. Vance is the second Catholic to serve as vice president, after Joe Biden, who went on to become the second Catholic president, after John F. Kennedy. Biden grew up in the Catholic Church, while Vance came to it as an adult. Joining Vance in Rome and at the Vatican this weekend wasFather Henry Stephan, the priest who baptized him in 2019. After landing in Rome at sunset on Saturday night, Vance’s motorcade first sped to the Basilica of St. Mary Major, where he and the second lady paid their respects at Francis’ tomb. In February,Francis sent a letter to U.S. bishopsthat wasviewed by many as a scoldingof Trump’s immigration policy in general and of Vance’s justification of it in particular. Vance responded by trying to defuse any tensions. Speaking at theNational Catholic Prayer Breakfastthat same month, Vance said that while Francis’ criticism surprised him, the pope was “fundamentally a person who cares about the flock of Christians under his leadership.” The remark came after Vance, who is known for hiscombative online presence, lamented to his audience that the rise of social media was unhealthy for religious discourse. (Vance excusedTrump’s recent postfeaturing an AI image depicting the president as the pope as a joke.) “We are not called as Christians to obsess over every social media controversy that implicates the Catholic Church,” Vance said. “Whether it involves a clergy or a bishop or the Holy Father himself, I think that we should frankly take a page out of the books of our grandparents, who respected our clergy, who looked to them for guidance, but didn’t obsess or fight over every single word that came out of their mouth and entered social media. I don’t think that’s good.” Vance struck a similar tone this month after Leo’s election as pope drew attention to stories he hadshared on social mediaas a cardinal that were critical of Trump and Vance. While wrestling with Leo’s politics inan interview with conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt, Vance offered a nuanced answer and said he prefers “not to play the politicization of the pope game.” Yet for all of Vance’s social media bluster, he telegraphed years before his vice presidency that the papacy is an authority that he is reluctant to cross. Ina 2020 essayhe wrote about his conversion in The Lamp, a Catholic journal, Vance recalled confronting “a conservative Catholic writer about his criticism of the pope.” Vance asserted that “too many American Catholics have failed to show proper deference to the papacy, treating the pope as a political figure to be criticized or praised according to their whims.” Vance’s conversion is a less plumbed part of his past. Aside from The Lamp essay andthoughts he shared with a conservative writer friendwho attended his baptism, away from public audiences, Vance has talked rather sparingly abouthis spiritual journey. At the Catholic prayer breakfast in February, Vance noted his interfaith marriage to Usha,who is Hindu, and how they are raising their three children Catholic while allowing them to decide when to be baptized. He said his most exciting moment last November — the month he was elected vice president — was when his 7-year-old son chose to be baptized. “One of the things that I try to remind myself of as a convert is that there is a lot I don’t know,” Vance said that day. “When I was a kid, we used to call new converts to the faith baby Christians. And I recognize very much that I am a baby Catholic, that there are things about the faith that I don’t know. And so I try to be humble as best I can when I talk about the faith publicly, because of course I’m not always going to get it right.”",

    "title": "Centrist wins Romania's tense presidential race over hard-right nationalist",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Supporters of presidential candidate Nicusor Dan celebrate on the street after polls closed for the second round of the country's presidential election redo in Bucharest, Romania on Sunday.Vadim Ghirda/APhide caption Pro-European Union candidate Nicusor Dan has won Romania's closely watched presidential runoff against a hard-right nationalist, nearly complete electoral data shows. A huge turnout Sunday played a key role in the tense election that many viewed as a geopolitical choice between East or West. The race pitted front-runner George Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, against Dan, the incumbent mayor of Bucharest. It was held months after the cancelation of the previous election plunged Romania into its worst political crisis in decades. After 10.7 million of 11.6 million votes were counted, Dan was ahead with 54.19%, while Simion trailed at 45.81%, according to official data. In the first-round vote on May 4, Simion won almost double the votes as Dan, and many local surveys had predicted he would secure the presidency. But in a swing that appeared to be a repudiation of Simion's more skeptical approach to the EU, which Romania joined in 2007, Dan picked up almost 900,000 more votes to solidly defeat his opponent in the final round. Thousands gathered outside Dan's headquarters near Bucharest City Hall to await the final results, chanting \"Nicusor!\" Each time his lead widened as more results came in, the crowd, many waving the flags of Europe, would erupt in cheers. When voting closed at 9 p.m. local time (1800 GMT), official electoral data showed a 64% voter turnout. About 1.64 million Romanians abroad at specially set-up polling stations participated in the vote, some 660,000 more than in the first round. In the first round on May 4, the final turnout stood at 53% of eligible voters. Dan told the media that \"elections are not about politicians\" but about communities and that in Sunday's vote, \"a community of Romanians has won, a community that wants a profound change in Romania.\" \"When Romania goes through difficult times, let us remember the strength of this Romanian society,\" he said. \"There is also a community that lost today's elections. A community that is rightly outraged by the way politics has been conducted in Romania up to now.\" Presidential candidate Nicusor Dan exits a voting cabin before casting his vote in the second round of the country's presidential election redo in Fagaras, Romania on Sunday.Eduard Vinatoru/APhide caption Shortly after 11 p.m., Dan emerged onto the balcony of his headquarters and waved to his thousands of supporters who had gathered along the length of a boulevard in central Bucharest, eliciting an ecstatic roar from the crowd. At the raucous rally, Ruxandra Gheorghiu told The Associated Press that she felt overwhelmed by the result. \"I was so scared that our European force is near the end … we are still in Europe and we are not fighting for this right,\" she said. \"I cannot explain the feeling right now.\" Romania's political landscape was upended last year when a top court voided the previous election in which far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped first-round polls, following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow denied. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sent her \"warmest congratulations\" to Dan and noted that Romanians \"turned out massively\" to vote. \"They have chosen the promise of an open, prosperous Romania in a strong Europe,\" she said in a post on X. \"Together let's deliver on that promise.\" Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician who rose to prominence as a civic activist fighting against illegal real estate projects. In 2026, he founded the reformist Save Romania Union party but later left, and ran independently on a pro-European Union ticket reaffirming Western ties, support for Ukraine and fiscal reform. Standing on the steps of Romania's colossal Communist-era parliament building after polls closed, Simion had predicted a victory, and said that Georgescu was \"supposed to be the president\" before last year's election was annulled. He also called for vigilance against election fraud, but said that overall he was satisfied with the conduct of the vote. Years of endemic corruption and growing anger toward Romania's political establishment have fueled a surge in support for anti-establishment and hard-right figures, reflecting a broader pattern across Europe. Both Simion and Dan have made their political careers railing against Romania's old political class. Cristian Andrei, a Bucharest-based political consultant, told the AP that Romanians \"rejected hate and reactionary politics and embraced the pro-western direction\" for their country. \"It is a win for the optimistic Romania, but there is a large part of voters that are really upset with the direction of the country,\" he said. \"Romania comes out of this election very divided, with a totally new political landscape, where older political parties are challenged to adapt to a new reality.\" In the lead-up to Sunday's vote, Simion's rhetoric had raised some concerns that he wouldn't respect the outcome if he lost. In the early afternoon, he told reporters that his team was confident in a \"landslide victory,\" if the election was \"free and fair.\" However, he repeated allegations of voting irregularities among Romanian citizens in neighboring Moldova and said that his party members would conduct a parallel vote count after polls closed. He told The Associated Press that the ballot so far had proceeded properly. Adrian Nadin, a 51-year-old musician who supported Georgescu in the previous election, said that he chose Simion. \"A part of Romania prefers conservatism,\" he said. \"It is very important because the next president will be our image in Europe, and (decide) how Romania will evolve in the next five years,\" said Luminita Petrache, a 32-year-old financial crimes analyst. \"I hope for changes in Romania in good ways.\" The president is elected for a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in matters of national security and foreign policy. The winner of Sunday's race will be charged with nominating a new prime minister after Marcel Ciolacu stepped down following the failure of his coalition's candidate to advance to the runoff. After coming fourth in last year's canceled race, Simion backed Georgescu, who was banned in March from running in the election redo. Simion then surged to front-runner in the May 4 first round after becoming the standard-bearer for the hard right. A former activist who campaigned for reunification with neighboring Moldova, Simion says he would focus on reforms: slashing red tape and reducing bureaucracy and taxes. Still, he insists that restoring democracy is his priority, returning \"the will of the people.\" His AUR party says it stands for \"family, nation, faith, and freedom\" and rose to prominence in a 2020 parliamentary election. It has since grown to become the second-largest party in the Romanian legislature. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Luke Garrett Former President Joe Biden speaks at Joint Base Andrews.Samuel Corum/Getty Imageshide caption Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, which has metastasized to the bone, according to a statement from his personal office. Biden, 82, was seen for further tests last week after a finding of a prostate nodule. The cancer has a Gleason score of 9, representing a more aggressive case. (Gleason scores combine how many cancerous cells are seen in a needle-biopsy tissue sample, and how aggressive the cells appear to be.) \"While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,\" according to the statement, which says Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options. For U.S. men, prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death and the most common cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Biden left office in January after finishing his first term as president. Facing intense scrutiny over his age, he decided over the summer todrop out of the 2024 presidential raceand endorse then-Vice President Kamala Harris.

Harris said in a post on X that she and her husband, Doug Emhoff, were saddened to hear of Biden's diagnosis. \"Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,\" Harris wrote. \"We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery.\" Joe Hernandez contributed to this report.

    "title": "FBI says primary suspect in Calif. fertility clinic bombing likely died in the blast",
    "article_text": "By Joe Hernandez A damaged building is seen after an explosion in Palm Springs, Calif., on Saturday.Eric Thayer/APhide caption Guy Edward Bartkus, 25, has been identified as the primary suspect in the fatal explosion outside a California fertility clinic Saturday morning. Investigators also said that they suspect Bartkus was the sole fatality in the Palm Springs blast, which injured four others. \"We are working through some other technical means to positively identify the decedent here, but we believe at this moment based on the evidence that we've gathered that that is Mr. Bartkus as the decedent here,\" Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office, said at a Sunday morning press conference. Davis reiterated that law enforcement is treating the bombing as an act of terrorism and said investigators have gathered some clues showing Bartkus' state of mind, including online posts and other writings that investigators are now examining. \"The subject had nihilistic ideations, and this was a targeted attack against the IVF facility.\" FBI spokesperson Laura Eimiller confirmed that the agency was also investigating evidence \"indicating antinatalist views.\" Antinatalism refers to a belief system that suggests it is wrong to have children. Davis added that investigators believe Bartkus was attempting to live stream the bombing. Law enforcement officials also executed a search warrant in Bartkus's hometown of Twentynine Palms, nearly 60 miles northeast of Palm Springs. Davis said this was the first time Bartkus had appeared on the FBI's radar but that he may have had contacts with other law enforcement agencies. The bomb used was powerful enough \"to throw pieces of vehicle hundreds of feet in the air and then several blocks away. You can use your imagination for how big that that bomb device was,\" Davis said. He would not comment on the type of materials used in the bomb, saying it was still under investigation. Bartkus was driving a silver 2010 Ford Fusion sedan, Davis said. A firefighter stands at the scene of an explosion in Palm Springs, Calif., on Saturday.Eric Thayer/APhide caption Palm Springs Police Chief Andrew Mills said Sunday that the public was not in any more danger. \"I am absolutely confident that this city is safe. There is no continuing threat to our community as a result of this incident,\" he said. American Reproductive Centers said Saturdayin a post on Facebookthat a vehicle had exploded in the parking lot near its Palm Springs facility earlier in the day. The clinic said no staff members were hurt and there was no damage to any of its eggs, embryos and reproductive material. \"This moment has shaken us—but it has not stopped us,\" the post reads. \"We will continue to serve with strength, love, and the hope that brings new life into the world.\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said Saturday evening that she had been briefed on the explosion. \"We are working to learn more, but let me be clear: the Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America,\" she saidin a post on X. \"Violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable.\" Bomb technicians were scouring the blast site over the weekend as part of the ongoing investigation, which was being led by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

    "title": "SNL's 50th season proved it's still relevant. Can it stay that way?",
    "article_text": "Eric Deggans On Saturday Night Live's cold open, James Austin Johnson played President Donald Trump and Emil Wakim played Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a sketch about Trump's Middle East trip.Will Heath/NBChide caption After watching a storied comedy brand finish one of its most creatively successful seasons in recent memory, I couldn't help but think of a pressing question: What's next forSaturday Night Live? No matter how well things go on a given episode or in a given season, it isn't long before that question re-emerges — especially given how eager some in the entertainment press have always been to pen the show's eulogy. In a way, it's the biggest drawback for a show that boasts the potential of reinventing itself every week. Ironically, Saturday's episode didn't give many hints about the ultimate answer, despite capping SNL's highly-hyped 50th anniversary season. Even thoughWeekend Updateco-host Colin Jost's wife Scarlett Johansson hosted this year's season finale – boosting rumors that he and onscreen partner Michael Che might announce their departure then – they didn't, and everything unfolded in a typical fashion featuring a star who has become a regular, game contributor. (Though Jost did hand his wife a bouquet of red roses during the final goodbye segment.) The numbers, provided by NBC, tell a story of success: they say SNL will finish its season as the top broadcast entertainment program among viewers aged 18 to 49. (That's a relatively youthful and ad-friendly group for TV watchers.) The network also says this season has averaged 8.2 million viewers each week across all platforms. So, as much as some critics may still want to shade the show, SNL remains one of the most powerful brands in comedy. But following up the hype of its 50th anniversary next season may be its biggest remaining challenge. Here's where I think SNL stands – and questions that remain – as it wraps up one of its most successful seasons in recent memory. The biggest parlor game among SNL fans at the end of a season is playing\"who's leaving the cast this year?\"Johansson even joked in her musical monologue that castmember Sarah Sherman was leaving, to Sherman's mock astonishment. And the biggest rumor before Saturday's broadcast was thatWeekend Updatehosts and veteran writers Jost and Che mightbe out the doorafter cementing their status as the longest-running anchors of SNL's newscast parody. Colin Jost and Michael Che during Weekend Update in December.Will Heath/NBChide caption In recent years,Updatehas emerged asthe most reliable segment in an often-uneven show, as Che and Jost honed their oddball chemistry as an uncaring provocateur paired with a snarky guy willing to parody his own privilege. Assuming they might still leave, let me breeze past obvious successor suggestions — like castmember and frequentUpdate contributor Michael Longfellow — to provide a suggestion from left field: Josh Johnson, the prolific standup comic andDaily Showcorrespondent. It's true that Johnson, who has built a growing fanbase with a long string ofimmensely popular YouTube videos, already seems to be developing a career on his own terms. But taking the reins of a comedy institution likeUpdatecould boost his work to a new level while pointing the way toward SNL's future. Who knew an SNL bit could spark real-life gossip about one of TV's biggest hits? After Sherman parodiedThe White Lotusstar Aimee Lou Wood in the sketch dubbed\"The White Potus,\"Woodcalled the portrayal\"mean and unfunny\" on social media and loads of coverage followed. (It didn't help that Wood'sLotusco-star Walton Goggins initiallycomplimented the sketchon SNL's Instagram page, fueling rumors of a rift between the two.) Sarah Sherman during \"The White Potus\" sketch on April 12, 2025.Holland Rainwater/NBChide caption And, in a separate controversy, a bit Ego Nwodim led playing a hacky standup comic during anUpdatesegment prompted the audience to shout out a curse word in unison, unplanned. Nwodim says she eventually talked toexecutive producer Lorne Michaelsto see if the show was going to be fined — andin a bit during Saturday'sUpdateplaying that character again, she was a little more careful about what cues she gave the audience. But that earlier bit also produced one of the most talked-about moments of the season. Proof that SNL can still make news even when the subject isn't its landmark anniversary. At age 80, Michaels seems like the Highlander of network television – an enduring force, forever the show's wise and steady hand, guiding events from behind-the-scenes. However he has divided authority among his lieutenants, things seem to be working – the show produced a string of consistently good episodes in 2025, particularly in programs featuring guests hosts Jack Black and Jon Hamm. Those successes, combined with the reputation-boosting triumph of the 50th anniversary celebrations, should be enough to quiet the \"when is Lorne retiring?\" rumors for at least another season. (AsI have said before, when the inevitable retirement does happen, if the show doesn't end, I think Seth Meyers would be an awesome successor, or perhaps Jost.) It feels like a lifetime ago whenthen-Vice President Harris sat across from Maya Rudolph in a sketchairing just before November's presidential election. That was also the episode that gave us a cavalcade of celebrity guest stars playing political figures, including Dana Carvey as then-President Joe Biden, Andy Samberg as Harris' hubby Doug Emhoff and Jim Gaffigan as Harris' running mate Tim Walz. Maya Rudolph and then-Vice President Kamala Harris during the cold open on November 2, 2024.Will Heath/NBChide caption But too few of those big comedic swings seemed to hit their mark this season. Amid the shock of keeping up with the second Trump administration, SNL only intermittently captured the chaos of the times. Even the political sketches centered on James Austin Johnson's impeccable impression of the president sometimes could feel like a transcript of the real-life POTUS' scattershot musings — especially in Saturday's \"cold open\" sketch, which satirized President Trump's Middle East trip a day after the real-life POTUS flew back from it. (\"The White Potus\" sketch, its Wood impression notwithstanding, was a brilliant step up.) The lesson here: perhaps it's time to stop expecting SNL to nail the political moment every week and give them space to find new angles. As late night TV erodes in other timeslots and younger viewers desert traditional television platforms, SNL faced a season where it had to argue for its relevance while also paying tribute to an astonishing comedy legacy. (The nitpicker in me is compelled to note that SNL's 50th anniversary technically isn't until later this year;the show debutedon Oct. 11, 1975.) But the massive celebration surrounding its 50th anniversary season, which started last September, elevated SNL by reminding audiences what a cultural institution it truly is. Indeed, the show's history was too big to fit into one special, with its three-and-a-half hour prime time extravaganza in February preceded by a commemorative concert,Questlove's brilliant documentary on the show's musical historyand a four-part docuseries on Peacock. The giant-size celebration served as a potent reminder that, frustrating as SNL's inconsistencies can be week-to-week, there is no other program like it on American television – a live showcase for the best TV comedy featuring top performers reacting to pop culture and politics very nearly in real time. Small wonder there's a six-episode version of SNLplanned for British TV next year. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Zelenskyy meets Vance in Rome, hours after Russia's largest drone attack on Ukraine",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Emergency Service, firefighters put out the fire following Russia's drone attack in the Kyiv region, Ukraine, Sunday, May 18, 2025.AP/Ukrainian Emergency Servicehide caption KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with top U.S. officials and European leaders in Rome on Sunday, part of stepped-up diplomatic efforts ahead of a high-stakes phone call Monday between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war in Ukraine. Zelenskyy spoke with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the U.S. ambassador's residence, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he had spoken both to Zelenskyy and to Rubio on the sidelines of the new pope's inauguration. Merz said that he had also agreed with the leaders of France and Britain \"that we will speak again with the American president in preparation for this conversation.\" \"My firm impression is that both the Europeans and the Americans are determined to work together, but now also in a goal-oriented manner, to ensure that this terrible war ends soon,\" Merz told reporters in Rome. Trump said he plans to speak by phone Monday with Putin, and will then speak to Zelenskyy and leaders of various NATO countries, about ending the war in Ukraine. The intensified diplomacy came as Russia launched its largest drone barrage against Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, after the first direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in years failed to yield a ceasefire. Putin spurned Zelenskyy's offer to meet face-to-face in Turkey after he himself proposed direct negotiations — although not at the presidential level — as an alternative to a 30-day ceasefire urged by Ukraine and its Western allies, including the U.S. Talks in Istanbul on Friday broke up after less than two hours without a ceasefire, although both sides agreed on exchanging 1,000 prisoners of war each, according to the heads of both delegations. Ukraine's intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said on Ukrainian television Saturday that the exchange could happen as early as next week. Russia fired a total of 273 exploding drones and decoys, Ukraine's air force said Sunday. Of those, 88 were intercepted and a further 128 lost, likely having been electronically jammed. The attacks targeted the country's Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions. Yuriy Ihnat, Head of the Communications Department of the Ukrainian Air Force, told The Associated Press that the barrage was the biggest drone attack since the start of the full-scale invasion. Russia's previous largest known single drone attack was on the eve of the war's third anniversary, when Russia pounded Ukraine with 267 drones. Kyiv regional Gov. Mykola Kalashnyk said a a 28-year-old woman was killed in a drone attack on the region and three other people, including a 4-year-old child, were wounded. Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down seven Ukrainian drones overnight, and a further 18 on Sunday morning. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "These Democratic governors are trying to curb health care for unauthorized immigrants",
    "article_text": "By Dana Ferguson , Laura Fitzgerald Calif. Gov. Gavin Newsom presents his revised 2025-2026 state budget during a news conference in Sacramento, Calif., Wednesday, May 14, 2025.Rich Pedroncelli/APhide caption Democratic governors in states offering health insurance coverage for immigrants without legal status are proposing to roll back coverage that they signed into law. As states grapple with budget holes, efforts to limit access to the programs are becoming a common thread. Debates about rolling back coverage or eliminating it entirely come as Congress considers a proposal that wouldreduce state Medicaid funds from 90% to 80%if they offer health insurance coverage to immigrants without proper authorization. On Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced thathe wants to freeze new enrollmentsfor unauthorized people 19 or older on Medi-Cal, California's insurance plan for lower-income people, and charge a $100 monthly premium starting in January 2026. There would be exceptions for pregnant people and emergency care. \"I don't want to be in this position, but we are in this position,\" Newsom said. California expanded Medi-Cal to include all adults without legal status in 2024, and 1.6 million immigrants in California currently receive health insurance through the program. Under the proposal, those already enrolled by year's end would still be eligible for coverage, but other adults without legal status couldn't enroll. Republicans, who were against the program's expansion from the start, have criticized Newsom for continuing to spend on coverage under his latest proposal. \"The governor showed his priorities,\" said California Assembly Minority Leader James Gallagher, a Republican. \"He wants to continue to spend on health care for illegal immigrants. Billions and billions of dollars.\" The Democratic governor also faces pushback from state lawmakers in his own party, including members of the Latino Caucus in the Legislature, who say they'll fight to maintain some form of coverage for those without legal status during the final month of budget negotiations. \"We can look at options for budget cuts elsewhere,\" said Democratic state senator Lena Gonzalez, who chairs the Legislative Latino Caucus. \"We can be a little bit more mindful of how we do this without always having to look at our most underserved communities.\" Experts, lawmakers, and Newsom point out that the state pays for coverage either way. Those without health insurance often seek care in emergency rooms, so some lawmakers and advocates initially pushed for expanding access so people could have regular care, like doctor's visits and prescription medications. In states where lawmakers granted Medicaid access for undocumented immigrants, hospital administrators and faith groups, along with immigrant advocates, have helped push for the expansion of benefits. That's true in Minnesota, where the proposal to strip the state's health insurance coverage for adults in the country without authorization emerged as part of a compromise budget framework. That drew immediate opposition from some Democrats and immigrant advocates. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks at a town hall meeting at the DeYor Performing Arts Center on April 7, 2025, in Youngstown, Ohio.Jeff Swensen/Getty Images North Americahide caption Thursday, a group of Democratic lawmakers banged on the door to the room where Gov. Tim Walz, a former vice presidential candidate, was laying out his budget plan with legislative leaders. They yelled out, \"You're killing our communities,\" and said they would vote against the provision to make adult immigrants without legal status ineligible for MinnesotaCare, the state's Medicaid program, in 2026. Under the proposed budget, children would still be eligible for coverage. In 2023, Democrats advanced a bill expanding public insurance coverage for people in the country without legal status and Walz signed it into law. The program took effect in January, and more than 20,000 people without legal status have enrolled, including about 3,000 children. Walz and Democratic legislative leaders said they opposed the change but had to accept it as part of a budget framework. The state Legislature is nearly split, with 101 Democrats and 100 Republicans, so they said they needed to accept the proposal that was a priority for GOP lawmakers. \"I'm not going to sugarcoat how difficult this was,\" Walz said as lawmakers pounded on the door outside his news conference. \"We didn't expect everybody to be happy in this; I think many of us compromised.\" State House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican, agreed that it was a compromise that could help plug a projected $6 billion budget deficit over the next four years. \"It's not a measure of being uncaring. It's a fiscal issue, and there are still opportunities,\" Demuth said. \"They can still join the private market, so it's not that health care is being denied in any way,\" she added. \"We had to make hard decisions in that room, and when we looked at numbers and we looked going forward, this was a compromise that we were all able to come to any negotiation. No one walks out completely happy.\" Some Democratic lawmakers who fought for the program say they'll oppose the rollback. Without their votes, the measure in a broader health budget bill could stall. \"Although we protected the children, which is a very noble thing to do, those children will lose moms, dads, grandfathers, aunts, uncles, siblings,\" said Rep. Cedrick Frazier, a co-chair of the Minnesota People of Color and Indigenous Caucus. \"That is what we are faced here with today.\" If Minnesota lawmakers can't pass a budget before July 1, they could face a state government shutdown.

    "article_text": "Daniel Estrin Israeli soldiers move tanks around staging area near the border with the Gaza Strip, in southern Israel, Sunday, May 18, 2025.Ariel Schalit/APhide caption TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel's military on Sunday said it has launched a new ground offensive in Gaza, as the sides entered their first round of serious ceasefire talks in months. The ground operation comes following an intensified week of Israeli airstrikes – which Gaza health officials say have killed around 500 Palestinians in the last five days, including many women and children. \"They're gone,\" wailed Raoutha Naser in a Gaza City morgue, mourning her sister and her sister's children, who were killed in an Israeli strike Sunday morning. It killed twenty Palestinians, including five women and five children, Gaza health officials said. Israel says it targeted hundreds of Hamas sites and killed dozens of militants, and is vowing to gradually expand its offensive to increase military pressure on Hamas. Israel is also planning to renew food aid to Gaza, with a U.S.-backed initiative aiming to begin aid distribution on May 24, according to a person familiar with the group's plans, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement by Israel. Israeli officials estimate that Palestinian civilians have seven to ten days left of food in Gaza, according to a second person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly and shared the assessment with NPR on condition of anonymity. Palestinians carry the bodies of their relatives killed in an Israeli army airstrike, during their funeral in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, Sunday, May 18, 2025.Abdel Kareem Hana/APhide caption Israel says ceasefire talks with Hamas began Saturday in Qatar and are continuing. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS's Face the Nation on Saturday that the U.S. is \"actively engaged\" in the ceasefire talks, which are aiming to try to free more Israeli hostages. Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi announced talks were ongoing, with no preconditions. Israel's prime minister's office says it is willing to negotiate the terms of a permanent end of the war, not just a temporary ceasefire. Israel's refusal to commit to ending the war has been a major stumbling block to reaching a ceasefire. It was unclear whether the talks would lead to a breakthrough toward a ceasefire in the 19-month war in Gaza. Israel's prime minister's office said the end of the war would require the \"exile of Hamas militants and the disarmament\" of Gaza, which Hamas has so far refused. The sides are negotiating a two month ceasefire, on the condition that about ten living hostages are released on the first day of the ceasefire, according to a person who was briefed on the matter. The diplomacy comes after an extraordinary week in the region. Hamas released the last living U.S. citizen held hostage in Gaza, saying it was a goodwill gesture to President Trump as he visited Gulf Arab allies. Israel sent ceasefire negotiators to Qatar, as it ratched up airstrikes in Gaza. Members of the Nasser family sit with the bodies of their relatives at the morgue of Shifa hospital in Gaza City following an airstrike that killed 20 Palestinians according to Gaza health officials, on May 18, 2025.Anas Baba/NPRhide caption Palestinians in Jabalia in north Gaza say the Israeli bombardment, coupled with military leaflets ordering them to flee, is the most intense series of strikes since the very beginning of the war, when Israel began its retaliation for the Hamas attacks of October 2023. \"This time is definitely different from the times before,\" said Kareem Joudeh, a resident of Jabalia. \"Clear evacuation orders indicate the seriousness and intentions of Israel in this operation, and people are sensing the seriousness of the situation.\" Families fled on donkey carts, in cars and on foot, taking mattresses and what little food they had left. Some fleeing the north also took with them the bodies of loved ones killed in recent strikes, as a key north Gaza hospital, the Indonesian Hospital, went out of service amid Israeli bombardment. In the shade of a partially damaged building, the seven-member Abu Nassar family took a break from their journey evacuating south, as airstrikes echoed in the distance. Majdi Abu Nassar said they fled after Israeli tanks rolled up near their home in Jabalia. He said he saw a fire blazing in the Indonesian Hospital nearby. He said he was carrying spoiled and infested flour, beans and lentils. \"We have no food,\" Abu Nassar said. Nadia Mukhaimar, 62, inspects the destruction of her house after an Israeli airstrike hit her neighbor's house, killing 20 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, in Jabalia, northern Gaza.Anas Baba/NPRhide caption Israel has been blocking all food, medicine and supplies into Gaza for 11 weeks now, the longest ever total blockade it has ever imposed on Gaza. Israel says its purpose is to pressure Hamas to agree to a ceasefire deal on terms that are favorable to Israel. But Israel is relenting amid international pressure to allow food into the territory. A United Nations-backed group of experts on hunger said there was a risk of famine in Gaza.The U.S.-led initiative tapped to distribute the aid is a charity run by a U.S. military veteran called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The United Nations and its partner aid groups, which have run aid distribution in Gaza throughout the war, said they would refuse to participate in the new aid initiative, calling it an Israeli plan to weaponize aid for military purposes. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says it would operate according to humanitarian principles. In order to receive aid under a proposed Israeli plan, Gaza's population would be forced to move south in a new zone cordoned off by Israel's military. This is to prevent Hamas members from access to aid, an Israeli defense official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to divulge details. NPR's Anas Baba reported from Gaza City, and Abu Bakr Bashir reported from London. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Losing faith: Rural religious colleges are among the most endangered",
    "article_text": "FromHechinger Report By Jon Marcus Wednesday night Mass at St. Ambrose University attracts a congregation of mostly students. On one recent evening, they added a prayer for the university's new partnership with Mount Mercy University.Mike Rundle for The Hechinger Reporthide caption DAVENPORT, Iowa — The Catholic prayer for the faithful echoed off the limestone walls and marble floor of the high-ceilinged chapel. The prayer implored God to comfort the poor and the hungry. The sick and the suffering. The anxious and the afraid. Then it took an unexpected turn. \"Lord, hear our prayer for St. Ambrose and Mount Mercy University,\" the young voice said, \"that the grace of the Holy Spirit may help us to follow God's plan for our new partnership.\" The speaker, a student, was talking about efforts to unite St. Ambrose University, where this weeknight Mass was being held, with fellow Catholic university Mount Mercy. Small religious schools in rural states are shutting down at an accelerating rate, a fate these two are attempting to avoid. \"Lord, hear our prayer,\" responded the congregation of her classmates, many in St. Ambrose-branded T-shirts and hoodies. The two universities are among the many religiously affiliated colleges that disproportionately serve rural America and are facing declining enrollment and financial challenges. The troubles threaten to further diminish access to higher education for rural students, who say they appreciate their colleges' personal touch and religious values. Our Mother of Sorrows Grotto on the campus of Mount Mercy University. The university is combining with St. Ambrose University, another Catholic institution, as small, rural and religiously affiliated colleges face enrollment declines.Mike Rundle for The Hechinger Reporthide caption \"I came from a small town, so I didn't really want to go bigger,\" said Alaina Bina, a junior majoring in nursing at Mount Mercy. She said she picked the university because she liked its small, hilly campus. \"Even when I came here on a tour, people would say 'Hi' to each other. You just know everyone, and that's kind of how it is in a small town too.\" Combining with St. Ambrose \"was kind of nerve-racking at the beginning,\" Bina said, \"because it's like, 'Oh, this is a lot of change.'\" But the heads of both St. Ambrose and Mount Mercy, which is 90 minutes away in Cedar Rapids, said they've watched as other religiously affiliated colleges — athletic rivals and institutions that employed their friends and former colleagues — closed. With falling numbers of college applicants, especially in the Midwest, \"we just don't have the demographics anymore,\" said St. Ambrose President Amy Novak. Now, asfewer graduates emerge from high schools, combining forces is a way to forestall \"the reality that we might all see in five or seven years.\" For many other small, religiously affiliated institutions, time has already run out. More than half the 79 nonprofit colleges and universities that have closed or merged since 2020, or announced that they will close or merge, were religiously affiliated, according to a Hechinger Report analysis of news coverage andfederal data. More than 30 that are still in business are on a U.S. Education Department list of institutions considered \"not financially responsible\" because of comparatively low cash reserves and net income and high levels of debt. Some small, religiously affiliated institutions that are not on these lists are also showing signs of strain. Saint Augustine's University in North Carolina, which is Episcopal, has 200 students, down from 1,100 two years ago, and haslost its accreditation. The 166-year-old St. Francis College in New York City, hassacked a quarter of its staff. Saint Louis University in Missouri, one of the United States' oldest Catholic universities,laid off 20 employees, eliminated 130 unfilled faculty and staff positions and sold off its medical practice after running a deficit. Alaina Bina, a junior nursing major at Mount Mercy University, said she chose the religiously affiliated school because she liked that it was small: \"Even when I came here on a tour, people would say 'Hi' to each other.\"Mike Rundle for The Hechinger Reporthide caption Other religious campuses making cuts or facing financial headwinds include Bluffton University in Ohio, St. Norbert College in Wisconsin and Georgetown College in Kentucky. Among those that are also merging to buttress themselves against demographic and financial challenges are Ursuline College in Ohio and Gannon University in Erie, Pennsylvania. Both are Catholic. Spring Hill College in Alabama and Rockhurst University in Missouri, also both Catholic,are teaming upto offer more academic programs, though they will remain independent. More than a fifth of colleges and universities in the United States, or 849 out of 3,893,are religiously affiliated, according to the most recent figures from the National Center for Education Statistics. The threats to them are getting new attention. Presidents of 20 Catholic universities and colleges met in November in Chicago at a conference sponsored by DePaul University. \"The intent was to think about a blueprint for the future of Catholic higher education,\" including more partnerships, shared services and other kinds of alliances, said Donna Carroll, president of the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities. \"Survival of the fittest is not the strategy that will advance the common good of Catholic higher education. We have to work together.\" The American Council on Education, the principal association of universities and colleges, last year launched a Commission on Faith-Based Colleges and Universities, with leaders of what has since grown to 17 institutions, including Pepperdine, Brigham Young and Yeshiva universities and the University of Notre Dame. The commission's goal is \"to increase visibility for the important contributions of religious and faith-based colleges and universities and to foster collaboration\" among them. Some religious colleges and universities are doing fine and even posting enrollment gains — at least in part because of growing political divisions, campus protests and ideological attacks on secular institutions, said David Hoag, president of the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities. Parents are \"wanting to put their son or daughter at a safe place that's going to have a biblical worldview or a way to look at challenges that's not polarized,\" Hoag said. \"At our institutions, you're not going to be seeing protests or things that are happening at many of these [other] universities and colleges. You're going to see them rallying together, whether it's for a sporting event or for a revival or baptisms.\" Other trends also offer some hope to religiously affiliated colleges and universities. A long decline in the proportion of adults who consider themselves affiliated with a religionappears to have leveled off, the Pew Research Center finds. And while enrollment at parochial schools that feed graduates to Catholic universities fellmore than 10%from 2017 to 2021, the most recent year for which a figure is available, the number of students at other kinds of religious primary and secondary schools is up. Even religiously affiliated institutions facing enrollment declines and financial woes fill an important role, their advocates say. They often serve low-income students who are the first in their families to go to college and who are reluctant to enroll at large public universities. Many are in rural areas where access to higher education is limited and is becoming even scarcer as public universities in rural statesmerge or close, orcut dozens of majors. \"I know kids from very small towns around Iowa,\" like the one where he grew up, said Todd Olson, president of Mount Mercy, above the sound of trains crossing Cedar Rapids outside his window. \"This campus is a much more comfortable place for them.\" When Jacob Lange arrived at St. Ambrose from East Dubuque, Ill., and attended a Mass on campus, \"all of a sudden all these new people I had never met were kind of chatting with me, and it was really kind of nice,\" he said. \"It felt like I was kind of included.\" His parents also liked that he decided to go to a Catholic university, Lange said. \"You know, you go to one of these big schools with 25,000 kids, and you're kind of worried about your kid — like, what kind of dumb things is he going to get up to?\" Catholic universities in particular have a slightly higher four-year graduation rate than the national average, according to the Center for Catholic Studies at St. Mary's University in Texas. Graduates have a stronger sense of community purpose, the center found in a survey. Alumni are 9 percentage points more likely to say they participate in civic activities than their counterparts at nonreligious universities and colleges. More students at religiously affiliated than at secular institutions receive financial aid, the American Council on Education says. Three out of 5 get scholarships from the colleges themselves, compared with fewer than 1 in 4 at other kinds of schools. At bothMount MercyandSt. Ambrose, which have about 1,450 and 2,700 students, respectively, 100% get financial aid. But these benefits for students can be vulnerabilities for budgets, said Novak, of St. Ambrose. \"We serve the poor. We educate the poor,\" she said. \"That is a risky financial proposition at the moment for small, regional institutions that are largely tuition driven.\" Combining means Mount Mercy and St. Ambrose will be able to streamline their administrations, consolidate their purchasing and offer a larger collective number of majors and courses, including graduate programs that students from one can continue into at the other. The threats to these campuses in rural areas stem largely from the downturn in the already short supply of high school graduates choosing to enroll. The proportion of such students going straight to college has falleneven more sharplyin many largely rural states. While they're generous with their financial aid, religiously affiliated colleges are also generally more expensive than many other higher education institutions, at a time when many families are questioning the return on their investments in tuition. What students pay in net tuition and fees averages $25,416 a year, according to the American Council on Education. That compares with anaverage net tuition and fees of $16,510at private, nonprofit four-year institutions overall. St. Ambrose and Mount Mercyare teaming upfrom positions of relative strength. Publicly available financial documents suggest that neither faces the immediate enrollment or financial crises that threaten many similar institutions. Nasharia Patterson, Mount Mercy University's student government president, said keeping Mount Mercy's and St. Ambrose's athletic teams separate \"gives us a piece of Mount Mercy specifically to just hold on to.\"Mike Rundle for The Hechinger Reporthide caption But their leaders say they're trying to fend off problems that could arise later. By joining forces, each can increase its number of programs while lowering operating costs. The reaction among students and alumni has been mixed. Students worried about what name would appear on their degrees and whether sports teams that once competed against each other would be merged. The degrees will still say \"Mount Mercy\" or \"St. Ambrose,\" and Novak and Olson promised to keep their athletics programs separate and even add a sport at Mount Mercy: football, beginning in 2026. Combining sports teams \"would not be wise at all from a business perspective,\" Olson said, because they are \"a powerful enrollment driver\" for both schools. \"Honestly, this was probably the biggest student concern,\" said Nasharia Patterson, the student government president at Mount Mercy, who was wearing a brace on her wrist from an awkward back-tuck basket catch during cheer practice. Keeping the athletics teams \"gives us a piece of Mount Mercy specifically to just hold on to.\" Among alumni, meanwhile, \"there's mixed feelings\" about what's happening to their alma mater, said Sarah Watson, a leadership development consultant who graduated from Mount Mercy in 2008. Still, she said, \"I know the great challenges that higher ed is facing right now. It's not just Mount Mercy. It's not just St. Ambrose. It's the bigger schools too. Enrollment numbers have dropped. The desire to go to a traditional four-year college is just not quite what it used to be.\" For Mount Mercy, which was founded by an order of nuns in 1928, Watson asked, \"If we don't do this, what's the alternative? We want to be around for another hundred years.\" After all, said Novak, St. Ambrose's president, \"to watch universities close across the heartland because we can't make it work will leave our communities fallow.\" Carroll, of the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, said that many other religiously affiliated institutions are closely watching what's happening at St. Ambrose and Mount Mercy. \"It's a leap of faith,\" she said. \"And who better to take a leap of faith than a Catholic institution?\" Contact writer Jon Marcus at 212-678-7556 orjmarcus@hechingerreport.org.

    "title": "A study finds stacking bricks differently could help this country fight air pollution",
    "article_text": "By Jonathan Lambert Smoke comes out from kilns at a brickfield on the outskirt of Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 6, 2021.Ahmed Salahuddin/NurPhoto via Getty Images/NurPhotohide caption During the dry winter months in Bangladesh, thousands of workers shovel millions of tons of coal into kilns across the country. As columns of hand-packed bricks bake and harden, dark plumes of smoke pour out of more than 8,000 smokestacks that mark the skyline of both rural and urban areas. \"It's a lot of black smoke, impacting the workers and nearby villagers, but also the overall air quality of the region,\" saidSameer Maithel, an engineer with Greentech Knowledge Solutions, a consulting firm in Delhi, India. Bangladesh's air consistently ranks among the most polluted on Earth. Brick kilns contribute anywhere from 10 to 40% of the tiny particles that make up that pollution. Those particles can enter our lungs and even our bloodstream, causing health problems, including respiratory diseases, stroke and even cognitive problems. But something as simple as stacking the bricks a different way could put asignificant dent in that pollution, according to a new study of over 275 kilns published in Science by Maithel and his colleagues. \"This is wonderful evidence of how simple low cost interventions can have a big impact on energy use,\" said William Checkley, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn't involved in the study. \"If we can implement these, we could have a significant impact in energy use and emissions, improving air quality throughout southeast Asia.\" Bricks are the main building block for Bangladesh. The densely populated and rapidly urbanizing country produces nearly 30 million bricks a year – more than 90% from loosely regulated, coal-burning kilns. \"It's quite simple and inexpensive to set up traditional-style brick kilns, so they've just proliferated,\" saidNina Brooks, a global health researcher at Boston University. The process goes something like this: First, dun-colored clay bricks are molded with a wooden box and stacked in the sun to dry. Next, hundreds of thousands of bricks are stacked in the firing chamber and covered with ash. Then, workers shovel lots and lots of coal as the bricks fire, firming them up. \"The combustion efficiency of these brick kilns is really low,\" said Brooks, meaning they end up burning a lot more coal than they need to, \"Which is why they're so heavily polluting here.\" Each kiln can employ up to 200 workers. They're the most directly impacted by the smoke, with one study findingnearly 80% report some kind of respiratory problems. But they're not the only ones. Kilns are often close to densely populated areas, adding to the smog that comes from city life. Brick workers balance stacks of bricks on their heads as the carry them from the kiln near Dhaka, Bangladesh.Zakir Hossain Chowdhury/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images/Anadoluhide caption While there are regulations on where kilns can and can't operate, they're not always followed, said Brooks. \"We found that 77% of brick kilns are illegally located too close to a school.\" Modern, high-tech kilns produce substantially less pollution, but they're up to 25 times more expensive to build and operate. \"They've not really taken off,\" said Brooks. Instead, the team looked for solutions that would be easier and cheaper for the average brick producer to adopt. In his decades of working with brick kiln owners in India as a consulting engineer, Maithel has noticed questionable practices. Many kiln operators pack too many bricks in the kiln too tightly, he said. That tight spacing chokes out oxygen flow, which is needed for efficient burning. It also means hot coals get stuck at the top of the stack instead of falling to the bottom, leading some bricks to be overbaked and others not fired enough. He's also noticed that workers often shovel coal in bouts, working hard in teams of two or three, and then all taking breaks together. That results in uneven fueling, which can stymie efficiency too. As an energy systems engineer, Maithel knew that a few simple changes could really help. Simply stacking the bricks in a zig-zag pattern that increases airflow and ensuring coal gets delivered more consistently should help the kilns operate more efficiently, he said.\"The better you are able to provide fuel and air mixing, the probability of black smoke will be less.\" To see if such simple interventions could help reduce air pollution and boost profits, the team planned a massive experiment across 276 kilns. One group of kiln owners and workers were taught how to implement these interventions. Another group got the same training plus info on how the changes would save money. The control group got no training. Then, during firing season in the winter, the researchers measured various aspects of kiln performance, including fuel use. The results were promising. Kilns that adopted these measures saw significant benefits. On average, fuel use dropped by about 23 percent, the study found. The researchers estimate that would reduce the carbon dioxide and particulate matter coming out of the kilns by about 20%. \"We showed that simple, low-cost interventions can really reduce pollution,\" said Mahbubur Rahman, an environmental health researcher at theInternational Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. And the changes improved both worker conditions and the bottom lines for kiln owners. Over the season, they had saved close to $40,000 each because of reduced fuel use, said Brooks. Brick quality went up as well. In fact, kiln owners were so impressed that a year later, those that had adopted the new practices were still practicing them. But to really make a dent in Bangladesh's air pollution, many more kilns need to sign on. The research team, which includes scientists from the U.S., India and Bangladesh, are now working with the Bangladeshi government to expand this training. \"It's a hopeful story,\" Brooks says, \"of a place where solutions are quite feasible.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Ever since she first debuted as a superheroic variant ofGwen Stacyin 2014, Spider-Gwen has become a semi-staple of Spider-Man media. If she’s not swinging on her own with Miles or Peter, she’s caught up in her own situations. While the original Gwen is beingrevived and turned into Gwenpoolin a few months, the wallcrawling Stacy is getting another solo comic that help keep her in the orbit of other Spider-heroes. So inÂAll-New Spider-Gwen: The Ghost Spiderfrom returning writer and artist duo Stephanie Phillips and Paolo Villanelli, Gwen continues to be a full-time resident of Earth-616. Like her fellow Spiders before her, she’s in her “brand new” era: a new costume, a new place to live, and she’s even looking to start up a new rock band. Those plans of hers get thrown into disarray when she’s got new threats to tangle with, at least one of which Phillips teased “might be her own fault.” Previous Spider-Gwen runs explored how she made the most of her new lease on life, either in 616 or her home dimension of Earth-65, and the same’s true with thisAll-NewÂseries. Philips said the book’s core theme is about “possibility. […] Sheâs finally in a place where she can build something newânew allies, new purpose, and maybe even a new sense of self.” Of course, withÂSpider-Man: Beyond the Spider-VerseÂpossibly hitting theaters inJune 2027, it also doesn’t hurt to have Gwen headlining a new comic and maybe being a key part of whatever the next major Spider-book crossover is whenever that hits in the next few years.

    "title": "Crypto-Related Abductions Are on the Rise Globally",
    "article_text": "Cryptocurrency is one of theleading drivers of cybercrime, but a newreport from the Wall Street Journalindicates it is increasingly becoming the target of crime in the real world, too. As more whales and major holders of cryptocurrencies shift their assets to cold wallets that can’t be accessed online, they are becoming targets or real-life thefts, abductions, and robberies. According to the Journal, there have been dozens of “wrench attacks”âor assaults that use simple tools to inflict pain and coerce victimsâreported to governments around the world in the past year that saw victims targeted for their cryptocurrency holdings, including at least five in France alone in the last several months. A few high-profile examples of attempted real-life robberies have grabbed headlines, perhaps most notably when popular Twitch streamerAmouranth was the target of a break-inat her Houston home this March. Three people entered her complex and demanded that she hand over her cryptocurrency holdings. They stole her laptop before being chased off by the streamer’s husband, which was ultimately recovered and the attackers never gained access to her digital currency. That case turned out to be a trio of teens responsible, but the Journal reports that there are indications that organized crime rings may be involved in some of the thefts. Last year, a 24-year-old Florida man named Remy St. Felix wassentenced to 47 years in jailfor serving as the leader of a crime ring that carried out multiple home invasions that targeted cryptocurrency holders. The group was able to steal a total of $3.5 million in cryptocurrency by binding victims, holding them at gunpoint, and demanding they transfer their holdings. As for how these attackers pick their victims, there are a variety of factors but it often starts with their online profile. People who flaunt their wealth are often targeted. A series of hacks of popular cryptocurrency trading platforms including Coinbase and Ledger have made information about potential cryptocurrency holders available to attackers, as well. In the case of Ledger, names, email, and postal addresses from the company’s marketing database were posted online and exposed more than 270,000 people. The CEO of Ledger, David Balland, was also a victim of one of these physical attacksâa brutal abduction that sawhim and his wife kidnappedand held for nearly two days while their captors demanded a crypto ransom be paid to them. The attackers cut off one of Balland’s fingers and sent pictures of it to his fellow executives at Ledge to pressure them to transfer the payment. The two were ultimately let go after multiple payments were made.According to WSJ, the attack, along with a series of others in France that have targeted cryptocurrency executives, led to French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau meeting with the industry to discuss security measures for the sector.

    "title": "Animation Studio Toei Wants to Use AI for Future Productions",
    "article_text": "If you watch anime, particularly of the shonen variety, you likely know Toei Animation. The studio is best known for adapting popular manga likeDragon BallandSailor Moon,Âand it’s got plenty of work coming out. When those series and films release, some may have been made with artificial intelligence. In Toei’s recently publishedfinancial briefingfor 2024-2025’s fiscal year, one slide reveals the studio’s invested an undisclosed sum of money into Preferred Networks, a Japanese company with “cutting-edge AI technologies.” The two hope to “co-develop new business opportunities and improve the efficiency and quality of our production, capitalizing on synergies between AI and animation production technologies.” Toei is specifically eyeing AI usage for storyboards in productions, along with coloring (and color specification), backgrounds, and in-betweens. Use cases cited include having the technology automatically correcting in-between or specifying and picking the correct colors, and generating backgrounds from referenced photos. At the time, the slide only talks about future prospects, and makes no mention of the technology being incorporated in the studio’s current works likeÂOne PieceÂor the upcomingÂDigimon BeatBreakÂandGosu. AI has been controversial to use and discuss across the larger entertainment industry. While it’s often been argued to be a means of efficiency and helpful to reducing menial work, workers across different creative fields like (voice actingand art) feel their livelihoods have been threatened by studios’ adoption of the technology and its integration into projects without artists’ consent. Others consider it a form of theft ordigital necromancythat could add extra steps to the production process or lead to unintended errors upon release. Toei’s a big company, and how it uses the technology will impact everyone, from other studios to the fans who watch their works. Want more io9 news?

    "article_text": "If you’ve been thinking about seeing the live-action remake ofLilo & Stitch,Âgood news: it’s apparently pretty decent! Reactions for the film hit social media on Saturday night, and those who’ve seen it were fairly warm to it. In addition to being surprisingly good, impressions consider it the best live-action remake of Disney’s erratic bunch over the years. We’ve gathered some of those thoughts here for you to get an idea of what to expect ahead of more substantial reviews in the next few days. #LiloAndStitchis the BIGGEST SURPRISE of the year and easily the BEST Disney live action remake yet.

    "title": "This Is What Your Brain Looks Like When You Solve a Problem",
    "article_text": "We’ve all had the aha moment, when the solution to a problem is suddenly obvious. In cartoons, that eureka feeling is usually depicted as a lightbulb floating above a character’s headâwhich is not that far off from what actually takes place in the brain during these moments. Researchers have revealed that epiphanies physically reshape brain activity. What’s more, they discovered that people remember epiphanies better than solutions reached through a more methodical approach. These results could have important implications for how instructors approach teaching in classrooms. “If you have an ‘aha! moment’ while learning something, it almost doubles your memory,” Roberto Cabeza, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke, said in a universitystatement. “There are few memory effects that are as powerful as this.” Cabeza is senior author of astudypublished earlier this month in the journal Nature Communications. As study participants solved brain teasers, he and his colleagues recorded their brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging, atechniquethat measures changes in blood flow associated with brain activity. The brain teasers were visual fill-in-the-blank puzzles that revealed a previously hidden picture once participants completed the image. While such an activity might seem childish, this small discovery “produces the same type of characteristics that exist in more important insight events,” Cabeza explained. Once participants thought they’d solved a puzzle, the team asked them how certain they were of their solution, and whether they’d reached the solution suddenly (in an aha moment) or worked it out more intentionally. Overall, the researchers noted that participants who reported epiphanies remembered their solutions significantly better than those who hadn’tâand the more certain they were about their flash of insight, the greater the likelihood theyâd still recall it five days later. The functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the epiphanies triggered an explosion of activity in the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in learning and memory. Stronger moments of insight caused stronger bursts of activity. When participants solved the puzzle and finally recognized the secret object, researchers also noted changes in the participants’ neuron firing dynamicsâespecially in regions of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex, which is involved in recognizing visual patterns. Similarly, the more powerful the moment of insight, the greater the changes researchers recorded. “During these moments of insight, the brain reorganizes how it sees the image,” said Maxi Becker, first author of the study and a cognitive neuroscientist at Humboldt University. Furthermore, the researchers linked more powerful epiphanies with more connectivity between those parts of the brain. “The different regions communicate with each other more efficiently,” said Cabeza. As such, “Learning environments that encourage insight could boost long-term memory and understanding,” the researchers wrote in the statement. While in this study the team imaged brain activity before and after participants’ “aha” moment, moving forward they hope to investigate what takes place in betweenâwhen the real magic happens. brainsEducation Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Motorbunny Buck Review: The Most Fun You Can Have While Sitting Down",
    "article_text": "When I was a young horndog, dipping my toes into the waters of sex positivity and all that it entails, I dreamed of getting my hands (and nethers) on a sex saddle. I finally got my wish thanks to Motorbunny. As purveyors of some of the most popular motorized sex machines, the company sent me the latest iteration of its self-pleasuring saddle, theMotorbunny Buck. Not to be confused with theoriginal Motorbunny we reviewed nearly eight years agothat quite literally takes your sexual pleasure to 11. The Buck adds thrusting motion to the mix, making it the worldâs first hybrid saddle. Motorbunny sent both versions of its sex saddlesâthe Buck and the original modelâfor me to try out. The Buck is nearly identical to the OG. As such, neither is the most discreet sex toy, weighing 17.8 pounds and measuring 10 x 13.2 x 12.5 inches. (Iâll definitely be stuffing them as deep into my shallow New York City closet as humanly possible when my mom comes to visit.) Both dome-shaped saddles are wrapped in memory foam that’s covered in black leatherette and are super comfortable for extended sessions. Motorbunny Buck The Motorbunny Buck proves that a lot of thrust goes a long way. Pros Cons There was a little bit of assembly before I could jump on the Buck. In addition to selecting one of the five silicone attachments, thereâs also the matter of connecting the controller and the power source. The overall setup process took approximately five minutes from start to finish. A new wrinkle for me is the Vac-U-Lock, which lets you connect a dildo or other compatible attachments for a more varied experience. The Buck ships with two such accoutrements (one more veiny than the other). It wasnât long before I had set up the Buck and picked out my first toy. And then, it was time to ride the bucking bronco. See Motorbunny Buck at Amazon Similar to the original motorized saddle, youâve got to ease into using the Buck. Even with a nice big glob of water-based lube, the initial sensation was slightly uncomfortable. I definitely recommend trying a variety of positions at low speed so you can get the hang of things before you go buckwild. No, seriously. Compared to my strongest vibrator, the rechargeable Hitachi Wand, the Buck and OGâs vibration is like a whitewater rapid versus a ripple in a tepid pond. For Chrissakes, the saddleâs motor uses horsepower as a measurement. Thereâs really no precision with either saddle, like you get from a vibrator or a clitoral stimulator. Youâre going to feel it from the rooter to the tooter and some parts in between. To date, Iâve only worked my way up to level six (out of 11) intensity on both the Buck and Buzz settings. Thanks to my time with the original Motorbunny, Iâm fairly used to the intensity of the Buckâs vibration. Hell, at this point, Iâve worked myself up to using the E-Stim attachment that sends jolts of electricity to where the sun donât shine. But the new twist here is the Buckâs thrusting functionality. Instead of the rotating motion you find on the original Motorbunny model and similar sex saddles like the Sybian, the Buck offers two flavors of thrusting action via its attachments. The Thrust toggle is for your traditional up and down motion, while the G-Thrust mode provides an up and forward action designed to stimulate G- or P-spots. For my first go-round, I went with one of the smaller attachments paired with the Thrust toggle. At first, the thrusting felt a little weird, but that strange sensation quickly gave way to pleasant and then to whoa! The G-Thrust felt even better. Turn up the Buzz setting, and it didnât take long to take me to O-Town several times over. Just like with a partner, you can control the depth by how youâre positioned. Iâm still working through all of the attachments, but out of what Iâve used so far, Iâve yet to have a bad time. I wish the company sent over a few other attachments, like the Mt. Gushmore ($59.99) and the Ribbed Rider ($39.99), but it wonât be long before I add them to my collection. I do have one request for Motorbunny. Please make an E-Stim for the Buck; adding electricity to the saddle might just make me levitate into the stratosphere. See Motorbunny Buck at Amazon Discretion, thy name is not Motorbunny. In addition to being bulky, the Buck is just as loud as its predecessor, which makes sense as both use the same motor. Thereâs no hiding what youâre doing once you decide to take a ride on the Buck. Placing the saddle on the floor only seems to amplify that noise to the level of a small tree saw. I got a quieter experience on my bed and couch, but once I really got into it, I couldnât hear the Buck over my own noise. I was having such a good time my partner came in and got in on the fun, which is fine since the Buck and the original are built for couple play and can support up to 1,000 pounds. He had a blast using the controller and modulating my experience. The Buck can also be controlled with your smartphone or tablet via the free Fluffer controller app. But maybe you want to gamify your sexy time. No problem, Motorbunny has you covered with the PlayMate. Attach the unassuming purple box to a USB-C game controller, link it and the Buck to the Fluffer app, and youâre now a sexy version of your favorite games. The PlayMate takes the haptic feedback from your games and transmits it to the Buck. That said, I recommend games with a lot of pulsation, such asRez Infinite,Call of Duty, andCyberpunk 2077. Fast-paced first-person shooters and fighting games should be a load of fun as well. See Motorbunny Buck at Amazon From its deep thrusts, powerful vibrations, and plethora of accessories, the Motorbunny Buck is everything young me dreamed of and then some. Is it pricey at $1,949 (discounted to $1,799 at the time of this writing)? Sure, but this premium sex toy more than makes up for it with its versatility and longevity. Seriously, Motorbunny offers one of the longest warranties Iâve seen for a sex saddle, at 11 years. Is the Motorbunny Buck an everyday treat? No, at least not for me, but I can definitely see OnlyFans folks and streamers adding this titillating toy to their repertoire. But no matter who you are and what youâre into, the Motorbunny Buck is a seriously fun way to spice up your bedroom.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Chargers are one of those everyday items you donât think about until they break, disappear, or stop working as fast as they used to. Whether itâs the cord fraying, the adapter running hot, or simply not charging your phone as quickly as it should, most of us have had at least one frustrating experience with a cheap or aging charger. Thatâs why having a couple of good, reliable backups is always a smart move. And you don’t have to spend an arm and a leg to get a great one. Check out Amazon right now to get theAnker iPhone 16 Charger 2-Pack for just $14, down from its usual price of $19. That’s 26% off and $5 off. And no matter how you slice it, two chargers for less than $20 is a great deal. See at Amazon Each charger delivers 20 watts of power, which is great for quickly charging newer iPhones, iPads, and other USB-C-compatible devices. If youâve ever noticed that your phone seems to charge slowly with older adapters, itâs likely because they donât support modern fast-charging standards. With these Anker chargers, youâll get back to 50% battery in around 30 minutes on most iPhones, which can be a lifesaver when youâre in a hurry. Theyâre also compact and travel-friendly. The low-profile design makes them easy to toss into a bag or keep in a travel pouch without adding bulk. Whether you want one for the bedroom and one for the office, or need an extra for your travel setup, having two means youâre covered in more than one spot. What really sets these apart is reliability. Anker is known for building chargers that donât just work well, but they last. You also get built-in safety features like temperature regulation and short-circuit protection, so youâre not putting your phone or tablet at risk every time you plug it in. So you can count on them to be available when you need them without running out or fizzling out somehow. At $13.99 for two, itâs a no-brainer. These chargers are great for everyday use, for keeping in your suitcase, or for giving to a family member whoâs always asking to borrow yours. You might not get excited about a charger, but when itâs fast, compact, and dependable, especially for just $14, it’s a great price. That’s $7 apiece, and where else are you going to get a deal like this one? See at Amazon Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Scientists Track Methane Clouds Wafting Over Titan’s Lakes for the First Time",
    "article_text": "Saturn’s most metal moon just got more intriguing. On Titan, clouds of methane unleash a cold, oily rainâvery different from the water-based downpours we see on Earth. For the first time, scientists have collected evidence of cloud convection in Titan’s northern hemisphere, observing the moon’s methane clouds shifting over time above its eerie lakes. By combining data from the Webb space telescope and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, a group of scientists observed Titan’s clouds rising to higher altitudes over time. This new discovery marks the first time cloud convection is seen taking place in the moon’s northern hemisphere, where most of Titan’s lakes and seas of liquid methane are located. The findings are detailed in astudypublished this week in the journalNature. “This enables us to better understand Titanâs climate cycle, how the methane clouds may generate rain and replenish methane evaporated from the lakes,” Conor Nixon, research scientist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and lead author of the study, said in astatement. Titan is the only moon in the solar system to host a substantial atmosphere, but Saturn’s largest moon is shrouded with a layer of yellowish smog. To probe different depths in Titanâs atmosphere, the scientists used various infrared filters on Webb and Keck to estimate the altitudes of the clouds. The team behind the study observed Titan in November 2022 and July 2023, capturing clouds in the moonâs mid and high northern latitudes. Using space and ground-based observations, the scientists observed the clouds as they appeared to move to higher altitudes over a period of days. They were, however, not able to directly see any precipitation occurring. Titan is the only other place in the solar system known to have an Earth-like cycle of liquids, with rain pouring from clouds and flowing across its surface, filling lakes and seas, and evaporating back into the sky, according toNASA. But instead of water, Titan has liquid methane and ethane. The strange moon is of high interest to astronomers as it holds complex organic chemistry despite its frigid temperatures and gaseous bodies of water. Organic molecules are among the building blocks of life on Earth, and studying Titan helps scientists better understand how different lifeforms could evolve under drastically different planetary circumstances. The recent findings also help scientists understand how different worlds evolve over time. “On Titan, methane is a consumable,” Nixon said. “Itâs possible that it is being constantly resupplied and fizzing out of the crust and interior over billions of years. If not, eventually it will all be gone and Titan will become a mostly airless world of dust and dunes.” Saturntitanwebb space telescope Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

A stellar occultation this month gave scientists an opportunity to scrutinize the seventh planet from the Sun. New JWST data strengthens earlier hints that K2-18b, a possible water world 120 light-years away, could host the chemical byproducts of life. New findings flip a previous theory of a planet's end on its head. While all the ingredients are there, the moon's composition likely prevents them from coming together in any meaningful way.

    "title": "Is the New Pope an Environmentalist?",
    "article_text": "On a sweltering January day in 2018, Pope Francisaddressed100,000 of the faithful in Puerto Maldonado, Peru, not far from where gold mining had ravaged an expanse of Amazon rainforest about the size of Colorado. âThe native Amazonian peoples have probably never been so threatened on their own lands as they are at present,â he told the crowd. He simultaneously condemned extractive industries and conservation efforts that âunder the guise of preserving the forest, hoard great expanses of woodland and negotiate with them, leading to situations of oppression for the native peoples.â Francis denounced the insatiable consumerism that drives the destruction of the Amazon, supported those who say Indigenous peoplesâ guardianship of their own territories should be respected, and urged everyone to defend isolated tribes. âTheir cosmic vision and their wisdom have much to teach those of us who are not part of their culture,â he said. To Julio Cusurichi Palacios, an Indigenous leader who was in the stadium that day, the words from the head of the Catholic Church âÂ which claims 1.4 billion members and has a long, sordid history of violence against Indigenous peoples worldwide âÂ were welcome and momentous. âFew world leaders have spoken about our issues, and the pope said publicly the rights of Indigenous peoples were historically violated,âhe saidafter Pope Francis died last month. âLet us hope that the new pope is a person who can continue implementing the position the pope who passed away has been talking about.â During his 12 years as pontiff, Francis radically reshaped how the worldâs most powerful religious institution approached the moral and ethical call to protect the planet. Beyond his invocations for Indigenous rights, Francis acknowledged the Churchâs role in colonization, and considered climate change a moral issue born of rampant consumption and materialism. As the Trump administration dismantles climate action and cuts funding to Indigenous peoples around the world â and far-right politics continues to rise globally â experts see the conclaveâs selection of Robert Francis Prevost, or Pope Leo XIV as he is now known, as a clear beacon that the faith-based climate justice movement his predecessor led isnât going anywhere. In 2015, Pope Francis released his historic papal letter, or encyclical, titledLaudato siâ. In the roughly 180-page document, he unequivocally identified planet-heating pollution as a pressing global issue disproportionately impacting the worldâs poor, and condemned the outsize role wealthy countries like the U.S. have in contributing to the climate crisis. With it, Francis did what no pope had done before: He spoke with great clarity and urgency about human degradation of the environment being not just an environmental issue, but a social and moral one. Laudato siâ established the definitive connection between faith, climate change, and social justice, and made it a tenet of Catholic doctrine. âPope Francis routinely said that we have a throwaway society. We throw away people, we throw away nature â¦ and that we really need a culture thatâs much more based in care,â said Christopher Cox, executive director of theSeventh Generation Interfaith Coalition for Responsible Investmentand a former priest. âThat means care for people, especially the most poor, the most vulnerable, the most marginalized. And we also need much greater care for creation. Weâve been given a beautiful earth and weâre consuming it at a rate that goes far beyond what will be able to sustain life for the long term.â The first Latin American pope, Francis was unique in implicitly embracing some elements of liberation theology, a Catholic social justice movement that calls for the liberation of marginalized peoples from oppression. Although Francis was occasionally critical of the doctrineâs Marxist elements and never fully supportive of it, many observers see his statements regarding poor and Indigenous peoples as reflective of the doctrineâs central values. âRight from the beginning of his papacy, that outreach, that recognition of Indigenous ways of being Catholic and Indigenous language in Catholicism, heralded â up to that point â the most expansive official recognition of Indigenous contributions to Catholicism thus far,â said Eben Levey, an assistant professor of history at Alfred University who has studied the relationship between Catholic Church and Indigenous peoples in Latin America. In the centuries since conquistadores arrived in the Americas and forced Indigenous peoples to accept their religion, many Indigenous communities have made Catholicism their own, and a growing number of church leaders have embraced the idea that there are multiple ways of being Catholic and that Catholicism and Indigenous cultures can coexist. A year after becoming pope, Francis approved the use of two Mayan languages, Tzotzil and Tzeltal, in mass and sacraments like baptism and confession. In 2015 he expanded that list to include the Aztec language Nahuatl, and in 2016, during a visit to Mexico, he celebrated mass in Tzeltal, Tzotzil and Chol. In 2022, Francis officially apologized to Canada for the residential schools that ripped Indigenous children from their families, leading to the deaths of many who were later buried in unmarked graves. The following year, he rejected the Doctrine of Discovery, a religious concept that colonizers used to justify the illegal seizure of land from Indigenous peoples and becamepart of an 1823 U.S. Supreme Court rulingthat described Native Americans as âsavages.â âThe Doctrine of Discovery is not part of the teaching of the Catholic Church,â Pope Francissaid, adding that hestrongly supports the global implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. He also drew a clear connection between those rights and climate action: In 2023, he made clear that Indigenous peoples arecritical to fighting climate changewhen he said, âIgnoring the original communities in the safeguarding of the Earth is a serious mistake, not to say a great injustice.â But Pope Francisâ progressivism had its limits. In 2019, hecalled for a meeting of church leaders, known as the Synod of Bishops, for the Pan-Amazon region to address issues affecting the Amazon Basin. Indigenous Catholics who attended brought up illegal logging and violence against land defenders and proposed reforms. âThe ancestral wisdom of the aboriginal peoples affirms that mother earth has a feminine face,âreads the documentthat emerged from the gathering and urged the church to give women more leadership roles and allow married deacons to be ordained as priests.In his response, Francis condemned corporations that destroy the Amazon as committing âinjustice and crime,â yetrefused to embrace the proposalsto make church leadership more inclusive of women and married men. Francisâ climate activism was alsoriddled in constraint. He transformed how religious institutions viewed the climate crisis, framing a failure to act on it as abrutal injusticetoward the most vulnerable, but could have implemented âmore direct institutional action,â said Nadia Ahmad, a Barry University School of Law associate professor who has studied faith-based environmental action. Though the former pontiff publicly supported renewable energy adoption, called for fossil fuel disinvestment, and prompted churches across the world to go solar, he did not mandate what he deemed a âradical energy transitionâ across dioceses, schools, and hospitals. The work he accomplished âcould have been amplified a bit more and had more accountability,â said Ahmad. But that limitation, she noted, likely stemmed from contradictory politics playing out within the church â many traditional, conservative Catholics,particularly in the United States, resisted Francisâ progressive teachings. A 2021studyfound that over a period of five years, most U.S. bishops were ânearly silent and sometimes even misleading,â in their official messaging to parishioners about climate change and the popeâs famed encyclical. Though Pope Leo XIV has been lauded for his advocacy in defense of immigrants and worker rights â his namesake, Leo XIII, who reigned from 1878 until 1903 is known as a historical Catholic champion ofsocial justice and equalityÂ âÂ thenew popeâs track record on engaging directly with climate change is sparse. Still, Mary Evelyn Tucker, co-director of the Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology, sees comments the new pope made last year on the need to move âfrom words to actionâ as a promising sign that he will continue Francisâ commitment to communicating the urgency of a warming world. The timing of the conclaveâs unprecedented decision to select the first pontiff from the United States, coming amid the Trump administrationâs sweeping dismissal of climate action, elimination of environmental protections, and attacks on Indigenous rights, isnât lost on her. âIt may be a signal to say âAmerica, come back into the world community, come back into a planetary future where we collectively have been working to create a future worthy of our children and our childrenâs children,ââ she said. Leo grew up in Chicago and is a citizen of both the U.S. and Peru, where he spent decades serving as a missionary and bishop before Francis made him a cardinal in 2023. He speaks five languages fluentlyand some Quechua, an Indigenous Incan language. While he was working in Peru in the 1990s, Leo was critical of the governmentâs human rights abuses â though he refrained from explicitly taking sides in the political fight between Maoist rebels and the government of then-dictator Alberto Fujimori, according to Matthew Casey, a historian and clinical associate professor at Arizona State University based in Lima. Still, his reaction to the countryâs authoritarianism could provide a glimpse of what stances he might take as pope, Casey said. âIt doesnât matter who was abusing human rights, he was on the side of the people,â he said. In 2016, the would-be pontiffspoke at a conferencein Brazil where attendees talked about threats to the Amazon rainforest and Indigenous peoples who lived there. He praised Francisâ encyclical, describing the document as âvery important,â and representing âsomething new in terms of this explicit expression of the churchâs concern for all of creation.â To Casey, that suggests Pope Leo XIV, like his predecessor, has an awareness of the issues affecting Indigenous peoples, such as the rampant degradation of the environment. âBoth Francis and Prevost are attuned to Indigeneity in ways that they couldnât have been if they worked in Europe or the United States, because the politics of Indigeneity in Latin America are just so different,â Casey said. More than a week after the conclave that named him pope, communities across Peru are still celebrating the selection of Pope Leo XIV. Francis and Leoâs shared experiences working with marginalized communities harmed by colonialism and climate change, and their commitment to the social justice aspects of the churchâs mission, are particularly meaningful in this political moment, said Levey, the Alfred University historian. âWe are seeing a resurgence of ultra right wing politics globally, and the Catholic Church next to the United Nations is one of the few multilateral organizations perhaps capable of responding in some form or fashion to the questions of our modern age or contemporary moment,â he said.

    "title": "The Robot Vacuum Arms Race Is Over, and the Incredible AI-Powered Roborock Saros Z70 Has Won",
    "article_text": "It’s time to give Roborock a hand, because they’re giving us an arm. The Roborock Saros Z70 is theworld’s first mass produced robotic vacuum cleaner with a foldable mechanical armthat can intelligently identify and remove obstacles from its path, and even put them away for you. It’s the most groundbreaking advance in home cleaning technology in recent memory, and it’s sure to usher in an entirely new era in home robotic appliances and assistants. The Roborock Saros Z70 is now officially available for purchase with a special launch offer:get it for $1,999 instead of $2,599âa 23% discount. Act fast, as only 10 units are released each day, and stock is refreshed every midnight. See Saros Z70 at Roborock.com See Saros Z70 at Roborock.com The world got a sneak preview of the Saros Z70 at CES 2025 in January, and the first demonstration of the mind-boggling AI-powered capabilities of the OmniGrip foldable robotic arm madethis one of the most anticipated new product releases in years. The Saros Z70 is able to accurately see, measure, and recognize its surroundings, and it uses AI to detect new obstacles or if the furniture’s been rearranged, and instantly rewrite its internal maps in real time. And that’s just scratching the surface of the unprecedented feats this ultra-intelligent robotic vacuum/mop combo can perform. Industrial robotic arms have been around for decades, and AI has been a presence in our homes in ways that seem to grow every day. And we’re all very well acquainted with robotic vacuums and mops and other enormously helpful smart home devices. But combining all of those into one enormously intelligent and multi-functional smart cleaning device has been, until now, just a very cool concept. And while the competition is still busy at the drawing board, Roborock is now the first company to take that concept into mass production and make it available to consumers in the form of the Saros Z70. It’s an enormous leap forward in robotic intelligence and capabilities, offering a smart device that’s more autonomous than any of its predecessors, and with the groundbreaking OmniGrip arm, able to perform specific chores and tasks for you. That’s what makes the release of the Saros Z70 such a seismic event. ð Roborock Wins Big at the iF DESIGN AWARD 2025! ð Weâre excited to announce that Roborock has won several prestigious awards for innovative designs like the Saros Z70, Saros 10R, and more. Join us in celebrating this incredible milestone! ð¥³#Roborock#iFDesignAwardpic.twitter.com/jFQW66P107 — Roborock (@roborockglobal)April 2, 2025 The OmniGrip arm would be an amazing innovation in any circumstance, but Roborock hascombined it with AI so advanced that it will redefine the definition of what a household robot can do. The OmniGrip arm of the Saros Z70 does far more than simply grab objects â it can see and think thanks to its precision sensors, dual cameras and LED light, all of which feed information into the Saros Z70’s AI processor. The OmniGrip arm can identify what’s in its path, whether or not it’s too heavy to pick up, and what to do with it. See Saros Z70 at Roborock.com For example, the Saros Z70 can identify a stray sock in its path, determine that it’s light enough to be picked up (anything roughly 0.6 pounds or less), and know to bring it toward the closet. A crumpled piece of paper or tissue can be brought to the trash can. Other objects without obvious homes can simply be moved out of the way, and the Saros Z70 knows to double back to that spot for a second round of cleaning. The intelligence level of the Saros Z70 is so great that it can identify and remember up to 108 household objects, 50 of which you can customize with labels in the Roborock app, and what to do with them. Even if it can’t pick up or move an object, it is able to identify it, and theoretically help you locate something that’s gone missing under a bed or other hidden area. That’s a massive leap forward for cleaning, and it’s even entertaining to teach the Saros Z70 how to interact with random objects and watching it work its magic. We could talk all day about the first-of-its-kind OmniGrip arm and otherwordly intelligence of the Saros Z70, but skipping its ability to actually clean your home would be doing it a huge disservice. The Saros Z70 is a top-notch robot vacuum and mop that would earn its way onto the best-of lists for robotic cleaners even without the OmniGrip arm and advanced AI. The upgraded dock can recharge the Saros Z70 in just 2.5 hours, heat and refill the mop water and then air-dry the mop pads, dispense detergent into the mop water, and even intelligently detect dirt to decide if it needs to re-wash and re-mop. The robot itself is barely 3 inches tall â the thinnest Roborock ever â and that exceptionally low profile enables it to get into areas most competing robot vacuums would simply get stuck in. It has advanced anti-tangle features for hair, and a powerful 22,000Pa of suction to give both hard and carpeted surfaces a truly deep cleaning. The Saros Z70’s FlexiArm Riser Side Brush extends to get into corners and along baseboards, and it’s able to lift itself over small thresholds like doorways or transitions between hard and carpeted surfaces. It can also lift its mop pads nearly a full inch off the floor to keep them off carpets, or remove the mop pads autonomously for vacuum-only tasks, and then replace them for mopping duties. All of these cleaning features, including the self-heating mop water, are backed by AI so the Saros Z70 can learn your cleaning preferences and modify them on the go. The Roborock app allows you to program and personalize all the settings so you can fully entrust the Saros Z70 to give your entire home a thorough cleaning without supervision. In the ever-escalating arms race among robotic home cleaning appliances, the debut of the Saros Z70 is truly the Sputnik moment â first of its kind, bringing abilities and technology out of the development stage and directly into the mass market, and into your home.

Ubisofthas previously said that Shadows would have \"special collaborations\" on its post-launch update roadmap. This is, presumably, the first one. What that crossover actually entails, though, remains to be seen. I find the concept outrageously silly but at this point Assassin's Creed just kind of does whatever it wants. You can see the most memorable other examples Assassin's Creed Origins, where you can accidentally free the antagonist of Final Fantasy XV from an ancient tomb and then ride around on a camel-chocobo hybrid with a very Final Fantasy looking sword and shield. An occurrence so absurd that it rated a \"-57%\" on PC Gamer's recentlist of the most historically inaccurate Assassin's Creed moments. Anyway, I'm just glad that this isn't the other way around. Dead by Daylight has some very non-horror crossovers like Lara Croft and Geralt and Nic Cage (that last one's debatable) but I don't think Naoe and Yasuke would make great DBD Survivors.

This really blew me away, because Gloomwood's mutation system is starting to look like a combo of some of the coolest game mechanics we've seen in recent years: Mario Odyssey's transformative enemy possession power-ups, and Hitman's social stealth disguises. Like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle or Fallout: New Vegas, Gloomwood's disguise system looks much simpler than Hitman's latticework of outfits and social stealth interactions, but as yet another system added to an already-complex stealth game, it's seriously impressive. Combining that with an entirely new movement system to open up the levels just feels genius, like how every enemy in Mario Odyssey could have been the star of their own indie platformer, all three of Gloomwood's monster power-ups strike me as a worthy anchor to their own stealth/horror/action/whatever game. Making them a small part of a larger whole just feels generous. It also harkens back to the Source engine glory days that loom so large as an inspiration for New Blood: I'm reminded of playing as the zombies in Left 4 Dead, or being a mutated killer in the cult asymmetric multiplayer shooter,The Hidden. In the video description, Rogers says that, in an upcoming update to Gloomwood, we'll get even more uses out of a single vial of monster juice, opening up its use as a tool out in Gloomwood's hostile city. That will be especially nice given how strict the game's attaché case inventory is. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I'll be continuing topractice stoic restraint regarding Gloomwood, though, like my colleague Morgan Park. I've played a bit in early access, and it's already got the value of a completed game, but I want to wait and see how it comes together in its 1.0 launch.

    "title": "'They don't really make life decisions without asking ChatGPT': OpenAI boss Sam Altman thinks young people turning to chatbots for life advice is 'cool'",
    "article_text": "The tech bros are apparently so disconnected they think AI can be your best friend, therapist, and life advisor. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Remember that movieHer, about a guy who developed an unhealthy relationship with an AI? Apparently it's happening in real life now, and Sam Altman counts it among the \"cool\" uses for ChatGPT. At theSequoia Capital AI Ascentconference earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman answered a slew of questions about ChatGPT, including a few that homed in on some of the seriously concerning trends around the way people are using AI chatbots. From the sound of Altman's comments during the Q&A, the AI tech bros have apparently become so disconnected that they don't see over-reliance on chatbots as an issue. \"They don't really make life decisions without asking ChatGPT what they should do,\" Altman claimed, when asked for examples of \"cool\" uses for AI among young people. Altman added that ChatGPT \"has the full context on every person in their life and what they've talked about.\" Altman contrasted this bleak scenario by stating that people in their 30s and older are using ChatGPT as more of a Google alternative. While that's still somewhat unwise considering ChatGPT often hallucinates andspits out completely fabricated or misleading responses, it isn't quite as scorched-earth as relying on a chatbot to determine the course of your life. These comments may seem silly at a glance, like joking about using WebMD instead of going to the doctor. But if this is the kind of unhealthy over-reliance on AI that OpenAI considers \"cool,\" we should all be worried. Ultimately, AI is not a person and fundamentally cannot replace actual human connections or understand anyone's lived experience. All it can do is mimic and regurgitate. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That means that even if an AI knows \"the full context\" of every person in your life (which is a privacy nightmare), it can't possibly understand how to resolve an argument, move on from a break-up, or deal with a frustrating coworker because AI is not human. It has no concept of relationships or emotions, just strings of code parsing through a mountain of training data scraped from all over the internet. Of course, all of us use Google to look for advice or do research, so you'd be forgiven for thinking using ChatGPT for that isn't any different. However, when you're looking for advice through Google, you can at least see where that advice is coming from or you can go to Reddit, where youcan be fairly certain you're getting input from real people. Even if you're aware of the risks and being careful about how you use ChatGPT, there are still very real risks about unhealthy, even dangerous relationships with AI. For instance, in one casereported byRolling Stone, a woman had to end her marriage after her husband began obsessing over conspiracy theories he was getting from an AI, leading her to comment that \"the whole thing feels like Black Mirror.\" There are countless other stories like her's of people upending their lives over strange spiritual messages from AI chatbots. In another harrowing example,parents in Texas are suing Character.ai, who's chatbots they claim \"encouraged self-harm, violence, and provided sexual content to their children.\" According to the lawsuit, interactions with Character.ai's chatbots included inappropriate sexual content and even encouraged one of the kids to kill his parents when they tried to reduce his screen time. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together This type of lawsuit is disheartening, worrying, and unfortunately just the tip of the iceberg. These chatbots can generate messages that seem like something from a real person or a friend, setting kids up to struggle to differentiate between relationships with real people and conversations with chatbots. It's easy to see how those interactions could lead kids to one day rely on a chatbot to make all of their life decisions, or even struggle to build strong friendships because they're talking to an AI about their life instead of a real person. All of that to say, more people turning to AI for advice is not as \"cool\" as Sam Altman apparently thinks it is. Our fractured, polarized internet is already the result of people isolating themselves from one another. We need to be talking to each other more, not AI.

    "article_text": "I guess it's kind of a happy ending. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In Baldur's Gate 3 YouTuberSlimX's deep diveinto the game's out-of-bounds secrets, he revealed a super-niche Act Three world state that beggars belief, one where the tiefling refugees are all zombie versions of themselves, but show up in their usual locations acting like you saved them. This requires indulging in a quite frankly deranged combo of \"good\" and \"evil\" playthrough choices: With all of those circumstances lined up, you'll find the zombified versions of characters like Lakrissa and Danis hanging out in their usual Act 3 haunts as if you saved them, only they'll be bloodied, glassy-eyed, and acting all twitchy and grungly outside conversation mode. This strikes me as less of a \"working as intended\" situation, and rather a quirk of Larian's unique way of handling NPCs. Outside very specific circumstances, each character has one consistent \"actor\" that's used through the entire game, rather than a new instance of the NPC for each appearance. So killing someone in Act One doesn't set a flag to keep them from appearing in Act Three, the NPC just won't be around to appear in the first place. It's also how a merchant like Dammon will still have items you sold him in the Grove when you find him in the Lower City. The zombie tieflings are apparently set up in the same way⁠—the zombies are the \"same\" NPC as their living versions, rather than new actors. If they survive the Colony encounter, they're switched back into a non-hostile \"we were saved\" mode for Act Three, just with the zombie aesthetics maintained, as the game doesn't recognize them as \"dead.\" This is far from a desirable world state, as you miss out on great quest rewards like the Potent Robe, but itisvery funny. It reminds me of the ending of Shaun of the Dead.

    "article_text": "By Andy Serkis? From actual Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Warner Bros has announced that the movie The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum will open in theaters December 17, 2027 (viaVariety). Which will come as a surprise if you, like me, missed that little stealth announcement last summer. Frankly, though, I cannot believe they're making a whole-ass movie about Gollum set between the end of Bilbo's Birthday Party and the entry of the Fellowship into the Mines of Moria. Gollum will be played, of course, by Andy Serkis via CGI just as Gollum has been played for 20-some years. Serkis is directing the movie, which is being produced by Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movie trilogy filmmakers Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh. On second thought, I can fully believe they're making a movie about Gollum. There's only so much territory within the canon of Tolkien's work to be mined for events that Warner Bros has legal rights to in some way make a movie about and make money off of. And, yeah, canonically Aragorn and Gandalf go hunting for Gollum after Gandalf is like \"wait that's probably the mega-evil bad guy ring.\" So I guess that's what they're gonna make a movie about. The movie won't necessarily go this way, but it's not the best sign that a videogame about Gollum,The Lord of the Rings: Gollum,crashed and burned so hard in 2023 that its developer just... decided to get out of games entirely. Gollum didn't carry that story—so can the angst and pathos of sympathetic antagonist Gollum carry a movie? I don't know. We're clearly bound to find out, though.

    "article_text": "Netflix is hoping you won't notice AI-generated ads interrupting your Squid Game rewatch. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Netflix is continuing the time-honored tradition of making ads as annoying as possible to get you to shell out more money through the innovation of AI-generated slop. At its annualmeeting with advertiserslast week, Netflix revealed plans to start showing AI-generated content to its ad-tier subscribers. These AI ads are slated to begin rolling out in 2026. Amy Reinhard, Netflix's President of Advertising, claimed during the meeting that \"[Netflix] members pay as much attention to mid-roll ads as they do to the shows and movies themselves.\" Maybe it's just me, but I have yet to meet someone who pays an ounce of attention to Netflix ads. Even the few ad connoisseurs out there will probably not appreciate an influx of AI-generated garbage interrupting their episodes of Stranger Things. Alternately, Reinhard could be making an utterly damning statement about how much people care about their Netflix programming⁠—is the glass half-full, or half-empty here? According toThe Verge, Netflix reportedly wants to sneakily blend its AI slop into your shows with pause ads themed around the program you're watching, featuring AI-generated content inserted in the scene or an AI-generated overlay over the screen. It reminds me of theCerveza Cristal beer adsthat werecut into Chilean TV reruns of Star Wars, just minus the human touch⁠—Netflix's proposal sounds low-rent in a trashy, rather than charming way. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's hard to say whether Netflix genuinely thinks this is a good idea that will improve their service (which seems intensely out of touch) or if they are simply trying to get more of their 94 million ad-tier subscribers to upgrade to their more expensive ad-free plan. Regardless, this is yet another move that makes Netflix a less consumer-friendly platform as prices continue to rise and password sharing becomes a luxury of the past. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Personally, random AI-generated ads interrupting my favorite shows and movies will do nothing but annoy me (and probably be the final nail in the coffin of my cancelled Netflix subscription). Maybe advertisers think an AI overlay demanding you buy something while watching Wednesday will boost consumer engagement, but I'm skeptical. One has to wonder where the training data for these AI ads blended into your shows is going to come from. Will Netflix be showing an AI every show and movie on its platform so the algorithm can seamlessly generate product placements into whatever you're watching? If so, it raises serious concerns about the copyright protections of all the people behind those shows and movies, many of whom probably don't want an AI consuming their work. Ultimately, the fact that roughly a third of Netflix subscribers are choosing the least expensive option doesn't mean that those people just enjoy watching ads⁠—it means they are either trying to save money or don't see Netflix's offerings as valuable enough to justify paying more. Perhaps instead of shoveling AI slop into its streaming service, Netflix should invest more in new features that add value to that subscription price, like expanding Netflix Gaming or giving hit shows more than two or three seasons.

    "title": "'The vibes have never been worse' Bungie's morale is reportedly in 'free fall' following its art theft fiasco",
    "article_text": "Devs also claim they have been often ignored by the studio's \"good old boy\" leadership regarding the overarching design. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's safe to say Bungie has not had a great week. On Thursday, the developer of Marathonadmittedit had used art designed by independent artist Antireal in its upcoming extraction shooter without compensation or credit. The studio blamed this on a \"former Bungie artist\" and promised to undertake a \"thorough review\" of Marathon's assets. But it isn't the first time Bungie has confessed to using other people's art without permission, having done so on at leastthreepreviousoccasions. Combined with the less-than-stellar reception Marathon's initial closed alpha received, the general mood surrounding the game and the studio is pretty bleak. Now, it's been claimed the atmosphere within Bungie matches the feelings around it. Numerous current and former employees reportedly spoke toForbesabout what's going on inside Bungie. According to the report, morale inside the company is apparently in \"free fall\", with one individual telling Forbes that \"The vibes have never been worse.\" The report doesn't provide many new details regarding the art plagiarism issue itself, other than to say that the publicly given reason for the art theft is also the one being shared internally. Beyond that, the studio is apparently going reviewing its art assets to check for any further evidence of plagiarism as it claimed, a process which could take a long time. But the negative mood isn't solely related to the art debacle. There is apparently broad concern about Bungie's fate should Marathan provide a commercial failure. Moreover, the report alleges that Bungie's marketing plan for Marathon is in tatters, with plans for a new trailer and the beginning of pre-orders next month out of the window, while a public beta planned for August may now switch to a \"roadmap of public playtests\". Finally, it's claimed that many developers within the studio have been repeatedly ignored when discussing Marathon's design direction by the \"good old boy\" leadership that originally pitched the reboot. This includes urging within the studio for Marathon to have a PvE element. Marathon had its fair share of challenges even before all this came out, as noted by Tim Clark in hiscomprehensive previewof the game. \"From a spooked Sony, to the inherently hostile nature of the genre, and Bungie's own chequered history with Destiny's live service model, monetisation, and especially PvP balancing. These are substantial hurdles the game has to clear,\" he wrote back in April. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's worth noting Tim also said that the game is \"definitely good\", mixing that hallmark Bungie weapon feel with some canny twists on extraction shooting. But it was debatable whether that would be sufficient to carry the game then. Now, with just four months before the game launches on September 23, that seems even more in doubt. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom.

    "title": "Netflix's long-awaited Gears of War movie might actually have a director, and it's the guy who helmed Bullet Train and codirected John Wick",
    "article_text": "David Leitch is reportedly in negotiations with Netflix. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Remember that Gears of War movie Netflix was working on? Nobody would blame you if you didn't. The streaming service and purveyor ofaggressivelymediocreactionflicksnabbed the film rights for Microsoft's cover-shooter series way back in November 2022. The plan was to lead with a feature film and then segue into an animated series, but little has been heard about the project since the rights acquisition. Now though, the project might finally have a director. According to theHollywood Reporter, David Leitch is in negotiations to helm the project, though the deal has not yet been signed off with the traditional chainsaw duel. Leitch has had an interesting career. He was originally a stuntman, working on films like Blade, The Matrix sequels Reloaded and Revolutions, and Zack Snyder's 300. In 2014, he codirected John Wick with Chad Stahelski, though he was only credited as a producer. He got his directorial debut with 2017's Atomic Blonde, going on to direct Deadpool 2 and 2022 action film Bullet Train. His most recent project was action romcom The Fall Guy, starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt. In short, he seems like an ideal pick to adapt a game as explosively grand, outwardly serious and inwardly daft as Gears of War. Leitch will apparently produce the film with his business partner Kelly McCormick. Perhaps the most interesting person currently attached to the film, however, is writer Jon Spaihts, who wrote the screenplays for Denis Villeneuve's Dune movies. Granted, he was also involved in the stories for Prometheus and that terrible The Mummy reboot starring Tom Cruise, but no Gears of War film would be complete withoutsomepreposterous nonsense, so that's alright. At this point, I'd be happy to see more Gears of War in any shape or form. It's been six years sinceGears 5, which I think is a slightly underrated entry in the series, balancing classic grub scratching with some light and breezy open-world exploration. But The Coalition is going backwards in time for its next game, the prequelGears of War: E-Daywas announced in June last year.

    "title": "MSI's clever new 500 Hz QD-OLED gaming monitor can detect when you leave the screen and turn itself off to begin its anti-burn-in cycle",
    "article_text": "Speedy and smart, two things I hope to be again when the jetlag clears. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you thought your gaming monitor was fast, well, it might be. But as fast, as clever, and as luscious to look at as the newly-announcedMSI MPG 271QR QD-OLED X50? I doubt it. MSI's 27-inch, 1440p, QD-OLED beauty was in front of my very eyes today at Computex 2025, and it's got quite the spec sheet—including MSI's AI Care Sensor for a spot of monitor peek-a-boo. Allow me to explain. A CMOS sensor module sitting at the bottom of the display captures images of whoever's sitting in front of the monitor every 0.2 seconds, then filters that information through an NPU (yep, here comesthe magic of AI). Should you decide to get up and make a cup of coffee, the monitor can detect your absence, then switch itself off and begin its OLED care cycle to prevent burn-in. You can sit back down in front of it before it's finished, too, and it'll turn itself back on without complaint. I was shown a short clip of the monitor correctly staying on for a human subject, then switching itself off when confronted by a dragon plushie, so it's got that down to a fine art, at least. In practice, the monitor used in the live demo was a touch slow to react—although an MSI rep told me it would be much faster by the time it reaches the shelves. Anticipating privacy-related issues, my MSI hosts were keen to point out that the AI Care Sensor captures images for detection, but doesn't store them. Just as well, really. Otherwise this particular monitor would have thousands of photos of my haggard, jet-lagged visage on file, and nobody deserves to see that. Not only can the sensor turn off the monitor entirely, but it can also activate adaptive dimming, which auto-adjusts the screen brightness when you look away to save power—and auto-adjust the colour temperature of the display to compensate for the level of ambient light in a room. I'm not sure I'm entirely sold on the idea of my monitor messing with the settings for me, AI-powered or not—but if it works as well as MSI says it does it may well extend the monitors lifespan quite significantly, as well as make it look better over the course of a long day. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. All this ties in with MSI OLED Care 3.0, which also extends the maximum mandatory OLED refresh prompt from 16 hours to 24. That should mean less interruptions for those of you annoyed by such things. I'm not sure who's leaving their OLED monitor on for 16-24 hours straight to begin with, but it sure sounds like an improvement, at least. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. Back to the specs. With a 500 Hz refresh rate the MPG 271QR QD-OLED X50 is blazing fast, and a 2560 x 1440 resolution is well-suited to its 27-inch panel size. As you might expect from a monitor with these credentials, it's not cheap—$899, to be precise—which puts it in competition with the slower, yet still gorgeousMSI MPG 321URX QD-OLED, which can often be found for roughly the same money. That's a 32-inch 4K stunner, so whether the massive refresh rate (and impressive party tricks) of the MPG 271QR QD-OLED X50 wins buyers over remains to be seen. The same panel also comes (without the AI Care Sensor) in the form of the $849 MAG 272QP Q-OLED X50, which was sitting somewhat forlornly off to the side in a very crowded room. It still looks like a gorgeous display, but everyone wanted to play with the sensor-equipped version. It's not every day you see a monitor playing peek-a-boo, I guess, and at $50 more I reckon a few might pay the extra just for the novelty. Still, I've stood in front of a lot of luscious displays over the years, and these two certainly look like stunning panels in the flesh. MSI makes some of thebest gaming monitorswe've tested to date, and I'll be anxious to see if either of these two make the cut when we get them in for review.

    "title": "After raising over $800 million from its community, Star Citizen's developer delays the release of a new ship upgrade as players baulk at having to pay for it",
    "article_text": "\"For future gameplay kit introductions, we’ll ensure these items are obtainable in-game on day one.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The only thing more astonishing thanStar Citizen's ability to extract funds from its community is the eagerness with which said community has supported it. Across thirteen years, Cloud Imperium Games has raised over $800 million from a convoluted mixture of paid alpha access, subscriptions, merchandising, microtransactions, and selling spaceships that cost hundreds of dollars to players (I suppose you could call these \"macrotransactions\"). While there have been controversies and backlashes to the game in the past, such as complaints overchanges to the roadmap, the community has rarely revolted en masse at the prospect of paying for stuff. But the recent reveal of an upgrade for Star Citizen's ships has finally caused to community to raise a finger and say \"hold on a minute…\" The upgrade (or upgrades) in question are flight blades. These are designed to make ships faster or more manoeuvrable (depending on which type of blades you pick). Ship upgrades like this can generally be purchased with both real-world money or Star Citizen's in-game currency (named aUEC) and Cloud Imperium Games apparently planned for this to be the case with flight blades. However, when these upgrades were initiallyadded to the game, they couldonlybe purchased with hard cash, costing between $9.60 and $42 depending on which set you bought. Combined with the perceived advantage they provided, this led Star Citizen's community to conclude flight blades were an outright pay-to-win item. The result was an explosivebacklash, with CIG's forum post announcing the upgrade racking upalmost 2,000 bewildered responses. \"This is a[n] actual joke, there is 0 reason why these should not be in game,\" wrote user Lolman345_, while the fittingly named SaltEMike called the introduction of flight blades \"the most embarrassing thing I have seen this company do yet\". More interesting, though, are the responses from players who openly admit they're generally happy with paying for stuff. Many players replying to the announcement refer to their eagerness for the Greycat MTC, a planetary exploration vehicle that costs $45. \"I was gonna buy the MTC. I don't feel good about it now,\" user TagariusKhan. Captn agrees. \"I was also looking forward to the MTC, guess we are write going back to voting with our wallet.\" A day later, Cloud Imperium Gamesresponded, explaining why flight blades had been introduced as a purely purchasable item, and stating it was pushing back the upgrade's release to coincide with their availability through in-game currency. \"Throughout Star Citizen's evolution, one fundamental principle has remained paramount: everything you pledge for to support our development will eventually be attainable through gameplay,\" wrote Star Citizen's community director Tyler Witkin. \"Your contribution helps push things forward, but your time in the 'verse should be equally rewarded. Witkin then claimed the reason CIG pulled the trigger too fast on flight blades is because they developer is having a busy year. \"We're pushing 11 patches this year instead of 4. We’re crushing more bugs than ever, building more exciting content, moving faster than ever to make the Persistent Universe a better experience for everyone, and in moving that fast, we missed a step.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"To be clear, the new flight blades will be obtainable for aUEC in our next patch this June. We followed our usual approach by offering early access on the pledge store to help support development.\" Witkin pointed out. \"But after some reflection, we’ve decided that for smaller components like flight blades or bomb racks, they should be available in-game at the same time they appear on the store.\" In light of the reaction, this seems like the right decision. But it does not appear to have mollified the community, with discussions about Star Citizen's broader approach to pricing continuing in the comments below CIG's statement: \"The root issue here is that you continue to sell more and more items in the game that have a wider impact on what a player would do day to day,\" writes SaltEMike. \"Components shouldn't be on the store AT ALL. Never mind later on. People are angry cos these are being sold in any way shape or form for real money,\" adds user Liana. As things stand, flight blades will now launch as both purchasable and earnable items in June, with Witkin emphasising that \"For future gameplay kit introductions, we’ll ensure these items are obtainable in-game on day one.\" Meanwhile, the development of Star Citizen and its single-player spinoff Squadron 42 rumble on with no firm release date for either. Last year, Chris Roberts said he was \"confident\" that Squadron 42 would launchin 2026, while in January he claimed Star Citizen was \"closer than everto realizing a dream many have said is impossible\" but was no more specific than that. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom.

    "article_text": "Help with solving Sunday's puzzle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Save yourself from any alphabet-twisting worries with ourWordlehelp. A quick run through our general tips might help you find a new path—especially if you pair that knowledge with our hint for today's game too. And if Sunday's puzzle is still causing you trouble, the May 18 (1429) answer is never more than an easy, puzzle-winning click away. Ah, the perfect Sunday Wordle. A treat of a first row to start me off with, an extremely weird second line that was all wrong in all the right ways, and a third guess that revealed nothing but green letters. I love it when the alphabet behaves for me like that. Make sure you pay today's hint a quick visit if it doesn't look like your game's going so well, it'll soon turn those greys and yellows green. If you were not just angry but furious, truly fuming over something, you'd be this. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. If you've decided to play Wordle but you're not sure where to start, I'll help set you on the path to your first winning streak. Make all your guesses count and become a Wordle winner with these quick tips: You're not racing against the clock so there's no reason to rush. In fact, it's not a bad idea to treat the game like a casual newspaper crossword and come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Sometimes stepping away for a while means you can come back with a fresh perspective. Another weekend win. The answer to the May 18 (1429) Wordle isLIVID. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Previous Wordle solutions can help to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer isn't likely to be repeated. They can also give you some solid ideas for starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. Here are some recent Wordle answers: There are six rows of five boxes presented to you by Wordle each day, and you'll need to work out which five-letter word is hiding among them to win the daily puzzle. Start with a strong wordlike ALIVE—or any other word with a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You should also avoid starting words with repeating letters, so you don't waste the chance to confirm or eliminate an extra letter. Once you've typed your guess and hit Enter, you'll see which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the first, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you might have missed on the first row—just don't forget to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the correct word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words and don't forget letters can repeat too (eg: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.

    "article_text": "Bring out your dead. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We've been following the development of co-op action-horror game Blight: Survival for a good long while now, going back to a gameplay reveal trailer in 2022 that showedfilthy knights fighting filthier zombies. A recent sign of life in what might have looked like a fungus-encrusted peasant corpse, the Blight: Survival team recently shared a look at the development of the Marshlands biome in a post with an evocative name:Mud, rot and the weight of a dying world. \"The Marshlands were quiet,\" its in-universe description begins, \"but never peaceful. The locals survived on whatever the waters offered, but most of it was taken by those in power. Peat-digging, once a vital way to earn a living, became a brutal curse. As bodies stacked up and old customs faded, strange growths began to spread across the land, marking the beginning of a transformation that left the land and its people unrecognizable.\" Blight: Survival is set in an alternate 14th century where a zombie plague has broken out, leading to widespread banditry and a serious uptick in the number of thatched-roof cottages mysteriously catching fire. It's as bleak as all get-out and the Marshlands exemplify that, with corpses in gibbets hanging from a tree, flocks of crows pecking at the dead, and a spooky ruin across the water. The vibe I get from Blight: Survival is a cross between Hunt: Showdown and Vermintide. It'll apparently be a purely PvE game you can also play solo and offline, with stealth and archery looking like valid options as well as swordplay. I look forward to putting arrows between the eyes of zombies in a kind of low-tech Resident Evil, if Blight: Survival allows for it. Blight: Survival doesn't currently have a release date, though we do know it plans to launch with a traditional monetization structure and DLC, and will support up to four players in co-op.

Some of the biggest names in computing, includingNvidia,AMDand Qualcomm, will be holding keynote presentations - and in this live blog we'll be reporting direct from the event, so you'll get the very latest updates on what the future holds for laptops, PCs, networking and much more. A key theme of this year's Computex event is Artificial Intelligence (AI), so we expect a lot of companies will take the opportunity to show how putting AI in their products will help improve our lives. Will it finally convince consumers that AI laptops are worth buying? Hopefully, we'll find out this week.

This hasn't been a very well-kept secret, but it looks like Huang is closing out his keynote with the announcement of Nvidia Constellation, Nvidia's brand new global headquarters, will be located in Taipei, Taiwan. It looks like we're coming close to the end of Jensen Huang's keynote. Huang is bringing things back around to the importance of Taiwan in the AI industry. Our TR Pro colleagues have their work cut out for them today, let me tell you... I'm dead. Huang just said that the new Nvidia RTX Pro enterprise and omniverse server racks are so powerful that they could even run Crysis. Let me tell you that the dead silence in the room as hundreds of industry analysts and professionals wondered what the hell Jensen meant by that was the highlight of the keynote for me. \"I guess there are no GeForce gamers in the room,\" Huang said. It got a chuckle out of me and Matt, though. If you haven't gotten the chance yet, you should check out ourRTX 5060 preview, where my colleague Christian Guyton got an advanced, extended look at the new graphics card. As Huang just explained, so much AI and data center infrastructure is being built now that it's hard to really wrap your head around, but as he says \"The more you buy, the more you build.\" I know I keep harping on how little GeForce is talked about during these keynotes, but I think that gamers deserve a little more attention than Nvidia's been giving them. Nvidia's graphics cards are generally fantastic products, and gamers who've been buying them for more than two decades helped provide the stable and profitable foundation for Nvidia to develop the advanced AI technology that has turned it into a multi-trillion dollar company. Again, Computex is not nearly as consumer focused as CES, but woof, if you blinked, you'd have missed the announcement of Nvidia's new graphics card. So about 90% of Nvidia's keynotes are now non-GeForce, but \"Nvidia has many children,\" Huang. The Nvidia RTX 5060 'reveal' section of the keynote lasted less than a minute though, and we didn't get any real discussion of the RTX 5060 either. Honestly, Huang spent more time talking about the RTX 5060 GPU in the MSI laptop he was holding than the graphics card in his other hand. He might have mentioned the manufacturer of the graphics card he was holding and I missed it, but I don't think he did. Nvidia GeForce might be one of Nvidia's children, but it's clearly less favored than it used to be. LOL, speak of the devil. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 is here. Nvidia aiming for AI factory infrastructure—an industry measured \"in the trillions of dollars\", according to Huang—really reiterates my concerns about the future of Nvidia GeForce as a consumer product. With so much emphasis on AI and industrial products and services, how much time and resources will continue to be invested in making thebest graphics cardsgeneration after generation? I will have a lot more to say about this later, but I 100% agree with Huang that 'intelligence infrastructure', i.e., AI, is following the exact same trajectory as the internet did in the 1990s. Huang really hitting the point that Nvidia isn't really a technology company anymore, but an AI infrastructure company. Given how many data center GPUs they've been selling, it's very hard to argue with that. Lots of data center and industry talk right out the gate. Huang tells us that Nvidia donated DGX1 to OpenAI, emphasizing how Nvidia has been the bedrock of the AI industry. Here's Jensen! In fairness to Nvidia here, Computex isn't CES, with the latter being much more consumer product focused, so it's very understandable that this presentation is going to be 98% about industrial applications of advanced Nvidia data center and embedded hardware. Have you heard the good news about Tokens? OK, here we go. It's a fairly packed house for the keynote, and I can tell you its alotof industry folks. Not consumer graphics kind of industry, mind you, but industrial and finance types. Lots of analyst and exhibitor badges, and given the shakeup in the AI field with the likes of Deepseek, I expect Huang to spend alotof time making the case that Nvidia hardware is still needed for AI going forward. Good morning from Taipei, folks! This is John Loeffler, Components Editior for TechRadar, kicking off the biggest computing show of the year with live coverage of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's keynote address. If this keynote is like past Nvidia presentations, I fully expect there to be an overwhelming amount of data center, AI, and industry talk, with not very much time devoted to consumer products like Nvidia GeForce, but i've been surprised before. With much of the Nvidia Blackwell lineup already announced, we're waiting on news for some more budget-friendly options to make an appearance, but we'll have to wait and see what Huang says starting in about 15 minutes. Just spotted this while connecting to the Wi-Fi at the Nvidia keynote. Has a rival snuck in to keep tabs on what Team Green has in store?! With that, I'm going to hand the live blog over to John Loeffler, our GPU expert who will be listening to what Jensen Huang has to say with great interest. Is it just me or does the inside of the Taipei Music Center look a lot like the Nvidia Shield? OK, it's probably just me. What makes me think there's going to be a lot of AI talk at this keynote? Well, there's a few clues dotted around... Matt Hanson here, and I've arrived at Taipei Music Center for Nvidia's keynote presentation, with CEO Jensen Huang. There's a big crowd for this presentation, and I have a feeling we're going to heara lotabout AI. Hopefully they'll be some announcements for PC gamers (like me) as well. Ellen Jennings-Trace reporting from Taipei -TechRadar Prohas landed for this year's Computex! First up for Pro is a tour of Synology HQ, with more to come! Here's the Acer Helios Neo 14 AI. It comes with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, 32GB RAM and an RTX 5070 GPU. The 14-inch screen can be configured with an OLED panel. Again, the AI in the name suggests this is a device capable of artificial intelligence tasks, though I still feel we've not been shown what these AI tasks are and how they help - especially when it comes to gaming PCs. An Acer spokesperson told me that the included software uses AI to optimize the laptop, keeping components cool and prolonging battery life, but these aren't terribly revolutionary features to be honest. My hunt for a reason to care about AI in laptops continues - and with that I'm going to brave the rain (at least it's very warm here) and go back to my hotel. Stay tuned for more from Computex 2025 from TechRadar's team on the ground. Of course, I had to have a quick play ofIndiana Jones and the Great Circle, and it looks and runs great. The OLED screen is bright and vibrant, and that 240Hz refresh rate means the game feels smooth and responsive. I've also had a chance to look at the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S AI. This gaming laptop can be configured with up to an RTX 5070 Ti GPU and 240Hz OLED screen. The 'S' in the name again means this is a slim version, and while it's certainly not going to compete with the likes of the MacBook Air, for a gaming laptop it is certainly impressively thin. What's more eye-catching is the Indiana Jones-themed design on show at the event. I'm not sure if you'll be able to buy it with this, which would be a shame. I'll clarify Acer when I get the chance. Next up is the Nitro V 16S AI. This is a more affordable version of the 16S. It has the same 'slim' design, and is a bit lighter than the 16S. However, the GPU choice tops out at an RTX 5070 - still a very good laptop GPU, but not as powerful as the RTX 5070 Ti that the 16S can come with. It might be quite hard to see but I placed the Nitro 16 AI on top of the 'S' version and you can see there is a slight difference in thickness. Not enough to justify a much higher price, though. OK, so figured out the 'S' means 'slim'. The Nitro 16S AI is less than 19.9mm thick. However, I don't seetoomuch difference between that and the standard Nitro 16 AI (on the left). All of these laptops come with liquid metal thermal grease to keep them cool when gaming. It's a noisy environment here so can't really tell if they are loud. There doesn't seem to be any noticable fan noise. We also have the Nitro 16S AI (above) and the Nitro 16 AI (below). I wonder what the S stands for... Look at these beauties. We have the Nitro 18 AI (notice a trend?), which comes with up to an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 processor, up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070Ti GPU, and 2560 x 1600 18-inch screen. I played a bit ofIndiana Jones and the Great Circleon it, as you'd expect with an RTX 5070Ti GPU, it runs brilliantly at 1440p. Right, going to move on from the Swift laptops for a while and take a look at Acer's Predator lineup of gaming laptops. This is the Swift Edge 14 AI. It's main selling point (apart from the AI features, again this comes with an Intel CPU capable of 120 TOPS), is it's ultra-light weight. It's less than 1KG and feelsreallylight. You'd hardly notice carrying it around with you. This comes at a slight cost, as it feels a bit cheaper than some of the other laptops here. But, as with the LG gram lineup of laptops, the fact you get a powerful laptop that feels so light is really impressive. Definitely one to look out for. One thing I really like about this laptop is that the touchpad features quick-access icons to launch apps, mute the volume and more. It's a nice touch. Touch... get it? Here's the Swift Go 16 AI. Has a 2K OLED display and an Intel Core Ultra CPU capable of 120 TOPS (essentially how good the NPU is at AI tasks). Most Copilot+ PCs at the moment offer around 40 TOPS (trillion operations per second), so this should be quite a bit faster at on-device AI tasks. Will anyone care though? There's also the Acer Swift X 14 AI. As far as I can tell, it's pretty much identical to the Swift X 14, but with AMD processors instead - up to an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365. Always good to see a laptop for creatives that comes with a microSD slot. I'm currently taking a look at the Acer Swift X 14 - a great looking thin and light laptop with an OLED screen that looks fantastic in real life. It comes with the latest Intel Core Ultra chips (up to an Ultra 9), and can even fit in an Nvidia RTX 5070 GPU. That's pretty impressive for such a thin laptop - I can easily hold it in one hand. This isn't a gaming laptop, however, and is more aimed at content creators and digital creatives. First stop is visiting Acer's pre-Computex preview. Thecompany announced all of its new devices a few days ago, and now I get a chance to see them in the flesh. If you're wondering what I'm looking forward to seeing at Computex 2025, then check out my article onwhat I expect to see. Spoiler alert: I think there's going to be A LOT of AI.

    "title": "After Asus and Dell, MSI is launching a Nvidia DGX Spark clone, but I am still skeptical about the whole 'desktop AI supercomputer' moniker",
    "article_text": "Could 1,000 TOPS replace real AI infrastructure? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. MSIis the latest entrant in the race to miniaturize AI infrastructure with its upcoming EdgeXpert MS-C931, a compact desktop system positioned as an AI supercomputer. Following the launches of theDell Pro Max with GB10and theAsus Ascent GX10, MSI’s new machine is built onNvidia’s DGX Spark platform and will be showcased at COMPUTEX 2025. While the hardware sounds formidable, questions remain about whether this device truly lives up to the lofty label of a \"desktop AI supercomputer\", or if it’s simply a case of marketing overreach. The EdgeXpert MS-C931 is powered by Nvidia’s GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, delivering up to 1,000 TOPS of AI performance (FP4), 128 GB of unified memory, and ConnectX-7 high-speed networking. MSI says the system targets sectors like education, finance, and healthcare, where data privacy and low latency could justify on-premise hardware over cloud-based services. Given its specs, the MS-C931 could rank among the most capableworkstation PCscurrently in development. Its high memory bandwidth and AI-focused compute also suggest it could be a top-tierPC for coding, especially for machine learning or large-scale simulation tasks. However, the real value of this product depends less on its raw specs and more on how grounded MSI’s claims about its purpose truly are. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The phrase “desktop AI supercomputer” continues to be used liberally, and MSI’s adoption of it raises similar concerns to those previously leveled at Asus andDell. A supercomputer, by definition, implies massive parallel processing power, usually deployed across large-scale server racks. Shrinking that concept down to a single desktop machine, even with cutting-edge components, feels more like branding than technical accuracy. MSI isn’t alone in this; Nvidia’s DGX Spark framework itself seems at least partially designed to enable this kind of positioning. For all the talk of supporting top-tierAI toolsand delivering enterprise-grade performance at the edge, there’s currently little evidence that these systems approach the breadth or scalability of true supercomputing infrastructure. Even 1,000 TOPS, while impressive, must be understood in the context of what modern AI teams actually require to train or run LLMs. While MSI may succeed in delivering a dense, high-performance system for localized inferencing and AI prototyping, the real-world utility of the MS-C931 is likely narrower than the “supercomputer” label implies. Until these machines prove their value in practice, calling them desktop supercomputers feels more like aspirational branding than a reflection of what they truly deliver.

    "article_text": "There's also a video of AUO’s see-through screen in action When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Transparent screens on devices like smartphones and tablets have long been a staple of sci-fi films and TV shows because they look good, even if they aren’t always practical. Now, though, they’restarting to become a reality. Taiwanese display manufacturer AUO (AU Optronics Corporation), which was formed in 2001 through the merger ofAcerDisplay Technology and Unipac Optoelectronics Corporation, has demonstrated a dual-sided transparent Micro LED display at Touch Taiwan 2025. This first of its kind display is a thin 17.3-inch screen that offers a transparent experience on both sides, and can present different content depending on the viewing angle. The screen can show separate images or data on each side, and AUO suggests one possible use case would be in first-class airline cabins, where passengers and flight attendants can each see their own interfaces. AUO’s demo included a translation interface, presenting seamless multilingual communication through the display itself. Commercial scenarios such as store windows, museum exhibits, and digital signage are also seen as natural fits for the technology. The ultra-thin design, combined with transparent Micro LED technology, represents a shift from traditional display use toward something closer to ambient computing. Unlike single-sided transparent OLEDs, which often struggle with brightness and image clarity in direct light, AUO’s Micro LED tech offers higher brightness and color performance - potentially overcoming many of those limitations. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! AUO has not revealed when it expects the display to go into production, nor has it given any hint at pricing, although it’s fair to say the screens won’t be cheap. A video posted onYouTubeshows the screen in use at the 50-second mark. Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

    "title": "This new Netflix series blends Black Mirror bleakness with cringe comedy and it's an ideal weekend binge-watch",
    "article_text": "It's been very divisive with the critics! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Even though reviews ofBad Thoughtshaven't ranked highly enough to earn it a place on ourbest Netflix showsroundup, the streamer's new anthology series does come highly recommended from me. I'm a huge fan of darkly funny storiesandanthologies, and I do placeBlack Mirrorseason 7into that category, even if many of the tales in Charlie Brooker's series are downright bleak with no comedic relief. InBad Thoughts, however, the disturbing nature of the stories is offset by some gross-out, cringe comedy and usually I'm not a huge fan of that, but it really worked for me here. Check out the trailer for the six-part series, now playing on one of thebest streaming services. The series is Tom Segura’s first go at sketch comedy. It sees him play various different roles including an incompetent assassin, a country singer who kidnaps his fans, and a difficult customer at a coffee shop. You never quite know what you're going to get as you jump between episodes, and it's guaranteed to shock you. And seriously it'sveryshocking. The first episode alone made me think \"oh,thisis how dark we're getting, okay!\", and even though you can kind of predict what's coming, it still fills you with this nervous sense of dread. You'll also laugh too, which is a strange sensation indeed. There's some really great guest stars in this series too includingJurassic Park’s Daniella Pineda,The Sopranos’ Robert Iler andBoardwalk Empire’s Shea Whigham, accompanying Segura on this totally wild adventure. The show is rated R for \"crude humor\" and \"injury detail\" and seriously, you will cringe in places. This is definitely an adults-only show and covers some topics that are not family friendly at all, so be warned! I wouldn't be surprised if you watch some of this behind your eyes, quite honestly. Segura has got the balance between humour and horrifying stuff right here, in my opinion. He plays on stereotypes, parodies things like action flicks, disaster movies, and A24 movies, and isn't afraid to justgo there. The same as any anthology series, some episodes are stronger than others and people will have their own thoughts about each one, whether that's positive or not. Bad Thoughtshas a 55% Rotten Tomatoes critical rating, not high enough to be considered 'Fresh' by the review aggregrate site's standards, so it's become this weekend's 'Marmite' watch. It's going to delight some people and completely disgust others, and perhaps that's enough to convince you to give it a go! Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "article_text": "Lighter and stronger When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We might see both theGalaxy Z Fold 7and a newSamsung tri-fold phonethis coming July, and the latest rumors from the supply chain are that both foldables might come with a titanium backplate that connects the hinge and display panels. This comes fromThe Elec(viaSamMobile), and should mean both a lighter and a tougher phone overall. While theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6(launched in July 2024) uses a carbon fiber backplate, titanium was used in theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition(launched in October 2024). There's definitely been a trend towards more titanium in smartphones in recent years, including theSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra– although that phone uses titanium in its frame rather than its backplate, as it doesn't have a hinge. The material brings with it a number of appealing properties, including lightness and durability, but it is harder and more expensive to make than the alternatives. That might be reflected in the prices ofSamsung's upcoming foldables. Another tidbit from the report from The Elec is that Samsung might do away with the digitizer part of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 display that would enable it to support S Pen inputs – and which would enable the handset to be thinner than ever. Thin phones are having a moment, with theSamsung Galaxy S25 Edgenow unveiled, theiPhone 17 Airon the way fromApplelater this year, and the Oppo Find N5 recently claiming the honor of being the thinnest foldable phone in the market. It sounds as though this is a trend that Samsung's next foldables will follow. There have been lots of leaks and rumors along the way already with these phones. The tri-fold (which may be called the Galaxy G Fold)is expected to sharethe same hinges and speakers as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, for example. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The two phones could also be announced at the same time, alongside theGalaxy Z Flip 7– which will most probably be at some point during July, although the tri-fold model might not go on sale at the same time as the other two foldables.

First, I thought that there was a group where luck was the connection – but I couldn’t get beyond FLUKE and CHANCE. Then I guessed that BLUBBER and FLIPPER must be part of a group to do with marine biology. Out of sheer luck I added FLUKE and BAWL and got “one away”, so swapped the latter for MELON – which I now know is the name given for the tissue found in the foreheads of toothed whales.

It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room.

Get ready, folks:Nvidia's ever-charismatic CEO Jensen Huang is soon to return to the stage (and screen, if you're not lucky enough to be in Taiwan this week), no doubt preparing to don his trademark leather jacket to deliver Team Green's Computex keynote address. What can we expect? Well, AI is likely to be at the forefront of this year's presentation - just like last year - with a high probability that the focus will be on the professional use cases of AI, as well as a bit of gaming scattered in there too (after all, Nvidia doesn't want us to forget its roots). The Nvidia Computex keynote starts at 11AM Taipei time on May 19, which is 8PM PT/11PM EDT on May 18 for the US, and 4AM BST, on May 19 in the UK (sorry, Brits). The event will take place at the Taipei Music Center in Taiwan. Last year's Nvidia keynote was a pre-Computex presentation delivered on the Sunday evening in local time, which made the viewing hours a lot more lenient for viewers in the UK and the eastern US - not so this time around, though. You'll be able to watch the Nvidia Computex 2025 keynote directly onNvidia's website, as well as on theNvidia YouTube page. We've also embedded the live stream below to make it easier to follow along with the keynote as it happens. If you're not able to tune in directly, you can also follow our live blog of the event, which will start shortly before the keynote begins and include all of the juicy details from Jensen's presentation - so be sure to check back in with TechRadar to make sure you don't miss a thing. Much like last year, AI is expected to be the watchword of this keynote, with Nvidia once again making big strides in the commercial and consumer AI spaces since Computex 2024. This will probably be mostly focused on professional use cases for artificial intelligence; we can expect to hear about some big, sweeping initiatives where AI is helping to run public transport systems, predict the weather, and fix global warming. No doubt there will also be some more focused examples; how AI can benefit professionals in scientific and creative industries, for example. RTX 5000 is also likely to make an appearance, with the long-awaited RTX 5060 officially dropping on May 19, so there will no doubt be a section of the presentation dedicated to gaming.

    "title": "I love that this tiny NAS offers up to 32TB of SSD storage and four 2.5GbE LAN ports, but why the DisplayPort connector?",
    "article_text": "SZBOX M1 MINI Plus offers connectivity beyond what most NAS devices provide When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In the expanding market of compact network-attached storage (NAS) devices, the SZBOX M1 MINI Plus has emerged with an unusual combination of features that blur the line between a storage solution and a desktop PC. The SZBOX M1 MINI Plus is available in two configurations: one powered by the energy-efficientIntelN100, and the other by the more powerful Intel Core i3-N305, which features an octa-core design and turbo speeds of up to 3.8 GHz. This external unit supports up to four removable NVMe drives via front-facing PCIe 3.0 bays, offering up to 20TB of external storage, plus an additional internal NVMe slot. The i3 model allows users to scale storage further, up to 32TB using SSDs. Equipped with four 2.5GbE LAN ports, the device signals a nod to enterprise-grade networking. This setup supports soft router functionality through Linux distributions like OpenWRT or iKuai, indicating SZBOX is targeting a technically savvy user base. It also includes USB 3.0 and 3.2 ports for external drives and peripherals, an SD card slot, and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for wireless connectivity. Still, this level of network hardware is typically found in larger, more expensive systems. Whether the M1 MINI Plus can deliver performance on par with those systems, or simply overpromises, remains to be seen. Its media-handling ambitions also warrant attention. On the rear panel are HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.4 connectors, both capable of4Kat 60 fps withHDRsupport. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! This setup would make sense for a compact media center or light desktop PC. However, in the context of aNASdevice, the inclusion of a DisplayPort feels somewhat out of place. One might ask: Who’s actually plugging a NAS directly into a monitor, and for what purpose? But SZBOX seems to enjoy unconventional combinations; itsSZBOX S9, for instance, similarly blurs the line between tablet and mini PC. On the software front, the SZBOX M1 MINI Plus ships withWindows 11, unless purchased as a barebones unit. Linux distributions are also supported, expanding its versatility. As a result, the M1 MINI Plus can function as more than just a NAS, it could also serve as a basicworkstationor multimedia hub, running Kodi, IPTV, or even retro gaming emulators. That said, this hybrid identity might confuse more than it clarifies, raising questions about what the device is truly optimized for. The SZBOX M1 MINI Plus is currently available for purchase on AliExpress for $249.

    "title": "4 features we know are coming to Wear OS 6 this year",
    "article_text": "It's going to be a big year for Google wearables, and others When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As we covered earlier this week, Google held itsAndroid Showas a precursor to the main event of Google I/O next week, and it's clear the tech giant has big plans forWear OS 6. While we're expecting the company to add more meat on the bones of what it showed this week with its flagship event in the coming days, there are already plenty of reasons to be excited. From the rollout ofGeminifeatures to thebest Samsung watches and beyondto a huge visual update, here's everything we know about that's coming to the platform soon. Gemini will roll out to Google's devices, but also to devices like theSamsung Galaxy Watch 7andSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra. From retaining small pieces of information like which locker you're using at the gym, to creating a bespoke playlist with a quick request or tapping into personal context, Gemini on your wrist could be super helpful in a bunch of small ways. Better still, it'll run on your current device as long as your wearable supports Google Assistant, which means you won't need to splurge on a new model unless you really want to. Android 16's new 'Material 3 Expressive' look is expected to modernize Google's OS on phones, and that's extending to Wear OS, too. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Users can expect a change to more rounded UI elements, reducing the boxiness of the interface and updating animations to make better use of the space available. Examples such as the above have shown the UI shrinking as it leaves the view of the user, focusing more closely on what's in the center of the screen. That updated UI ties into a new set of buttons that can display key information. These are intended to be glanceable, so they'll grow to fill the available space on display to allow users to read things like calendar appointments and messages more clearly in a split second. With all these changes, it certainly feels like Google is honing in on its circular display, and it's definitely something that helps it offer something a little different to the squircle offered by thebest Apple watches. One of our biggest concerns with all these slick new animations and AI features was having Wear OS 6 eat into the battery life of our devices, particularly since we're not necessarily having to buy a new one. Thankfully, it sounds as though Google heard our prayers. \"With Wear OS 6, we’re continuing to improve performance and optimize power — in fact, this update delivers up to 10% more battery life,\" it said. It might sound like a small margin, but in practice, that's an extra 2.4 hours of wear for a device like theGoogle Pixel Watch 3, which has a 24-hour battery life.

    "article_text": "Silicon to the rescue When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We're expecting theiPhone 17 Airto replace theiPhone 16 Plusthis year, and it's expected to be super-slim – which has raised some questions about battery life. Now a new leak suggests those questions could be answered using next-gen silicon battery technology. According to a report fromBloomberg, battery maker TDK is ahead of schedule with a significant upgrade, where silicon is used for the battery anode rather than the conventional graphite. This means 15% more energy can be packed into the same space. Shipping for these batteries will begin by the end of June, which may just giveAppleenough time to incorporate the batteries into its iPhone 17 series – including the iPhone 17 Air, which will have less space for a battery than the other models in the range. Now we're being pretty speculative about joining up these particular dots, but we know that TDK supplies both Apple andSamsung. Samsung has of course just unveiled its own ultra-slim handset in the form of theSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge. If the most recent leak is accurate, then the iPhone 17 Air is going to comewith a battery capacity of 2,800 mAh. That's some way short of the 3,651 mAh battery you'll find in the current iPhone 16 model, for example. And previous rumors about the iPhone 17 Air battery life have contradicted each other.One recent reportsuggested that all-day battery life isn't guaranteed for the new phone, and that Apple might offer a battery case accessory for it. However, back in March, a well-placed source said that battery life would becomparable to current iPhone 16 models. Bear in mind that the device will still be in testing at this point, which may explain the conflicting accounts. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. We have previously heard that the iPhone 17 Airmight use next-gen battery techof some description, and that the upcoming iOS 19 is also going todeliver an AI-powered battery optimization toolthat should boost battery life further.

    "title": "Scream 7 is one of my most-anticipated new horror movies – here are 5 things I want to see",
    "article_text": "Less gore, more scares When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Slasher fans rejoice! The next installment in theScreamfranchise recently wrapped filming and is slated to hit theaters worldwide February 2026. This sequel follows the series timeline, albeit in a slightly-tweaked fashion.Scream(2022) andScream 6directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett stepped down and were temporarily replaced byHappy Death Dayhelmer Christopher Landon. He then exited the project along with Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega, making way for original screenwriter Kevin Williamson to take residence in the director's chair. While the path fromScream6 to 7 has beentumultuousto say the least, some steadiness is ensured: franchise stalwarts Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox return as Sidney Prescott and Gale Weathers respectively and a swathe of recognisable cast members poised to reprise their roles. With this freshstab, ahem, heading to theaters in ten months, that gives us plenty of time to embark on speculation galore amid our own desires for thenew movieand the future of the series. Here's what I want to see: In an ideal world,Scream 7would see us finally deliver aNew Nightmare-inspired take on the franchise. After initial set photos hit the web fromScream 5, I was convinced that's what was in store for us back in 2022. (The jock wearing the letterman jacket on the porch at Stu's house? Could have been a screenshot from the 1996 original!) Alas, from what we've seen ofScream 7this isn't the case. So now we know they're probably not playing versions of themselves in \"the real world\", how does Williamson plan to bring back characters who are very much dead? David Arquette, Matthew Lillard, and Scott Foley are confirmed but Dewey, Stu, and Roman all died on screen. Roman engineered a voice changer that allowed him to sound like any person, living or dead, so there's the chance they could all have voice cameos. I wouldn't be opposed to that brand of twist. With the Scream series' continued push into tech, it makes sense that we might even see AI versions of past characters. The idea of AI deepfakes hitting the web to imply that Stu didn't die or something, to toy with Sidney's sanity, makes sense. Matthew Lillard's elation at being able to return wascaptured at a recent con event, where he confirmed he's back and jokingly referenced coming back as 'a fairy godmother'. Hewent on to discuss working on setwith both Williamson and Campbell– which would suggest he does have sceneswith Sidney. Likewise, Foley appeared on Kelly and Mark Live andconfirmedhe IS playing Roman. So this suggests that they are playing their original characters (no sneaky little cameos in the background like Lillard did inScream 2?) . I wasn't the biggest fan of the spectre of Billy Loomis appearing to his daughter – for many reasons – so I'd rather not have a de-aged Skeet Ulrich situation again. What if instead, the ghosts of Sidney's past are literally haunting her? Speaking of… Alright, hear me out. Am I the only person who liked Sid's mom returning from the grave inScream 3? I get it; it was Sid's mind playing tricks on her combined with her brother's shenanigans. So, not exactly a return from the grave. But still, ithintedat the idea of an otherworldly element. We're entering the late-stages of a slasher franchise– if there's ever a time to push the boat out, it's now. Jason literally pushed the boat out when he went to Manhattan. Freddy's backstory grew out of control in the latter portions by incorporating dream demons into his whole schtick. Michael Myers turned out to be… well there was a cult and a summoning ritual involved. I can see why fans would loathe this approach– it's jumping theshark, it's doing something none of the other movies have done. But at this point? Why not expandScreaminto the last frontier it’s yet to explore? We've repeated the same formula over and over for the previous five sequels. If handled right, the idea of a whole slew of Ghostfaces from the past coming to haunt Sidney could really be quite terrifying. Which segues nicely into my next point! Arguably one thing all Scream fans can agree on – because ranking the Scream movies is not one of them – is that the earlier entries knew how to execute truly scary setpieces. Naturally, the opening of the 1996 original is the top shelf example, followed by Cici's death and Gale in the AV room, both superior moments fromScream 2. The most recent sequels failed to really crank up the tension, and explored the action and gore over genuine fear-building. Granted, I do like some gore –Scream 4wins the award for nastiest entry – but not at the expense of a damn good nerve-jangling. I want that hold-your-breath, peek-behind-your-hand sort of feeling. Some of these aspects were hinted at, certainly, but never explored in depth. To put it plainly – the Scream sequels have a woody for Woodsboro. Whereas the first film and its immediate successor dealt with eviscerating both innocent teens *and* genre tropes, the subsequent films have careened into the quagmire of their own making. It's the sort of metatextuality that lacks depth and staying power. Scream thrives when it skewers the horror genre and modern cultural mores as a whole; not simply the Scream in-universe of Woodsboro and Stab. But here's the rub: how do we do that when the horror genre barely has time to evolve between sequels? Well, here's what I'm hoping is in store forScream 7. What if Williamson and writer Guy Busick dive into the late-stage franchise slashers for inspiration. Yes, sure,Scream 6kinda did that, with Mindy's \"rules speech\", but it was the weakest part of the film and not particularly memorable. Let's explore those wacky Chucky, Freddy, Michael and Jason sequels and rip 'em apart. (And yes, this would tie in nicely to my earlier idea to bring in supernatural elements!) While the open back door ofScream 3's closing shots hinted at a perfect ending for Sidney– she's been yanked out of peace and back into the mayhem only a Ghostface can bring over and over again. How can we tell a new story? From the looks ofleaked set footage, this sequel takes place in an entirely new location– the fictional Pine Grove, Indiana. Sidney is married (not to Mark Kincaid, alas) to Joel McHale's character, Mark. We know there's a time jump; Sidney's daughter is at an age where she's played by a 24 year-old, so that suggests she's portraying a teen. This whole setup would hint that Sid's had a while out of the spotlight. Presumably we've had no more killings between 6 and this one. Scream 5 alluded to the torch being passed in quite a comical moment and it sort of happened? But with Melissa Barerra and Jenna Ortega unfortunately both leaving the franchise, that shot that idea in the foot. This new cast is absolutely stacked – so why not have someone new anchor the series? I want Sidney to have a happy ending that doesn't involve an armoured fortress a la Laurie Strode inHalloween2018 or a life on the run like The Terminator's Sarah Connor. She deserves a truly peaceful life, yes, but that doesn't mean it can't be interesting or therapeutic for her. She's provided counselling services for women experiencing trauma (Scream 3), she wrote a book about her own wranglings (Scream 4), and she flat-out left town (Scream 5 and 6). What if she sticks around and makes peace in a new way? We'll find out whenScream 7opens in theaters on February 27, 2026.

    "title": "Microsoft, Google, and Meta have borrowed EV tech for the next big thing in data centers: 1MW watercooled racks",
    "article_text": "One megawatt per rack is no longer science fiction When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As demand for artificial intelligence workloads intensifies, the physical infrastructure ofdata centersis undergoing rapid and radical transformation. The likes of Google,Microsoft, and Meta are now drawing on technologies initially developed for electric vehicles (EVs), particularly 400VDC systems, to address the dual challenges of high-density power delivery and thermal management. The emerging vision is of data center racks capable of delivering up to 1 megawatt of power, paired with liquid cooling systems engineered to manage the resulting heat. The shift to 400VDC power distribution marks a decisive break from legacy systems. Google previously championed the industry's move from 12VDC to 48VDC, but the current transition to +/-400VDC is being enabled by EV supply chains and propelled by necessity. The Mt. Diablo initiative, supported by Meta, Microsoft, and the Open Compute Project (OCP), aims to standardize interfaces at this voltage level. Google says this architecture is a pragmatic move that frees up valuable rack space for compute resources by decoupling power delivery from IT racks via AC-to-DC sidecar units. It also improves efficiency by approximately 3%. Cooling, however, has become an equally pressing issue. With next-generation chips consuming upwards of 1,000 watts each, traditional air cooling is rapidly becoming obsolete. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Liquid cooling has emerged as the only scalable solution for managing heat in high-density compute environments. Google has embraced this approach with full-scale deployments; its liquid-cooled TPU pods now operate at gigawatt scale and have delivered 99.999% uptime over the past seven years. These systems have replaced large heatsinks with compact cold plates, effectively halving the physical footprint of server hardware and quadrupling compute density compared to previous generations. Yet, despite these technical achievements, skepticism is warranted. The push toward 1MW racks is based on the assumption of continuously rising demand, a trend that may not materialize as expected. While Google's roadmap highlights AI's growing power needs - projecting more than 500 kW per rack by 2030 - it remains uncertain whether these projections will hold across the broader market. It’s also worth noting that the integration of EV-related technologies into data centers brings not only efficiency gains but also new complexities, particularly concerning safety and serviceability at high voltages. Nonetheless, the collaboration between hyperscalers and the open hardware community signals a shared recognition that existing paradigms are no longer sufficient.

    "article_text": "Kinhank K18 Pro sounds cool until you read the fine print When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Mostportable monitorsfocus solely on display quality, but the Kinhank K18 Pro takes a different approach by integrating Google TV 12, and transforming it into a standalone entertainment hub with access to Netflix,YouTube, and other apps, without the need for a separate device. The Kinhank K18 Pro is DRM-certified, meaning it supports high-quality playback from paid streaming services. It also includes a Bluetooth remote and a microphone to enable voice control. However, the product listing lacks information about the processor, RAM, and storage, suggesting that it may simply function as an output device for a connected computer rather than a fully independent smart display. This device features an 18.4-inch4KUHD display with a 60 Hz refresh rate, which may not satisfy users seeking smoother motion, especially in gaming scenarios. The monitor uses an IPS panel with 8-bit + FRC technology, simulating 10.7 billion colors. It covers 85% of the NTSC color gamut and claims 120% sRGB coverage, adequate for everyday tasks but insufficient for professional color-critical work that demands AdobeRGB or DCI-P3 accuracy. The screen has a 1000:1 contrast ratio and a brightness of 300 cd/m², which limits the effectiveness of its HDR10 support, particularly in brightly lit environments. In terms of connectivity, the monitor includes twoUSB Type-Cports, a microSD card reader, a 3.5mm audio jack, and both HDMI input and output, making it suitable for devices like theMac mini. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Additionally, the monitor features a swivel bracket that allows tilt adjustments up to 165 degrees, along with integrated stereo speakers. However, it lacks both a built-in battery and touchscreen functionality, requiring constant power and offering no touch input. It is also bulkier and heavier than most portable monitors, weighing 5.5 pounds and measuring 2 x 18 x 16 inches. OnAmazon, the K18 Pro has received a single customer rating of just 1.0 out of 5, which raises concerns about potential issues with build quality and software stability, so buyer beware. For budget-conscious buyers, the Kinhank K18G Pro offers entry-level display capabilities, retailing for $329.03 onAliExpressand $429.99 onAmazon.

We will go all the way, even if it is hard to bear the bitter taste of defeat,”he said in a video address on Monday.“We may have lost a battle, but we will certainly not lose the war.” The pro-EU president of neighboring Moldova, Maia Sandu, congratulated Dan.“Moldova and Romania stand together, supporting one another and working side by side for a peaceful, democratic, and European future for all our citizens,”she said. The two countries share deep historical and cultural ties, with around 30% of Moldova’s population holding dual Moldovan-Romanian citizenship. Simion’s party has claimed that Moldovan authorities and media outlets carried out an illegal campaign to mobilize support for Dan among voters living in Moldova. Chisinau has denied any interference in the election. The election rerun was ordered after Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the results of the November vote, in which independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu came first with 23%. The authorities cited“irregularities”in his campaign, along with intelligence reports alleging Russian interference – claims Moscow has denied. Simion condemned the annulment of the 2024 election results as a“coup d’état”and said that, if elected, he could appoint Georgescu as prime minister. During the first round on May 4, Simion received 41% of the vote, while Dan and former Senator Crin Antonescu each garnered around 20%.",

Around Friday, the supercells generated tornadoes concentrated over parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky, The New York Times reported on Sunday. As many as 26 tornadoes touched down, mostly affecting Kentucky and Indiana, the newspaper wrote, citing government forecasters. Parts of the US are still reeling from an even more severe tornado outbreak last month, which spawned 107 of the violent storms.",

    "title": "France denies claims of Romanian election interference",
    "article_text": "The French Foreign Ministry has vehemently denied undertaking any attempts to interfere in Romania's presidential election after Telegram founder Pavel Durov claimed that he was asked to silence Romanian conservative voices on the platform ahead of Sunday's runoff. The second round of voting in Romania is being contested by pro-EU centrist Nicusor and Eurosceptic George Simion, who have been running neck and neck in a tight race. Durov stated in a post on Telegram on the day of the vote that a“Western European government”approached his company with a request to block conservatives in Romania ahead of elections. The tech entrepreneur did not explicitly name the nation behind the request but posted an emoji of a baguette in a thinly veiled reference to France. Hours later, the French Foreign Ministry responded with a lengthy statement on X calling“the recent accusations against France”completely“unfounded.” “France categorically rejects these allegations,”the ministry said, maintaining that such claims were“merely a diversionary maneuver from the real threats of interference targeting Romania.” Durov then promptly hit back by stating that he was personally approached over the issue by the head of France's foreign intelligence agency, Nicolas Lerner, at a Paris hotel this spring. In its statement, the French ministry also tried to point finger at Moscow, saying that the first round of the Romanian presidential election initially held in December 2024 was annulled“by the competent Romanian authorities”following what it called“very real”interference from actors linked to Russia. The ministry was referring to a decision by Romania’s Constitutional Court to overturn the first round result after it was won by independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu, who secured 23% of the vote. The court cited electoral irregularities and suspected Russian“hybrid”influence. Moscow has denied any involvement. Georgescu was later barred from running again by the Central Electoral Bureau, which cited his alleged“anti-democratic”and“extremist”positions and procedural violations. Simion publicly supported Georgescu and also accused France of“putting a lot of money and pressure”into subverting the vote in Romania.",

    "title": "Made in America? Why Trump’s new jet has ‘Russian roots’ and a Qatari tail",
    "article_text": "One of the more intriguing international stories in recent weeks was the report that Donald Trump, now back in the White House, is set to fly aboard a lavish Boeing 747-8 once owned by the Qatari royal family. While some media dismiss it as just another Trump indulgence, the real story is more revealing – and more political – than it first appears. Western media only caught on in early May, but Trump’s interest in the aircraft surfaced months earlier. In February, he personally inspected a Boeing 747-8 with the temporary registration number P4-HBJ at Palm Beach Airport. The jet, originally delivered in 2012, had been used exclusively by Qatar Amiri Flight – a VIP state aviation unit, comparable to Russia’s Rossiya.It carried members of the Qatari royal family and top officials and bore the livery of Qatar Airways, a symbol of Doha’s soft power. Along with three similar aircraft, this plane spent a decade shuttling royals around the globe. In 2023, it was transferred to the business jet operator Global Jet Isle of Man. However, ownership likely remained with Qatar. For some time now, the aircraft has been parked in the United States, quietly awaiting a buyer. Trump apparently saw it and liked what he saw. Amid questions over whether the former president can accept such a gift from a foreign power, the aircraft was quietly moved in April to San Antonio, Texas – home of L3 Harris Technologies, a US defense contractor specializing in communications systems. According to limited but credible information, the company has been tasked with upgrading the aircraft’s communications suite, possibly transforming it into a functional backup for presidential travel. The timeline is tight, aiming for year’s end, but phased upgrades could allow partial use much sooner. Talk of a $400 million“gift”is misleading. That figure reflects the catalog price of a brand-new 747-8 – not a lightly used 2012 model. Still, its custom interior surely cost a fortune. And the US side will need to invest heavily in retrofitting it with secure communications and defense equipment. After Trump’s term, the plane may be displayed in his future presidential library – a museum, more accurately – or retained by the US Air Force. Operating it as a civilian aircraft would be difficult due to the embedded defense systems. In the Middle East, gifting prestige aircraft is nothing new. Offering a prized horse from one’s stable is a traditional gesture of respect. The Qatari royals simply do so on a grander scale. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan received a similar 747-8 from Doha – a move that drew criticism during an economic downturn. But Erdogan claimed that the Qatari Emir refused any payment out of friendship. Less luxurious aircraft have also been given to other allies. In Trump’s case, the motivation was simple: he liked the plane, and Qatar saw a chance to curry favor. But how did the US reach a point where its president needs a hand-me-down from the Gulf to get airborne? The answer lies in the long-running and deeply flawed Air Force One replacement program. The two current VC-25As have been in service since 1990. While still operational, they’re aging, maintenance-intensive, and increasingly unreliable. If one is grounded for repairs – as often happens – the president’s travel plans are at risk. A replacement program was launched years ago. In 2016, Boeing, the only bidder, won the contract to produce the VC-25B, based on the now-discontinued 747-8 platform. In a twist of irony, the two airframes selected were originally built for Russia’s bankrupt Transaero Airlines. So the next Air Force One, whenever it arrives, will have Russian origins. Upgrades only began in 2020. Trump took an unusual interest in the project, proposing a new red-white-and-blue livery to replace Jackie Kennedy’s pastel blue. A model of the updated plane even sat in his office. Predictably, Biden canceled the paint scheme – but with Trump’s return, the design and model are back. Thanks to pandemic disruptions, overregulation, and Boeing’s much-discussed internal dysfunction, the program has faced chronic delays. Trump has now been told he won’t be able to use the new VC-25B during his second term. Optimistic projections place delivery in 2029; more realistic ones, sometime in the 2030s. Trump wasn’t willing to wait – nor should he have to. Boeing is losing money on the fixed-cost contract and would love to be rid of it, but cancellation would bring massive penalties. The Air Force isn’t scrapping it either – there are no four-engine presidential aircraft in production anywhere in the West. Switching contractors midstream would delay things further. Even the 747-8 selected for the future E-4C airborne command center had to be sourced secondhand – from a South Korean airline, no less. Boeing wasn’t even included in that redesign program. Instead, Sierra Nevada Corporation is handling it. Trump’s decision to take the Qatari plane was not vanity, but pragmatism. Faced with creaking aircraft and no domestic solution in sight, he found an available platform – and took it. That’s not scandalous. It’s resourceful. It is a striking moment when the president of the United States must rely on a Middle Eastern ally for the nation’s most symbolic aircraft. But this is where decades of decline at Boeing and dysfunction in the US procurement system have led. Trump didn’t cause the problem. He just solved it in the most Trumpian way possible.

    "article_text": "A new world record set by Russian ultramarathon runner Ivan Zaborsky will not be recognized by the International Association of Ultrarunners (IAU), the Monaco-based organization has stated. The 37-year-old runner was the only participant to cover more than 1,000km in the notoriously grueling ‘6 Days of France’ endurance race that ended on May 4. His closest competitor, Frank Gielen from Belgium, covered only about 900km, according to IAU data. On Wednesday, ten days after the race, the IAU said it would not acknowledge Zaborsky’s record because of his nationality.“Any performances by Russian or Belarusian athletes running under the national flag will not be recognized and will not be included in the IAU records listing,”it stated, pointing to the“the provisional suspension imposed by World Athletics”as part of the sanctions slapped on Moscow over its military campaign against the Kiev regime. The IAU also advised any ultramarathon event organizers against allowing any Russian or Belarusian athletes to participate by saying that they are not“permitted to compete in any official IAU major event”and maintaining that only those recognized as“neutral”should be allowed to join. Zaborsky crossed the finish line carrying the Russian flag. Despite the statement, the Russian was still listed as the winner of the ‘6 Days of France’ on the IAU website as of May 18. Zaborsky himself told the news outlet Sport Express that the issue revolves around him carrying“the Russian flag at the finish [line].” According to Zaborsky, the IAU’s decision might not actually significantly impact the outcome of the race, as it was organized by a different ultrarunning association – the US-based Global Organization of Multi-Day Ultramarathoners (GOMU).“I have not seen any statements from them,”he said. As of Sunday, the GOMU has not commented on the issue and has not included Zaborsky’s result in any of its listings of records.",

    "title": "Israel begins major ground offensive in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Israel launched a large-scale ground campaign in Gaza on Sunday following a wave of overnight airstrikes that killed more than 100 people, according to local health officials. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had begun“extensive ground operations”across both the northern and southern parts of the enclave, even as negotiations over a possible ceasefire and hostage release continue in Qatar. In a statement on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the negotiation team in Doha is“working to exhaust every possibility for a deal,”but emphasized that any potential agreement must include the release of all hostages, the expulsion of Hamas members from Gaza, and the full disarmament of the territory. Since the collapse of a two-month ceasefire in March, mediation efforts by Qatar, Egypt, and the US have failed to achieve a breakthrough. Netanyahu has insisted that the war will not end without Hamas’ complete defeat, while the militant organization has rejected any conditions requiring disarmament. The IDF reported that over the past week the Israeli Air Force struck more than 670 Hamas targets. According to hospitals and medical sources in Gaza, more than 100 people were killed in the airstrikes overnight and into Sunday, bringing the week’s death toll to over 400, The Times of Israel reported. Israel blames the civilian casualties on Hamas, citing the group’s use of densely populated areas for military operations. Medical officials in Gaza say hospitals are struggling to cope with the rising number of wounded.“Hospitals are overwhelmed by the growing number of casualties – many of them children – and are facing severe shortages of medical supplies,”according to Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson Khalil al-Deqran. The latest IDF operations have also forced the closure of the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, leaving the area without functioning medical facilities. Gaza’s Health Ministry has reported that more than 3,000 people have been killed since March. Israeli officials say the operation, dubbed Gideon’s Chariots, aims to seize and hold strategic areas of Gaza, dismantle Hamas’ military and governing networks, and prevent the group from intercepting humanitarian aid. The plan also includes relocating civilians from northern to southern Gaza to separate them from conflict zones and Hamas infrastructure. Since the breakdown of the ceasefire, Israel has halted all humanitarian aid – including food, fuel, and medical supplies – to pressure Hamas. Speaking at an Arab League summit in Baghdad on Saturday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was“alarmed”by the escalating violence and called for an immediate and lasting ceasefire. UN agencies warn of severe shortages of essentials across the territory. The current escalation began in October 2023, when Hamas launched a surprise cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and abducting around 250. An estimated 58 hostages remain in Gaza.",

    "article_text": "Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan has taken the lead over his opponent, George Simion, in the Romanian presidential election, according to exit polls released on Sunday evening. Both candidates have declared victory, despite the official results not yet being announced. The outcome may hinge on the diaspora vote, which remains uncounted. Dan garnered slightly over 54% of the vote, data published by the Avangarde and CURS show. Another pollster, INSCOP, put his result at 52%. Simion was gaining between 45% and 48% according to the three exit polls. Data published by a fourth pollster, Sociopol, suggested that the candidates were neck-and-neck. Exit poll results are based on questionnaires completed by voters immediately after casting their ballots. According to local media, these polls do not account for votes cast by the diaspora abroad, which could significantly influence the final outcome. Voter turnout for the runoff on Sunday was significantly higher than in the first round held on May 4, according to the Romanian electoral authority. Around 53% of eligible voters – 9.5 million people – cast ballots in the first round. In the runoff, these figures rose to nearly 65% and 11.6 million, respectively. Over 1.6 million Romanians abroad voted, according to electoral authority data, amounting to roughly 13% of all votes cast. Just after the exit poll results were announced, Dan stated that“a community of Romanians, who want… a society of dialogue, not a message of hate, won.”Meanwhile, Simion claimed on X he was“the New President of Romania.” A staunch critic of the EU and opponent of military aid to Kiev, Simion won the first round on May 4 decisively, securing 40% of the vote. His success in the first round triggered a collapse of the pro-Western coalition government in Bucharest. Speaking at a rally earlier this week, Simion vowed to oppose “centralization” imposed by Brussels and prevent Romania from becoming an EU “province.” He also praised US President Donald Trump and said he would seek closer bilateral ties with Washington if he won the presidency. Dan is known for holding strong pro-EU and pro-NATO views and has called Romania’s support for Kiev vital for its national security. He campaigned on a promise to combat corruption and to keep the nation firmly within the course set by Brussels.",

The FBI has classified the incident as an intentional act of terrorism. The blast occurred around 11 a.m. local time outside the American Reproductive Centers clinic, which offers various fertility services, including in vitro fertilization and egg freezing. The explosion damaged the single-story facility and nearby buildings. Debris was scattered across a 250-yard (228m) radius, with windows shattered up to five blocks away, according to the Los Angeles Times. Palm Springs officials said the explosion appeared to originate from a vehicle parked outside the clinic. Photos and videos from the scene showed severe structural damage, including a collapsed roof and shattered facade. A burned-out vehicle was visible behind the clinic, and the force of the blast was reportedly felt more than two miles away.

The clinic was closed for the weekend, and no patients were present at the time of the explosion. Dr. Maher Abdallah, its head, told CBS News he had received a call informing him that a powerful blast had destroyed“a couple of our buildings.” Abdallah confirmed that all staff members were unharmed and the IVF lab remained intact.

The deceased suspect was later identified as 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus,accordingto the FBI. Officials say Bartkus left behind writings and recordings in which he described himself as a“pro-mortalist.” In one text, he defined the term as someone who seeks to end their own life to avoid future suffering and, more significantly, to prevent the harm their existence may cause to other sentient beings. Palm Springs Police Chief Andy Mills stated the attack appeared to be isolated and that there was no ongoing threat to the community.

    "article_text": "The French government sought to make Telegram block conservative voices in Romania ahead of the country’s presidential runoff, the messenger’s founder, Pavel Durov, claimed on Sunday, as Romanians head to the polls. Durov did not actually name the country responsible for the request directly but posted an emoji of a baguette, a thinly veiled reference to France. Durov, who holds the citizenship of Russia, France, the UAE, and St. Kitts and Nevis, stated that he refused the request. “Telegram will not restrict the freedoms of Romanian users or block their political channels,”he said in a post, adding that one“can’t ‘defend democracy’ by destroying democracy.” You can’t ‘fight election interference’ by interfering with elections. You either have freedom of speech and fair elections – or you don’t. The French Foreign Ministry promptly hit back by declaring Durov’s statement a“fake.”“The recent accusations against France are merely a diversionary maneuver from the real threats of interference targeting Romania,”it claimed in a lengthy statement on X. Romanian authorities have not commented on Durov’s statements. The presidential runoff held on Sunday pits fierce EU critic George Simion against the mayor of Bucharest and centrist Nicusor Dan. Simion, who opposes military aid to Kiev and has been barred from visiting Ukraine, decisively swept the first round, securing 40% of the vote on May 4. This triggered a collapse of the pro-Western coalition government in Bucharest. Dan is known as a staunchly pro-EU and pro-NATO candidate, who has called Romania’s support for Kiev vital for national security. Simion has previously accused Paris of attempts to subvert the elections.“They are putting a lot of money and pressure – through their ambassador here, and through foreign institutions – in order to rob the Romanian people of their vote,”he told entrepreneur and blogger Mario Nawfal on Friday. France has emerged as one of the fiercest and most hawkish supporters of Kiev over the past months as the US under President Donald Trump has moved toward supporting the peace process between Moscow and Kiev. Last year, the French authorities charged Durov with facilitating the distribution of child sexual exploitation material and drug trafficking due to alleged moderation failures on Telegram. He was arrested at Paris-Le Bourget Airport in August before being released on €5 million ($5.46 million) bail. Durov, who has denied any wrongdoing, was eventually allowed to leave France in March.",

    "article_text": "Türkiye is ready to continue mediating between Russia and Ukraine to help end the conflict, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said, hailing the recent talks in Istanbul. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Erdogan described the recent round of Russia-Ukraine talks – the first direct engagement between the two sides since 2022 – as critical to settling the conflict. “Bringing the delegations of the two countries together in Istanbul is extremely important for the end of the war that started on February 24, 2022, and for the establishment of peace in the region,”he said, as quoted by TRT Haber. The Turkish president said his country is“not just saying ‘let the war end,’ we are also proposing methods, preparing the ground and making calls for this.” “Our greatest desire is to obtain a definitive result from the peace talks. Therefore, we are determined to continue our mediation role for the end of this war. We will make every effort to keep the channels of dialogue open and the negotiations to continue between the parties,”he added, stressing that the conflict cannot be resolved militarily. During the two-hour Istanbul meeting, Russia and Ukraine agreed to carry out a large-scale prisoner swap and exchange the preliminary terms for a potential ceasefire and discuss a follow-up round of talks. Türkiye has been a key mediator between Moscow and Kiev since 2022. That year, it hosted peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, which failed to bring about a breakthrough – after what Moscow claims was intervention by former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who reportedly advised Kiev not to accept a deal and keep on fighting. Ankara has also been a regular intermediary in prisoner exchanges between the two belligerents. Russia has said it is open to dialogue and ready to consider a ceasefire with Ukraine, although it has expressed concerns that Kiev could use the pause to restore its battered military and receive more weapons shipments from the West.",

    "article_text": "Portugal plans to ask the European Commission to pressure France over limited electricity supplies from the latter, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing Energy Minister Maria da Graca Carvalho. The move follows the April 28 blackout that left millions across Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France without electricity for up to ten hours. Portugal is reportedly blaming Paris for failing to complete and expand critical electricity interconnections with Spain – shortcomings that Lisbon argues exacerbated the blackout by restricting cross-border energy support. The power outage has been described as the largest in recent European history. Carvalho claims that Brussels has the authority to arbitrate the matter under EU law, noting that the weak interconnections between France and Spain continue to hamper the bloc’s internal energy market. “We will involve the president of the EC on this to make sure that we are all integrated,”she said, expressing hope for a resolution.“This is a European question, it’s not a question between the three countries.” She urged the Commission to step in if the internal market is being compromised, emphasizing its power to pressure France into accelerating work on infrastructure. The Iberian Peninsula has some of the lowest energy connectivity levels in the EU, the FT noted. Power links between France and Spain were automatically disconnected to safeguard the wider European grid after Spain’s system began to fail. Earlier this week, Spanish Minister for Ecological Transition Sara Aagesen said an initial investigation had revealed that the chain reaction of grid disconnections were triggered by power generation failures in the provinces of Granada, Badajoz, and Seville. A preliminary technical assessment by Entso-E, the European association of transmission system operators, reported that 2.2 gigawatts of capacity went offline in southern Spain less than a minute before the full system collapse. The root causes of the substation failures remain under investigation.",

    "article_text": "The Polish presidential election is underway in what will likely be a tight contest pitting critics of the EU against those supporting deeper integration. A runoff will be held on June 1 if no candidate secures a majority in Sunday’s first round. Around 29 million eligible voters will be choosing the successor to President Andrzej Duda from a field of 13 candidates. According to the latest opinion polls, three contenders have emerged as frontrunners. Emerging as the frontrunner is Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, who is aligned with Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s Civic Coalition. A pro-European candidate and advocate of judicial reform, Trzaskowski narrowly lost the last presidential election to Duda five years ago. He is seen as the most pro-Ukrainian contender, though he has pledged to cut some social benefits to Ukrainian nationals. Karol Nawrocki, backed by the Law and Justice party and running on a conservative platform, is polling second. He strongly opposes what he calls left-wing ideologies and has criticized EU migration and climate policies. Nawrocki rejects Ukraine’s accession to the EU and NATO and is against financial support for refugees, though he backs continued military aid to Kiev. Slawomir Mentzen, an economist from the right-leaning Confederation Liberty and Independence party, is currently polling in third place. Mentzen is prominent on social media, especially TikTok, where he has criticized EU regulations on car emissions and home heating, arguing they undermine Polish sovereignty. He has also condemned the government’s refugee policy, claiming it strains public resources. Public sentiment toward Ukrainian refugees has shifted significantly of late.

    "title": "Romania holds runoff vote in presidential election rerun",
    "article_text": "Romanian voters returned to the polls on Sunday, May 18 for the second round of a presidential election rerun following a court-annulled vote last year. The runoff is between George Simion, a critic of Brussels who has been banned from entering Ukraine, and Nicusor Dan, the pro-EU mayor of the capital, Bucharest. Around 19,000 polling stations have opened across Romania for the second round of the election. Voting began at 7am local time (4am GMT) and is scheduled to end at 9pm, with exit polls expected soon after. George Simion, the leader of the right-wing Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), came in first in the initial round earlier this month with 40.96% of the vote – nearly 20 percentage points ahead of Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, who came in second. Recent polls, however, show a tighter race, with one reporting a tie and another giving Dan a narrow lead. Dan, who is running as an independent, is a Sorbonne-educated mathematician who entered politics after years of activism. He has pledged to fight corruption, reduce economic inequality, and maintain strong ties with the EU and NATO. He also claims that Romania’s support for Ukraine is vital to national security. Simion opposes EU bureaucracy and Brussels-mandated policies, which he has described as part of a“greedy and corrupt bubble.”He supports what he calls a“Europe of sovereign nations”and has positioned himself as a defender of“traditional values,”in contrast to“globalist ideologies.”He has denied being anti-European, describing his alliance as“Eurorealist, not Euroskeptic,”according to Politico. Although Simion has insisted he is not pro-Russian, he opposes sending weapons to Ukraine and has called for a negotiated settlement to the conflict between Moscow and Kiev. He has also praised US President Donald Trump, calling him“a symbol of freedom,”and has said he would reverse what he describes as an“anti-American shift in Europe.” The election follows the annulment of the previous vote, in which independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu led in the first round with 23% of the vote. Romania’s Constitutional Court overturned the results, citing electoral irregularities and allegations of foreign interference, including campaign activity on TikTok and suspected Russian“hybrid”influence. Moscow has denied having any involvement. Georgescu was later barred from running again by the Central Electoral Bureau (BEC), which cited his alleged“anti-democratic”and“extremist”positions and procedural violations. The court upheld the BEC’s decision. Simion has publicly supported Georgescu, arriving with him at a polling station on Sunday. He previously said he might appoint him prime minister if elected. On the eve of the vote, Simion claimed that voter manipulation was taking place in Moldova, where many Romanian citizens are voting. He has also deactivated his TikTok and Facebook accounts, citing compliance with the election silence rules. After Simion’s strong showing in the first round, Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu resigned and announced the Social Democratic Party’s withdrawal from the ruling coalition, stating that the bloc no longer has political legitimacy. The PSD has said it will not support either candidate in the runoff.",

    "title": "US opposes ‘endless negotiations’ on Ukraine – Rubio",
    "article_text": "The US does not want negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to drag on indefinitely, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said, stressing that Washington expects concrete results. He made the remarks after Russia and Ukraine held their first direct talks in three years in Istanbul on Friday. The countries agreed to a prisoner swap involving 1,000 people on each side, and to continue contacts once both parties have prepared detailed ceasefire proposals. “On the one hand, we’re trying to achieve peace and end a very bloody, costly, and destructive war. So there’s some element of patience that is required,”Rubio said in an interview aired on CBS News’ ‘Face the Nation’ on Sunday. “On the other hand, we don’t have time to waste. There are a lot of other things happening in the world that we also need to be paying attention to. So we don’t want to be involved in this process of just endless talks. There has to be some progress, some movement forward,”he added. Rubio said the US would examine the ceasefire proposals from Russia and Ukraine.“If those papers have ideas on them that are realistic and rational, then I think we know we’ve made progress,”he said. The diplomat confirmed that the US is ready to impose further sanctions on Russia if no deal is reached. He expressed confidence that both chambers of Congress would pass Senator Lindsey Graham’s bill introducing 500% tariffs on imports from countries that purchase Russian oil, natural gas, and uranium. According to the White House, Rubio spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov by phone on Saturday, reiterating President Donald Trump’s call for an immediate ceasefire. Moscow has rejected demands for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, insisting that talks must address the“root causes”of the conflict, including Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO – which Russia considers a threat to national security. Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained that a lasting truce would require Ukraine to halt its mobilization drive, stop receiving weapons from abroad, and withdraw troops from Russian territory. He warned that Kiev would likely use a temporary ceasefire to rearm and regroup.",

    "title": "US easing sanctions on Turkish defense sector – Erdogan",
    "article_text": "The US is relaxing sanctions on Türkiye’s defense industry and has approved a major arms deal, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has announced. In 2020, Washington imposed restrictions on Ankara under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) in response to Türkiye’s purchase of Russian S-400 air defense missile systems. Ankara rejected calls to abandon the deal with Moscow, insisting on its sovereign right to choose its weapons suppliers. “We can safely say that CAATSA sanctions are being eased,”Erdogan told reporters on Saturday, after returning from the European Political Community summit in Albania. He added that he had spoken with the new American ambassador to Türkiye, Tom Barrack. “With my friend Trump taking office, we reached a more open, more constructive, more sincere communication,”he said. The easing of restrictions coincides with the US approval of a potential missile sale worth over $300 million – a move Erdogan described as a step toward removing remaining barriers between the two NATO allies.“As two major NATO allies, there should be no defense restrictions,”he said. During a phone call in March, Erdogan urged Trump to lift the sanctions, finalize a $23 billion deal for 40 F-16 fighter jets, and reinstate Türkiye in the F-35 fighter jet program. Ankara was removed from the project in 2019 over concerns that the Russian-made S-400 system could compromise the jet’s security. Trump is reportedly open to Türkiye’s return, provided the S-400 system is dismantled or relocated to a US-controlled base. Erdogan and Trump recently held another call, during which they discussed Syria, Gaza, and efforts to end the Ukraine conflict. Trump, who previously described his relationship with Erdogan as“excellent,”called the conversation“very good and productive.” Türkiye hosted the first direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations in three years on Friday in Istanbul, during which the two sides agreed to a prisoner swap.",

    "title": "Mexican Navy ship crashes into Brooklyn Bridge (VIDEOS)",
    "article_text": "Two sailors were killed and many others injured when a Mexican Navy training ship collided with the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night. The vessel lost power and drifted into the bridge during its departure from New York, according to officials. Videos from the scene show the ARM Cuauhtemoc’s three tall, illuminated masts crashing into the underside of the bridge’s road deck and toppling onto the ship. Multiple crew members were stationed on the masts at the time of the impact, the New York Post reported, citing fire officials and unnamed sources. The outlet also said rescuers were seen pulling people from the water. The ARM Cuauhtemoc was carrying 277 crew members when the incident occurred. New York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters that at least 19 people were injured, including four in critical condition. “The status of the personnel and material is under review by naval and local authorities, who are providing support,”the Mexican Navy said in a statement on X. According to the Latin Times, the crew may have miscalculated the height of the ship’s 171-foot masts in relation to the bridge’s 127-foot clearance at high tide. Despite the dramatic crash, officials have found no major structural damage to the bridge. Fabien Levy, a spokesman for Mayor Adams, said there appeared to be“no signs of structural damage.” In an absolutely stunning modern metaphor a ship blaring Mexican music and flying a massive Mexican flag just got destroyed by the Brooklyn bridge.

    "title": "Presidential frontrunner accuses EU candidate of vote rigging",
    "article_text": "Romanian presidential candidate George Simion has accused the pro-EU government in neighboring Moldova of attempting to rig Sunday’s runoff vote. The Euroskeptic leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) came in first in the initial round of the presidential election rerun on May 4, securing more than 40% of the vote. Around 30% of Moldova’s population are dual Moldovan-Romanian citizens. Simion’s supporters argue that early turnout among Romanians voting in Moldova is suspiciously high – nearly three times the level recorded during the same period in the first round. “Enough campaigning – now we have to stop the massive fraud! The government in Moldova has started stealing votes. We won’t let them!”Simion wrote on Facebook on Friday. The AUR claims that Moldova’s ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) has been directing voters to support Simion’s opponent, Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan.“By 1 p.m., over 50,000 votes had been cast by the diaspora – an increase of almost 70% compared to the first round. These figures are no coincidence,”the party wrote on its website. The AUR also accused Moldova’s Pro TV Chisinau of waging“an illegal and partisan campaign in favor of the establishment candidate”and of voter manipulation“under the guise of independent journalism.” Chisinau has denied having any interference in the election.“Out of respect for the voters, we urge all political actors to refrain from making accusations that only serve to undermine this democratic exercise,”government spokesman Daniel Voda said. He encouraged Romanian nationals living in Moldova to cast their ballots“without fear.” The election rerun was ordered after Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the results of the November vote, in which independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu came in first with 23%. The authorities cited“irregularities”in his campaign, along with intelligence reports alleging Russian interference – which Moscow has denied. Simion condemned the annulment of the 2024 election results as a“coup d’état.”He is currently banned from entering Moldova, which he has called“an artificial country”which“will never join the European Union.”",

The world is a weird and wonderful place full of weird and wonderful people, stories and things. And, thanks to some of the bestdocumentariesout there, we get a chance to grab a peek at them all. Documentaries come in all shapes and sizes, from bite-sized short films to multi-episode arcs full of twists and turns. Whether you're into pop cultural insights like Asif Kapadia'sAmyor Pamela Anderson's very ownPamela: A Love Story,or grisly true crime mysteries likeAmerican NightmareandThe Staircase,there's something for us all. It's true what they say: if anything interesting has ever happened, there's probably a film about it somewhere. Picking one to watch can be tricky and overwhelming. But across the likes ofNetflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime and more, here are just a few of the best documentaries and docuseries out there that we think are worth investing an hour or multiple nights in. If you want to skip to the best documentaries on your preferred streaming platform, hit the links here:Netflix,Amazon Prime,Disney + Sure, we're biased. As Gabriella Paiella wrote on this site not long ago: “Back in 2021,GQ’sDaniel Rileywent down to the Bahamas to trail the world champion freediver Alexey Molchanov. He spent time with Molchanov and a daring crew of freedivers from around the world, all of whom were united in their passion for a pursuit that Riley summed up as follows: “Go as deep as you can go on one breath and return to the surface without passing out or dying.” Sounds simple enough! But as Riley’s feature“The Secrets of The World’s Greatest Freediver”made clear, it’s far more complicated, and the results far more sublime—for Molchanov, especially, whose legacy is entwined with his mother Natalia's, once the greatest freediver in the world herself.” For anyone who read Riley’s story and wished they could actuallyseethe wonder of freediving in action, you’re in luck: Writer/director Michael John Warren'sFreediver, an epic documentary that follows Molchanov which follows as he attempts to reclaim all of his world records, is now available on Prime Video or tobuy or rent. Director Josh Greenbaum’sWill & Harperfollows Will Ferrell and his longtime friend and collaborator Harper Steele (the former head writer ofSaturday Night Live, who came out as trans in 2022) on a 16-day cross-country road trip, as they reconnect and see America through the eyes of a trans person. As we wrote on this site last year when it premiered at Sundance to rapturous applause: “At a time when trans rights continue to be under attack, this indelible and funny portrait of friendship doubles as an earnest, vulnerable, and open-hearted response, a crowd-pleasing tonic and a bipartisan bridge to empathy and understanding…It’s an icebreaker—for its subjects, and for everyone watching.” In 1985, the biggest names in music all gathered in one room with a single goal in mind—record a song to end hunger in Africa. Producer Harry Belafonte took inspo from Midge Ure and Bob Geldof's ambitious supergroup anthem “Do They Know It's Christmas?” to create “We Are the World” with a line-up that included Lionel Ritchie, Michael Jackson, Cyndi Lauper, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan among many, many others.The Greatest Night in Poptakes us behind the scenes of that ambitious idea (and no doubt scheduling nightmare!), with interviews from some of the stars who took part.You can watchThe Greatest Night in PoponNetflix. The Emmy and BAFTA-nominatedThree Identical Strangerstells of a group of identical triplets who, by chance, discover they are one of three siblings after being separated duringchildhood. Their stranger-than-fiction story becomes a media sensation, and the brothers make the most of their fortune. But as the truth behind their disparate upbringings comes to light, a wholesome tale of family reunions and happenstance descends into an unsettling account of injustice and exploitation happening behind closed doors.You can watchThree Identical StrangersonNetflix. After her public disgust at the story of her sex tape being made into a drama withPam & Tommy, Pamela Anderson uses this documentary to finally address her own life in her own words, from herBaywatchorigins to her tumultuous romances and, of course, the tape that upended everything and still follows her around to this day. It's a startling, empowering and personal look at misogyny and fame through the eyes of someone rebuilding themselves after years 30 years of being tabloid fodder.You can watchPamela: A Love StoryonNetflix. The Staircasetells atrue crime storyso gripping the machine had no choice but to make it into a wildly popular drama series of the same name starring Colin Firth and Toni Collette. The 13-part docuseries (yes, 13 episodes. It's a meaty case!) dives into the mysterious death of Kathleen Peterson and the subsequent murder trial of her husband Michael Peterson. After being found dead at the bottom of the stairs of their house, suspicion naturally falls on Michael, though he maintains his innocence throughout. The docuseries delves into the trial, from the twists and turns deep in the Petersons' marriage, the bizarre but weirdly compelling alternative version of events around the tragic death which involves an owl and the revelation that Kathleen wasn't the only person in Michael's life to meet their end at the bottom of a staircase.You can watchThe StaircaseonNetflix. If you're in any doubt as to why trans representation is so important, then watchDisclosureimmediately. Featuring interviews with the likes of Laverne Cox and Jen Richards, this documentary dives deep into the history of transgender people in film and TV, revealing the disturbing stereotypes that the industry continues to perpetuate to this day. But it's not all negative.Disclosurealso does a brilliant job of highlighting the trailblazers who have paved the way for others, as well as the influence that the trans community has had on every aspect of our culture.

The world of competitive Rubik's Cube solving doesn't sound like it should make you cry and fill you with warmth, but Netflix'sThe Speed Cubersshows the beating heart within a community of niche interest lovers. Focusing on the lives of two speedcubing champions Max Park and Feliks Zemdegs, the documentary shows that beyond, quite frankly, superhuman levels of skill and competition (literally seven seconds to solve a whole cube), the power of strong and supportive friendships reign supreme.You can watchThe Speed CubersonNetflix. The team behindThe Tinder Swindler(which is also worth checking out on Netflix!) returned in 2024 withAmerican Nightmare, a look into what was, at first, dubbed the ‘real-lifeGone Girl’ case. In 2015, couple Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn were awoken in the middle of the night by a masked figure (or possibly more than one). After that, Huskins was kidnapped for ransom before being released 48 hours later. This three-part Netflix series is essentially the story of what actually happened. More than just a retelling of Wikipedia, the doc includes plenty of new interviews and interrogation footage, all the while unpacking the consequences of a cultural voraciousness of true crime and our desire for a villain.You can watchAmerican NightmareonNetflix. One of the most infamous music festivals in history,Woodstock '99attempted to recreate the hippie magic of its 1969 edition and instead unleashed a logistical bloodbath.

Compiled in part from 800 hours of home-video footage the mercurial acting legend Val Kilmer shot over the course of his life, producer/directors Leo Scott and Ting Poo'sValwas already a revelatory portrait of an A-list actor turned Hollywood eccentric when it premiered in 2021, charting Kilmer's F-14-speed rise to fame and the “difficult actor” era that followed, along with the personal tragedies that haunted him and the battle with throat cancer that all but robbed him of his voice. In the wake of Kilmer's death in 2025—of pneumonia, at 65—it stands alongsideTop Gun: Maverickas Kilmer's last testament, the final work of an actor/auteur so fiercely individualistic he even wrote his own epitaph. When a young pop culture icon dies before their time, their memory is often reduced to spectacle or serves only as a cautionary tale.

After the guns and the girls, probably the most enduring element ofJames Bondis its sound. From its epic score to the theme tunes that garner almost as much press as the films themselves, this documentary by Matt Whitecross takes you behind the scenes of what makes a definitive Bond sound.

True crimehas become such an endemic form of entertainment that it's hard to imagine a time when the secret lives of friends and neighbors could still genuinely shock us.

Once the highest-grossing documentary of all time (usurped only by the posthumousMichael Jacksonconcert docMichael Jackson's This Is It), it's not hyperbole to sayMichael Moore'sFahrenheit 9/11made documentaries bankable. As the title suggests, the film exploresGeorge W. Bush's presidency through a liberal and critical view. Taking aim specifically at the administration's decision to go to war with Iraq, Moore posits a now-widely-held but at-the-time shockingly controversial opinion that corporate mass media acted as a shill for an illegal war. The film took the Palme d'Or in 2004, one of the few documentaries to ever even be selected for competition.You can watchFahrenheit 9/11onAmazon. It does not feel hyperbolic to sayThe Act Of Killingis the kind of documentary that will truly never happen ever, ever again. Joshua Oppenheimer’s film follows the perpetrators of a genocide in Indonesia in the mid-1960s, which has led to a political situation in which gangsters who slaughtered civilians are darlings of the country’s right wing. Oppenheimer invites these perpetrators to reimagine their killings in the style of cinematic genres, an absurd premise that leads to horrifying reckonings for men who have never faced true punishment for their sins.

This concert film, which captures Talking Heads’ stint at the Pantages Theatre in December 1983, is probably thegreatest concert filmever made.

The tragedy of Rock Hudson still remains largely unspoken. His death from AIDS early on in the crisis landed at a time when Hollywood and the general public didn't want to grapple with the reality of a gay movie star. But now, withRock Hudson: All That Heaven Allowed, we get to take a closer look at the screen icon through archival footage and personal testimony.

If it's a cheat to include a documentary series here, so be it—if you're one of the untold millions who've thrilled to theStar Warssaga fromA New HopetoAndor, or any of the countless special-effects-driven films that followed in the wake of George Lucas' genre-redefining saga, this doc about the pioneering special-effects house Industrial Light and Magic is essential viewing. And even if you're not aStar Warshead, the series is still a warm and engaging celebration of human creativity, and an era when a bunch of shaggy Bay Area hippies got together and reinvented cinema by building spaceships out of Styrofoam and old kit-model parts. The first season, directed byStar Warslegend Lawrence Kasdan, ends with Steven Spielberg'sJurassic Parkand the dawn of the CGI era; the newly-released Season Two, directed byCaptain America: The First Avenger's Joe Johnston, picks up where the original left off, as George Lucas returns to ILM to make theStar Warsprequels and reinvent the wheel yet again.You can watchLight and MagiconDisney+.

John le Carré, who died in 2020, was one of the most influential genre-fiction writers of the 20th century, and sold more than 60 million copies of his twenty novels—an oeuvre that includes classics likeThe Spy Who Came in From the Cold,Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, andThe Constant Gardner. His work has been adapted multiple times for the big and small screen—the latest incarnation, set to starSuccession's Matthew McFayden as le Carré's unassuming spymaster George Smiley, is now in the works—and has inspired countless other anti-Bond spy stories about the nitty-gritty of the espionage game, like the AppleTV+ hitSlow Horses.

    "article_text": "FormerUS presidentJoe Biden was diagnosed Friday with prostate cancer, his personal officeannounced Sunday, characterizing it as “a more aggressive form of the disease.” “Last week,President Joe Bidenwas seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms,” his office said in a statement. “On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by aGleason score of 9(Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone.” (Gleason scores grade the cancerous cells, with lower numbers representing more normal looking cells, according to the Cleveland Clinic; 10 is the highest grade.) The 82-year-old Biden's last publicly reported physical was on February 28, 2024, at which time Dr. Kevin O’Connor said “no new concerns” regarding Biden's health were discovered. During that exam at Walter Reed National Military Center, Biden was prescribed medications for seasonal allergies, acid reflux, atrial fibrillation, and cholesterol level management; his weight remained steady and all blood levels were within the normal range. Biden and his family\"are reviewing treatment options with his physicians,\" the statement continued. \"While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to behormone-sensitivewhich allows for effective management.\" He is currently at his family home in Wilmington, Delaware,CNN reports.

    "title": "Wes Anderson Takes On the Oligarchs in The Phoenician Scheme",
    "article_text": "In the cold open ofWes Anderson’s new film,The Phoenician Scheme, we see a man blown in half by a bomb. A streak of bright red blood spatters on the wall above the lower half of his body, still buckled into its airplane seat. There has been mild violence in Anderson films before, and the director has often been blunt and dispassionate while doling out the fates of characters. But this moment feels like an escalation.The Phoenician Scheme, which premiered here at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18, is trying for something more than diorama-box whimsy. The film’s closest relative in the Anderson curio cabinet is probablyThe Grand Budapest Hotel,a WWII-coded adventurethat gallivants across a mountainous fantasy Europe at the dawn of fascism in the 1930s.The Phoenician Schememoves the action up twenty years to the strange post-war days in which a world is being rebuilt, new threats loom, and shadowy actors scramble to wield as much influence—and make as much money—as they can. Benicio del Toroplays one of those ruthless opportunists: Anatole “Zsa-zsa” Korda, a wealthy wheeler-dealer of vague extraction who is constantly thwarting—or, at the very least, miraculously surviving—various assassination attempts. His plane is bombed; he’s shot; he narrowly avoids drinking poison. He’s hated the world over, and for good reason. Zsa-zsa is a builder of things, but he does so with a heavy hand, exploiting local workers (indeed, the word “slaves” is used frequently throughout the film) and unsettling the global political balance. He’s made enemies of other governments, of other sinister masters of the universe, and of his family. Zsa-zsa is in some senses a return to the lovably rakish allure of Royal Tenenbaum, the bad dad played with hustling zeal by the late Gene Hackman. Royal is perhaps Anderson’s single greatest creation, a figure both loathsome and pitifully endearing. Del Toro ably crafts his own version of that puzzling duality, albeit on a grander scale. Zsa-zsa has done terrible things, and plans to do more. Yet there is something charming about his heedlessness, a confidence that suggests he may actually know the secret machinery that governs all things. His motivations are complicated by the arrival of his daughter, Liesl (Mia Threapleton), a novitiate summoned from her convent to be named sole heir to her father’s fortune. She’s suspicious of her estranged father, but drawn to him too. There is also a concern for her nine brothers, a cadre of lost boys either born to Zsa-zsa or adopted in the hopes that they will one day develop some skill useful to their father. Zsa-zsa finds his sons untrustworthy, and so turns to his only daughter, counseling her in the ways of his business as he tries to rescue his fortune from the disastrous interference of an American intelligence agency. Thus begins the episodic ramble of the film. Zsa-zsa and Liesl hop around a fictional region that is styled as a mix of southern Europe and North Africa. As he did in his last film,the lovelyAsteroid City, Anderson makes fine use of desert vistas, all soothing austerity and whispering loneliness. As suggested at the start of the film, the film’s plucky, pensive mood is occasionally interrupted by bursts of violence that remind us of the high stakes of Zsa-zsa’s game of world domination. Despite all that supposed intrigue, the plot ofThe Phoenician Schemegoes awfully slack. As father and daughter call on various associates to plead for loans that will keep Zsa-zsa’s enterprise afloat—played by a host of big names likeTom Hanks,Scarlett Johansson,Bryan Cranston, andBenedict Cumberbatch—the film meanders into tedium. As he tends to do, Anderson alienates the viewer from his meticulously crafted but chilly creation. Del Toro and Threapleton give winsome performances, but they’re not enough to sustain our interest. The ornately articulated surreality of the film is its main detriment; with no significant tether to real life,The Phoenician Schemequickly floats away into frustrating abstraction. But Anderson rescues his film from oblivion in the end, closing out his story with a disarmingly sweet—and, in some ways, provocative—moral argument.The Phoenician Schemeis, in all its Andersonian obfuscation, about the tyranny of oligarchy and the hoarding of wealth, a call to sanity and compassion targetting the rich crazies currently making a mint and a mess out of our planet. Anderson’s longtime fascination with aristocracy, barbed but loving, prevents him from making any truly harsh pronouncements about their cruelties and excesses. ButThe Phoenician Schemedoes at least imagine a simpler way of being, one of harmless personal contentment. Anderson’s film leaves us on that humanist note, a moment of hush and harmony that stands in stark contrast to the film’s bloody beginning. It’s a poignant, if a bit trite, message, this veneration of a modest and decent life that our own weird zillionaires might actually enjoy if they stopped ripping out the wiring of democracy and building armies of offspring. But those people likely won’t see this film, which leaves the rest of us to yet again learn their lesson for them.

    "title": "FBI: Car Bombing Outside California Reproductive Health Care Clinic Was “Terrorism”",
    "article_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation labeled the Saturday bombing of a reproductive health care clinic in Palm Springs, California as an act of terrorism. The clinic, American Reproductive Centers, offered in vitro fertilization, egg freezing, surrogacy, LGBTQ+ family building, and other services. \"Make no mistake: This is an intentional act of terrorism,\"Akil Davis, the head of the FBI's Los Angeles field office,toldreporters during an evening conference. The fertility clinic bombing killed one person,saidto be the suspect Guy Edward Bartkus, and injured at least four more people. An internal Los Angeles Police Department briefing circulated Saturday afternoon andviewedbyThe Los Angeles Timesnoted that the FBI had confirmed the suspect was the sole fatality. The clinic’s doctor,Maher Abdallah, toldThe Washington Postthat all his employees were safe, adding that the “IVF lab is intact” and “embryos were not affected in any way.” “Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients,\" he said. The bombing caved in the building's roof, shattered windows in businesses that were blocks away, and sprayed debris across a five-lane road. The damaged front of the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic stands following a bomb blast on May 17, 2025 in Palm Springs, California. A 25-year-old man, Bartkus, who lived about an hour's drive from Palm Springs, used a car bomb in the attack, which greatly damaged the clinic. According to the LAPD briefing, two rifles—an AK-47 and an AR-platform rifle—and ammunition were found next to the exploded vehicle. Per CBS Newsreportingbased on sources familiar with the investigation, the suspect stated in writings or recordings that he was against bringing people into the world against their will. This finding is supported by NBC News’reportingthat the suspect held anti-natalist views—the ideology that no one should have children. The interim mayor of Palm Springs,Naomi Soto, said the clinic was “a place of hope” and “a building that people go to to start to expand their families.” The targeting of ARC, Soto said, is “a terrible tragedy.” California governorGavin Newsomposted on X that he had been briefed on the explosion, adding, “Jen and I are keeping everyone affected in our hearts. The state is working closely with local and federal authorities as the investigation unfolds.” The fertility clinic bombing comes as access to IVF hascome under threatfrom someRepublicansacross the country—and the attack could deepen concerns for people attempting to start their families through in vitro services. Following the Alabama Supreme Court ruling from February 2024, where the court held that frozen embryos would now be considered children under state law, Republicans—includingPresidentDonald Trump—have beenmaneuveringhow to balance their stringent anti-abortion rhetoric with thegrowingright-wing fetal personhood movement pushing against IVF. These activists purport that life begins at conception and claim that embryos that do not result in a pregnancy during the process of IVF are victims. According to an April 2024 Pew Research Centersurvey, only 8 percent of respondents held that IVF is a bad thing—with 70 percent saying that it’s a good thing and 22 percent responding that they weren’t sure. While IVF facilities and medical service providers have faced increasedattacksrecently, the kind of violence displayed on Saturday is more likely to occur at clinics that offer abortion services. Abortion-rights activists attempt to block the path of anti-abortion parishioners as they attempt to march from the Old Saint Patrick Catholic Church to a nearby Planned Parenthood abortion clinic, June 4, 2022 in New York City. In the soon-to-be three years since the United States Supreme Court overturnedRoe v. Wade—gutting access to reproductive health care for millions of Americans and spurring a crisis where women have died after being denied life-saving care—abortion providers have experienced sustained and consistent harassment, terror, and violence,accordingto the National Abortion Federation’s yearly “Violence & Disruption Report.” According to the report, from 2023 to 2024, clinics and individual providers were subject to 621 cases of trespassing, 777 obstructions, 296 death threats or threats of harm, 128,570 instances of picketing, 37 cases of stalking, 38 cases of assault and battery, 17 thefts, three arsons and three more attempted arsons, 30 hoax devices or suspicious packages, and 12 bomb threats. And, since the NAF has beentrackingviolence since 1977, there have been 11 murders, 200 arsons, 531 assaults, 492 clinic invasions, 375 burglaries, and 42 bombings.

    "title": "Alexander Skarsgård Is the Dom of One Sub’s Dreams in the Affecting Drama Pillion",
    "article_text": "Let’s just get the inevitable out of the way. The new filmPillion, which premiered here at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18, is in some ways similar tolast year’sBabygirl, a comedy-drama-romance about a dom-sub relationship.Pillion, from first-time feature directorHarry Lighton, examines the same sort of coupling, from timid beginning to full-body commitment. But in comportment, tone, and intention,Pillionis otherwise wholly different fromBabygirl. Rather than satiric provocation,Pillionis a disarmingly poignant drama of discovery. The film starsHarry Melling, moony eyed andFran Lebowitzcoiffed, as Colin, a young-ish man (maybe early 30s) living with his parents in an anonymous city in the United Kingdom. He sings with his father and brother in a barbershop quartet and spends social time at a local queer pub with a pal who might want something more. Colin is shy, and seems woefully uncertain of his place in the gay ecosystem. At the bar one Christmas Eve, he’s quite taken by the striking, self-possessed man he sees across the room. To Colin’s giddy surprise, the man—whom we later learn is a motorcycle enthusiast named Ray (Alexander Skarsgård)—approaches Colin and slips him a terse note, instructing Colin where and when to meet him the next evening. (So, on Christmas.) Thus begins an improbable sort of romance, or courtship, or contractual arrangement. It’s hard to define by typical standards, this thing that Colin and Ray create—though really, it’s mostly Ray’s invention. Colin simply does as he’s told, hungrily compliant to this looming adonis whose gruff, emotionless instruction is both turn-on and threat. Colin’s family, ailing mum (Lesley Sharp) and encouraging dad (Douglas Hodge), are happy that their lonely son is dating someone—we never detect any squeamishness about Colin’s sexuality—but they grow increasingly bemused as Colin cedes more and more of himself to this mysterious biker, changing his clothing and appearance and behavior. Watching this unfold, one braces for the cautionary tale to come. But Lighton graciously avoids moral judgment. Characters state their concerns; there is some degree of confusion and alarm. YetPillionis not a leering, foreboding look at a subculture. Too often, stories that delve into the margins of sex let an innate repulsion guide and color their fascination.Pilliontakes a more thoughtful and compassionate approach, without gauzing over the realities of Colin and Ray’s relationship. Pillionis a graphic film. It’s far from hardcore, but no doubt some viewers will still be titillated or put-off by the film’s depiction of gay sex and male anatomy, by the rough foreplay enjoyed between two consenting—if, perhaps, not equally matched—adults. That frankness is crucial to Lighton’s project; mere coy hinting at the central matter would do disservice to the sentiment of the film.Pillionis ultimately ambivalent about what this all means. Or, at least, it lets a potent question hang in the air: when does a willingly agreed-upon abnegation of autonomy become something less than consensual? Lighton’s answer to that question is, essentially, that there is no one answer. Colin’s specific story is one complicated by loss and love and a dawning understanding of himself and his desire. He learns and experiences both good and bad things; he loses aspects of himself and finds crucial others.Pillionis a coming-of-adulthood film that projects the universal through a particular lens. Lighton does not shy away from those particularities. He soberly delves into the mores and customs of Ray’s community of fellow travelers, leather daddies and their partners whose bonhomie would seem, initially, to belie the nature of their roleplay. What results from all this attention and care is a film that deftly balances squirmy comedy with gentle pathos, social suspense with offbeat warmth.Pilliongives little indication that Lighton is a first-time feature director. The film is confidently staged and handsomely styled, elegantly gliding through Colin and Ray’s adventure (or misadventure) with a keen eye for detail and texture. Melling, a long way from hisHarry Potterdays, beautifully renders Colin’s nerves and elation, both the giddy amazement and the real apprehension at a major life epoch’s sudden emergence. Skarsgård’s main directive is to be stern and withholding, but he and Lighton allow for a few breathtaking moments when Ray lets the facade drop and we glimpse the real man—maybe hurting, maybe scared too—behind the act. It’s tempting to read a certain self-loathing into one such moment—to see in it a suggestion that Ray’s hyper-masc, domineering persona is rooted in latent and self-destroying homophobia. There may be some truth to that. But yet again,Pillionpulls away from absolutism. This moment, brief and heartbreaking, instead catches two people in a vivid flash of connection that probably only they can truly understand. The beauty ofPillionis that those of us watching on the sidelines are not voyeurs, but rather witnesses to something powerfully complex and human.

    "title": "Is Jennifer Lawrence About to Win Another Oscar?",
    "article_text": "Update (May 18, 1.33pm EST):Well, that was fast.Deadline is reportingthat Mubi has acquired U.S. and other territory rights to theJennifer LawrencevehicleDie, My Lovein a whopping $23 million deal, cementing plans for an Oscar campaign to come. This is the studio that boughtThe Substanceout of Cannes just last year, before a brilliant push forDemi Mooreresulted in her first career Oscar nomination and a near-win. Sounds like a good match. The original post continues below. Jennifer Lawrence gives the kind of performance inDie, My Lovethat demands instant Oscar attention. The reviews, including by our ownRichard Lawson,will tell youas much, to say nothing of the ecstatic murmurs that echoed out of the Saturday pre-premiere screening that I attended. It’s a volcanic take on a new mother in crisis that never verges toward easy hysterics or melodrama, lacing a devastating character portrait with bracing humor and fearlessness. I heard more talk around potential acquisitions and campaigns for this film in the last 16 hours than I have for every other premiere thus far, combined. I also heard ecstatic instant reactions from sources at multiple studios. Such is the impact of star power when it delivers as hoped. On Sunday, following a strong reception out of the premiere, Lawrence joined co-starRobert Pattinson,directorLynne Ramsay,and more for the film’s official Cannes press conference. “As a mother, it was really hard to separate what I would do as opposed to what she would do,” Lawrence said of filmingDie, My Love. “I’ve wanted to work with Lynne Ramsay since I sawRatcatcherand…we took a chance and I just sent this to her.” Lawrence, who also produced the movie, then turned to her director: “I really cannot believe I am here with you, and that this happened.” This is still a Ramsay movie, and fans of the intense, committed auteur know how this story tends to go. Usually, her work gets a rousing reception on the Croisette, and maybe goes home with a prize or two, before facing a tougher road with the American film community. Nearly 15 years ago,Tilda Swintonseemed near-assured of an Oscar nom for her harrowing work inWe Need to Talk About Kevin, but despite BAFTA, SAG, and Golden Globe nods, the Academy’s distaste for the movie led to her snub. And Ramsay’s last movie,You Were Never Really Here, won both best screenplay and best actor (Joaquin Phoenix) at Cannes before barely making a dent in the year-end awards race. All told, no Ramsay feature has ever received an Oscar nomination. Die, My Lovemay well change that. Though again, this is a tough, elliptical movie that will not be for everyone. It isn’t more accessible than Ramsay’s previous work, exactly, but it packs a resonant, emotional punch. And alongside strong supporting turns from Pattinson andSissy Spacek,Lawrence arguably has never been better. It’s a striking return to the cinephile space for the Oscar winner, a reminder of what she can pull off alongside an ambitious, visionary filmmaker. This is easily her most significant dramatic role since 2017’sMother!,Darren Aronofsky’s polarizing psychological horror drama, and should result in her first Oscar nomination in a decade (going back toDavid O. Russell’s 2015Joy). Since her breakout inWinter’s Bone, Lawrence’s Oscar history has been entirely defined by her work with Russell (she won in 2013 forSilver Linings Playbook). Believe it or not, she has never starred in a Cannes main-competition title either, until now—so it feels fitting for this new phase of her acting career to unveil itself in such uncharted territory. It’s a fool’s errand to expect a small, idiosyncratic jury to follow up on that narrative and hand Lawrence the best-actress prize, setting her up for a fruitful fall run—but she’s easily the standout of the slate so far. Regardless, this is major work from a major star, and she’ll be playing the long game. It’s conceivable she could go all the way.

    "title": "Scarlett Johansson Gets Her Apology from Michael Che on ‘Saturday Night Live’ Season Finale",
    "article_text": "MayJames Austin Johnsonspend his summer alternating between sage cleanses and cold plunges—whatever he needs to rid himself ofDonald Trump's neck glue and the psychic cost of bringing our President to satirical life. His Trump lasted two-thirds of the cold open on stage, bragging about his new $400 million Qatar plane and his big Boeing deal with the Saudis. “Get me to Allah's country,” he said, land of oil and money and people forbidden from hating him. And then, without warning, Johnson's Trump gave up on the sketch, breaking the fourth wall to sit in the audience. “See you again in the fall,\" he said, \"if we still have a country.\" Scarlett Johanssonwas our final host of the season, and she had her eyes on retribution for theindignitiesrained down upon her byMichael Cheon her last visit. But first, she delivered a sunny monologue in which she showed off her pipes to the tune ofBilly Joel's “Piano Man.”Bowen Yangjoined her for the second verse, followed by the entire cast—minus the Weekend Update hosts, who in a perfect world she'd have duct-taped together in Staten Island ferry boat as punishment for their middle school-esque shenanigans. “It lasted forever,” Johansson and crew sang of the 50th season, “we did it together, and we got to do it with you.” Cheers to the cast, whose adrenal glands must be blasted after the very high high of the grand anniversary celebration and the subterranean low of putting on a comedy show after the 2025 election results. Mike Myersmade his mark onSNL50. HisElon Muskwas one of the true highlights of the season—though perhaps the conceit of his elevator reunion withKenan Thompson'sKanye Westwas better than the sketch itself. Still, it allowed for a claustrophobic pairing of Myers with the man who made him turn an even whiter shade of pale 20 years ago during that Hurricane Katrina telethon. “You just had to stand there looking stupid,” Thompson'sYereminded him. “So what are you up to now?” asked Myers. “Oh, me? I'm in the KKK now.” Myers looked almost as awkward and uncomfortable as he did back then, desperate not to be captured in a selfie or remain trapped in the elevator when Ye's nitrous oxide hit. Yang playing a bruh will never get old. His push-ups. His leering. His neck being smothered byGina Gershon's lips. His pizza boxes and leather couches and “tendies” in the air fryer of his dirtbag apartment. “He just dials up the gay for clout,”Heidi Gardnerassured a crushing Johansson. (I did love Gardner andEgo Nwodimwrongly guessing that her crush was onMichael Longfellowor, as they called him, “creepy creepy Longfellow.”) “Scarlett, Scarlett, myJurassicharlot,” Yang purred to Johansson, before Yang-banging her in the control room. Punching a hole in the wall before sneering “thanks for inventing AI, by the way” was top-shelf chode. Bad Bunny, the most charismatic man alive, was this week’s musical guest. Finally, it was time forColin JostandMichael Cheto indulge in their beloved joke swap, in which the boys give each other jokes to read without any pre-warning. Che tries to get Jost to say the N-word (that dumbNick Kerrbit got him just about there), and tonight kept his foot on Jost's neck about him fiending forLorne Michaels’s job. Jost feeds Che lines about what a creep he is with women, and tonight made him read an apology to his wife for daring to compare her to CostCo roast beef on their last joke swap. Che tried to sound contrite reading his script: “The fact is, I'm jealous, because I've never even seen a human vagina, and notice I said human, because I once spent the summer on a farm…” Keep your jokes, fellas. And leave us withEgo Nwodim'sMiss Eggy, back with another beef with food. This time her stink was with the airplane industry. “Can't even have a whole can of soda, stingy ass,” she said, strutting back and forth in front of Jost and Che where she belongs. “Wanna hand me a dried-ass piece of Biscott? More like you about to piss a bis’ off.” When Jost tried to keep her on track, Nwodim silenced him. “Colin, please. I'm eating,” she insisted. Now this is 50.

    "article_text": "World Vision Hong Kong also calls for more education for parents after finding most did not know proper intake levels of vegetables, grains and fruit Up to 80 per cent of children from low-income families living in Hong Kong’s subdivided flats are suffering from various degrees of insufficient nutrition intake, a study has estimated, with researchers urging authorities to step up education over proper diets. The study covered 589 children aged two to 11 from 520 families and their carers, who took part in questionnaires and phone interviews between June 2024 and January of this year. World Vision Hong Kong, a humanitarian organisation, said on Sunday its research showed 86.4 per cent of the children were not getting enough dairy and 76.2 per cent were not meeting the recommended intake level of vegetables. According to the data, 69.8 per cent of the children were not eating enough fruits, 61.1 per cent needed to consume more meat and 49.1 per cent had inadequate grain intake levels. Bonnie Leung Wing-yan, a dietitian from the Hong Kong Community Dietitian Association who collaborated with the charity for the study, said parents of the respondents also had limited understanding of the recommended amounts of key foods their children should be eating. “We found that most of the children had inadequate nutrition intake, which is a relatively serious situation,” she said.",

    "title": "Why alternative diets like fasting, low carbs, don’t work: Hong Kong nutritionists",
    "article_text": "Survey by Hong Kong Nutrition Association finds 40 per cent of respondents have tried intermittent fasting and other methods of dieting The effectiveness of intermittent fasting, low-carbohydrate meals and other alternative diets to lose weight is not backed by enough scientific evidence and such efforts could backfire, Hong Kong nutritionists have warned, after conducting a survey that showed 40 per cent of respondents had tried the methods. The Hong Kong Nutrition Association on Sunday revealed the findings of the survey it conducted between March and the beginning of May, in which 364 respondents, or about 40 per cent of the 916 in total, had tried at least one of a variety of dieting methods. It added the residents polled had obtained dietary information from possibly unreliable sources. Over half had turned to unverified information on social media, and more than four in 10 had gone to friends and family for guidance. Among respondents who went on diets, 51 per cent had tried intermittent fasting, which involves eating once in eight hours and fasting for the remaining 16 hours, while 43 per cent had gone on diets with a low level of carbohydrates. Weight control and improving health were the key reasons for going on diets, as indicated by 76 per cent and 56 per cent of respondents, respectively. But the association said the effectiveness of such diets was not backed by sufficient scientific research and they could lead to adverse health effects. “Refraining from consuming carbohydrates can slow down metabolism rate, worsen memory, [cause] low energy, low blood sugar and low spirit,” said Leona Leung Yuen-ling, the association’s vice-president.",

    "title": "Dell Technologies World 2025 — all the day one news and updates live",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Hello and welcome to our live coverage ofDellTechnologies World 2025. Day one of the event kicked off this morning with a keynote hosted by company founder and CEO Michael Dell, who was in bullish mood talking about its AI goals. We're here for the rest of the day, so stay tuned for more updates below as they happen.... The final question is about local and regional energy production, and how this might affect building or planning new data centers. Holmes notes once again that partnerships are essential - and providing the balance between the energy available, and the capacity on offer, might be the main point. With that, it's a wrap here - we'll be back shortly. Next is a question about power expansion - are you building to a GPU, or is it something else? Shedd notes that although the curve keeps going up, with no end in sight (for the time being at least) - with Dell announcing new rack hardware and cooling services to ensure optimal running. But not that many customers are building to this kind of scale, he adds - it's very much customer-specific. Schmitt adds understanding of customer scale and needs is vital - so optimizing for performance per watt is the important thing. The next question concerns workload scheduling in data center- what is its role? Ty Schmitt, Dell Vice President and Fellow, has joined us, and explains factoring in this functionality at a rack or cluster level has been a huge advantage - although this is often customer-specific. Time for Q&A - first up, how does Dell deal with the potential over-hype when it comes to generative AI? Holmes counters by saying there are \"profound applications of Gen AI\" that are changing how organizations do business. Shedd adds that while he sees the skepticism, but notes the scale and breadth of Gen AI technology shows how it can be useful for organizations across the board. When it comes to learnings, Shedd notes that working together with customers, and listening to them to learn their needs, is vital. \"Every deployment is unique,\" he says. Where Dell really excels is deployment and field services, he adds, deploying the technology at scale, and quickly. Asked about the challenges, opportunities and learnings, Shedd notes power cooling technology can be a huge advantage moving forward. Starting from the chip, to the rack, to the row, up to the data center, heat needs to be considered at each stage, he says, meaning a 1% improvement at any stage can roll in to big opportunities as a whole. The more efficiently heat is collected, the easier it is to reject the heat outside of the building. Energy grids have previously been build on the supply angle, he notes - this is not the case as much now, and managing the demand and load being put on the grid is becoming an increasing worry. Data center providers can also play their part, Holmes adds - partnerships are, \"absolutely key to success\". Holmes adds he meets with energy firm executives regularly, and their biggest challenges are permitting and a stable regulatory environment. Both of these are crucial given the scale of the possible investment asked of the energy providers, which can potentially span multiple decades, he says. We need to think hard about how we unleash AI, whilst staying supportive of sustainability. After introductions, Holmes starts off by outlining how Dell's approach to working with energy companies has changed significantly in the past few years, especially as AI demand continues to rise. Building and deploying huge amounts of AI infrastructure without impacting the grid is a key concern, he notes. Next up is a press roundtable, focussing on energy and AI, hosted byTim Shedd, Dell Engineering Technologist and David Holmes, CTO for Global Industries. So what happened at Michael Dell's opening keynote this morning? The company founder and CEO Michael Dell was in bullish mood talking about its AI goals, saying the technology is \"the new electricity\". Dell also declared the company was ready to take on the increased demand for PCsfollowing the Windows 10 End of Lifein October 2025, pitching AI PCs as the future for businesses everywhere. And that's a wrap on the opening keynote from Dell Technologies World 2025! Dell thanks us for coming, and we're off to hit the show floor for a look around. We'll be back shortly with more coverage of press and media panels, so stay tuned for more updates soon. \"AI is the new electricity - and Dell is the grid powering this transformation,\" Dell declares. \"At our core, we're about solving the world's toughest problems.\" \"AI is for all of us - it's for all of human progress,\" Dell notes. Dell is back to wrap up, highlighting the importance of relationships in business, especially when it comes to living up to your commitments. He also highlights the commitment to green initiatives and energy, with new Dell products and services coming out to help boost efficiency, as well as initiatives to reclaim and re-use older components and products. \"For us to realise the potential of AI, we need to do it responsibly,\" he notes. \"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity...this is incredibly exciting technology,\" Huang concludes, \"this is the beginning of a decade of transformation.\" \"This is unquestionably the biggest platform shift\" of the last 30 years, Huang notes - many systems were built in the old age, and now need to be brought into the age of AI. Sadly - it's only by video, as Dell sat down with Huang prior to the show. Huang notes how Nvidia is queuing up for the huge potential offered by enterprise AI, particularly when it comes to agents, as well as the innovation provided by Dell's AI Factory. Our next and final guest is one of the biggest names in tech right now - fresh from Computex, it's leather jacket aficionado, and Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang. Dell managed services are also expanding across more Nvidia platforms, allowing users to manage the entire AI lifecycle. \"We are on the cusp of an intelligence explosion,\" he notes - and working with Nvidia is the key. The companies are unveiling version 2 of the Dell-Nvidia AI Factory, offering some hugely advanced hardware, along with a new cooling system designed to take some of the strain off the system. It's time to look at the Dell AI Factory - the full big-picture view of AI from the company. Dell notes it can be more than 60% more effective than public cloud, and this will only get better as more investment comes in. \"AI is the operating system that will power the world forward,\" he declares. The challenge now is making AI more accessible to customers, he says. Next up, Dell switches to focus on reimagining on how businesses can capture value from their data \"We are entering the age of ubiqutious AI\", he says, as AI becomes as commonplace as electricity. However this doesn't mean AI is here to replace human workers, he notes. Godbole lays out how a company like Lowe's is not just a home improvement powerhouse, but a technology titan - bringing a whole host of systems and services to help make what can be a stressful process much more seamless for customers. AI Agents are a major focus for businesses everywhere, Dell notes, especially as data moves from cold storage to warm and hot tiers, as multi-agent systems get the most out of it. Dell has been pushing this for some time, he notes - and with that, it's time to welcome our next guest - Seemantini Godbole, Executive Vice President, Chief Digital & Information Officer, Lowe’s. We'll hear more on specific news in the day two keynote tomorrow, Dell teases... We swiftly move on to compute and infrastructure - Dell wants to be the hardware powering all your workloads. Storage is a huge focys for the company - namely PowerStore, the perfect choice for disaggregated architecture, Dell says, helping save capacity, power and space. PowerScale and PowerProtect also get a shout out - all forming a key part of Dell's overall architecture offerings. We bid farewell to our guest, and Dell switches to talking about the company's backbone - the PC. AI innovations are replacing aging technology - namely, Windows 10 - and Dell is ready to help power the next generation of productivity. Laptops are becoming AI worksations, Dell notes, inckuding the new Dell Pro Max with Nvidia GB300 - offering a ridiculous amount of power under your desk. \"AI is moving out of the cloud, onto the edge, bringing intelligence to every device in real time,\" he notes. It's time for our first guest - Larry Feinsmith, Head of Global Technology Strategy, Innovation & Partnerships, JPMorganChase. He notes Dell and JPMorganChase have been partners for over 30 years, and as it handles billions of transactions per day, needs a technology platform it can rely on. \"We firmly believe technology is a differentiator,\" Feinsmith notes. Dell moves on to highlight that it's OK to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of potential AI offers. \"The real danger is staying still,\" he declares. \"Here at Dell, we love data...and turbocharged by AI, that engine of progress is going faster than ever before,\" he adds. He mentions the \"AI Factory\" - Dell's system designed to help companies of all sizes get the most out of AI. \"AI can power your progress,\" Dell adds, noting that all companies should be able to benefit. The lights go down and Michael Dell, Chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies, takes to the stage. He welcomes us to \"Dell Technologies Way\" - a street that's alive with our energy, creativity and data. \"Data is at the center of everything, everywhere, all the time,\" he notes, with most of this produced at the edge, where AI thrives. \"The future of AI will be decentralized...and that's why Dell is pioneering the edge AI revolution,\" he adds. The music is cut off (mid-way through a triumphant finale of Bohemian Rhapsody) and it's time to kick off Dell Technologies World 2025 - with a video highlighting some of the biggest innovations and updates from the company. We're in and seated - as usual for Las Vegas keynotes, we're immediatey bombarded by loud music, this time by a rock group playing covers of your favorite hits. Chappel Roan's \"Pink Pony Club\" is a bit of an odd choice for 9.30am though... Badge secured! This is our passport to all the biggest talks and keynotes this week...as well as the press lounge and it's delectable array of pastries and coffee.

    "title": "Tornadoes kill dozens in US (VIDEOS)",
    "article_text": "A series of tornadoes killed dozens of people and injured many more across multiple US states over the weekend. A massive storm system pummeled the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions beginning Friday, killing at least 29 people in Kentucky, Missouri, Virginia, and Indiana, according to the local authorities. Dozens more have been reported injured. “Deaths from the severe weather have now risen to 19, with the addition of one adult female from Russell County,”Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear wrote on X on Sunday. He added that at least three people injured in the storm remain in critical condition. 📛📛📛Only 20 mins away …. The town next to me here in Kentucky got leveled by a tornado last night 🌪️If you wouldn’t mind taking a few seconds…. These people could use a prayer or twopic.twitter.com/6nIMwfNlNK Videos of the aftermath show entire streets reduced to rubble, with some houses destroyed down to their foundations. Debris was scattered across wide areas. At least seven people were killed in Missouri, two in Virginia, and one in Indiana, according to local officials. BREAKING: At least 20 people killed by tornado in Laurel County,#Kentucky- mayor tells WKYT#lastdakika#storm#usapic.twitter.com/UUwolnhdwu It was“one of the worst storms”that St. Louis has ever faced, Mayor Cara Spencer told reporters on Saturday. Five of Missouri’s fatalities occurred in that city. The massive weather system was made up of supercells – highly organized, long-lived thunderstorms capable of producing stronger winds and more severe damage than typical storms. Around Friday, the supercells generated tornadoes concentrated over parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky, the New York Times reported on Sunday. As many as 26 tornadoes touched down, mostly affecting Kentucky and Indiana, the newspaper wrote, citing government forecasters. Parts of the US are still reeling from an even more severe tornado outbreak last month.",

    "title": "France denies claims of Romanian election interference attempt",
    "article_text": "The French Foreign Ministry has vehemently denied undertaking any attempts to interfere in Romania's presidential election after Telegram founder Pavel Durov claimed that he was asked to silence Romanian conservative voices on the platform ahead of Sunday's runoff. The second round of voting in Romania is being contested by pro-EU centrist Nicusor and Euroskeptic George Simion, who have been running neck and neck in a tight race. Durov stated in a post on Telegram on the day of the vote that a“Western European government”approached his company with a request to block conservatives in Romania ahead of elections. The tech entrepreneur did not name the nation behind the request, but posted an emoji of a baguette in a thinly veiled reference to France. Hours later, the French Foreign Ministry responded with a lengthy statement on X calling“the recent accusations against France”completely“unfounded.” “France categorically rejects these allegations,”the ministry said, maintaining that the claims were“merely a diversionary maneuver from the real threats of interference targeting Romania.” Durov hit back, claiming he was personally approached over the matter by the head of France's foreign intelligence agency, Nicolas Lerner, at a Paris hotel this spring. In its statement, the French ministry also tried to point finger at Moscow, saying the first round of the Romanian presidential election initially held in December 2024 was annulled“by the competent Romanian authorities”following what it called“very real”interference from actors linked to Russia. The ministry was referring to a decision by Romania’s Constitutional Court to overturn the first round results after it was won by independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu, who secured 23% of the vote. The court cited electoral irregularities and suspected Russian“hybrid”influence. Moscow has denied having any involvement. Georgescu was later barred from running again by the Central Electoral Bureau, which cited his alleged“anti-democratic”and“extremist”positions and procedural violations. Simion publicly supported Georgescu and also accused France of“putting a lot of money and pressure”into subverting the vote in Romania.",
