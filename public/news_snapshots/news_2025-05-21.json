The 41-year-old former MVP has been a lightning rod of controversy in the media for expressing conservative opinions during podcast appearances the last four years. The quarterback was invited to become the running mate of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Director Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during Kennedy's independent presidential campaign in 2024. Now, Rodgers joins fellow former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre and wide receiver Donald Driver in taking a vocal stance against allowing trans athletes to compete in women's sports.

However, many Democrat-run states have openly defied Trump's order, prompting both internal and federal backlash.

    "article_text": "Dominic Garcia was arrested on 28 charges and held without bail. (KSTU) A Utah man is accused of holding his pregnant girlfriend and her family hostage in their home for six months under the lie that \"cartel\" members were pursuing them. Dominic Garcia, 23, was arrested Saturday and booked on 28 charges, most of them felonies. Among them were seven each of kidnapping and assault, according toThe Associated Press. SIX OHIO SUSPECTS ACCUSED OF TORTURING MAN IN WEEKLONG HOTEL KIDNAPPING: 'EXTREMELY DISTURBING' The situation reportedly began when one of the alleged captives called the police, claiming they were being held against their will and that they \"weren't able to take it any longer,\" according to KSTU, aSalt Lake City-basedFOX affiliate. Upon arriving at the home, police found the family holding Garcia at gunpoint, and he was promptly taken into custody. Dominic Garcia is accused of holding seven people hostage in a Utah home.(KSTU) Garcia reportedly moved in with the family in December. Shortly afterward, he allegedly claimed his own family had ties to a cartel, and that his new housemates had to do as he told them to remain in the cartel's good graces. \"Over time, Garcia created an atmosphere of fear and control, falsely creating affiliations with a dangerous cartel,\" said Sgt. Aymee Race of theUnified Police Departmentof Greater Salt Lake. UTAH COLD CASE SOLVED 40 YEARS AFTER 18-YEAR-OLD WOMAN’S MURDER THANKS TO DNA SAMPLE, POLICE SAY \"He claimed ‘his people’ were watching and any defiance could result in their deaths,\" she continued. Garcia reportedly began carrying a handgun around the house, repeatedly telling family members that the cartel would kill them if they did not do as he told them. One victim purchased a handgun that Garcia began carrying around, according to a probable cause statement.(KSTU) Garcia is also accused of forcing his alleged victims out of the home for a month under the pretense that his family had made a bad deal with the cartel and needed to flee. Upon their return, a family member texted a friend to explain where they had gone,KSTU reports. Upon seeing the text, Garcia allegedly lashed out, later claiming he'd brought one of the hostages \"into the company\" and that he'd kill them if they went astray. Garcia \"created an atmosphere of fear and control,\" Sgt. Aymee Race said.(KSTU) Family members also accuse Garcia of checking their phones and confronting them over messages he didn't approve of and limiting who could leave the home and for how long. He is also said to have run a \"boot camp\"-like operation that entailed working out five times a day, taking ice baths and facial submersion to the point where family members were left unable to breathe. Garcia, who as of Monday was being held without bail, \"said that he continued this lie for several months because he did not know how to stop it in fear that they would not like him,\" the police affidavit reads.

    "title": "At least 82 killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza as critical aid fails to reach Palestinians",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports on how Israel plans to move further into Gaza if no deal is reached with Hamas before President Donald Trump’s next visit on ‘The Story.’ Israeli strikes continued to poundthe Gaza StripWednesday, despite a surge in international anger at Israel's widening offensive. The attacks killed at least 82 people, including several women and a week-old infant, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and area hospitals. Israel began allowing dozens of humanitarian trucks into Gaza on Tuesday, butthe aidhas not yet reached Palestinians in desperate need. Jens Laerke, the spokesperson for the U.N.'s humanitarian agency, said no trucks were picked up from the Gaza side of Kerem Shalom, the Israeli border crossing with southern Gaza.

(AP Photo/Ohad Zwigenberg)(AP Photo/Ohad Zwigenberg) U.N. spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said Tuesday that although the aid had entered Gaza, workers were not able to bring it to distribution points after the Israeli military forced them to reload the supplies onto separate trucks and workers ran out of time. The Israeli defense body that oversees humanitarian aid to Gaza said trucks entered Wednesday morning, but it was unclear if that aid would move deeper into Gaza for distribution. TheU.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said its staff had waited several hours to collect aid from the border crossing but were unable to do so on Tuesday. ISRAEL BLOCKS HUMANITARIAN AID INTO GAZA AFTER HAMAS REJECTS CEASEFIRE EXTENSION PROPOSAL A few dozen Israeli activists opposed to Israel's decision to allow aid into Gaza while Hamas still holds Israeli hostages attempted to block trucks carrying supplies Wednesday morning, but were kept back by Israeli police. Diplomats come under fire in Jenin A group of diplomats came under fire while visiting Jenin, a city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Authority. The diplomats were on an official mission to observe the humanitarian situation in Jenin when shots rang out. An aid worker, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisal, said a delegation of about 20 regional, European and Western diplomats were standing near the entrance of theJenin refugee campwhen they heard gunshots Wednesday, she said. No one was injured, she added. The Israeli military said the delegation \"deviated from the approved route\" and Israeli soldiers fired warning shots to distance them from the area. The military apologized and said they will contact all countries involved in the visit.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana) Footage shows a number of diplomats running for cover as rapid shots rung out. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said firing even warning shots was unacceptable and called on Israel to investigate. The Italian government of Premier Giorgia Meloni also demanded an explanation, saying that its vice consul was among those who came under fire. Jenin has been the site of Israel’s widespread crackdown against West Bank militants since earlier this year. On Jan. 21 — just two days after its ceasefire deal with Hamas in Gaza — Israeli forces descended on Jenin as they have dozens of times since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The fighting displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians, one of the largest West Bank displacements in years. International pressure on Israel On Tuesday, the United Kingdom suspendedfree trade talkswith Israel over its intensifying assault, a step that came a day after the U.K., Canada and France promised concrete steps to prompt Israel to halt the war. Separately, the European Union was reviewing an EU pact governing trade ties with Israel over its conduct of the war in Gaza, according to its foreign policy chief. Israel says it is prepared to stop the war once all the hostages taken by Hamas return home and Hamas is defeated, or is exiled and disarmed. Hamas says it is prepared to release the hostages in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal from the territory and an end to the war. It rejects demands for exile and disarmament. ISRAEL FIRES BACK AT UK OVER SUSPENDED TRADE TALKS, REJECTS ‘EXTERNAL PRESSURE’ Israel called back its senior negotiating team from ceasefire talks in the Qatari capital of Doha on Tuesday, saying it would leave lower-level officials in place instead. Qatari leaders, who are mediating negotiations, said there was a large gap between the two sides. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes continued across Gaza. In the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israel recently ordered new evacuations pending an expected expanded offensive, 24 people were killed, 14 from the same family. A week-old infant was killed in central Gaza. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strikes, but has said it is targeting Hamas infrastructure and accused Hamas militants of operating from civilian areas. Desperate need for food Experts have warned that many of Gaza’s 2 million residents face a high risk of famine. At one displacement camp in Gaza City, a charity group distributed thin and watery lentil soup. Somaia Abu Amsha scooped small portions into bowls for her family, saying they have not have had bread for over 10 days and she can’t afford rice or pasta.

Even dogs wouldn’t eat this, let alone children,\" she said, pointing at the soup. Pope Leo XIV on Wednesday called for aid to reach the Gaza Strip and for an end to the \"heartbreaking\" toll on its people during his first general audience in St. Peter’s Square. Hospitals surrounded Israeli troops also have surrounded two of northern Gaza’s last functioning hospitals, preventing anyone from leaving or entering the facilities, hospital staff and aid groups said this week. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday urged world leaders to take immediate action to end Israel’s siege on Gaza, issuing the appeal during a visit to Beirut, where he was expected to discuss the disarmament of Palestinian factions in Lebanon’s refugee camps. ISRAEL ENCIRCLES 2 OF NORTHERN GAZA’S LAST FUNCTIONING HOSPITALS, GROUPS SAY \"It is time to end the war of extermination against the Palestinian people. I reiterate that we will not leave, and we will remain here on the land of our homeland, Palestine,\" Abbas said, demanding the immediate entry of aid, the release of detainees, and a full withdrawal from Gaza. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 others. The militants are still holding 58 captives, around a third of whom are believed to be alive, after most were returned in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Both hospitals as well as another and three primary health care centers are within the evacuation zone, though Israel has not ordered the evacuation of the facilities themselves. Another two hospitals and four primary care centers are within 1,000 yards of the zone, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization. Israeli military operations and evacuation orders \"are stretching the health system beyond the breaking point,\" he said. Israeli drones have been hovering around the Indonesian hospital since Sunday, an aid group that supports the hospital told the AP.

In February, Ukraine’s president was involved in a shouting match with Trump and others, which reportedly led to him being ejected from the White House. \"The meeting is set to occur at a time when the relationship between the two countries has soured to unprecedented lows,\" analyst Frans Cronje, Yorktown Foundation for Freedom advisory board member,told Fox News Digital.

These choices have consequences,\" Max Meizlish, senior research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital. Meizlish said South Africa has \"attracted the ire of the president and key members of Congress, who play significant roles in shaping the future of U.S.-South African relations. Unfortunately,President Ramaphosaand his colleagues in the ANC do not appear to fully appreciate this fact.President Trump should insist on meaningful change and be ready to back his demands up with tools like targeted sanctions and tariffs.\" But will the White House meeting be icy, feisty, even loud? Not from the South African side, former U.S. diplomat and Daily Maverick Associate Editor J. Brooks Spector told Fox News Digital. \"Ramaphosa has a long track record of careful negotiating with adversaries.\" A man brandishes a replica toy gun during a pro-Palestinian demonstration organized by the South African opposition party Economic Freedom Fighters in front of the Israeli Embassy in Pretoria on Oct. 23, 2023.(Marco Longari/AFP via Getty Images) He doesn’t raise his voice, even when others become heated. This reporter has seen this first hand. In a smoke-filled room in 1990 in South Africa’s dusty Free State, I watched Ramaphosa, then a leader of a Black miners' union, sometimes even smile as he quietly and successfully calmed down [the] often-shouting White miners accused of killing Black colleagues underground and got the murders stopped. Spector continued, \"It is almost certain Ramaphosa and his team have closely studied the way three recent prior meetings with Trump have gone – those withZelenskyy (Ukraine), Starmer (the United Kingdom) and Carney (Canada) – in an effort to draw lessons about how to present their best face. He will not make neophyte negotiation mistakes.\" WHITE SOUTH AFRICAN REFUGEES BROUGHT TO US DUE TO ‘GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED RACIAL DISCRIMINATION’: STATE DEPT South African Embassy officials Vusimuzi Madonsela, seated right, and Cornelius Scholtz, seated second left, talk at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, on May 16, 2024.(AP Photo/Peter Dejong) Cronje told Fox News Digital that Ramaphosa and his country badly need the U.S. \"At home, Mr Ramaphosa is presiding over economic stagnation, with South Africa facing a rate of economic growth estimated at just over 1% together with an unemployment rate of over 30%. Mr. Ramaphosa will, therefore, be under great pressure to secure a deal.\" Some 600 U.S. companies operate in South Africa. Ramaphosa has taken four top ministers to Washington hoping to offer new deals, especially reportedly on natural gas, minerals and agricultural product sales to the U.S., and possibly finally the licensing of Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet system in South Africa. Cronje noted a military perspective the U.S. will also want to consider: \"South Africa commands the southern sea route between the Indian and Atlantic oceans, which is an important trade and naval choke point.\" Meizlish added that South Africa \"holds vast mineral wealth and could anchor U.S. investment in Africa, but that doesn’t mean we should turn a blind eye to its alignment with America’s enemies.\" President Donald Trump listens to a question during an event at the Oval Office on May 19, 2025.(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) South Africa’schief rabbi, Dr. Warren Goldstein, told Fox News Digital that South Africa could \"easily withdraw\" its ICJ case against Israel if it wanted to, adding that \"opinion polls show that there is very little domestic support for his (Ramaphosa’s) anti-Israel stance, with most holding positive views towards Israel, sharing the same conservative Christian values that deeply resonate with Mr. Trump’s support base in the U.S.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meizlish said, \"This visit can’t be about optics or deals that fail to address the root of South Africa's malign foreign policy. Trump needs to push Ramaphosa to make substantive, structural reforms in his country's foreign policy while also creating pathways for greater U.S. investment. It can't just be one or the other.\" As South African politicians swept through Washington on Tuesday on a major lobbying exercise, trying to get traction on the idea of focusing on trade, Rubio told senators during a hearing that a reset in relations might be possible. \"If there's a willingness on their side to reset relations, obviously [that's] something we'll explore, but we do so with eyes wide open to what they've done so far,\" he said.

Protesters affiliated with several leftist groups, including the People's Action Institute, flooded aCapitol Hilloffice building in Washington on Wednesday as the House prepared to vote on the\"big, beautiful\" budget billbacked by President Donald Trump. Capitol Police have responded to several protests over Medicaid cuts that disrupted activities in Capitol office buildings over the last several weeks. On Wednesday, protesters affiliated with the People’s Action Institute shut down a hallway in the Longworth House Office Building as part of a protest against cuts to Medicaid in the budget bill. In a video obtained by Fox News Digital, protesters could be seen blocking a hallway and shouting, \"We got the power,\" while raising their fists.

Democrats have beenshining a spotlight on portions of the budget bill that restructure Medicaid, the nearly 60-year-old federal government program that provides health insurance for roughly 71 million adults and children with limited income. The cuts to Medicaid, being drafted in part as an offset to pay for extending Trump's 2017 tax cut law that is set to expire this year, include a slew of new rules and regulatory requirements for those seeking coverage. Among them are a new set of work requirements for many of those seeking coverage. Wednesday’s protest was not the only one that has disrupted activity in the Capitol office buildings this month.

    "article_text": "Sen. Adam B. Schiff of California battled EPA Administrator Lee M. Zeldin at a Senate EPW Committee hearing. The typically calm confines of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee were the site ofseveral clashes on Wednesdaybetween Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin and Democrats on the panel adjudicating his annual budget request. Sen.Adam Schiff,D-Calif., rattled off a list of cancers he claimed Zeldin's actions at the agency could cause, remarking the New York Republican must be proud of how many regulations he’s slashed in such a short time. \"Your legacy will be more lung cancer — it'll be more bladder cancer, more head and neck cancer. There'll be more breast cancer, more leukemia and pancreatic cancer, more liver cancer, more skin cancer, more kidney cancer, more testicular cancer, or colorectal cancer — more rare cancers of innumerable varieties. That will be your legacy. … My kids are gonna be breathing that air, just like yours,\" he said. \"If your children were drinking the water in Santa Ana, Mr. Zeldin… maybe you would give a damn,\" he said after holding up a glass of water and claiming the EPA’s move toward streamlining its grants and expenditures will lead to a panoply of bad outcomes. KASH PATEL ENRAGES SCHIFF IN CLINTONIAN BATTLE OVER THE WORD ‘WE’ AND A JANUARY 6 SONG \"You need the money for a tax cut for rich people because you’re totally beholden to the oil industry,\" Schiff fumed, accusing Zeldin of unlawful termination of congressionally appropriated grants. \"You could give a rat’s a-- about how much cancer your agency causes,\"Schiff said, raising his voice as Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., banged the gavel to note his time was up. Earlier in the hearing, Zeldin clashed with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., over grant reviews and claimed the administrator couldn’t \"get [his] story straight.\" Whitehouse appeared to make the claim that the EPA was not individually reviewing each of the grants it was canceling and cited court testimony from Zeldin official Travis Voyles that he had conducted an \"individualized review\" as of February.

It cannot be that Voyles personally himself conducted—\" \"He did,\" Zeldin cut in. \"… the review of 781 grants—\" Whitehouse continued. \"He did; I did,\" Zeldin cut in again. \"… and that [Deputy Administrator Daniel] Coogan saw to it that it was individually done,\" Whitehouse said as the two men talked over each other. After some more back-and-forth, Zeldin told Whitehouse that it must be a \"crazy concept\" for him to consider that more than one person could review the hundreds of grants in question and for more than one per calendar day. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Zeldin said he and his EPA colleagues have been \"busting their a--\" to identify waste and abuse and that Whitehouse was only interested in scoring political points. \"I'm using the facts as your employees stated them,\" Whitehouse claimed. \"We’re on it every single day, because we have a zero-tolerance policy towards wasting dollars,\" Zeldin shot back. \"You don't care about wasting money,\" he went on, adding that he had promised committee member Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., at a prior hearing that he would make reviewing grants in this way a priority of his tenure. \"I have to come back here in front of Sen. Ricketts today, and even though you don't care about wasting tax dollars, Sen. Ricketts does.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Sen.

    "title": "Texas doctor sentenced to 10 years in prison in one of the ‘most significant’ cases of patient harm",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. ATexas-baseddoctor was sentenced Wednesday to 10 yearsin prison for healthcare fraud after he carried out what prosecutors said was a nearly two-decade scheme that involved falsely diagnosing thousands of patients with degenerative diseases and profiting handsomely off their treatments. Jorge Zamora-Quezada, a rheumatologist licensed to practice medicine in Texas, Arizona and Massachusetts before being stripped of his licenses in each state, raked in hundreds of millions of dollars for the misdiagnoses and treatment he ordered during his roughly 20 years as a medical practitioner. The treatments included punishing rounds of chemotherapy, intravenous infusions, and a battery of other tests, monthly visits, and regular procedures associated with the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic, autoimmune condition for which there is no cure. The sentencing, and his earlier court appearances, played out at times like a study in contrasts. Prosecutors detailed his extravagant lifestyle, including a private jet, 13 properties across the U.S., including in Aspen and various towns in Mexico, and a Maserati – while the health of the patients he defrauded continued to worsen. Prosecutors accused him of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals in Texas, such as teenagers, elderly individuals, and disabled persons, in order to carry out the scheme. Some of them testified at Wednesday’s hearing about the ongoing side effects they suffered as a result of the doctor’s actions, including receiving chemotherapy or IV infusions they did not need. AMTRAK BILKED OUT OF $12M BY AT LEAST 119 EMPLOYEES, DOCTORS IN FRAUD SCHEME; MANY STILL ON THE JOB: REPORT View of the Justice Department building in Washington, D.C: Valerie Plesch/dpa (Photo by Valerie Plesch/picture alliance)(Getty Images) It’s \"one of the most egregious\" cases of its kind theJustice Departmenthas brought in this space, Matthew Galeotti, head of the Justice Department Criminal Division, told Fox News Digital in a sit-down interview on Wednesday. That’s because of \"all of the various kinds of misconduct rolled into one,\" he said, \"and because it was pervasive – the scheme lasted more than 18 years.\" \"By the time you're towards the end of the scheme, he knows the consequences some of these things have had on the victims, and he's going forward anyways,\" he said of the doctor. The Justice Department'sCriminal Divisionhas been prosecuting this case for years. Unlike other departments, it is one of the few where career and political staff alike are largely in lockstep, with goals and cases that transcend partisan politics and seek instead to hold criminals like the Texas doctor accountable. Galeotti said he sees the case as emblematic of the Trump administration’s goals to vindicate victims and counter wasteful government spending. \"Even in cases where you don't see this level of misconduct, where you're not prescribing someone chemotherapy medicine that doesn't need it, which obviously sort of stands out on its own, we still have a problem because you were wasting government funds that should be going to actually benefiting patients,\" Galeotti said. A BERLIN DOCTOR HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH THE KILLINGS OF 15 PATIENTS UNDER PALLIATIVE CARE US President Donald Trump and US Attorney General Pam Bondi (L) arrive to speak at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. (Roberto Schmidt/AFP)(Getty Images) A separate Justice Department official told Fox News Digital Zamora-Quezada’s case was one of the \"most significant\" instances of patient harm that he had seen in at least a decade. \"There was testimony about truly debilitating side effects from the medications, things like strokes, necrosis of the jawbone, really the jawbone melting away, hair loss, liver damage,\" the official said. The doctor’s actions were seen as particularly egregious, in the Justice Department's telling, because they sought to prey on lower-income communities in Texas, targeting teenagers, elderly persons, and disabled individuals. The doctor also operated in areas with less access to medical care and with fewer native English speakers compared to other parts of the state. \"Of course, it's always the most twisted when you're benefiting from someone else's misfortune – misfortune you caused – and misfortune you used for your own personal enrichment,\" Galeotti said. \"They're the hallmarks of the worst kind of conduct that you see,\" Galeotti said. DOJ PROSECUTOR SUING TRANS MEDICINE WHISTLEBLOWER TAKEN OFF CASE OVER APPARENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST \"This investigation highlights an even greater concern presented by health care fraud than the significant financial losses – the physical and emotional harm suffered by the patients and their families,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Combs in 2018.(Getty Images) Zamora-Quezada was convicted by a jury in 2020 of seven counts of healthcare fraud, one count of conspiracy to commithealthcare fraud, and one count of obstruction of justice. His attorneys argued that the fraud was not \"pervasive\" in the way the government made it out to be, according to public court filings. Prosecutors said Zamora-Quezada purchased condominium properties in vacation towns, including in Aspen, San Diego, and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. They said he commuted to his various doctors’ offices in Texas in a Maserati and a private jet, both emblazoned with his initials, \"ZQ.\" His assets were forfeited after he was charged, prosecutors said. Meanwhile, they said, while Zamora-Quezada was living a life of luxury, out of nearly 100,000 Medicare patients he treated, Zamora-Quezada diagnosed 72.9% of them with rheumatoid arthritis. Prosecutors compared that data to seven other Texas rheumatologists, who cumulatively diagnosed 13% of their patients with the same condition. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Prosecutors asked for $100 million in restitution, but the judge required him to pay $28 million. Attorneys for Zamora-Quezada did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump’s Border Czar, Tom Homan, applauded border security elements of the president’s ‘big beautiful bill’, noting an improved border wall and resources for relocating illegal migrants In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital,Trump border czar Tom Homanoutlined the progress that has been made at the border, and detailed how the president’s \"big beautiful bill\" could solidify items that have improved border security. \"All those accessories on the border, we can lock it in to make it permanent,\" Homan explained. \"So we're going to put more border walls up. We'll put more water buoys in. That's going to save lives, right, because people see the water buoys, you can't get over them, which many people won't attempt to go into that river, which means we save lives.\" According todata from the Customs and Border Patrol(CBP), apprehensions at the border are down 93% from April 2024 to April 2025 under the Trump administration. Fulfilling the president’s campaign promise to reign in the heightened flow of illegal immigrants has been one of the administration’s top priorities, and Homan told Fox the \"big beautiful bill\" will \"solidify the success\" the numbers are already illustrating.BORDER CZAR TOM HOMAN SAYS DEMOCRAT LAMONICA MCIVER 'BROKE THE LAW,' SHOULD BE CHARGED FOR ICE CLASH White House 'border czar' Tom Homan speaks with reporters outside the White House in Washington, DC, on March 7, 2025.(JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) \"[The bill] is going to save lives,\" Homan said. \"It's going to add technology to the existing new border wall that the Biden administration didn't put into the wall. So, it's a smart wall, but Biden stopped the tech equipment from getting embedded in the wall to let us know when someone approaches that wall, climbs the wall, digs under that wall.\" Trump’s border czar also pointed out an important element of the legislation, which provides funding for the U.S.Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE) to purchase beds for illegal migrants who are detained. \"Right now we've got 50,000 people in custody. We're only funded for $34,000. ICE is already in a hole at $500 million. We need 100,000 beds. This bill does that.\" INSIDE TRUMP'S URGENT MEETING WITH HOUSE GOP TO PASS THE 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' Border czar Tom Homan defends the Trump administration's choice to invoke the Alien Enemies Act.(C-Span) The president’s \"big beautiful bill\" contains many components of Trump’s agenda, including border security, tax policy, debt limit, and defense spending. It has had issues making it through the legislative process as some House Republicans have advocated for provisions such as state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps and spending cuts. President Trumpspoke out stronglyagainst any cuts to Medicaid or SALT deduction caps during his visit to Capitol Hill to rally support for the bill on Tuesday. As for the border, GOP members whose districts line the southern border spoke out in support of the legislation. \"It may be a big and beautiful bill, but it has the muscle and backbone of historic border security and the ability to deport the millions of criminal illegals Joe Biden let walk into our country,\" Congressman Darrell Issa, R-California, told Fox News Digital.

Tony Gonalzes, who represents the largest border district in Congress, also highlighted border elements of the legislation. \"These are exactly the priorities I have fought tooth and nail for during the last four years, and I’m proud to see we’re finally getting it done,\" Gonzales told Fox News Digital. \"My communities along the border will be much better off, and I’m proud to have played a key part in making that happen.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Despite some GOP enthusiasm, sources on Capitol Hill say there is still a long way to go before the piece of legislation reaches the president’s desk.

    "article_text": "Correspondent Kevin Corke reports the latest on the Fox News Voter Analysis from the 2024 race. The 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts react to the former president's gains with minority and younger voters as he is named the projected election winner. FIRST ON FOX:Republicans outperformedDemocrats on voter registrationin four key battleground states between the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections, according to research by the American Association of Political Consultants (AAPC). The bipartisan political consultant non-profit teamed up with analysts from Data Trust, aconservative organization, and Target Smart, whichhas aligned with Democratsin past election cycles. Compiling data from the 2020 and 2024 elections in Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Pennsylvania, the research suggests a national shift in voter registration toward the Republican Party. \"We wanted a bipartisan analysis because there are so many conventional wisdoms this election challenged,\" Larry Huynh of Trilogy Interactive andDemocrat AAPC Board President said. \"The data was pretty clear that the Democrats were caught off guard with voter registration and turnout efforts and failed to mount a sufficiently compelling counter-effort to compete. We should all learn from this and take a deeper dive into our voter registration and turnout operations.\" AAPC unveiled the research this week during the 2025 Pollie Awards, a political communications awards program, in Colorado Springs, Colo.

BIDEN AIDE INTIMIDATED REPORTER INVESTIGATING FORMER PRESIDENT'S MENTAL DECLINE WITH 'TACIT THREAT:' BOOK From 2020 to 2024, the bipartisan political analysis found the share of registered Democrat voters dropped in all four battleground states. Meanwhile, the share of registered unaffiliated and Republican voters increased in Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Pennsylvania, according to the data compiled by Data Trust and Target Smart. In three out of four of the states analyzed, unaffiliated voters accounted for the largest electoral increase. Democrats saw the largest electoral drop between 2020 and 2024 across the four battleground states, following the same trend as voter registration. Voter turnout across party lines dropped in three out of the four battleground states analyzed, the data revealed. And while Democrat turnout dropped more than Republican turnout in those three states, the difference was less than a percentage point in every state but Arizona. Data Trust and Target Smart also analyzed trends across demographic groups, including Black, Hispanic and rural voters. The overall increase in Republican registration, turnout and electoral growth was consistent across the demographic groups analyzed.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on congressional efforts to pass President Donald Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ on ‘The Faulkner Focus.’ The marquee event in the run-up to potentially passing the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" began Wednesday at 3 p.m. ET as House SpeakerMike Johnson, R-La., and members of the Freedom Caucus headed to the White House to meet with President Donald Trump. TheWhite Houseis really amping up the pressure now on the Freedom Caucus. A White House statement said, \"The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\" It added that \"President Trump is committed to keeping his promises, and failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal. If H.R. 1 were presented to the President, he would sign it into law.\" Fox is told that the House GOP brass would like to pass the bill \"today.\" There is an increasing scenario that \"today\" means very late Wednesday night or the early hours of Thursday morning. They are banking on the idea that pressure from the president will force the Freedom Caucus to vote \"yes.\" They also need to provide a fig leaf for the Freedom Caucus so they can exit these negotiations with a \"win.\" HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS HEADING TO WHITE HOUSE AFTER DELAY PLAY ON TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ Congress is feeling the pressure as the Memorial Day deadline to vote on Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" approaches.(Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The Freedom Caucus is upset that the SALT Caucus achieved a victory with an increase in the deduction for state and local taxes. So the Freedom Caucus is asking, \"Where is our deal?\" We expect House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to parachute a \"manager’s amendment\" or two into the bill at the end. This would be introduced before the House Rules Committee and made a part of the bill. The manager’s amendment is essentially the final change to the bill. The key is to make sure that it sweetens the measure in a way that it drags the final outstanding votes across the finish line. Here’s the dynamic:HouseGOP leaders are worried about losing members from an attendance perspective on Thursday. So they feel it’s best to move sooner rather than later. Also, there’s the potential of losing votes the longer this sits open. So Republican leaders want to lock this down as soon as possible. That’s why an overnight/early morning scenario is very much in play right now. DEMS WARN HOUSE REPUBLICANS WILL PAY PRICE AT BALLOT BOX FOR PASSING TRUMP'S ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL’ Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., must navigate his perilously slim majority to pass President Donald Trump's agenda.(Getty Images/Fox News Digital illustration) Here are the concrete steps which must happen to pass the bill: – Johnson introduces his manager’s amendment to tweak the bill and court reluctant Republicans to vote yes. – The Rules Committee incorporates that amendment into the bill. – The Rules Committee votes on the overall \"rule,\" which sends the \"new\" version of the bill with the changes via the manager’s amendment to the floor. – The House debates the \"rule\" to set the table for the actual debate. – The House must adopt the \"rule\" in order to put the bill on the floor. If the Rules Committee fails to send the rule to the floor or if theGOPstumbles in its effort to get it out of the Rules Committee, they’re stuck. So these two procedural steps are crucial.

Those are a lot of steps. But things can move very fast when they get these things in place in the House. That’s why Republican leaders want the pressure of the president to force the issue in the next 12 to 24 hours. That said, there is a distinct possibility of this unfolding overnight or in the wee hours of the morning on Thursday. There is also a possibility that this stalls, and we are staring at a Thursday night/wee hours of Friday scenario, too.

    "title": "Trump faces another deportation setback with 4th Circuit appeals court",
    "article_text": "Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin sounded off on a Biden-appointed federal judge who could decide Wednesday morning that a plane carrying illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes to South Sudan has to return. A U.S. appeals court ordered theTrump administrationthis week to comply with a lower court judge's order to return a 20-year-old Venezuelan migrant deported from the U.S. to El Salvador in March, marking another setback in legal battles over its use of the Alien Enemies Act. The 2–1 decision from the 4th Circuit leaves in placeU.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher’searlier ruling that Daniel Lozano-Camargo, previously identified in court documents as \"Cristian,\" must be allowed back into the country. Gallagher, a Trump appointee, ruled that Lozano-Camargo's removal violated an agreement that the Department of Homeland Security struck with a group of other migrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children and later sought asylum. DHS agreed not to deport these individuals, who later sought asylum in the U.S. until their cases could be fully adjudicated in court. The decision paves the way for the Trump administration to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. In the interim, Gallagher has said she will amend her ruling to set a formal timeline for the government to return the 20-year-old migrant to the U.S. FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS RETURN OF DEPORTED MIGRANT TO US, REJECTING TRUMP REQUEST President Donald Trump gestures while speaking during an executive order signing event in the Oval Office of the White House March 31, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(Fox News Digital; Getty Images) TheJustice Departmentappealed the case to the 4th Circuit earlier this month. The majority opinion, published Monday night, rejected its request, stressing what judges said was their role in ensuring the courts have the ability to prevent any attempted \"degradation of effective judicial review\" by the executive branch. \"As is becoming far too common, we are confronted again with the efforts of the Executive Branch to set aside the rule of law in pursuit of its goals,\" Judge DeAndrea Gist Benjamin said, writing for the majority. \"It is the duty of courts to stand as a bulwark against the political tides that seek to override constitutional protections and fundamental principles of law, even in the name of noble ends like public safety.\" \"The Government’s breach denied Cristian the benefit of the bargain and the process he was due,\" Gregory added. JUDGE ON WARPATH PRESSES TRUMP DOJ ON ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION, ANSWERS LEAVE COURTROOM IN STUNNED SILENCE More than 250 suspected gang members arrive in El Salvador by plane, including 238 members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang and 23 members of the MS-13 gang, who were deported to El Salvador by the US in San Salvador, El Salvador, March 16, 2025.(El Salvador Presidency/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) Gallagher ruled in April that the government violated a 2024 settlement between DHS anda group of young asylum seekers, including Lozano-Camargo. Under that deal, DHS agreed not to deport the migrants, all of whom entered the U.S. as unaccompanied children, until their cases were fully heard in court. Last month, Gallagher said Lozano-Camargo’s deportation was a \"breach of contract\" since his asylum case had not yet been heard and ordered the U.S. government to arrange for his release. Lawyers for the Trump administration argued Lozano-Camargo was eligible for removal under the Alien Enemies Act, citing his arrest and conviction on cocaine possession charges as recently as January. They also claimed, without evidence, he was a member of a \"violent terrorist gang.\" IDENTITY OF SECOND DEPORTED MAN WHO JUDGE WANTS RETURNED TO US REVEALED AS TRUMP ADMIN FIGHTS ORDER Gallagher reiterated her previous decision this month, emphasizing it has nothing to do with the strength of his asylum request in a nod to two apparent low-level drug offenses. Rather, she stressed, it was a matter of due process. The government is \"measuring utility using the wrong yardstick\" in this case, she told the administration, adding it is not a case of whether Lozano-Camargo will eventually receive asylum, but the process afforded to him in the interim.

This was also upheld by the judges of the appellate court. \"The Government's breach denied Cristian the benefit of the bargain and the process he was due,\" Benjamin said, writing for the majority. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The job of the courts is to \"say what the law is,\" she said.  \"The task is delicate but cannot be shirked.\" It is unclear whether the Trump administration will appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

    "article_text": "Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., explains the precedent behind expelling members of Congress who break the law. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., introduced a House resolution on Wednesday to expel Democratic New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver, who earlier this week was served with federal charges for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers this month while protesting at a federal immigrant detention center. \"On May 9th, McIver didn't just break the law, she attacked the very people who defend it,\"Mace saidin a press release announcing the new House Resolution. \"Attacking Homeland Security and ICE agents isn't just disgraceful, it's assault.

    "title": "Will Vance remark about US bailing on Ukraine encourage Putin to sink nascent peace talks?",
    "article_text": "Vice President JD Vance says the U.S. wants to see \"outcomes\" from Russia and Ukraine on peace talks and isn't afraid to step aside from its involvement in negotiating with both countries. Vice PresidentJD Vance'ssuggestion this week that the U.S. could walk away from supporting Ukraine if peace talks with Russia stagnate could serve as catnip for the Kremlin, according to experts who say Russian PresidentVladimir Putinmight choose to smother progress in hopes of getting America to wash \"its hands of the war.\" WhilePresidentDonald Trumphas indicated that the U.S. may disengage from the negotiations as a last resort if they prove futile, Vance has taken the rhetoric a step further by saying the U.S. is definitely open to doing so. \"We’re more than open to walking away,\" Vance told reporters on board Air Force Two on Monday, just moments before a high-stakes phone call between Trump and Putin. \"The United States is not going to spin its wheels here. We want to see outcomes.\" But Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyycautioned that no one wins if the U.S. steps aside from the talks, except for Russia. \"It is crucial for all of us that the United States does not distance itself from the talks and the pursuit of peace because the only one who benefits from that is Putin,\" Zelenskyy wrote in a Monday post on X. Vance's remark about abandoning mediation between the two countries would only embolden Russia, even though a lack of U.S. involvement still wouldn't give Putin everything he wants, according to John Hardie, the deputy director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Russia program, a nonprofit research institute based in Washington. For the moment, Moscow still benefits from U.S. involvement in the talks because the Kremlin wants the U.S. to help advance a deal that benefits Russia and alleviates sanctions, Hardie said. \"But, for the Kremlin, the United States washing its hands of the war would be the next best outcome if it means an end or reduction to U.S. support for Ukraine, especially since President Trump may well move to normalize relations with Russia anyhow,\" Hardie told Fox News Digital. \"So the administration’s threat to walk away risks perversely incentivizing Kremlin intransigence. A better approach would be to ramp up the economic and military pressure on Russia if Putin continues to reject compromise.\" Russia still desires normalization with the U.S., which can only happen if the war ends swiftly and relatively amicably, said Peter Rough, a senior fellow and director of the Center on Europe and Eurasia at the Hudson Institute think tank. \"That reset in relations is a giant carrot the administration is dangling in front of the Kremlin,\" Rough told Fox News Digital. \"If the U.S. walks away because Russia will not make peace, however, then that carrot disappears as well.\" Rough noted that other administration officials besides Vance, including Trump and Secretary of StateMarco Rubio, have mentioned the possibility of walking away from a deal, so Vance's comments don't necessarily reflect a huge change in policy. And it's unclear right now what exactly stepping aside would mean. \"The purpose of those comments has been to impress on the Kremlin that U.S. patience is not limitless,\" Rough said. Vance hasn't shied away from issuing bold foreign policy statements since becoming vice president. From sparring with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office in Februaryto appearing to counter Trump when Vance remarked in May that the war in Ukraine was far from over after Trump indicated a deal might emerge soon, Vance has been outspoken in a way most vice presidents haven't been. When asked for comment or if there were any concerns about Vance's Monday statement, the White House referred Fox News Digital to Vance’s office. Vance’s office declined to provide comment when asked if his remarks would encourage Russia to sit the negotiations out and continue its attacks. WHY ZELENSKYY KEEPS PUSHING NATO MEMBERSHIP EVEN THOUGH TRUMP SAYS IT'S NOT HAPPENING Vice President JD Vance talks to reporters inside Air Force Two at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport in Rome on May 19, 2025. Vance has adopted an outspoken approach as vice president, starting off with his fiery February statements at the Munich Security Council in which he asserted that Europe needed to \"step up in a big way to provide for its own defense.\" That boldness has carried over into the Russia-Ukraine negotiations, where Vance has taken a proactive approach, at times appearing to be forging his own path. Vance and Rubio engaged in discussions to end the conflict in Ukraine with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Rome on Sunday, among other issues. Vance and Rubio also discussed the Trump administration's efforts to end the war with Vatican prelate Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher on Monday. Aboard Air Force Two on Monday, Vance said the negotiations had reached \"a bit of [an] impasse\" between the two countries and that the conflict is not the Trump administration’s war to wage but rather belongs to former PresidentJoe Bidenand Putin. \"There is fundamental mistrust between Russia and the West. It's one of the things the president thinks is, frankly, stupid, that we should be able to move beyond,\" Vance told reporters. \"The mistakes that have been made in the past, but ... that takes two to tango.\" \"I know the president's willing to do that, but if Russia's not willing to do that, then we're eventually just going to have to say ... this is not our war,\" Vance said. \"It's Joe Biden's war, it's Vladimir Putin's war. It's not our war. We're going to try to end it, but if we can't end it, we're eventually going to say, 'You know what? That was worth a try, but we're not doing it anymore.'\" TRUMP INSISTS UKRAINE-RUSSIA PEACE DEAL IS CLOSE, BUT MISTRUST IN PUTIN LEAVES EXPERTS SKEPTICAL President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the first time since their Oval Office spat in February.(Vatican and Ukraine Ambassador to Holy See) Vance's Monday statement came just before Trump was scheduled to speak with Putin, seemingly undercutting the high-leverage telephone call and also underscoring Vance's influence over foreign policy matters in the White House. Specifically on Ukraine negotiations, Vance has remained outspoken, engaging in confrontation when Zelenskyy visited the White House in February. In that exchange, Vance accused Zelenskyy of being \"disrespectful\" after Zelenskyy pointed out that Putin has a track record of breaking agreements and countered Vance’s statements that the path forward was through diplomacy to end the war in Ukraine. President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky get into an argument in the Oval Office.(Getty) \"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" Vance asked at the Oval Office meeting. Almost immediately after the U.S. signed a minerals deal with Ukraine on May 1, Vance said the war in Ukraine wouldn't end in the near future, despite the fact that Trump indicated the previous week that an agreement was on the horizon. \"It’s not going anywhere,\" Vance told Fox News on May 1. \"It’s not going to end anytime soon.\" Still, he characterized the agreement as \"good progress\" in the negotiations. Trump and Putin spoke over the phone Monday to advance peace negotiations to halt the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, just days after Russia and Ukraine met in Turkey to conduct their first peace talks since 2022. After the call, Trump said both countries would move toward a ceasefire and advance talks to end the war. Meanwhile, Trump has suggested continued U.S. involvement may not be a viable option moving forward, but he has been reticent about specifics on what would actually prompt him to walk away from the talks. For example, Trump said on May 8 in an interview with NBC News that he believes peace is possible but that the U.S. wouldn't act as a mediator forever. \"Well, there will be a time when I will say, 'OK, keep going, keep being stupid,\" Trump said in the interview. \"Maybe it's not possible to do,\" he said. \"There's tremendous hatred.\" Still, Trump signaled that the U.S. would take a backseat in the negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv after his call with Putin. \"The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know the details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,\" Trump said in a Monday post on Truth Social. Trump has continued to distance the U.S. from the conflict, and he later described the conflict as a \"European situation.\" \"Big egos involved, but I think something's going to happen,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. \"And if it doesn't, I'll just back away and they'll have to keep going. This was a European situation. It should have remained a European situation.\" Trump also doubled down on extracting the U.S. from the war, claiming it didn't involve U.S. personnel. \"It's not our people, it's not our soldiers … it's Ukraine and it's Russia,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday while hosting South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. TRUMP SAYS HE COULD ‘WALK AWAY’ FROM RUSSIA-UKRAINE TALKS, CITES ‘TREMENDOUS HATRED’ ON BOTH SIDES Vice President JD Vance and Foundation Council President Wolfgang Ischinger participate in a discussion at the Munich Leaders Meeting hosted by the Munich Security Conference in Washington on May 7, 2025.(Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images) According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, sanctions against Russia could ramp up in the event Russia fails to cooperate. \"President Trump has made it very clear that if President Putin does not negotiate in good faith that the United States will not hesitate to up the Russia sanctions along with our European partners,\" Bessent said Sunday in an interview with NBC. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Vance has previously said the concessions that Russia is seeking from Ukraine to end the conflict are too stringent but believes there is a viable path to peace and wants both to find common ground. \"The step that we would like to make right now is we would like both the Russians and the Ukrainians to actually agree on some basic guidelines for sitting down and talking to one another,\" Vance said at the Munich Leaders Meeting in Washington on May 7. Russia's demands include Ukraine never joining NATO and preventing foreign peacekeeper troops from deploying to Ukraine after the conflict. Russia is also seeking to adjust some of the borders that previously were Ukraine's. Diana Stancy is a politics reporter with Fox News Digital covering theWhite House.",

I'm pretty confident it could be done in 10 days. But that's up to leadership to decide,\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., told reporters. Republicans are working to enact Trump's agenda via the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party in power to pass sweeping legislation without the minority party's input by lowering the Senate's threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51. Their current multitrillion-dollar bill would advance Trump's priorities on immigration, taxes, energy, defense andthe debt limit. Meanwhile, the national debt continues to climb, surpassing $36 trillion earlier this year. NATIONAL DEBT TRACKER: AMERICAN TAXPAYERS (YOU) ARE NOW ON THE HOOK FOR $36,213,570,763,720.98 AS OF 5/20/25 The Freedom Caucus is meeting with Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., at the White House on Wednesday afternoon in a bid to resolve differences. Meanwhile, a White House official told Fox News Digital the administration wants the House to vote on the bill at some point Wednesday. House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., led his group in calling for a delay on the vote.(Getty Images) \"The One Big Beautiful Bill Act reflects the shared priorities of both Congress and the Administration. Therefore, theHouse of Representativesshould immediately pass this bill to show the American people that they are serious about ‘promises made, promises kept,'\" the new White House statement said. \"President Trump is committed to keeping his promises, and failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\" HOUSE GOP TARGETS ANOTHER DEM OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF BLOCKING ICE AMID DELANEY HALL FALLOUT The statement ended by affirming that Trump would sign the legislation into law if it got to his desk, a significant endorsement of House GOP leaders' plans. The bill itself is not yet finished, however. Republican leaders have signaled they are including additional provisions via a \"manager's amendment\" that are expected to cover Medicaid work requirements and an amended state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP House conservatives have been pushing for the bill to include more aggressive cuts to Medicaid — specifically the expanded population who became eligible under theAffordable Care Act— and a full repeal of former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and its green energy subsidies. Trump paid a rare visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, where he personally told House Republicans he wanted the bill passed as soon as possible. The Freedom Caucus, meanwhile, has insisted that it is pushing to enact Trump's campaign promises to the fullest possible extent.

    "title": "Controversial office vacant for first time in nearly a decade, but emerging secrets haunt those involved",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent David Spunt joins 'Special Report' to break down the first volume of Special Counsel Jack Smith's report and President-elect Trump's reaction. It’s the first time in nearly a decade that a special counsel is not investigating something related to a sitting or former president, but the remnants and revelations of past special counsel probes continue to break through thenews cycle. Every attorney general-appointed special counsel since 2017 has now released their reports, issued their indictments, received their verdicts, shuttered their offices, disassembled their teams and returned to their government or private sector roles. Essentially, they’ve all moved on. BIDEN INTERVIEW AUDIO REVEALS WHO BROUGHT UP BEAU'S DEATH – AND IT WASN'T HUR First, in 2017, there was Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who was investigating whether members of the first Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the2016 election. Special counsel Robert Mueller Then, in 2019, there was Special Counsel John Durham, who was investigating theoriginsof the Mueller investigation and the original FBI probe into then-candidateDonald Trumpand his campaign. Soon, it was 2022, and Special CounselJack Smithbegan investigating then-former PresidentTrumpfor his alleged improper retention of classified records held at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida after his presidency. Smith also began investigating events surrounding the 2020 election and the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Next up, in 2023,Special Counsel Robert Hurwas appointed and began investigating now-former PresidentJoe Biden’salleged improper retention of classified records, which occurred during his vice presidency as part of the Obama administration. DURHAM FINDS DOJ, FBI 'FAILED TO UPHOLD' MISSION OF 'STRICT FIDELITY TO THE LAW' IN TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE Later in 2023, David Weiss, who had served as U.S. attorney in Delaware and had been investigatingHunter Bidensince 2018, was appointed special counsel to continue his yearslong investigation into the now-former first son. At this point, those investigations have all come to their resolutions: Mueller, in 2019, found there was no collusion; Durham, in 2022, found that the FBI ignored \"clear warning signs\" of a Hillary Clinton-led plan to inaccurately tie her opponent to Russia using politically funded and uncorroborated opposition research; Smith, in 2022, charged Trump but had those charges tossed; Hur, in 2023, opted against charging Biden; Weiss, in 2023, charged Hunter Biden, who was convicted and later pardoned by his father. But the curiosity surrounding those investigations that dominated headlines for the better part of a decade remains, largely because of so many loose ends and the prevalence of unanswered questions. Special Counsel Robert Hur, left, in his report described former President Joe Biden as \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\"(Getty Images) A trickle, sometimes more like a flood, of information and news related to those probes continues to seep into the news cycle. On Friday night, audio of Biden’s interview with Hur was made public. Hur closed his investigation in 2024 without charging the then-president and infamously described him as a \"sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory.\" Some congressional lawmakers had demanded the release of the audio of Biden’s interview amid questions about the former president’s memory lapses and mental acuity. BIDEN STRUGGLES WITH WORDS, KEY MEMORIES IN LEAKED AUDIO FROM SPECIAL COUNSEL HUR INTERVIEW The audio – as expected, based on the transcript of the interview released in 2024 – showed Biden struggling with key memories, including when his son, Beau, died; when he left the vice presidency; and why he had classified documents he shouldn’t have had. In a throwback to another special counsel investigation, the United States Secret Service last week paid a visit to former FBI Director James Comey after he posted a now-deleted image on social media that many interpreted as a veiled call for an assassination of Trump. Former FBI Director James Comey(Cheriss May/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Comey on Thursday posted to Instagram an image of seashells on the beach arranged to show \"86 47\" with the caption, \"Cool shell formation on my beach walk.\" Some interpreted it as a coded message, with \"86\" being slang for \"get rid of\" and \"47\" referring to Trump, who is the 47th president. TRUMP SAYS COMEY KNEW 'ASSASSINATION' MEANING BEHIND DELETED SOCIAL MEDIA POST Comey later deleted the post and wrote a message that said, \"I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.\" Comey was the FBI director who, in 2016, allowed the opening of the bureau’s original Trump-Russia investigation, known inside the FBI as \"Crossfire Hurricane.\" Trump fired Comey in May 2017. Days later, Mueller was appointed as special counsel to take over that investigation, thus beginning the string of special counsels. Donald Trump, Robert Mueller, Hillary Clinton(AP Newsroom | Getty Images) Durham investigated the origins of the FBI probe and found that the FBI did not have any actual evidence to support the start of that investigation. Durham also found that the CIA, in 2016, received intelligence to show that Hillary Clinton had approved a plan to tie then-candidate Trump to Russia; intelligence that the FBI, led by Comey, ignored. DECLASSIFIED TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE DOCS TO DATE: WHAT TO KNOW On July 28, 2016, then-CIA Director John Brennan briefed then-President Barack Obama on a plan from one of Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisers \"to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.\" Biden, Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper were in the Brennan-Obama briefing, according to the Durham report. After that briefing, the CIA properly forwarded that information through a counterintelligence operational lead (CIOL) to Comey and then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok with the subject line \"Crossfire Hurricane.\" Fox News first obtained and reported on the CIOL in October 2020, which stated, \"The following information is provided for the exclusive use of your bureau for background investigative action or lead purposes as appropriate.\" DURHAM: FBI IGNORED 'CLEAR WARNING SIGN' OF CLINTON-LED EFFORT TO 'MANIPULATE' BUREAU FOR 'POLITICAL PURPOSES' \"Per FBI verbal request, CIA provides the below examples of information the CROSSFIRE HURRICANE fusion cell has gleaned to date,\" the memo continued. \"An exchange (REDACTED) discussing US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s approval of a plan concerning US presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering US elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.\" Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton are shown after their presidential debate on Sept. 26, 2016.(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) By January 2017, Comey had notified Trump of a dossier, known as the Steele dossier, that contained salacious and unverified allegations about Trump’s purported coordination with the Russian government, a key document prompting the opening of the probe. The dossier was authored by Christopher Steele, an ex-British intelligence officer, and commissioned by Fusion GPS. Clinton's presidential campaign hired Fusion GPS during the 2016 election cycle. DOJ RECOMMENDED AGAINST TRUMP PROSECUTION ON OBSTRUCTION IN MUELLER PROBE: NEWLY RELEASED 2019 MEMO REVEALS It was eventually determined that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee funded the dossier through the law firm Perkins Coie. Durham, in his report, said the FBI, led by Comey, \"failed to act on what should have been – when combined with other incontrovertible facts – a clear warning sign that the FBI might then be the target of an effort to manipulate or influence the law enforcement process for political purposes during the 2016 presidential election.\" But that intelligence referral document is just one of many that tells the real story behind the investigation that clouded the first Trump administration. And Trump has taken steps to ensure the American public has full access to all the documents. Trump, in late March, signed an executive order directing the FBI to immediately declassify files concerning the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. Special Counsel John Durham indicated the Department of Justice and FBI \"failed to uphold their mission of strict fidelity to the law\" when it launched the Trump-Russia investigation.(Ron Sachs/Consolidated News Pictures/Getty Images) The FBI is expected to release those documents in the coming weeks. As for the other special counsels, Smith recently had his own moment in the news cycle. FLASHBACK: DURHAM TESTIFIES THAT THE FBI IGNORED HILLARY CLINTON PLAN TO LINK TRUMP TO RUSSIA FBI Director Kash Patel on Thursday disbanded a public corruption squad in the bureau’s Washington field office. That was the same office that aided Smith’s investigation into Trump. As for Weiss, after the release of the Biden audio tapes calling further into question the former president’s mental acuity, some, including Trump, are now calling for a review of the pardon of Hunter Biden. David Weiss, inset; former President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden(Fox News) Hunter Bidenwas found guilty of three felony firearm offenses stemming from Weiss’ investigation. The first son was also charged with federal tax crimes regarding the failure to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes. Before his trial, Hunter Biden entered a surprise guilty plea. The charges carried up to 17 years behind bars. His sentencing was scheduled for Dec. 16, 2024, but his father, then-President Biden, pardoned him on all charges in December 2024. HUNTER BIDEN: A LOOK AT HOW THE SAGA SPANNING OVER 6 YEARS UNFOLDED Trump alleged in a Truth Social post in March that former President Biden's pardons were \"void\" due to the \"fact that they were done by Autopen.\" \"The 'Pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,\" Trump wrote. \"In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them! The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden. He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime,\" Trump added. Weiss, in his final report, blasted then-President Biden's characterizations of the probe into Hunter Biden, which Weiss said were \"wrong\" and \"unfairly\" maligned Justice Department officials. He also said the presidential pardon made it \"inappropriate\" for him to discuss whether any additional charges against the first son were warranted.

    "title": "Trump unveils ‘Golden Dome’ missile shield, blindsides key senators",
    "article_text": "Chuck DeVore, expert at Texas Public Policy Foundation, argued a decreased cost to orbit made it less expensive to defend against nuclear missiles than to build a bigger nuclear arsenal, with Golden Dome changing the game of homeland defenses. Before PresidentDonald Trump’sdramatic reveal of the \"Golden Dome\" missile defense project on Tuesday, the proposal wasn’t even on the radar of many lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Several senators told Fox News Digital they had received no briefing on the initiative’s costs – and some hadn’t heard of it at all. \"I don’t support blank checks. I haven’t seen the cost figures,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told Fox News Digital. Two senior members of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, one Republican and one Democrat, asked, \"what’s Golden Dome?\" in response to questions about the projectTrump commissioned in January. CHINA ACCUSES US OF 'TURNING SPACE INTO A WARZONE' WITH TRUMP'S GOLDEN DOME MISSILE DEFENSE PROJECT Trump has floated a $125 billion estimate and says it could be completed in three years by the end of his term.(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque ) Trump’s sweeping plan – pitched as an American version of Israel’s Iron Dome – carries an ambitious price tag and timeline. He’s floated a$125 billion estimated costand says it could be built in three years, by the end of his term. A government funding package moving through Congress, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, includes $25 billion to jumpstart the project. But defense experts and even some Republican allies anticipate the cost to be much higher. \"This is not going to be a $25 billion or $35 billion project. It will likely cost in the trillions if and when Golden Dome is completed,\" said Sen. Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., who announced plans to form a Golden Dome Caucus during a recent Washington Times defense industry event earlier this month. Sheehy warned that simply scaling up Israel’s Iron Dome to protect the U.S. is \"a fundamentally different technological proposition.\" \"The challenges don’t scale linearly with the size of Israel, which is the size of New Jersey,\" he added. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated the project could cost around $500 billion – though some believe even that figure is likely too low. CBO estimated that the space-based interceptors portion of the dome could cost at least $161 billion but up to $542 billion. But it didn't account for any ground-based interceptors in that cost. \"I’ve been 34 years in this business, and I’ve never seen an early estimate that was too high,\" said Space Force chief of space operations Gen. Chance Saltzman. \"We don’t always understand the full level of complexity until you’re actually in execution, doing the detailed planning.\" LASERS, SPACE RADARS, MISSILE INTERCEPTORS: DEFENSE LEADERS LAY OUT VISION FOR TRUMP'S 'GOLDEN DOME' PROJECT Digitized concept design of Golden Dome demonstrates how the shield would utilize space-based interceptors to stop a missile.(Lockheed Martin) Some Republican lawmakers suggest the potential benefits outweigh the massive spending required. \"It might very well prevent a war,\" Sen. Mike Rounds, R-N.D., said. \"When we talk about spending billions on defense, that is small compared to one single major war – not only in trillions of dollars, but in bloodshed.\" Once a missile is launched toward the U.S. homeland, the Golden Dome system aims to detect it, and orbital systems would aim to hit the missile during its \"boost\" phase, either with a laser or a kinetic interceptor. Otherwise, ground-based systems could deploy to knock it off its path. Others noted competing defense priorities. \"That’s gonna be a long, drawn-out process, and it’s gonna cost a lot of money,\" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala. \"Right now, we’re redoing our missile silos… we’re transitioning to different types of warfare. If we’re gonna do [Golden Dome], we do it the right way.\" Supporters of the plan argue that technological advances have dramatically lowered the cost of missile defense, enough to potentially flip decades-old strategic assumptions. Chuck DeVore, a defense expert at the Texas Public Policy Foundation and former Reagan administration official, said the old logic – that it’s always cheaper to build offensive missiles than defenses – may no longer apply. Golden Dome aims to protect against adversaries' missiles, like this North Korean test ICBM above.(KCNA via REUTERS  ) \"That calculation is changing now,\" DeVore said. \"With low-cost orbital launches and inexpensive electronics, it may actually be less expensive to defend against nuclear missiles than to build them. If that’s the case, we’re at a truly revolutionary inflection point.\" DeVore also warned that traditionalists in the defense establishment may push back. \"You’re going to see people defending the status quo,\" he said. \"They’ll say we need that money for more conventional defense – more divisions, more jet fighters, maybe another aircraft carrier.\" Still, DeVore argued that a homeland missile defense system is overdue. \"The ability to truly defend the homeland and save American lives is better than mutual assured destruction – especially in an age of nuclear proliferation where we can’t always be sure where the threat is coming from.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., agreed on the project’s importance, even as he said he hadn’t been briefed on the cost and needs of the project. \"I think it’s the most important thing we could do to keep our homeland safe.\"",

    "article_text": "Former GOP Sen. Cory Gardner and former DNC official Jose Aristimuno weigh in after President Donald Trump accused members of the previous administration of \"treason at the highest level\" for covering up former President Joe Biden's mental decline. EXCLUSIVE:Bombshell developments continue to emerge about former PresidentJoe Biden’s declining health along with allegations of a White House cover-up. In response, a top Republican is urging the Justice Department to investigate whether any laws were broken in how Biden’s condition was presented to the public. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas is expected to write Wednesday afternoon to Attorney General Pam Bondi demanding that the DOJ open a probe into \"any potential violations of federal law surrounding the representations made to the American people about the health and wellbeing (sic) ofthen-President Biden.\" In the letter obtained by Fox News Digital, Cornyn cited the May 18 report from Biden’s camp that he is battling late-stage aggressive prostate cancer that had metastasized to his bones. \"This announcement follows the publication of news reports calling into question the former president’s capacity and awareness during his time in office,\" Cornyn said as other Biden critics questioned what then-White House physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor knew while treating the president. TEXAS LAWMAKERS SEEK TO GET FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR BIDEN ERA BORDER CONTROL EXPENSES Former President Joe Biden and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas(Getty) In the letter, Cornyn expressed concern that Biden’s \"associates,\" including O’Connor, misrepresented or made \"material omissions\" to the public about his mental and physical fitness. Conservatives beat the drum of Biden’s alleged senility for years but were often lambasted by the mainstream media for questioning the White House’s line on the matter. \"I fear the American people were deliberately misled about President Biden’s health. Instead of providing full transparency, which is the obligation of the commander-in-chief, important information was kept secret,\" Cornyn wrote. \"I do not have confidence in the former president’s aides and staff, including medical staff, or their ability to be honest and straightforward about President Biden’s cancer diagnosis.\" ARIZONA KAMALA HARRIS RALLY SPEAKERS COURT ‘JOHN MCCAIN REPUBLICANS’ He noted how PresidentDonald Trumpassented to calls that he take a cognitive test to demonstrate fitness for office while contrasting that with Biden's refusal, which famously resulted in a tense exchange with a CBS News correspondent when the then-president asked, \"Why the hell should I take a test?\" and asked if the Black news anchor was \"a junkie\" who might want to undergo a test for cocaine in his system. Cornyn contrasted White House claims that Biden was \"fit for duty\" with revelations, including those in aCNN anchor’s new book, that he was only capable of working \"four to six good hours\" per day. \"These positions are in direct conflict,\" Cornyn will tell Bondi, adding that despite having the world’s best medical care at his fingertips, Americans have been asked to \"accept coincidence after coincidence\" involving his health. He also cited the 25th Amendment, which he noted provides Americans an insurance policy that their government can continue to function if the infirmity or death of a president should occur. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"These actions potentially impacted the trust the American people have in their government and weakened us on the world stage.\" He cited a report from earlier this week that White House staff had secretly discussed the possibility that Biden would be confined to a wheelchair while still putting on a brave face to the public. Former President Franklin Roosevelt, stricken by polio, conducted the nation’s business from a wheelchair. \"I encourage the Department to conduct a full investigation and ensure that no federal laws were violated during the previous administration,\" Cornyn concluded.

    "article_text": "Buildings are flattened in Mandalay, Burma's second-largest city, after a 7.7 magnitude earthquake. (Credit: Reuters/Myanmar Fire Services Department via Facebook) An underwater volcano off theOregon coastcould erupt late this year, scientists say. The volcano, known as Axial Seamount, is more than 4,900 feet beneath the Pacific Ocean and 300 miles off the Oregon coast, but it is showing signs it will soon erupt for the first time since 2015. The volcano is formed by a hot spot, an area in the Earth’s mantle where hot plumes of molten material rise upward into the crust, theUniversity of Washington'sCollege of the Environment said in an April blog post. As the crust moves over the top of the mantle, the hot spot stays put, which results in long chains of volcanoes over time.

An eruption at Axial Seamount also has nothing to do with seismic activity on land, so Pacific Northwesterners don’t need to worry about this event triggering a major earthquake or tsunami,\" the blog post states.

If what we learned in 2015 is correct, I would expect to see more than 2,000 per day for a few months before the eruption.\" The quakes will be caused by magma moving toward the surface, the post states.

    "article_text": "Robert Hopkins Jr., MD, medical director of NFID in Maryland, spoke to Fox News Digital about what Americans are doing wrong when it comes to handwashing. Proper handwashingcould save a million lives a year, according to an expert — and yet many people are doing it improperly, often due to misconceptions surrounding the practice. Doctors recommend washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to reduce the spread ofinfectious diseases. The NFID 2025 State of Handwashing Report, recently released by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, provides details on Americans' handwashing habits (and mistakes). WHY YOUR LAUNDRY COULD BE MAKING YOU SICK AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT The report is based on a survey of 3,587 U.S. adults, conducted in November and December 2024 and March 2025. Robert Hopkins Jr., MD, medical director of NFID in Maryland, spoke to Fox News Digital about what Americans are doing wrong when it comes to handwashing. \"We have to recognize that there are a number of important infections that hand sanitizers are not effective at preventing,\" Hopkins said. Proper handwashing could save a million lives a year, according to experts.(iStock) One example is norovirus, a highly contagiousstomach virusthat is common on cruise ships and is also spread seasonally. The virus cannot be killed with hand sanitizer, but is \"easily destroyed\" with soap and water, according to Hopkins. A COMMON KILLER BUG IS ENDANGERING AMERICANS: ‘PANDEMIC IN PLAIN SIGHT’ Certain virusesare \"encapsulated\" and can be destroyed with either soap and water or hand sanitizer, the expert said. However, there is also an \"unencapsulated\" type of virus, which has an outer coat that does not break down from the alcohol in hand sanitizer. Using soap and water is a more effective way to kill the germs, the doctor noted. When peoplecough or sneezeinto their sleeve, they could still spread germs afterward. \"If you cough into your sleeve … go ahead and wash your hands with soap and water as well,\" Hopkins advised. COMMON MEDICAL TEST LINKED TO 5% OF CANCERS, STUDY SUGGESTS: ‘USE THEM WISELY’ \"We also have to recognize that we often bring our hands up close to our face, touch our nose, our glasses, other parts of our face,\" noted the doctor, who is based in Arkansas. \"If we havebacteria or viruseson our hands, we can introduce them into our mucous membranes, where we can get infections.\" Nearly half of survey respondents admitted to forgetting or choosing not to wash their hands at key times.(iStock) The NFID report stated that one in four respondents washed their hands more frequently in the fall and winter, whencold and fluare prevalent. \"The seasonal variance is understandable given that some respiratory diseases, including flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), tend to peak during fall and winter,\" the report stated.

    "title": "Brain cancer patients who received this pain medication lived longer, study shows",
    "article_text": "Emma Dimery, a Minnesota woman who had stage 4 colon cancer, shares how an experimental trial led by Dr. Emil Lou at the University of Minnesota saved her life. The patient and doctor both discuss. Glioblastoma, the most aggressive and deadly type ofbrain cancer, is known to have a very poor prognosis — but a new study suggests that a pain-relieving drug could extend survival. Researchers at Mass General Brigham have found that analready-approved medication— a pain reliever and anti-seizure medication called gabapentin — has been linked to improved survival in patients with glioblastoma. The findings were published in Nature Communications last week. MICHAEL BOLTON HAD STRANGE SYMPTOMS BEFORE BRAIN CANCER DIAGNOSIS: ‘SOMETHING’S WRONG’ Inspired by previousmouse studiesthat showed gabapentin’s potential in targeting tumors, the researchers studied the medical outcomes of nearly 700 patients with glioblastoma. Many of them had already been taking gabapentin to alleviate nerve pain, according to a press release from MGB. Glioblastoma, the most aggressive and deadly type of brain cancer, is known to have a very poor prognosis — but a new study suggests that a pain-relieving drug could extend survival.(iStock) The patients who were taking the drug survived four months longer than those who were not — 16 months compared to 12 months — which was described as \"statistically significant.\" \"Ultimately, our goal was to highlight the emerging role of cancer neuroscience in GBM progression and emphasize the importance of exploring creative strategies to therapeutically target this evolving neural-tumor axis,\" lead author Joshua Bernstock, MD, PhD, a clinical fellow in the Department of Neurosurgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital, told Fox News Digital. BREAST CANCER DRUG COULD HELP PROLONG SURVIVAL FOR CHILDREN WITH BRAIN TUMORS, STUDY FINDS The team was surprised by the survival benefit, Bernstock noted. \"It’s always incredible to see a hypothesis come to life,\" he said. \"I was also really pleased to see the decrease in serum TSP-1 levels in the UCSF cohort, potentially positioning it as a biomarker of response.\" A pain reliever and anti-seizure medication called gabapentin has been linked to improved survival in patients with glioblastoma.(iStock) Based on the initial findings, Bernstock reached out to researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) to study more glioblastoma patients. Among the 379 patients at USCF, the same outcome was observed — the ones who were taking gabapentin lived 20.8 months on average, compared to 14.7 months for those not taking the drug. \"There have been very few advances in survival for GBM patients since the early 2000s.\" \"Across both cohorts (1,072 patients total), gabapentin use was consistently associated with a statistically significantimprovement in survival,\" Bernstock told Fox News Digital. The researchers also noticed that the gabapentin group had lower levels of a protein called TSP-1, which is found in the blood serum, a finding that \"needs further investigation.\" Glioblastoma claims the lives of around 14,500 Americans each year. The five-year survival rate is just 6.9%.(iStock) \"There have been very few advances in survival for GBM patients since the early 2000s,\" Bernstock said in the release. \"We need to think more creatively about theemerging biologyin these tumors and how to target them.\" The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initially approved gabapentin in December 1993 to treat seizure activity in adults; the approval was extended to include children in 2000. Two years later, the agency approved gabapentin fornerve pain following shingles, according to the agency. The drug is often prescribed for off-label use to treat a range of pain conditions, studies show. The drug is often prescribed for off-label use to treat a range of pain conditions, studies show.(iStock) Some of the more common side effects of gabapentin include fatigue, headache, dizziness, fever, nausea and vomiting, memory loss, trouble speaking, weight gain,vision problems, movement problems and recurring infections, according to Cleveland Clinic. Certain medications may interact with gabapentin. Patients should speak with a doctor if they experience severe or persistent side effects, experts recommend. The study did have some limitations, chiefly that it is retrospective and was not controlled. \"While the findings are promising, the study is retrospective — patients were not given gabapentin in a controlled, randomized manner to directly assess its effects,\" Bernstock told Fox News Digital. \"As such, larger prospectiveclinical trialsare needed to validate these results and to further investigate the role of gabapentin and TSP-1 in GBM progression.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Bernstock said he is \"cautiously optimistic\" by the findings. \"While gabapentin is FDA-approved and generally well-tolerated, it's not appropriate to change clinical practice based on these findings alone without a controlled study, something our collaborators at UCSF are working on,\" he said. \"It's not appropriate to change clinical practice based on these findings alone without a controlled study.\" \"That said, in GBM patients who develop neuropathic pain or seizures post-craniotomy, there may be a rationale to consider gabapentin more readily than other agents.\" For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health Glioblastoma — described by Bernstock as \"a relentlessly progressive and nearly universally fatal disease\" — is the most common type ofprimary brain cancer, according to Mayo Clinic.

She asked that I remove Ms. Hudson from the premises, to which I responded that I would speak with Ms. Hudson after contacting Dreamland executive director Alicia Carney to discuss the matter.\" \"It was very uncomfortable. There was a lot being exchanged between them. It was very aggressive behavior,\" a source familiar with the situation told People. \"Jordon never approached anyone, but she was approached the entire night, with people asking, ‘Oh, why are you here?'\" Security footage then showed Holliday confronting Hudson in the middle of the dance floor, surrounded by roughly 200 people.

    "title": "California girls' track athlete opens up on losing 1st-place title to trans competitor",
    "article_text": "High school athlete Katie McGuinness joins 'America Reports' to discuss placing second in a long jump event while competing against a transgender athlete. A high schooltrack meetin Southern California became the latest flashpoint in the state's ongoing conflict with President Donald Trump's administration over trans athletes in girls' sports. There, multiple girls' competitors fell shy of first place to a biologically male trans athlete. The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Southern Section Final on Saturday saw the trans athlete take first place in the triple jump and long jump. The second-place finisher in the long jump was Katie McGuinness of La Canada High School. McGuinness recounted the experience of losing to the trans athlete in an interview on Fox News'\"America Reports.\" \"I remember thinking to myself, ‘OK, I need to get a big jump,’\" McGuinness said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Katie McGuinness of La Canada High School finished seventh in the girls' high jump event at Arcadia High School in California on April 12, 2025.(Keith Birmingham/MediaNews Group/Pasadena Star-News via Getty Images) \"I ran down the runway and I landed and I watched them measure my mark, and it was 18.9,\" she said. \"And I just remember thinking that there was nothing else that I could do. That was it. And I was honestly very discouraged, and I'm a high school senior and winning CIF has always been a goal of mine, and I wasn't able to compete with someone who was genetically different than me.\" McGuinness made her overall stance on the issue clear. \"There are just certain genetic advantages that biological males have that biological girls don't,\" she said. \"Frankly, I just can't stand for that.\" The second-place finisher to the trans athlete in triple jump, Reese Hogan of Crean Lutheran High School, made it a point to stand on the first-place podium spot for a quick and symbolic photo op. Footage of Hogan taking the top podium spot after the trans athlete stepped off went viral on social media over the weekend. Hogan had just competed against the trans athlete in the prelims a week earlier. At that event, Hogan also came in behind the trans athlete in the triple jump, finishing third, and would have placed one spot higher were it not for the trans athlete. But Hogan did finish ahead of the trans athlete in the high jump. \"It's just kind of sad just watching. He's obviously a really talented athlete, we've all seen him jump and stuff, and I wish him the best of luck, but in a boys' division,\" Hogan previously told Fox News Digital about competing against the athlete. \"It's pretty obvious the certain advantages that he has, and it's obviously just sad as a woman to watch that.\" TEEN GIRLS OPEN UP ON TRANS-ATHLETE SCANDAL THAT TURNED THEIR HIGH SCHOOL INTO CULTURE WAR BATTLEGROUND Spectators wear Protect Girls Sports shirts during the CIF Southern Section Division 3 Track and Field preliminaries at Nathan Shapell Memorial Stadium at Yorba Linda High School on May 10, 2025, in California.(Kirby Lee/Getty Images) Hogan also spoke at a press conference to protest the trans athlete at the prelims and wore a shirt that read, \"Protect Girls Sports.\" \"It was nothing against the athlete itself, it was just an issue of fairness,\" Hogan previously said. \"Nothing that we can do, no amount of training, no amount of hours that we put in, we could never achieve the same amount of advantages that a man can have.\" The CIF track and field postseason has been overshadowed by the controversy involving the trans athlete, garnering national scrutiny against the CIF and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. A U.S. Department of Education spokesperson sent a warning to the state in the days leading up to the CIF Southern Section final, referencingprevious reportsthat CIF officials made competitors remove their Protect Girls Sports shirts. \"CIF’s and Jurupa Valley High School’s apparent flouting of federal civil rights law by allowing a male athlete to compete in a female California track and field [Southern Sectional Division 3 final] this Saturday, and the alleged retaliation against the girls who are protesting this, is indefensible,\" Julie Hartman, a Department of Education spokesperson, told Fox News Digital. The CIF is already under a federal Title IX investigation over the state's trans-inclusion practices. The U.S. Department of Education launched an investigation against CIF in February after President Donald Trump signed the Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports executive order. The CIF was one of the first high school sports leagues in the country to announce it would defy the order. Newsom, in a February episode of his podcast, said he believes trans athletes competing in girls' sports is \"deeply unfair\" but has not taken any steps as governor to change the state's policies. The state has had a law in place that allows trans athletes to compete with females since 2014. \"California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who, in a startling moment of moral clarity, recently remarked that it was ‘deeply unfair’ for men to compete in women’s sports,\" Hartman continued. \"Where is Gov. Newsom now? With or without the governor, the Trump administration’s Department of Education’s commitment is unwavering: We will not allow institutions to trample upon women’s civil rights. OCR’s (Office of Civil Rights) investigation into CIF continues with vigor.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The trans athlete represents Jurupa Valley High School. The Jurupa Unified School District provided a statement to Fox News Digital in response to the Department of Education's statement. \"JUSD continues to follow both California law and CIF policy regarding school athletics. Both state law and CIF policy currently require that students be permitted to participate in athletic teams and competitions consistent with their gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil's records. JUSD remains committed to protecting the rights and safety of the students we serve, in accordance with applicable state and federal laws,\" the statement reads.

    "article_text": "Awake Illinois founder Shannon Adcock joins 'America Reports' to discuss the debate over transgender athletes in girls' sports after female track runners were defeated by a biological male. Tensions are mounting over trans athletes ingirls' sports in Illinois, as the state continues to allow males to compete against and beat out females in sports across the state. A youth track meet became the focus of national controversy after a biological male competed in the seventh-grade competition against girls at the Naper Prairie Conference Meet last Wednesday. The incident prompted a series of heated debates, which went viral on social media, at the Naperville 203 Community School District Board meeting on Monday. Now, Illinoisans are speaking out, calling for PresidentDonald Trumpto crack down on the state and Gov. J.B. Pritzker to protect girls' sports. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., has addressed a second letter to the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice asking for federal intervention into the issue. Miller previously sent a letter in April and is now doubling-down on her pleas for the Trump administration to step in. Miller's latest letter asks U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Education Secretary Linda McMahon to specifically look into the Naperville incident and consider pulling federal funding from the state, as seen in a copy obtained by Fox News Digital. \"The Illinois Governor has made our beautiful state unfair and unsafe for women and girls by allowing men to compete in their sports and to use their showers and locker rooms. It is my strong opinion that any school district that allows these actions to continue should have its federal funds reviewed immediately for revocation,\" Miller wrote.  \"Ultimately, it is my understanding that violations of Title IX may have taken place at this track and field meet, and I write to bring this grave incident to your attention.\" Illinois GOP state Rep. Blaine Wilhour is also calling for a federal investigation and potential consequences in the wake of the Naperville incident. \"President Trump should freeze every penny of federal dollars until these schools come to their senses and do right by these kids,\" Wilhour told Fox News Digital. \"Either you believe in fairness, biological reality and common sense, or you don’t. This is not fair competition and Naperville 203 is engaged in what I consider abusive and illegal practices in violation of title 9. Wake up people, these are Jr. High kids being exploited and used as political pawns, and it’s disgusting.\" TEEN GIRLS OPEN UP ON TRANS ATHLETE SCANDAL THAT TURNED THEIR HIGH SCHOOL INTO A CULTURE WAR BATTLEGROUND Illinois Rep. Mary Miller gives remarks after receiving an endorsement during a Save America Rally with then-former President Donald Trump at the Adams County Fairgrounds on June 25, 2022 in Mendon, Illinois.(Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images) Wilhour was previously a leader in putting pressure on the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) to comply with Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order that was signed on Feb. 5. However, the state's Democrat leaders ensured the IHSA defied Trump on the issue. In a public letter to Wilhour and other state GOP lawmakers, the IHSA said Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the Illinois Department of Human Rights have declared that state law requires that transgender athletes be allowed to participate based on gender identity. So girls around the state and their families have had to continue sharing teams and locker rooms with biological males, as they have since 2006. Even Chicago Bears legendBrian Urlacherhas spoken out on the issue while his home state is ravaged by controversy. \"It's just different because we are men, there are certain things we do better than women, and it's just, number one, it's not fair, and if I had a daughter who had to be forced to play against a man, I would not be okay with it and I would raise hell about it,\" Urlacher said during an interview on the\"Global View\" podcaston May 9. \"I just don't get it, it's a common sense thing, I just don't see how you can push this and make someone thing they're a different sex.\" Currently, there is one federal Title IX probe in Illinois regarding transgenders impeding on female spaces, but it is only against one school. Deerfield Public Schools District 109 is facing a probe by the U.S.Department of Education'sOffice of Civil Rights after middle school girls were allegedly forced by school administrators to change in front of a trans student in the girls' locker room.

Now, Georgas is looking for more action to be taken as the issue continues to plague girls' sports in Illinois and hopes the recent Naperville incident will be a turning point. She is pleading for the president's administration to bring more pressure to Illinois on the issue. \"The tides are going to turn after this. We as the parents have had enough,\" Georgas told Fox News Digital. \"We are at the forefront, we are in the crosshairs and we need help. We need help right now.

The Eagles have had the most success with the play over the last few years, and Kelce’s input was apparently enough for owners to forgo approving the ban. The Packers'official rule change proposalwould have prohibited \"an offensive player from pushing a teammate who was lined up directly behind the snapper and receives the snap, immediately at the snap.\" The proposal added that a penalty would be assessed on any offensive player who violated the rule.

However, he'll be starting from the 11th and final row of the grid alongside his teammate Will Power after both drivers' cars failed pre-qualifying inspection.

    "article_text": "Dr. Josef Wegner, Penn Museum curator who is based in Philadelphia, recently uncovered a groundbreaking discovery: an unknown pharaoh's tomb, dating back 3,600 years. (Credit: Josef Wegner for the Penn Museum) Ancient \"propaganda\" that was used to support the Egyptian pharaoh who is believed to be a major character of theOld Testamenthas been spotted in Paris, according to an expert. Jean-Guillaume Olette-Pelletier, an Egyptologist from Paris-Sorbonne University and Institut Catholique de Paris, recently spoke with Fox News Digital about his findings, which are set to be published in the coming months. The expert found the propaganda, which is supportive of Ramesses II, on the 3,300-year-old obelisk that sits in Paris' Place de la Concorde. Olette-Pelletier saw the obelisk up close in 2021 after receiving permission to climb scaffolding to conduct research. ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER TOMB OF EGYPTIAN ROYALTY BEHIND FALSE DOOR: 'UNVEILS NEW SECRETS' Ramesses II, who was born in 1303 B.C. and died in 1213 B.C., is considered one of the most influential and powerful Egyptian rulers of the New Kingdom. The Egyptian monarch is often cited as the most likely candidate for the pharaoh mentioned in Exodus, though an explicit name was never given inthe Old Testament. The pharaoh is said to have retaliated against Moses and refused his requests in Exodus — resulting in a series of plagues. Olette-Pelletier identified seven cryptographies, or codes, which assert Ramesses II's authority from 1280 B.C. on.(Jean-Guillaume Olette-Pelletier) Olette-Pelletier called the pro-Ramesses hieroglyphs \"propaganda.\" He identified seven cryptographies, or codes, which assert Ramesses II's authority from 1280 B.C. on. \"It was a message from Ramesses II to the nobility,\" the expert said, notingthe Egyptian nobilitywere able to read the codes. ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER LONG-LOST TOMB OF UNKNOWN PHARAOH IN EGYPT Olette-Pelletier said Ramesses II was born before his father Seti I became pharaoh – and therefore was not conceived by the gods. Not being of divine essence could have hampered his legitimacy to the throne. \"The nobility, able to read cryptographies, might be tempted by an overthrow of power since Ramesses II was not born of theogamy and therefore not divine by birth,\" Olette-Pelletier said. The codes allegedly reveal Ramesses II's efforts to assert his divine authority and avert a coup.(Jean-Guillaume Olette-Pelletier) The expert added, \"[Ramesses II] spent the first two years of his reign emphasizing his divinity with his wife Nefertari by paying homage atEgypt's great shrines, and by buying priests.\" \"In the process, he changed his name from Usermaatra to Usermaatra Setepenra, [which means] ‘chosen of Ra.’\" For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle The obelisk has four sides, and Olette-Pelletier noted that the side that faces the Seine (and was intended to face the Nile) shows Ramesses II \"wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt.\" The expert also said that Ramesses II \"underlined his divine knowledge\" by using codes to convey the swaying messages. Egyptologist Jean-Guillaume Olette-Pelletier uncovered the pro-Ramesses II hieroglyphs on Paris' obelisk.(Jean-Guillaume Olette-Pelletier) \"The obelisk also contains hidden texts that show the nobility that he is a legitimate and divine king, thus averting a possible coup d'état,\" Olette-Pelletier said. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER \"So, indeed, these are propaganda texts.\" The cryptographies also claim that Ramesses II was the \"provider of the Nile flood and thus of the country's wealth,\" according to Olette-Pelletier.

    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses tips on how to protect your data amid AI privacy concerns and Ford filing a patent to bring the stick shift to electric vehicles. Removing your personal information from people-search sites can feel pretty overwhelming. There are hundreds of these sites in the U.S. alone. In fact, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse says there are over 500 companies that collect and sell personal information. At first, it might seem impossible to get your details removed from all of them. But here's the good news: You don't need to tackle every single site. Your information isn't on all 500-plus sites. With a bit of time and persistence, you can remove your info from the major ones, and every removal really counts. Let me show you exactly how to do it yourself. JOIN THE FREE \"CYBERGUY REPORT\": GET MY EXPERT TECH TIPS, CRITICAL SECURITY ALERTS AND EXCLUSIVE DEALS, PLUS INSTANT ACCESS TO MY FREE \"ULTIMATE SCAM SURVIVAL GUIDE\" WHEN YOU SIGN UP! A woman scrolling on her laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The process will be easier if you have a list of people-search sites that have your personal information. Not only can you check them off as you go, but you'll also need a list for the last step. The easiest place to start is with afree scan that some data removal servicesprovide. These scans automatically check a ton of people-search sites for your personal information and send you a report. You can also search for your full name on Google. This will probably bring up a mix of results, including your social media profiles. THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR DATA YOURSELF? HERE'S WHY YOU'RE PROBABLY WRONG The bigger your online presence, the more search results you'll likely have to sift through to find the people-search sites. I recommend searching for your name together with other personal details, like your email, phone number or home address. For some reason, this is more likely to bring up people-search sites, different ones depending on the combination of personal details you try. You may not be able to find all the people-search sites that have your info like this, though. You should also check any state-specific people-search sites, likeStateofFlorida.com, and search all of the most popular people-search sites like: Keep in mind that many smaller or niche sites exist, especially those that are state or region-specific. These sites can be harder to find but may still have your information. Using scanning tools ordata removal servicescan help uncover these less obvious listings. Every people-search site has its own opt-out process, but most of them will require you to do something like this: TOP 20 APPS TRACKING YOU EVERY DAY Many sites require email verification. Using your regular email can expose it to spam or further data collection. Creating a dedicated or alias email address just for these requests helps protect your primary inbox and keeps things organized. Also, using various email aliases makes it so you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach. An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.See my review of the best secure and private email services here. A woman working on her laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) If a site requires phone verification, consider using a secondary number to avoid exposing your personal phone number. Services likeGoogle Voicecan provide you with a secondary number that you can use for online activities, keeping your primary number private. The process should take between five and 20 minutes for each site on your list, depending on how difficult they make it for you. But once you submit the request, removal is usually pretty quick. Your information should be off the site within 24 hours to a week, though it can sometimes take up to 30 days. People-search sites aren't the only places your info can pop up. Sometimes your personal info appears directly in Google search results, pulled from public records or other sites. If you find sensitive info inGoogle results, you can request removal through Google's own removal tools, especially if the info includes things like your Social Security number, bank account info or images you don't want to be public. This is a separate process, but it is worth doing alongside removing info from people-search sites. Google Search image(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK Even after you remove your info, there's a good chance it'll show up again. People-search sites constantly scrape public records and other databases to refresh their listings. Some sites offer \"suppression lists\" you can add your name to, but it's not a perfect system. Small changes, like a slightly different address, a new phone number or a missing middle name, can slip past their filters and pop up as a \"new\" profile. The best way to stay on top of it is to set a reminder to recheck the main people-search sites every few months and repeat the opt-out process when needed. Maintaining a detailed tracker or spreadsheet with the sites you've contacted, dates and confirmation info can make this easier and help you avoid missing any sites. A woman working on her laptop and scrolling on her phone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO GET RID OF ROBOCALLS WITH APPS AND DATA REMOVAL SERVICES There is still no federal data privacy law in the U.S. that grants everyone the automatic right to opt out of people-search sites. However, the landscape is changing quickly at the state level. As of 2025, at least thirteen states have passed comprehensive privacy laws that give residents stronger opt-out rights, including: If you live in one of these states, you now have a much stronger legal footing to demand that people-search sites remove your information. Many of these laws require companies to honor requests to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal data, and some even require businesses to respect browser-based global opt-out signals. But even if you don't live in one of these states, you should still submit removal requests. Most people-search sites do not filter opt-out requests by state; they generally process any request they receive to avoid potential legal issues, regardless of your location. Removing your data manually takes real time and commitment, especially since you have to keep doing it to stay off these sites. That's why many people turn to personal data removal services. Instead of going site by site yourself, a service can automatically send removal requests on your behalf, track the responses and re-request removals if your data reappears later. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. Manual removal is free and gives you full control, but it takes time and requires ongoing effort. Automated services cost money but save you time, handle rechecks and can catch new listings faster. Choose what best fits your budget and privacy needs. If you follow these steps and stay consistent, you can take back control of your personal information online. It might take some work, but every removal counts toward protecting your privacy.

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen says it is fair to ask who was really running the country over the past four years on 'America Reports.' When history gazes back upon thepresidency of Joseph Robinette Biden, one question will stand out: Who was really running the country? Because it certainly wasn’t the so-called commander in chief. But perhaps, it wasn’t really a question of who. Maybe we were governed by something much closer to an invisible hand of wokeness. Maybe we were governed by a twisted worldview, not a conspiracy or solitary figure. WHY WE MUST EXPOSE THE CRIMINAL FRAUD OF THOSE BEHIND BIDEN'S DISASTROUS PRESIDENCY It is reasonable, and almost comforting, to believe that Barack Obama or some other Democrat luminary was sitting at the center of the political universe like Vishnu, myriad arms pulling levers and flicking switches. But the reality might be far more troubling. The reality might be that progressive politics have created a self-perpetuating deep state bureaucracy that, left unchecked, couldn’t care less who sits behind the Resolute Desk. President Biden faced intense calls for him to step aside following a disastrous debate performance.(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) There are ahandful of behind-the-scenes power brokers, hiding from public view of late, who clearly had a lot of sway in the Biden White House: Chief of Staff Jeff Zeints, longtime ally Mike Donilon, Senior Adviser Anita Dunn, and the ever-present Susan Rice. But in all likelihood, they were not running some textbook conspiracy theory to rule in Biden’s name. In fact, the entire Biden administration looks more like a broken play in football; It really was just trying to stay on its feet. It is telling that the front-facing cabinet members of Biden’s, unlike his hotshot behind-the-scenes team, were feckless, awful and never fired for anything. Watching our current Secretary of State Marco Rubio cross swords with Democrats in his Senate testimony this week couldn’t help but remind us of someone like hapless Biden Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, sitting in those same rooms, like a scolded child unable to mount a defense for hisopen borders. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is expected to face a House impeachment vote.(Getty Images) Or how about Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who seemed to have a special Zippo lighter designed to let him fire up conflagrations from Ukraine to the Middle East? Or Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin -- when he was available, of course -- whose Afghanistan withdrawal made the Keystone Cops look like the A Team? For four years this \"aw shucks\" brigade of midwits was allowed to drive our nation off a cliff precisely because nobody was actually in charge. When the border was a mess and Mayorkas embarrassed himself on the Hill, what would be the process for firing him? The boss is oblivious. Who would actually care enough to go after him? None of the insiders I mentioned above. It wasn’t their legacy, wasn’t their problem. So no accountability. No. We were governed by a set of progressive assumptions, much like the invisible hand of the market that Adam Smith wrote about. In progressive politics the questions simply answer themselves. It is a system. Why would Mayorkas let the southern border become a turnstile for foreign gang members? Because first and foremost, we must think of the innocent migrants, even if the cruel open borders policy is getting many of them trafficked. Why couldn’t the Biden administration back off of the hill of men playing in women’s sports when everyone without pronouns on their business card knows it's absurd? Because progressive ideology dictates that the oppressed must be right. Why was the Biden administration unable to forcefully call out antisemitism on our college campuses? Because Jews are now white-adjacent and privileged. We were governed by a set of left-wing assumptions. Think about what almost happened. Even if Democrats had somehow gotten Methusela Bidenover the finish line, with his new cancer diagnosis, we now know we would have wound up with Kamala \"I’m not taking questions at this time\" Harris as president. Could there be a better example of the fact that, to Democrats, it doesn’t matter in the slightest who is actually in charge? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION We do not have two functioning political parties today. We have the GOP and a Democrat Party that is like the Borg from Star Trek, it speaks with a single voice that is somehow always dead wrong. There is a reason that we have a president. Leadership matters, and in the last 120 or so days, from securing the border to securing trade deals, President Donald Trump has exemplified just how crucial his job really is. In retrospect, we look back on four years of Biden’s presidency and ask ourselves, what the hell just happened? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP What happened was a reign of woke policy agendas that flooded our border, inflated our prices, wrought war across the globe and infiltrated Catholic churches looking for fantastical right-wing extremism. We may never know exactly what happened, but one thing we do know. It can never be allowed to happen again.

    "title": "DR. MARC SIEGEL: Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis reveals dangerous flaw in screening guidelines",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss his take on former President Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, the importance of early response and his prognosis moving forward. If there is one thing that theCOVID pandemictaught us, it was the lack of flexibility, nimbleness and the frequent inaccuracy or out of datedness of superimposed guidelines. I must confess that as a practicing internist for many years, I have never strictly adhered to guidelines and simply used them to guide me. Medicine is and always has been an art to be practiced on an individual basis. One of the guidelines that has bothered me the most is the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Guideline – in use since 2012 -- not to recommend routine Prostate Specific Antigen use in prostate cancer screening. And even theAmerican Urological Associationdoesn’t recommend routine screening over the age of 70.  Studies have shown that use of the PSA has fallen off likely in men over the age of 40 as a result of the USPSTF recommendation.  This is particularly disturbing considering that there are over300,000 new cases of prostate cancerin the U.S. diagnosed every year, with over 35,000 deaths, many of which may be preventable with earlier diagnosis. So it is disturbingly possible that former President Biden’s spokesperson is telling the truth when he says thathe wasn’t screenedfor prostate cancer in over a decade prior to his current diagnosis of aggressive metastatic disease. Perhaps he and his doctors were just rigidly following an outdated and ill-conceived guideline. But this revelation, if true, is just as disturbing as if the Biden White House were hiding a timelier earlier diagnosis from the American public, just as they have apparently hidden other health realities regarding the former president. BIDEN'S 'LAST KNOWN' PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING WAS OVER A DECADE AGO, AS QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER DIAGNOSIS Delay and guessing in the dark is simply not how I, and many other internists and urologists, practice medicine. The PSA itself tells us when it trends upward, often when it increases over 4, that there is something going on in the prostate. The rise may or may not be due toprostate cancer. When combined with a \"free PSA,\" if low, the likelihood of prostate cancer increases. We are also on the verge of genetic testing and liquid biopsies (blood tests) which will increase the accuracy of prostate cancer screening and we already haveuseful biomarker screening testsfor prostate cancer in the urine. Luckily, despite the fact that current screening guidelines are not up-to-date or useful, I can still order a PSA and have Medicare cover it for any age if I say the test is medically necessary. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION I need to know that information, combined with a digital rectal exam looking for nodules, to know what to do next regardless of my patient’s age. If either test is abnormal, I can then choose to proceed to an MRI of the prostate, which has become more accurate at looking for prostate cancer as the test has evolved and advanced.  An MRI result can direct a urologist as to whether a biopsy is necessary and where in the prostate to direct this biopsy. If a patient has prostate cancer, there are many treatment options available, depending on the stage and aggressivity. These treatments have also advanced over the years and are better tolerated with fewer side effects, which means they may be tolerated by men of older ages and in poorer health. If a cure is possible, then either robotic radical prostatectomy or various forms of radiation treatments are considered. And if the prostate cancer is metastatic, as in PresidentJoe Biden’scase, hormone therapy to target testosterone (which may be causing the tumor to grow), may be used or combined with other treatments, including targeted therapies, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy. There areeven studieswhich show that it may improve outcome to still remove the prostate even in some advanced cases. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Many critics are saying that a president of the United States should have the most aggressive prostate cancer screening regardless simply because he is president. But I am saying that all men over the age of 45 should have this screening. Period. Regardless of age. Medical knowledgeis power and what I do with the information I acquire to help my patient is the art of medicine. Not knowing is never the correct answer. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

    "title": "I'm a progressive Democrat fighting Medicaid cuts. And I just joined Trump's Truth Social to do it",
    "article_text": "Fox News Digital captured video of Capitol Police arresting protesters who disrupted the budget markup on Tuesday as Democrats continue to warn of Medicaid cuts. At one point, Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ, appears to cheer them on. I am a proud progressive Democrat, so some people might be surprised to see me joining Donald Trump’s Truth Social social media platform this week. Let me explain. This week, House Republicans are trying to pass Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ which would take away health care from more than 8.6 million Americans through Medicaid cuts, even though just6% of Americanssupport cuts to Medicaid and Medicare, according to a recent Fox News poll. Washington Republicans aren’t just out of touch with Democrats and Independents on this – just11% of Republicanvoters support cuts, but nearly 100% of House Republicans are pushing a bill that would make thebiggest Medicaid cut in American history. WAYS AND MEANS CHAIR: 'REPEAT VERIFICATION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ON MEDICAID WOULD SAVE ALMOST $200B' If Republicans are going to push forward massive cuts to programs like Medicaid, Democrats can’t just preach to the choir. We need to be reaching out to working people of all stripes and political parties who could face these cuts. I know most users of Truth Social are more conservative than I am and disagree with me on some issues, but I also know that many agree with me that billionaires have too big an influence in our politics and we shouldn’t be cutting programs like Medicaid andSocial Securityto pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. Medicaid recipient Emily Gabriella protests outside the U.S. Supreme Court as oral arguments are delivered in the case of Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic on April 2, 2025 in Washington D.C. The case details an attempt by the state of South Carolina to exclude Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program because it provides abortions.(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) When I think about how to reach out to people who disagree with me on some issues, I think back to how I started my career: as a labor organizer. I worked on construction sites to unify workers who disagreed on a lot of issues but could all come together to demand better wages or working conditions from their bosses. SEN ELIZABETH WARREN: SOCIAL SECURITY IS UNDER ATTACK. GUTTING IT IS A BROKEN PROMISEThat is what I think we need to be doing as Democrats: reaching out to people who may not agree with us on every issue but who are concerned that Republicans in Washington are cutting programs for working people to pay for billionaire tax cuts. It’s not just Medicaid. Look at Social Security. In the same Fox poll, only 5% of Americans want it cut, but PresidentDonald Trumphas empowered people likeElon Musk, who called it a \"Ponzi scheme,\" and  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said only \"fraudsters\" would complain about missing a check. And they have fired so many people that the former head of the Social Security Administration warns the system could \"collapse.\" Of course, joining a social media site will not solve our problems. We should be communicating with more conservative voters wherever we can – that’s why I’ve appeared on Fox News and why I’ve traveled to three red congressional districts to hold in-person town halls where Republican members of Congress have not held them for their own constituents. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Of course, I also often talk to progressive media and post on platforms like BlueSky. And it’s not just about where we go: we have to make sure people know we are fighting for the working class and are willing to take on big money and special interests. We also need to make sure people know they are welcome in theDemocratic Partyeven if they do not agree with us on every issue. I am a progressive Democrat and I do not plan on changing or obscuring my position on anything, but I want people to know that we are focused on making the lives of all working class people better. That means we as Democrats need to sound less judgmental and more focused on the issues that matter most to peoples’ lives, like the GOP cuts to Medicaid and Social Security. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Even if you disagree with me on some issues, if you oppose these cuts toMedicaidand Social Security and want to take back our government from the billionaire class, I want to talk to you and figure out where we can work together. I’m happy to do that on whatever platform you’re on. Democrat Greg Casar represents Texas’s 35th Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives.

    "article_text": "Ruby Chen addressed the UN Security Council, urging it to enforce its resolution on missing persons. Chen's son, Itay, has been held by Hamas terrorists for 593 days. (Video: UNTV.) I am the father ofItay Chen, an American German Israeli citizen held in Gaza by Hamas for 593 days. At the age of 18, Itay joined the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), and on that fatal Oct. 7, 2023, he and his squad fought against Hamas for several hours, protecting Israeli civilians from being raped, burned alive and killed. Eventually, Itay’s tank was neutralized by Hamas, and three of the four tank members were taken hostage to Gaza. In March 2024, my family was notified by the IDF that Itay most likely did not survive the October 7 attack. But for over 19 months, Hamas has not been willing to acknowledge that my son is in their possession or what his physical status is. It is believed there are over 30 families with a deceased hostage in Gaza. In addition, there are a recorded 50,000 plus families with a missing family member in areas of conflict worldwide. Hamas' actions are the lowest form of terrorist psychological warfare imaginable. What kind of human beings take dead people as future negotiation chips? Who denies them the basic human rights and dignity they deserve? A MOTHER'S PLEA: BRING MY SONS HOME FROM GAZA Ruby Chen addressed the U.N. Security Council, calling for more action to bring the hostages home from Gaza. Ruby's son Itay is still being held in Gaza by Hamas terrorists.(Bianca Otero) More than five years ago, theU.N. Security Councilunanimously adopted Resolution 2474 – a landmark commitment to families like mine. This resolution calls upon all parties in armed conflicts \"to actively search for persons reported missing, to enable the return of their remains and to account for persons reported missing ‘without adverse distinction.’\" In other words, the world’s nations agreed that no matter who you are or where a conflict rages, every effort must be made to find the missing and bring them home. This is not just rhetoric; it’s international law and a moral obligation. Yet today, Hamas’ actions in Gaza stand in brazen defiance of this resolution. By continuing to hold hostages – including withholding the bodies of those it has killed – Hamas is violating fundamental principles of humanitarian law and the explicit demands of the Security Council. Resolution 2474 was the first of its kind, unanimously adopted, and it signifies the world’s promise to families of the deceased. Last Thursday, I had the opportunity to brief the Security Council as part of the American Mission. I urged the international community to enforce their prior decision and make sure Resolution 2474 is not forgotten. SIGN UP FOR ANTISEMITISM EXPOSED NEWSLETTER American Israeli Itay Chen has been held for over 593 days by Hamas terrorists in Gaza.(Obtained by Fox News) When I stood before the United Nations, I went there as a father — not a diplomat. I went there to put a human face on this global crisis. I needed them to see our pain, to understand what it means to wait 593 days not knowing if your child is alive or dead. I begged the Security Council to do something real: appoint a Special Representative for Hostage Affairs, similar to the U.S. which has a Special President Envoy for Hostage Affairs. We need someone whose only job is to fight for our loved ones, to pressure groups like Hamas to follow basic human decency and to make sure families like mine aren't forgotten in the halls of power. A dedicatedUnited Nationsofficial could serve as a clear focal point for this issue — monitoring incidents, coordinating urgent responses and aligning relevant efforts, including the implementation of Resolution 2474. But more than that, they would give voice to victims and their families—to parents like me who need someone to speak for us. A view of the United Nations Headquarters building in New York City on July 16, 2024.(Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) We have seen PresidentDonald Trump's commitment to hostages where he has released at least 37 U.S. hostages from six countries since his inauguration. He has stated on multiple occasions his demand that all the hostages in Gaza be released, living and deceased. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION What I fear most is the growing silence among the public. The reality is that as wars drag on, attention fades. For many, the headlines move on. For us, the families, time stands still. We cannot afford for the American public to move on from this crisis. And that silence has teeth. It says: your child’s life doesn’t matter. Your grief is inconvenient. Your pain is inconsequential. Please, do not let our loved ones remain lost in the shadows. I did not choose to become a spokesperson for the deceased worldwide. I am simply a father who wants his son back. My son, Itay, was a huge NBA Boston Celtics fan. I should have been watching the Knicks-Celtics playoff games with him now. Instead, we endure this unfathomable pain. Itay’s death, whether confirmed or otherwise, does not make him any less of a hostage, does not make him any less deserving of efforts to return him home. And we, his family, are no less worthy of dignity, truth, justice, or peace. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ruby is the father of Itay Chen, a 19-year-old Israeli-American who was taken captive by the Hamas terrorist organization on Oct. 7, 2023. Although the Israel Defense Force believes Itay may have been killed, Ruby, who lives in Israel with his wife, Hagit, and their two other children, continues to hold out hope his son is alive.",

    "title": "It's time for Congress to deliver President Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' to his desk",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on how President Donald Trump is rallying House Republicans to support his proposed spending bill and outlines the next steps in the legislative process. Republicans have a historic opportunity to deliver America First tax reforms that reward hard work, bring jobs back home, expand opportunity, and most importantly, rebuild the American economy for hardworking families across our nation. PresidentDonald Trumphas been crystal clear about what he wanted Congress to deliver – 77 million Americans raced to the ballot box in support of his vision of lower taxes for those whose sweat moves our economy forward. Now, The One, Big, Beautiful Bill passed by the Ways and Means Committee delivers for those workers. It makes permanent the expiring provisions of the successful 2017 Trump tax cuts, provides additional tax relief to American families, and rewards those who manufacture more at home and hire more American workers. The additional tax relief includes eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and auto loan interest, and delivering tax relief for seniors. Now, Congress must not fail the American people. For two years, theWays and Means Committeehas been preparing for this moment – hearing directly from working-class Americans, small businesses, manufacturers, and farmers during over 120 events across more than 20 states. This bill was written by them, and we must deliver it for them. NEW PROJECTION SIGNALS GOOD NEWS FOR FAMILIES, WORKERS IN TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ The Republican Party is fortunate to have a leader like President Trump – someone who refuses to cave to special interests and the K Street lobbyists who have controlled Washington for decades. Everything he does – and every policy he fights for – is rooted in what Americans have told us over the past two years. These are communities that have long been overlooked, who have struggled to gain a foothold in an economy rigged against them. The One, Big, Beautiful Billwill deliver real relief to those Americans. The average family with two children will see up to a $13,300 increase in take-home pay. We will stop a looming $1,700 tax hike on that same family while also delivering an additional $1,300 tax cut. Six million American jobs will be saved. Forty million families will receive a boosted child tax credit. And our economy will benefit from $284 billion in growth from manufacturing alone. This bill will not only supercharge our economy – it finally holds elite, woke universities and nonprofits accountable. For years, private universities with massive endowments and large nonprofits have operated like corporations, all while pushing political agendas and enjoying taxpayer-funded benefits. That ends now. If these institutions want to act like corporations, we’ll treat them like corporations. Can anyone seriously think of a reason that Harvard, with its $50 billion endowment – larger than the GDP of the Kingdom of Jordan and nearly 100 other countries – should not pay the equivalent of the corporate tax rate? We are replacing bad tax policy withgood tax policyby ending Biden-era tax breaks and special interest giveaways that rewarded the wealthy, well-connected, big banks and China. Under Republican tax policy, the working class, not the wealthy, are the priority. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION We are also protecting hardworking Americans by ensuring thattaxpayer-fundedbenefits serve citizens, not those who broke our laws to be here. Under this bill, illegal immigrants or fraudsters get cut off from backdoor access to Obamacare, Medicare, or child tax credits. And if illegal immigrants send money abroad, they will pay a fee – because no one should profit off of breaking the law or undermining American workers. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I grew up in a small town of fewer than 5,000 people in South Central Missouri. Most of my childhood was spent in a single-wide trailer with my family of four. My grandparents didn’t have running water. I have always said my priority is the working class because I am a product of the working class. When I ran for Ways and Means Chairman, I made clear the Republican Party is now the party of the working class, and when our policies reflect that, we win. November 5, 2024, proved I was right. I am proud of the historic bill my colleagues and I passed with unanimous Republican support in the Ways and Means Committee. Now, it is time for the rest of Congress to follow through – and deliver The One, Big, Beautiful Bill to President Donald J. Trump’s desk. Republican Jason Smith represents Missouri's 8th Congressional District and is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.",

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Brett Velicovich joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss Secretary's Hegseth's sweeping Army transformation, how Russia has responded to the U.S. minerals deal with Ukraine and the military bolstering drone technology. Since becoming secretary, I have been alarmed to find that our Army is at risk of falling behind other major powers across the globe, including China. Why? For decades, antiquated processes and bureaucratic bloat shackled our innovation and modernization efforts. If we continue business as usual ournational securitywill be at risk. The gap between the Army we have and the Army we need is growing fast. Our soldiers are innovative, resourceful and capable – they are our nation’s best. But they are being held back by lobbyists and complacent stakeholders who prioritized parochial interests over our soldiers’ lethality and readiness. No lobbyist ever took a hill. No lobbyist ever won a war. Our soldiers deserve better. And our nation deserves better. That’s whySecretary of Defense Pete Hegsethrecently directed the Army to accelerate change. BILLIONS SPENT, WARFIGHTERS WAIT: INSIDE THE PENTAGON’S BROKEN BUYING SYSTEM AND THE PLAN TO FIX IT We got to work immediately. The Army is undergoing a large-scale realignment.

This is the way forward: HEGSETH ORDERS SWEEPING ARMY OVERHAUL AND CONSOLIDATION AIMED AT COUNTERING CHINA AND GOLDEN DOME CAPABILITIES Our soldiers must out-survive and outfight the enemy on the battlefield. Today, they need drone and counter-drone capabilities, AI-driven decision-making and lethal, battle-ready tanks and attack aircraft.

Our mission is clear:cut red tapeso we can quickly equip troops with the best capabilities available.

We will fuel market competition, back industry-led research and development, and streamline the process by placing users, testers and developers shoulder-to-shoulder in the field. We will embrace change and fight system inertia, keeping us agile, lethal and one step ahead of our enemies. For far too long, our hands have been tied by parochial interests propped up by swarms of lobbyists. We have been forced to buy gear that we no longer want or need. With ATI, we’ll ensure that we use American taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars effectively. If a capability no longer benefits our soldiers and does not make ourArmy more lethal, we will not buy it. ARMY MAY SLASH 90,000 TROOPS AS PENTAGON FACES BUDGET CUTS AND STRATEGIC SHAKE-UP: REPORT We are transforming the Army from the ground up, not just upgrading our processes and equipment. We are building an organization that will drive process improvements, leading to better products and better outcomes for soldiers.

    "title": "Democrats' major messaging crisis: The party of opposition without solutions",
    "article_text": "Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., weighs in on whether there was a 'cover-up' of former President Joe Biden's fitness for office on 'The Story.' The political drama unfolding in America is a tale of missed opportunities, and the Democrats are the main characters struggling to find their footing. As Trump’s polls falter, many wonder why the Dems aren’t capitalizing on the moment. Well, it’s no surprise to me. An ABC News-Washington Post-Ipsos poll released last month showed that 69% of people believe theDemocratic Partyis out of touch with most people’s concerns. Why? Because instead of focusing on people’s concerns, they’re stuck in the same tired routine: pointing fingers, highlighting Trump’s faults, and decrying the chaos and threats to democracy. This strategy is fundamentally flawed. Recent events underscore this disconnect. Chaos at a detention facility inNew Jerseyhighlights the ongoing immigration crisis, yet Democrats struggle to present a cohesive alternative. They could focus on pragmatic reforms, such as streamlining the asylum process, increasing border security with technology rather than walls, and creating pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants contributing to society. Meanwhile, internal conflicts within the party, like the fight overDavid Hogg's futureinside the DNC, reveal a lack of unified vision. Instead of rallying around fresh voices and ideas, the party seems mired in internal disputes, further alienating potential supporters. DEMOCRATIC VOTERS SLAM THEIR OWN PARTY AS 'INEPT' AND 'USELESS' IN NY TIMES OPINION INTERVIEW And that’s saying nothing about the alleged cover-up of former PresidentJoe Biden’sfrail health highlighted in Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's new book, \"Original Sin\" and the questions arising from his recent tragic prostate cancer diagnosis.  All of this adds another layer of complexity. Instead of addressing these concerns head-on with transparency and a plan for continuity, the party seems to sidestep the issue, leaving voters with more questions than answers. All of this leads to a HUGE trust problem for the Democrats. Can they be trusted to tell the truth? Can they be trusted to solve our greatest problems? The answer is in plain view withFox News' most recent surveywhere Democrats hit their lowest favorable rating ever, with only 41% viewing them positively. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATINGS SLIDE, BUT DEMOCRATS' POLL NUMBERS HITTING NEW LOWS The drop in positivity toward the Democrats comes from within. Last summer, 87% of self-identified Democrats approved of their party, but that’s now down to 77%. Meanwhile, the Republican Party saw a slight improvement among their party faithful, with 85% of self-identified Republicans holding a favorable view. The data is painting a very clear picture of the impact of the Democrats’ missteps. Winning hearts and minds requires positive messaging, not just shouting about how bad Donald Trump is. In 2017-2018, Democrats handled things much better. They had a clear narrative approaching the midterms: Trump’s failure in his first term to deliver on healthcare was a tangible issue they could seize. They promised to mend what was broken—offering plans like expanding the Affordable Care Act and reducing prescription drug prices. But now, instead of offering solutions, they’re fixated onDonald Trump’schaos and \"evilness.\" The issue? Voters crave more than just a villain; they want a solution. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Consider the economy. While Democrats criticize Trump’s trade wars and tax cuts for the wealthy, they often fail to articulate a clear economic vision of their own. Instead of merely opposing tariffs, they could propose comprehensivetrade policiesthat protect American jobs while fostering global cooperation. Highlighting plans for infrastructure investment or green energy jobs, while not appealing to those on the right, could provide a positive, forward-looking agenda for many. Their rhetoric often spirals into extremes—comparing Trump to Hitler or labeling his supporters as Nazis. While this may energize the base, it risks alienating moderates and undecided voters, or even everyday Americans who yearn for practical solutions over apocalyptic rhetoric. By framing the opponent as a boogeyman, they risk turning off the wider electorate. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The bottom line is that Democrats need to pivot from a reactive, negative strategy to a proactive, solution-oriented approach if they want to win. They should focus on real policies—healthcare reform, economic growth, immigration reform,tariffs—with clear plans to address these issues. Winning hearts and minds requires positive messaging, not just shouting about how bad Trump is. Otherwise, they’ll continue to falter, running against an opponent who has mastered the narrative game and controls the conversation through chaos. To truly connect with voters, Democrats must offer a vision that resonates with their daily lives. By doing so, they could transform from the party of opposition to the party of solutions, but it doesn’t seem like anyone is willing to step up to the plate to do just that.

    "title": "SENATOR TOMMY TUBERVILLE: Trump and coach Saban have the right game plan to save college sports",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. As a former college football coach for 40 years, I’ve witnessed firsthandthe transformative power of college sportsin shaping young lives. From the locker room to the classroom, athletics instill discipline, teamwork and resilience — values that extend far beyond the field. But ever since the Supreme Court ruled that college athletes can be compensated for the use of their Name, Image and Likeness (NIL), college sports have been in a tailspin. While I’m all for players making money, we need to create national standards to protect the integrity of college sports. Because there are no national rules forNIL contracts,every state has passed its own laws. This patchwork of laws has created an uneven playing field and given some universities advantages over their competitors. We now have pay-to-play as bidding wars for recruits are starting in middle and high school. This is not to mention thetransfer portal,which has become a revolving door with student-athletes jumping from school to school in pursuit of more money. TRUMP CONSIDERING EXECUTIVE ORDER TO REGULATE NIL AFTER MEETING WITH NICK SABAN: REPORT For example, the men’s basketball teams at Kentucky, Duke and the University of North Carolina are preparing for their entire rosters to change in the upcoming 2025-26 season. This is not only bad for team culture, it’s also having negative impacts on the student-athletes’ educations, which is what college athletics is supposed to be all about. Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava (8) left the team to pursue a better NIL deal. FILE: Iamaleava throws the ball during the first quarter at FirstBank Stadium in Nashville, Tenn., Saturday, Nov. 30, 2024.(IMAGN) I’ve been working to try to address these issues since I got to the Senate in 2021. Last Congress, West Virginia Independent Senator Joe Manchin and I introduced the\"Protecting Athletes, Schools, and Sports Act\" (PASS Act).This bipartisan legislation would establish a national standard for NIL contracts, ensuring consistency and fairness across all institutions. The PASS Act would also require universities to honor the original scholarship made to student-athletes, regardless of their NIL deal status, and provide stability by moderating eligibility for thetransfer portal. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Importantly, this was not just our bill — we worked with student athletes, coaches, athletics directors and parents to draft it. Unfortunately, Democrats, who had the majority at the time, refused to bring the bill to the floor for a vote. SEN TUBERVILLE PREVIEWS NIL MEETING WITH TRUMP, SAYS DEMOCRATS 'DON'T CARE' ABOUT COLLEGE SPORTS Thankfully, PresidentDonald Trump —a notorious sports fan — is looking to get involved. A few weeks ago, I had the chance to talk to him about our fight to preserve college sports while on Air Force One headed to Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He was particularly focused on protecting women’s and Olympic sports, which are sadly in danger of being eliminated at some schools who don’t have enough money to play players. He was also focused on preserving education, ensuring antitrust protections are in place, and protecting women’s and Olympic sports, which are sadly being eliminated at some schools that don’t have enough money to pay players. In typical Trump fashion, he sprang into action. Following our conversation, the White House began exploring ways, ranging from an executive order to a federal commission, to address the most pressing issues within college athletics. By hearing from key stakeholders, including my friends former Coach Nick Saban from Alabama and formerNFL playerand Chairman of the Board of Regents of the Texas Tech University System Cody Campbell, the Trump administration is working to gather possible solutions that address the complexities of NIL and its impact on college sports. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Regardless of which path Trump chooses to address the current state of college sports, I’m confident that his administration — which has already proven to be both effective and unafraid to shake up the status quo — can make meaningful reforms to make sure college sports remain intact. NCAA POWER FOUR COMMISSIONERS SAY THEY 'NEED HELP FROM CONGRESS' TO REGULATE NIL, TRANSFER PORTAL Meanwhile, I’ll continue to work with my colleagues to hopefully draft legislation that could pass both chambers. The challenges facing college sports today are formidable, but not insurmountable. WithPresident Trump’sleadership and a unified approach, we can navigate this new era while preserving the integrity and spirit of collegiate athletics. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.

When Klarna delivered updated quarterly earnings on Monday, it was his AI avatar (pictured above) that presented the highlights,according to the company’s YouTube video. Other than AI Siemiatkowski’s admission, it wasn’t obvious that this was AI. There were only a few subtle signs: AI Siemiatkowski didn’t blink as much as most humans do. The voice sync was good, but not perfect. The AI was also wearing a brown jacket that looked a lot like the one froma widely circulated corporate photoof his human self (though the shirt was different). Klarna,which is getting ready to debut as a public company, was using the updated financials to tout AI as a driving factor for hitting 100 million users. It credited its use of AI for a fourth consecutive profitable quarter, explaining that it “streamlined its workforce by ~40%,” the companysaid in its blog post, driving uprevenue per employee to nearly $1 million. Human Siemiatkowskispecified to CNBCthat “the company has shrunk from about 5,000 to now almost 3,000 employees.” He’s not the first CEO to poke fun at the idea of an AI replacing a CEO. AI sales agent startup Artisan, known for its viral “stop hiring humans” ad campaign, posted an April Fool’s video of itsCEO Jaspar Carmichael-Jack being fired and replacedwith an AI CEO. But maybe the idea of AIs replacing CEOs isn’t a total joke. While it’s certainly true that some CEOs — especially at startups — do get their hands dirty coding features or cold-calling prospects, a CEO’s main jobs are to set strategy, make decisions, and take responsibility for those decisions. Who better than an AI built on a SATA reasoning model to digest large swatches of company data, study gobs of successful business strategy, and use that to make decisions? In fact, research published in Harvard Business Review last year found that anAI could, mostly, outperform human CEOs, based on a model using GPT-4o. However, the AI CEO also quickly got fired by the study’s virtual board. This is because it did poorly responding to “black swan events, such as market collapses during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the researchers found. Still, as AI advocates like to point out, these are early days. Future AI CEOs may learn to excel at that, too. Klarna did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.

In a newly filed amicus brief in support of Epic Games in its ongoing legal battle with Apple over external payments on the App Store, Spotify claims its internal data indicates that its recent update supporting web payments has resulted in “a significant increase in iOS users upgrading to a Premium subscription.” Shortly after the U.S. District Court in Northern Californiaruled in favor of Fortnite maker Epic Gameson the matter of external payments, Apple was forced to finally allow U.S. app developers todirect their customers to other ways to payfrom within their iOS apps without having to pay Apple’s commission. Now, iOS app developers in the U.S. can choose to tell their customers about web billing options and whether there’s a discount for paying directly. Spotify was one of thefirst to update its iOS appto take advantage of the new policy. The updated version explains to customers what subscriptions cost, points them to its website to purchase, and allows users topurchase audiobooksdirectly. The results have been largely positive, Spotify wrote in the new filing. “The 2025 Order has created substantial benefits for developers and — more importantly — consumers,” the filing states. “Spotify’s internal data show that its iOS app updates have already resulted in a significant increase in iOS users upgrading to a Premium subscription. Apple’s compliance has also enabled new product innovations that would not have been possible without the Injunction.” Spotify said that its revised “Premium Destination Page” in its iOS app tells free users how to upgrade to a paid subscription by offering information about prices and a link to a checkout page. Since adding the link and pricing information, Spotify says it’s seen the immediate impact of the changes. In the two weeks the new page has been live, Spotify says the rate of conversions from the free to Premium tier has remained “relatively constant” on Android, where Spotify has already been able to offer basic pricing information. Meanwhile, the conversion rate among iOS users has increased substantially, the company says. “This strongly suggests that the increase is due to Apple finally complying with the Injunction thanks to the 2025 Order,” Spotify wrote. Plus, the company adds that it’s beginning to see the effects on audiobook purchases just three days after the new product options were launched. Spotify declined to share specific numbers related to the increases when reached for comment. Its brief joins those fromMicrosoftand others in support of Epic Games, as Apple tries to fight the injunction that upended its U.S. App Store business. Apple doesn’t want to comply with the court’s decision, which it’s in the process of appealing, until all legal matters are fully settled. It alsotried to keep Epic Games’ Fortnite out of the App Storefor the same reason, but the judgepressured Apple to allow the game back in the App Store or return to courtto explain why Apple was in non-compliance with the ruling. On Tuesday, Fortnitewent live on the U.S. App Store after a five-yearhiatus. The case between Apple and Epic now continues in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Apple filed an Emergency Motion so it could revert to its old policy while its appeal was underway. However, the court decided not to grant the motion, saying the panel of judges would follow the default briefing schedule and then rule on the motion in “due course.” Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Ron Wydensent a letterto fellow senators on Wednesday, revealing that three major U.S. cellphone carriers did not have provisions to notify lawmakers about government surveillance requests, despite a contractual requirement to do so. In the letter, Wyden, a Democrat and longstanding member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that an investigation by his staff found that AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon were not notifying senators of legal requests — including from the White House — to surveil their phones. The companies “have indicated that they are all now providing such notice,” according to the letter. Politico wasfirst to reportWyden’s letter. Wyden’s letter comes in the wake of a report last year by the Inspector General, whichrevealedthat the Trump administration in 2017 and 2018 secretly obtained logs of calls and text messages of 43 congressional staffers and two serving House lawmakers, imposing gag orders on the phone companies that received the requests. The secret surveillance requests werefirst revealed in 2021to have targeted Adam Schiff, who was at the time the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. “Executive branch surveillance poses a significant threat to the Senate’s independence and the foundational principle of separation of powers,” wrote Wyden in his letter. “If law enforcement officials, whether at the federal, state, or even local level, can secretly obtain Senators’ location data or call histories, our ability to perform our constitutional duties is severely threatened.” AT&T spokesperson Alex Byers told TechCrunch in a statement that, “we are complying with our obligations to the Senate Sergeant at Arms,” and that the phone company has “received no legal demands regarding Senate offices under the current contract, which began last June.” When asked whether AT&T received legal demands before the new contract, Byers did not respond. Wyden said in the letter that one unnamed carrier “confirmed that it turned over Senate data to law enforcement without notifying the Senate.” When reached by TechCrunch, Wyden’s spokesperson Keith Chu said the reason was that, “we don’t want to discourage companies from responding to Sen. Wyden’s questions.” Verizon and T-Mobile did not respond to a request for comment. The letter also mentioned carriers Google Fi, US Mobile, andcellular startup Cape, which all have policies to notify “all customers about government demands whenever they are allowed to do so.” US Mobile and Cape adopted the policy after outreach from Wyden’s office. Chu told TechCrunch that the Senate “doesn’t have contracts with the smaller carriers.” Ahmed Khattak, US Mobile’s founder and CEO, confirmed to TechCrunch that the company “did not have a formal customer notification policy regarding surveillance requests prior to Senator Wyden’s inquiry.” “Our current policy is to notify customers of subpoenas or legal demands for information whenever we are legally permitted to do so and when the request is not subject to a court order, statutory gag provision, or other legal restriction on disclosure,” said Khattak. “To the best of our knowledge, US Mobile has not received any surveillance requests targeting the phones of senators or their staff.” Cape CEO John Doyle pointed to the company’sprivacy policy, which states that Cape responds to legal requests but “will notify its subscribers of receipt of any legal process seeking disclosure related to their accounts, thereby giving you the opportunity to challenge that request,” unless legally prohibited to do so. “To date, Cape has not received any requests for subscriber data that contained a nondisclosure obligation,” the privacy policy reads. Google did not respond to a request for comment. As Wyden’s letter notes, after Congress enacted protections in 2020 for Senate data held by third-party companies, the Senate Sergeant at Arms updated its contracts to require phone carriers to send notifications of surveillance requests. Wyden said that his staff discovered that “these crucial notifications were not happening.” None of these protections apply to phones that are not officially issued to the Senate, such as campaign or personal phones of senators and their staffers. In the letter, Wyden encouraged his Senate colleagues to switch to carriers that now provide notifications. Updated to include comment from Cape’s John Doyle and corrected the title of US Mobile’s founder.

As part of the unusual deal announced Wednesday, Ive and his design firm, LoveFrom, will now lead creative and design work at OpenAI. “thrilled to be partnering with jony, [in my opinion] the greatest designer in the world,” said Altman in apost on XWednesday. “excited to try to create a new generation of AI-powered computers.” thrilled to be partnering with jony, imo the greatest designer in the world.excited to try to create a new generation of AI-powered computers.pic.twitter.com/IPZBNrz1jQ OpenAI and Ive’s collaboration puts one of Apple’s former design heads — famous for crafting many iPhones, iPods, iPads, and Apple Watches — at the forefront of the newest technology wave, generative AI. Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, OpenAI has amped up its consumer business significantly. Earlier this month, the company appointed former Meta executive and Instacart CEOFidji Simo to lead its consumer applications. Ive could help OpenAI directly compete with Apple in the consumer hardware space, putting even more pressure on the iPhone maker. In recent years, Apple has struggled to develop AI features that keep up with the latest technology from OpenAI and Google. Apple’s stock fell 2% on Wednesday after the OpenAI and Ive collaboration was announced. Io has a staff of around 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists, and product development specialists, per The Wall Street Journal, all of whom will join OpenAI. Many of io’s employees are former Apple designers — including Scott Cannon, Evans Hankey, and Tang Tan — who helped build the firm’s most iconic products. Ive is retaining control of his design firm, LoveFrom, which will continue to operate independently. Io, under OpenAI, will develop AI-powered consumer devices and other projects. Altman and Ive have reportedly been working on a device that moves consumers “beyond screens.”Bloombergreports that Ive and Altman’s first devices are slated to debut in 2026. The Wall Street Journal reports that Ive will have an expansive role, giving input into future versions of ChatGPT and more. OpenAI already had a 23% stake in io as part of an agreement between the companies last year, according toThe New York Times. That means OpenAI will pay $5 billion to fully acquire io, marking the ChatGPT maker’s largest acquisition ever. Reportedly, the OpenAI Startup Fund made a separate investment in io last year. In avideo posted by OpenAI, Altman said the mission of io is to create a family of AI devices that will let people use AI to produce “all sorts of wonderful things.” Ive said he’s convinced that everything he’s learned “over the last 30 years has led me to this place and this moment.” The first AI device io is working on has “completely captured” Ive’s imagination, he said. The world of AI devices is still in its infancy. Altman was an early investor in Humane, another AI hardware company founded by former Apple employees, which made an AI-powered “pin.” After a series of stumbles, Humane wassold to HP and its devices were sunsetted. Meanwhile, other form factors for AI devices have shown more promise. Meta’s AI-powered smart glasses, which it’s developing with the eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica, have achieved strong sales and adoption among consumers. This week, Google unveiledits version of AI smart glassesthat it’s developing with Samsung, Warby Parker, and other partners. Ultimately, it’s unclear what shape OpenAI’s devices will take. Later in the video, Altman noted how using a laptop or smartphone to access ChatGPT was too cumbersome. Instead, the OpenAI CEO suggested he’d rather use a device more integrated into his everyday life. The Informationfirst reported on OpenAI’s discussions to acquire io in March. At the time, the two companies were said to be discussing building a device that would bring a version of the technology from the movie “Her” to life.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us There is a new accounting software in town, coming in with a fresh $17.2 million raise and a desire to shake things up. The company,Filed, hopes to automate the grunt work. “The tax industry is facing a genuine crisis,” Leroy Kerry, Filed’s co-founder CEO, told TechCrunch. Many CPAs are approaching retirement while a dwindling number of students are entering the field, he said, citing much-quoted research froma 2021 reporton the topic from the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants. “Firms simply don’t have enough people to process returns efficiently. Meanwhile, professionals are drowning in paperwork, spending nearly half their time on low-value tasks that could be automated,” he says. So he teamed up with Atul Ramachandran, now the company’s CTO, to launch Filed, which uses AI to complete the lifecycle of a tax return. “It reads documents, uses reasoning to apply each firm’s specific approach to tax strategy, and then enters that data into their existing software systems,” Kerry said. He said that when the AI notices a scenario that requires human input, it flags it for review, “keeping humans in control while eliminating the tedious work.” There are others in this space, including tax preparation and accounting assistant software, Black Ore and Basis, respectively. Kerry says his product is different from others because the AI was created specifically for tax workflow, and it directly plugs into software systems rather than forcing clients to overhaul existing tech. The venture firm Northzone led Filed’s $17.2 million round, with Day One Ventures and Neo also participating in the round. It seems life has come full circle for Kerry, who didn’t often see people like him running tech companies. He grew up in South London, raised by a single mom in low-income housing. “Being a CEO wasn’t something I saw possible,” he said. Still, he knew he wanted to become a businessman, “whatever that meant at the time.” He started working at a call center while finishing up school and university. He didn’t have the grades during primary school, he said, but he did have grit. He studied architecture in college, graduated on a Friday, and was back on the sales floor by Monday. “Within a year, I was managing a team and working with startups as clients,” he said. “One of those startups became a unicorn, and I ended up joining them.” That was his foray into the world of venture and startups. He’s since worked as a chief of staff at high-growth companies, working for businesses both in the U.K. and Sweden. “Those years taught me how to build through chaos and stay relentlessly focused on the customer.” His ambition led him to the U.S. to launch his own company. Kerry said he and his team went straight to the source, sitting in small tax offices in Colorado and Arizona, observing how teams still relied on paper and fax machines. Filed will use its fresh capital to expand its team and hire more tax engineers. “Our long-term vision extends beyond return preparation to become the foundational AI infrastructure for the entire tax industry — transforming everything from client collaboration to document management and audit preparation,” Kerry said. “The industry has been waiting for its AI moment, and we’re just getting started,” he said.

The program,Llama for Startups, provides companies “direct support” from Meta’s Llama team, as well as funding in certain cases. Any U.S.-based firm that is incorporated, has raised less than $10 million in funding, has at least one developer on staff, and is building generative AI applications is eligible to apply by the May 30 deadline. “Members may receive up to $6,000 per month for up to six months to help them offset the costs of building and enhancing their generative AI solutions,” Meta wrote in ablog post. “Our experts will work closely with them to get started and explore advanced use cases of Llama that could benefit their startups.” The launch of the Llama startup program comes as Meta tries to cement its lead in the fiercely competitive open model space. While the tech giant’s Llama models have racked upmore than a billion downloads to date, rivals such as DeepSeek, Google, and Alibaba’s Qwen threaten to upend Meta’s efforts to establish a far-reaching model ecosystem. Not helping matters, Llama has suffered several setbacks over the past few months. The Wall Street Journal last weekreportedMeta has delayed the rollout of a flagship AI model, Llama 4 Behemoth, over concerns the model underperforms on key benchmarks. In April, Meta had tofend off allegations that it cheated on a popular crowdsourced AI benchmark, LM Arena. The company used a version of its Llama 4 Maverick model “optimized for conversationality” to achieve a high score on LM Arena, but released adifferent versionof Maverick publicly. Meta has huge ambitions for Llama — and its broader generative AI portfolio.Last year, the company made a prediction its generative AI products would rake in $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue in 2025, and between $460 billion and $1.4 trillion by 2035. Meta hasrevenue-sharing agreementswith some companies that host its Llama models. The company recentlylaunched an APIfor customizing Llama releases. And Meta AI, the company’s AI assistant powered by Llama, may eventually show ads and offer a subscription with additional features, CEO Mark Zuckerbergsaidduring the company’s Q1 earnings call. These products have proven costly to build.In 2024, Meta’s “GenAI” budget was more than $900 million, and this year, it could exceed $1 billion. That’s not including the infrastructure needed to run and train the models. Metapreviously saidit plans to spend $60 billion to $80 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, primarily on new data centers.

The agency said the process would “evaluate a potential mineral lease sale in the waters offshore American Samoa.” The administrative procedure requires a publication in the federal register and the solicitation of public feedback before considering any sales. Given the tone of the Secretary of the Interior’sstatementon the matter, the lease sale might be a foregone conclusion. “Critical minerals are fundamental to strengthening our nation’s resilience and safeguarding our national interests,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said. “By providing opportunities to responsibly access deep-sea mineral resources, we are supporting both American economic growth and national security.” Impossible Metals, a deep-sea mining startup, submitted a formal request for the leases in April. The company has developed an underwater autonomous vehicle that’s lowered by crane to the ocean floor, where it uses robotic claws to grab polymetallic nodules rich in minerals. Impossible Metals claims that its UAV is less disruptive to the fragile deep-water ecosystem than its competitors, many of which use vacuums to hoover up the nodules. Polymetallic nodules form over the course of millions of years, accumulating minerals that are dissolved in seawater, including manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper. As the world electrifies, demand for such critical minerals has skyrocketed. China’s dominance over key mineral markets like cobalt has also sent companies and governments searching for alternative sources. The lumps of metal have caught the eye of prospectors because they contain incredibly high concentrations of minerals, far higher than terrestrial mines typically recover. Ecologists and oceanographers have warned that mining operations in regions rich with polymetallic nodules risk disrupting fragile ecosystems. Life down deep grows slowly, and any disruption there would take decades to bounce back. Onerecent studyfound that microbial communities would need 50 years to recover from mining operations. Sponges and other creatures growing on the floor could be directly harmed by the mining robots, and those that are passed over would still have to cope with sediment plumes polluting the normally clear water. What’s more, the nodules themselves produce oxygen, suggesting they may help researchersfind life on other planets.

The audio summaries are voiced by what Amazon calls “AI-powered shopping experts” that discuss key product features, customer reviews, and information from across the web. The new AI product summaries can be accessed by tapping the “Hear the highlights” button in the Amazon Shopping app. Amazon will test the feature on products that typically require consideration before purchase, the company says. The idea behind the feature is to help Amazon customers save time while shopping and get important information through a conversational, discussion-style format. “The feature makes product research fun and convenient — it’s like having helpful friends discuss potential purchases to make your shopping easier, even if you’re multitasking or on the go,” the company wrote in their blog post. The summaries are currently available on select products to some U.S. customers. Amazon plans to roll out the feature to more products and to additional U.S. customers in the coming months. The company explains that the feature uses large language models (LLMs) to generate scripts by pulling from customer reviews and information from the web, and then transforms this content into short-form audio clips. Amazon says the new feature joins its current suite of AI-powered shopping features, which includesRufus, its generative AI shopping assistant, andInterests, an AI feature that monitors new products that match your interests. Amazon isn’t the only tech giant that’s leveraging short-form AI-powered audio to help users get informed in a quick, efficient way.

The company on Wednesday announced it has secured $50 million in a Series B round led by SignalFire with participation fromDick Costolo and Adam Bain’s VC firm 01 Advisors. Square CPO Saumil Mehta; the founders of business management software Squire, Songe LaRon and Dave Salvant; former Yelp SVP of Engineering Michael Stoppelman; and former Snap Engineering VP Ding Zhou also participated. To date, Siro has raised a total of $75 million. Founder Jake Cronin’s idea for Siro came from an experience in college. For a summer, he had the option of working at an amusement park or selling kitchen knives door to door. He chose the latter and earned good money from it. The next year, he opened an office to hire other sales reps and have them sell knives. But he realized that he couldn’t be on the ground to help coach all the junior reps. A few years later, after working at McKinsey, Cronin started building Siro — coding the core product himself. “When I was running the knives sales office, I realized a lot of sales work is manual, and good software could have a lot of value,” he told TechCrunch in an interview. “The more I researched sales, I thought that the biggest opportunity here is not in data enrichment or customer relationship management, but it is in improving the lives of sales reps who are on the ground.” Siro transcribes sales meetings via an app. Features include a company-wide dashboard where sales folks can submit successful calls and sort them by engagement from peers, allowing other reps to listen to top calls and get insights about improving on-ground sales visits. Cronin said that Siro trains models for specific industry verticals — for example, for HVAC sales coaching. The company also uses a general-purpose model to gauge how a salesperson is building rapport and handling rejections. Wayne Hu, a partner at SignalFire, said that the VC firm always wants to invest in companies that have a strong business advantage in data for particular segments. “Siro’s solution is helping digitize the ‘dark matter’ of offline conversations comprising field sales engagements, which has broad extensibility across verticals and depth in downstream actions that can be instrumented from this data, such as customer and product insights,” he told TechCrunch via email.

Ads may appear “where relevant” below and “integrated into” AI Mode responses as part of a test, Google says. AI Mode lets Google Search users ask a question and get an AI-generated response, with the ability to go deeper through follow-up questions and links to websites. “In some cases, a website builder might be a good next step [in an AI Mode query], so we may show a helpful ad that can help [users] get started,” explains Google in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. “From there, [the user] can ask questions to explore possible business ideas, what type of content they should develop, and even learn about their target audience.” Ads being Google’s primary cash cow — the company notched $66.89 billion in ad revenue in Q1 2025 alone — it was inevitable that they’d eventually make their way into whatmany seeas the future of Google Search. But that doesn’t mean users will be pleased. According to arecent pollby CivicScience, a consumer analytics platform, 36% of U.S. adults are wary of AI as it relates to advertising, saying they’d be less likely to purchase from a brand that uses AI in ads. Google says that advertisers already using its Performance Max, Shopping, and Search campaigns with “broad match” will be eligible to have their ads shown in AI Mode. Users in the U.S. will see ads, specifically Search and Shopping ads for now, in AI Mode across desktop and mobile. Several of Google’s rivals have experimented — or are considering experimenting — with ads in their AI products. AI-powered search engine Perplexity launchedadslast November and hasn’t ruled out collecting data outside its platform to sellmore targeted advertising. Microsoft briefly piloted ads in its Copilot chatbotseveral years ago. OpenAI, too,has saidthat it may one day adopt an ad-supported model to supplement subscriptions. In related news Wednesday, Google said that it will expand ads inAI Overviews, its Google Search feature that automatically synthesizes and summarizes answers to queries. Search and Shopping ads will soon appear on desktop in the U.S. ahead of an expansion to “select countries” on mobile and desktop in English. In AI Overviews, ads are inserted in AI-generated summaries “when relevant to both the query and the response provided,” Google says. They’re labeled as “Sponsored.” Googlefirstbrought ads to AI Overviews in the U.S. on mobile last October. Some publishers have argued that Google’s moves threaten their own ad revenue.

The latest company to enter this space isTED, the non-profit best known for its TED Talks featuring prominent figures like Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the late Pope Francis. On Wednesday, the company announced its new short-form video feature, aptly named “TED Shorts.” The feature has gradually rolled out to users since the beginning of May. Available on bothiOSandAndroiddevices, TED Shorts can be found in the middle of the navigation bar. By tapping the button, users are taken to a swipeable vertical feed featuring short snippets of TED Talks and other original content. Users can like videos, leave comments, and share with friends. TED teamed up withGenuin, a no-code platform for generative video experiences, to power the TikTok-like feature. As Genuin explained to TechCrunch, TED’s new feed will be personalized with AI, curating a selection of videos based on factors like personal interests, trending subjects, and other signals to surface the most relevant content for each viewer. TED Shorts is one of the more notable additions to the app, which hasn’t seen a significant update in its 15-year history. Since its launch in 2010, the app has primarily served as a destination for users to access TED Talks and other content via their mobile devices, such as educational animations and 26 podcasts spanning various topics like business, climate, and health. The new feature offers a way for users to discover highlights of their favorite speakers before committing to a full-length video. This is also the first time users can engage with one another within the TED app, fostering a sense of community that may have been previously lacking. TED already has a substantial following onYouTube(26.1 million),TikTok(2.8 million),Instagram(8.1 million), and other social media channels, indicating a demand for short video content. The launch of TED Shorts comes at a crucial time as the app seeks to boost its growth. Head of Product Tricia Maia tells TechCrunch that the app had been deprioritized “for several years,” which impacted its monthly active users and annual growth metrics. According to Appfigures, the app was downloaded 1 million times in 2024, a 17% decline compared to 1.2 million installs in 2023. To date, the company boasts more than 100 million app downloads globally. TED joins a growing number of companies adopting short-form video content as platforms compete for users’ attention. Earlier this month,Netflixrevealed that it’s experimenting with a short video feed for its mobile app. Meanwhile, TikTok faces apotential baninmid-June, although President Trumpplans to extend the deadlinefor a third time as deal negotiations continue. Should U.S. users lose access to TikTok, they might seekalternative platforms, and TED hopes they’ll turn to what it believes is higher-quality content compared to what’s found on other apps. “In an era of fragmented attention, people are actively seeking more thoughtful, less overwhelming ways to connect with new ideas, and with each other,” Maia said. “[TED Shorts] is our antidote to algorithm fatigue and doom-scrolling low-quality content.” The company plans to continue evolving TED Shorts over time to meet user needs while also exploring new ways to enhance community building. Maia added, “We’ll explore ways to add new community features, and expand community-driven features to other TED platforms, like our website … This could expand beyond video and mobile to a cross-platform community engagement experience where our audience won’t just watch videos, but can participate in truly personalized, topic-driven digital communities on a global scale.” This story was updated to correct total app installs from 30 million to 100 million.

Defying a contraction that issideliningmany newcomers, Weil just secured $80 million for Scribble’s third fund, its largest capital raise yet. The milestone underscores market confidence in Weil, a Stanford graduate whose resume includes a partner role at Andreessen Horowitz, corporate development at Twitter (now X), and stints at Silicon Valley stalwarts IVP and Menlo Ventures. “Everybody told me it was going to be the hardest to raise,” Weil said on a call Monday, after completing the 5:30 a.m. run and swim that puts this editor’s coffee routine to shame. Ultimately, she said, the firm exceeded its hard cap of $75 million after extending the fundraising period by three weeks. Scribble’s success comes amid what many consider a reckoning for the venture industry, particularly for newer managers who emerged during the funding boom of 2020-2021 and have yet to establish meaningful distributed proceeds to investors (DPI). “Being a harvester is part of venture capital, too,” Weil observed. “There’s so many emerging managers that never have had to go through that part.” What sets Scribble apart is what Weil calls the “Scribble Network,” a carefully cultivated ecosystem of operators and executives who not only provide deal flow and due diligence help, but invest alongside the firm. This network includes figures like Maggie Hott, who leads go-to-market at OpenAI; Jim Everingham, VP of Engineering at Meta; and Sheila Vashee, CMO of Figma. Weil’s husband, Kevin Weil, adds another powerful dimension to the firm’s network. As chief product officer at OpenAI and a Cisco board member, his technical and product expertise complements Elizabeth’s background in investment and corporate development. “We tell our founders, ‘Who from our extended network would you like to meet?’” Weil explained. “When they look at that market list and the menu, and they say, ‘I can just text this person?’ That’s incredible.” The approach has helped Scribble make successful early bets on companies like Whatnot, a live auction platform that reached a valuation ofnearly $5 billionin January; Atmo, an outfit that was founded byformer Googlersand is focused on AI-driven ultra-precise weather forecasting; and Poolside.ai, a Paris-based generative AI company founded by GitHub’s former CTO that was valued by its investors at$3 billionback in October. Other portfolio companies of Scribble, which now has $216 million in assets under management, include SpaceX and Figma. Scribble typically writes checks of $750,000 to $1.5 million, avoiding rigid ownership targets that might preclude collaboration with other investors. “I think the approach of saying ‘we must be at 14% or we walk’ isn’t the way to start off a relationship,” Weil noted. The firm’s first fund, raised in 2020, is already showing strong performance with a 4x multiple, Weil said, thanks in part to early distributions to investors from crypto positions in Mysten and Aptos. With the current focus on AI transforming the startup landscape, Weil sees the clearest opportunity yet to apply Scribble’s collaborative approach. “I think this is the best time to be a startup, but it’s the hardest time because there’s so much noise,” she said. “Everyone knows how to hack the channels, and finding product-market fit and go-to-market is just harder than ever.” Pictured above, from left to right, the Scribble Ventures team, including Christen O’Brien (operating partner); John Smothers (partner); Elizabeth Weil; and Kevin Weil (operator-in-residence).

Matthew D. Lane, 19, is accused of using stolen login credentials to access the network of an unnamed software company, which serves schools across North America and elsewhere, to steal the personal information of more than 60 million students and 10 million teachers. The stolen personal information included names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, medical information, and school grades. In some cases, the hackers stoledecades of historical student data. While the company was not named, federal prosecutors described specific details matching the data breach at education software maker PowerSchool, whichrevealed in Januarythat it had been hackedas far back as August and September 2024. The breach affected schools located mostly across the United States and Canada, which use the PowerSchool software to manage student grades, attendance, and other personal and health information. Prosecutors say Lane worked with an unnamed co-conspirator who lived in Illinois to extort the education software maker for about $2.85 million in cryptocurrency, according tothe criminal complaint. PowerSchool confirmed to TechCrunch in January that ithad paid the hackers to delete the stolen data, but refused to say how much it paid. Earlier this month, several school districts said that they had since faced extortion attempts from someone saying that the stolen student data had not been destroyed. PowerSchool said the extortion attempts were not related to a new incident, as the “samples of data match the data previously stolen in December.” NBC News wasfirst to reporton Lane’s plea agreement. PowerSchool spokesperson Beth Keebler said the company was aware of the filing, and deferred comment to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Massachusetts, which declined to name the victims, per an email from an unnamed spokesperson to TechCrunch. When asked, Keebler did not dispute the ransom amount as noted by the prosecutors. Lane is also accused of hacking and extorting another company, which prosecutors said was a U.S. telecoms provider. Prosecutors did not name the company in the plea agreement. Lane’s attorney Sean Smith did not respond to a request for comment. Updated with a response from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Massachusetts.

    "title": "Women with dense breasts should have extra NHS cancer scans, researchers say",
    "article_text": "Women with very dense breasts should be offered additional scans as part of the UK's NHS breast screening programme to help detect more cancers and save lives, researchers say. A Cambridge University-led study of more than 9,000 women found using different scans from traditional mammograms could treble the number of cancers detected in this group of women. Around one in 10 women have very dense breasts and they have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, however cancers are harder to spot in dense breasts because of the way mammograms (breast x-rays) work. This is because they look whiter on the x-rays, the same colour as early-stage cancers. The trial, co-ordinated from Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, tested different scanning methods on women with very dense breasts who had been given a mammogram and told they did not have cancer. It is only through mammograms that women and their health professionals can identify breasts that are very dense. Louise Duffield, 60, from Ely, Cambridgeshire, was one of the trial participants who had an early-stage breast cancer diagnosed. She had surgery to have the tumour removed within weeks. She says it was a \"big shock\" when she got the diagnosis. \"It's been a stressful time and it's a huge relief to have it gone. The tumour was deep in the breast so if I hadn't been on the trial, it could have gone unnoticed for years.\" The study, published in The Lancet, found two alternative methods, an enhanced mammogram and a fast MRI scan, detected 17-19 cancers per 1,000 women screened. Both techniques use injections to make blood vessels more visible – tumours in the breast have a lot of blood vessels. By contrast, traditional mammograms detect eight cancers in every 1,000 women screened. This amounts to more than 20,000 cancers currently detected each year. Women aged 50 to 71 are invited for breast screening every three years and around two thirds take up the offer. Based on the study results and that level of uptake, using the different scanning techniques on women with very dense breasts could identify 3,500 extra cancers per year and potentially save 700 lives. Prof Fiona Gilbert, who led the research, said she was convinced the new approach could make a difference. \"We need to change our national screening programme so we can make sure more cancers are diagnosed early, giving many more women a much better chance of survival.\" The Department of Health and Social Care said its screening advisory body had been looking at ways to improve detection rates in women with very dense breasts for a number of years. It said it would be reviewing the findings of this trial, but it was determined to \"fight cancer on all fronts\" to improve survival rates. A new national cancer plan for England is expected to be published later this year. Normally the insects are targeted with insecticide, but US researchers say anti-malaria drugs absorbed through their legs can stop them spreading disease.

    "title": "Scientists propose novel way of treating mosquitoes for malaria",
    "article_text": "Mosquitoes should be given malaria drugs to clear their infection so they can no longer spread the disease, say US researchers. Malaria parasites, which kill nearly 600,000 people a year, mostly children, are spread by female mosquitoes when they drink blood. Current efforts aim to kill mosquitoes with insecticide rather than curing them of malaria. But a team at Harvard University has found a pair of drugs which can successfully rid the insects of malaria when absorbed through their legs. Coating bed nets in the drug cocktail is the long-term aim. Sleeping under a bed net has been one of the most successful ways of preventing malaria as the main malaria-spreading mosquitoes hunt at night. Vaccines to protect children living in high-risk malaria areas are also recommended. Nets are both a physical barrier and also contain insecticides which kill mosquitoes that land on them. But mosquitoes have become resistant to insecticide in many countries so the chemicals no longer kill the insects as effectively as they used to. \"We haven't really tried to directly kill parasites in the mosquito before this, because we were just killing the mosquito,\" says researcher Dr Alexandra Probst, from Harvard. However, she says that approach is \"no longer cutting it\". The researchers analysed malaria's DNA to find possible weak spots while it is infecting mosquitoes. They took a large library of potential drugs and narrowed it down to a shortlist of 22. These were tested when female mosquitoes were given a blood-meal contaminated with malaria. In their article in Nature, the scientists describe two highly effective drugs that killed 100% of the parasites. The drugs were tested on material similar to bed nets. \"Even if that mosquito survives contact with the bed net, the parasites within are killed and so it's still not transmitting malaria,\" said Dr Probst. \"I think this is a really exciting approach, because it's a totally new way of targeting mosquitoes themselves.\" She says the malaria parasite is less likely to become resistant to the drugs as there are billions of them in each infected person, but less than five in each mosquito. The effect of the drugs lasts for a year on the nets, potentially making it a cheap and long-lasting alternative to insecticide, the researchers say. This approach has been proven in the laboratory. The next stage is already planned in Ethiopia to see if the anti-malarial bed nets are effective in the real world. It will take at least six years before all the studies are completed to know if this approach will work. But the vision is to have bed nets treated with both anti-malaria drugs and insecticide so that if one approach doesn't work, then the other will. Additional scans better tailored to spotting cancer in dense breasts could treble detection rates.

    "title": "'The mood is changing': Israeli anger grows at conduct of war",
    "article_text": "As Israel's war in Gaza enters a new, violent phase, a growing number of voices within the country are speaking out against it - and how it's being fought. Yair Golan, a left-wing politician and former deputy commander of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), sparked outrage on Monday when he said: \"Israel is on the way to becoming a pariah state, like South Africa was, if we don't return to acting like a sane country. \"A sane state does not wage war against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not set itself the goal of depopulating the population,\" he told Israeli public radio's popular morning news programme. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hit back, describing the comments as \"blood libel\". But on Wednesday, a former Israeli minister of defence and IDF chief of staff - Moshe \"Bogi\" Ya'alon - went further. \"This is not a 'hobby',\" he wrote in a post on X, \"but a government policy, whose ultimate goal is to hold on to power. And it is leading us to destruction.\" Just 19 months ago, when Hamas gunmen crossed the fence into Israel and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages - statements like these seemed almost unthinkable. But now Gaza is in ruins, Israel has launched a new military offensive, and, though it has also agreed to lift its 11-week blockade on the territory, justa trickle of aid has so far entered. Recent polling by Israel's Channel 12 found that 61% of Israelis want to end the war and see the hostages returned. Just 25% support expanding the fighting and occupying Gaza. The Israeli government insists it will destroy Hamas and rescue the remaining hostages. Netanyahu says he can achieve \"total victory\" - and he maintains a strong core of supporters. But the mood among others in Israeli society \"is one of despair, trauma, and a lack of a sense of ability to change anything\", says former Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin. \"The overwhelming majority of all the hostage families think that the war has to end, and there has to be an agreement,\" he adds. \"A small minority think that the primary goal of finishing off Hamas is what has to be done, and then the hostages will be freed\". On Sunday, around 500 protesters, many wearing T-shirts with the inscription \"Stop the horrors in Gaza\" and carrying pictures of babies killed by Israeli air strikes, attempted to march from the town of Sderot to the Gaza border, in protest at Israel's new offensive. They were led by Standing Together - a small but growing anti-war group of Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel. After attempting to block a road, the leader of the group Alon-Lee Green was arrested, along with eight others. From house arrest, Mr Green told the BBC: \"I think it's obvious that you can see an awakening within the Israeli public. You can see that more and more people are taking a position.\" Another Standing Together activist, Uri Weltmann, said he thinks there's a growing belief that continuing the war is \"not only harmful to the Palestinian civilian population, but also risks the lives of hostages, risks the lives of soldiers, risks the lives of all of us\". In April, thousands of Israeli reservists - from all branches of the military - signed letters demanding that Netanyahu's government stop the fighting and concentrate instead on reaching a deal to bring back the remaining hostages. Yet, many in Israel hold differing views. At the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza on Wednesday, the BBC spoke to Gideon Hashavit, who was part of a group protesting against aid being allowed in. \"They're not innocent people,\" he said of those in Gaza, \"they make their choice, they chose a terrorist organisation.\" It is against some of Israel's most extreme parts of society - settler groups - thatthe UK on Tuesday announced fresh sanctions. In its strongest move yet, the UK also suspended talks on a trade deal with Israel and summoned the country's ambassador - with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy calling themilitary escalation in Gaza \"morally unjustifiable\". The EU said it is reviewing its association agreement with Israel, which governs its political and economic relationship - with foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas saying a \"strong majority\" of members favoured looking again at the 25-year-old agreement. On Monday night, the UK joined France and Canada in signing a strongly worded joint statement, condemning Israel's military action and warning of \"further concrete actions\" if the humanitarian situation in Gaza did not improve. \"The mood is changing,\" says Weltmann, \"the wind is starting to blow in the other direction.\" Parents say children are having to drink unsafe and salty water, as fuel shortages threaten desalination and hygiene facilities. The shooting unfolded as the victims were exiting an event at the Capital Jewish Museum. Protesters were seen in videos calling for an end to the war and the removal of the armed group from Gaza Many nations have condemned the Israel military, which says a delegation visiting Jenin deviated from an agreed route. The UN agency says Israeli ground operations and evacuation orders are putting hospitals out of service or making them inaccessible.",

    "title": "Anti-Hamas protests in southern Gaza enter third day",
    "article_text": "Palestinians have taken to the streets in southern Gaza for a third day to protest against Hamas. Hundreds of demonstrators were seen in videos posted on social media calling for an end to the war and for the removal of the armed group from Gaza. \"Out! Out! Out! All of Hamas, out!\" they chanted. Speaking out against Hamas can be dangerous in Gaza and threats circulated on journalists' WhatsApp groups on Tuesday, forbidding them from publishing any \"negative news that could affect the morale of the people\". Activists said young people started the protests on Monday and were joined by others on their way to get food from community kitchens, who were still holding their pots. The protesters directed their anger at Hamas's leadership after an interview with senior official Sami Abu Zuhri circulated on social media. Speaking on a podcast which originally aired in late March, he said that the war with Israel was \"eternal\", adding: \"We will rebuild the houses and produce dozens more babies for each martyr.\" Videos from the protests in Khan Younis show young men criticizing Hamas for selling their \"blood for a dollar… To those with Hamas, be aware the people of Gaza will dig your grave\". In recent months, protests against Hamas have been on the rise in northern Gaza, but activists say the group's presence in the south has remained strong and it has successfully suppressed public dissent until now. International journalists including those with the BBC are blocked by Israel from reporting in Gaza and anti-Hamas sentiment remains difficult to assess from afar. Israel has carried out daily air strikes on Khan Younis since Monday, whenthe Israeli army issued residentswith one of the largest evacuation orders this year, telling those in the eastern half of the city to head immediately towards camps in the coastal al-Mawasi area. One man, who we are calling Alaa, was among those who started the protests. He agreed to speak to the BBC on condition of anonymity, for fear of reprisals from Hamas. \"The people do not care any more about Hamas' attempts to suppress their voice because they are literally dying from hunger, evacuation, and the bombings,\" he said. Alaa, who is originally from northern Gaza, said he had had to move around 20 times over the course of the 19-month war and could not afford to buy a tent for shelter. Previously imprisoned for taking part in anti-Hamas protests in 2019, Alaa said Hamas needed to leave. \"Resistance was not born with Hamas, and even if Hamas is gone, there will be other faces of resistance [to the Israeli occupation]. But this current policy will cost us all of Palestine and the nation.\" \"We just want our children to live in peace, and we deliver a message to the whole world, to try their best in pressuring Israel and Hamas so we can save us and our children from this war.\" In Gaza, public criticism of Hamas carries significant risks. In March, 22-year old Oday a-Rubai was abducted and tortured to death by armed gunmen after taking part in anti-Hamas protests in Gaza City. There are reports that others have been beaten, shot or killed for publicly opposing the group. Alaa said that as their protest approached Nasser hospital on Monday a group of men told them to stop. \"There was one man who wanted to pull out his gun, but his friend stopped him. They couldn't do anything because they were outnumbered by the number of protesters.\" Moumen al-Natour, who is a lawyer, former political prisoner, and co-founder of the anti-Hamas protest movement, We Want to Live, said: \"The fatigue, effort and cost of displacement is pushing people to revolt against Hamas who refuse to surrender and hand over their weapons.\" The United Nations says that since 15 May, more than 57,000 people have been displaced in southern Gaza due to the fighting and evacuation orders. More than 53,000 people have been killed across Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, 82 of them in the past 24 hours. Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas after the group's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel agreed on Sunday to allow a \"basic amount of food\" to enter Gaza, where global experts have warned of a looming famine. Baby Niveen was evacuated to Jordan for medical treatment, but has now been sent back to Gaza. The decision comes after students took part in demonstrations and protests last year. Dr Rose has been describing life at Nassar Hospital in Gazan city of Khan Younis. Fighter jets hit sites including a school in Gaza City, the Hamas-run civil defence agency says.",

    "title": "Gaza health system 'stretched beyond breaking point' by Israeli offensive, WHO warns",
    "article_text": "Intensified Israeli ground operations and new evacuation orders are stretching Gaza's health system beyond breaking point, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the Indonesian, Kamal Adwan and al-Awda hospitals in the northern towns of Beit Lahia and Jabalia were inside an evacuation zone announced on Tuesday. Another two hospitals are within 1km (0.6 miles) of it. Kamal Adwan was out of service due to hostilities nearby and the Indonesian hospital was inaccessible because of the presence of Israeli forces around it, he added. Al-Awda hospital is still functioning, but its director told the BBC on Wednesday that it was \"totally under siege\". \"Nobody can move out and we can't receive any cases from outside the hospital,\" Dr Mohammed Salha said. He added that there was a quadcopter drone \"shooting in the surroundings of the hospital and the outdoor area of the hospital\". \"We also hear shooting from the tanks... maybe 400 or 500 metres [away].\" Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that it was \"operating in the area against terror targets\", but that it was \"not aware of any siege on the hospital itself\". Dr Tedros said: \"Even if health facilities are not attacked or forced to evacuate, hostilities and military presence obstruct patients and staff from accessing care, and WHO from resupplying hospitals, which can quickly make them non-functional.\" \"We've seen this too many times - it must not be allowed to happen again.\" Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) also said that at least 20 medical facilities across Gaza had been damaged, or forced partially or completely out of service, in the past week by Israeli ground operations, air strikes and evacuation orders. The charity demanded that Israeli authorities stop what it called the \"deliberate asphyxiation of Gaza and the annihilation of its healthcare system\". Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive against Hamas two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire. It said it wanted to put pressure on Hamas to release its remaining 58 hostages, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive. After several days of intense bombardment, the IDF launched an expanded offensive on Sunday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said would see ground forces \"take control of all areas\" of Gaza. The plan reportedly includes completely clearing the north of civilians and forcibly displacing them to the south. More than 600 people have been killed and 2,000 injured across Gaza over the past week, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The UN says tens of thousands of people have been newly displaced. Netanyahu also said Israel would allow a \"basic\" amount of food into Gaza to prevent a famine. But the UN has so far been unable to collect the dozens of lorry loads of supplies allowed in since Monday. MSF said the volume of aid allowed in so far was not nearly enough, describing it as \"a smokescreen to pretend the siege is over\". On Tuesday, the WHO's representative in the Palestinian territories said he had recently returned from Gaza and witnessed how the health system was facing attacks and acute shortages of supplies. \"Every time you get into Gaza you always think it cannot get worse. But it gets worse,\" Dr Rik Peeperkorn told reporters in Geneva. He described how al-Awda hospital was \"overwhelmed with injuries\" and running low on supplies. Hostilities had damaged the facility, disrupted access and deterred people from seeking healthcare, he added. He said the Indonesian hospital was barely functioning, almost inaccessible, and that most patients had left last week after a staff member was killed, one patient was injured and the facility was damaged during intensified hostilities. Only 15 people, including patients and staff, were still inside the hospital as of Tuesday, urgently in need of food and water, he added. The hospital's generator was also struck by an Israeli quadcopter on Monday night, causing a large fire and a blackout, according to MER-C Indonesia, the NGO that built the facility. On Wednesday, a woman inside the hospital told the BBC by telephone that two of the patients were in a \"serious condition\". In the background of the call, crashes could be heard. \"Five minutes ago, there was intense shooting in the surroundings of the hospital,\" she said, adding that she could see tanks. The woman also said that they still had supplies of food inside the hospital, but were \"facing a water crisis\". The IDF told the BBC it was operating in the area around the hospital and targeting \"terrorist infrastructure sites\", but that it was not targeting the hospital itself. In another incident on Tuesday, a paramedic said his ambulance was shot at by an Israeli drone while he was transporting staff and food between al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals. Khaled Sadeh said he was with another ambulance when bullets hit both vehicles' windshields. Nobody was injured. Dr Salha shared photos of the ambulances and confirmed that Mr Sadeh was unable to return to al-Awda because of the threat of Israeli fire. The BBC supplied details of the allegations and photos to the IDF, but it said it \"could not confirm\" the reports. Hospitals and medical personnel are specially protected under international humanitarian law. Hospitals only lose that protection in certain circumstances. They include being used as a base from which to launch an attack, as a weapons depot, or to hide healthy fighters. The IDF has insisted that its forces operate in accordance with international law. In most instances where it has attacked hospitals, it has said they were being used improperly by Hamas - an allegation the group has denied. In the southern city of Khan Younis, the European hospital - the only facility providing neurosurgery, cardiac care and cancer treatment in Gaza - has been out of service since 13 May. That day, the hospital's courtyard and surrounding area was hit by a series of Israeli air strikes that Israel's defence minister said targeted an underground bunker where the head of Hamas's military wing, Mohammed Sinwar, was hiding. Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said the attack killed at least 28 people, but it is not clear yet whether Sinwar died. The facility has also been inside an Israeli-designated evacuation zone covering almost the entire eastern half of Khan Younis since Monday. Dr Tedros said Nasser, al-Amal and al-Aqsa hospitals, as well as one field hospital, were within 1km of the zone. Dr Victoria Rose, a British surgeon working at Nasser hospital,said in a video posted on social media on Wednesdaythat she was very worried about the facility being evacuated or cut off by an Israeli troops advance from al-Aqsa, which in the central town of Deir al-Balah. \"If we get cut off from the Middle Area, there really are no other hospitals around us that could cope with the evacuation of Nasser,\" she explained. \"We have some amazing field hospitals... but none of them are capable of doing the type of surgery that we're doing here. And none of them have ICU capacity or generated oxygen. So, even all of them together couldn't cope with the amount of patients that we have.\" She warned: \"If Nasser is evacuated, we really are looking at the imminent death of hundreds of patients because we won't be able to take them anywhere.\" Nasser was also hit by an Israeli strike on 13 May, killing two people including a Palestinian journalist who was being treated for injuries he sustained in a previous strike on a tented camp at the complex. The attack also destroyed 18 beds in a burns unit, according to the WHO. The IDF accused the journalist of being a Hamas operative and alleged that the hospital was being used by the group to \"carry out terrorist plots\". Another strike on Monday severely damaged Nasser's medical warehouse and destroyed critical WHO supplies, according to the hospital's director. Suha Shaath, a pharmacist from Khan Younis who has been told by the IDF to evacuate and head to camps in the coastal al-Mawasi area, told the BBC in a voice note: \"I have not left my house until now because I haven't found any place to set up my tent.\" \"The humanitarian situation is very serious - no water, no food, no fuel. The shelling is hitting everywhere,\" she added. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 53,655 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 3,509 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry. The shooting unfolded as the victims were exiting an event at the Capital Jewish Museum. Many nations have condemned the Israel military, which says a delegation visiting Jenin deviated from an agreed route. Israel agreed on Sunday to allow a \"basic amount of food\" to enter Gaza, where global experts have warned of a looming famine. Baby Niveen was evacuated to Jordan for medical treatment, but has now been sent back to Gaza.

    "title": "‘Smash the gangs' and end asylum hotels - are government promises being met?",
    "article_text": "The prime minister has made tackling illegal immigration and \"restoring order\" to the asylum system a priority for the government. Sir Keir Starmer has promised to \"smash the gangs\". It follows predecessor Rishi Sunak's pledge to \"stop the boats\". Yet small boat crossings have reached record levels for this point in the year. Ahead of the release of the latest official numbers on Thursday, BBC Verify looks at key government pledges - from ending the use of asylum hotels to returning more failed asylum seekers. Labour promised to \"end asylum hotels, saving the taxpayer billions of pounds\" in its general election manifesto. The government wants to fulfil this pledge by the end of this Parliament - meaning by 2029, unless an early election is called. However, according to figures obtained by BBC Verify via a Freedom of Information request, the number of hotels used to house asylum seekers was higher in December than when Labour took office in July. In July, 212 hotels were in use. By December, there were 218 - accommodating about 38,000 people. Once someone applies for asylum, they gain legal protections while awaiting a decision - including accommodation if they cannot support themselves financially. Almost everyone who arrives by small boat claims asylum - they made up a third of all asylum applications last year. Another large group of claimants were people already in the UK who had overstayed their visas. The asylum process determines whether a person can remain in the UK because they have a \"well-founded fear of persecution\" in their home country. Since 2020, the government has been increasingly reliant on hotels, partly because the supply of other types of asylum accommodation has not kept up with the numbers arriving in small boats. But using asylum hotels is expensive -costing £8m per day in 2023-24. As of 14 May, 12,699 people had arrived in the UK in small boats - up by a third compared with this time last year. To reduce the number of crossings, the government has pledged to disrupt the people-smuggling gangs behind them. But it is unclear how the government plans to measure its progress, or when the goal will be met. The Home Office told us data on actions taken by officials to disrupt criminal gangs was \"being collected and may be published in the future\". There is some information on efforts to prevent small boat crossings by French authorities - who, under a 2023 deal, are receiving £476m from the UK over three years. They say about 17,379 people were prevented from crossing between July and December 2024. We do not know what happened to them or whether they tried to cross again. There have been high-profile cases of UK-based smugglers being sentenced,including a man who helped smuggle more than 3,000 peopleand raids on the continent. And at the recent UK-EU summit both sidespledgedto work together on finding solutions to tackle illegal immigration. Illegal migration includes people who arrive on small boats, or hidden in lorries, and people who remain in the UK after their legal visa expires. The vast majority of UK immigration is legal - this includes people who have been granted permission to come to work, study, claim asylum or for other authorised purposes. Last year, about 43,000 people entered the UK illegally - about 4% of the nearly one million people who came to the UK legally in 2024. The government has also promised \"to clear the asylum backlog\". This refers to the backlog of claims by asylum seekers who are waiting to hear whether they will be granted refugee status and be allowed to remain in the UK. Since last summer, there has been a 50% increase in decisions on asylum cases. But despite this, the UK sawa record number of asylum applicationsacross the year, meaning the overall backlog has actually risen since the election. Under Labour, 41% of asylum claims were granted between October and December 2024. Another backlog the government wants to clear is the mountain of court appeals from asylum seekers following rejected claims. That backlog has also got worse since last summer's election, according to the latest figures. There were about 33,000 cases at the end of June, rising to nearly 42,000 in December - the highest total since at least 2015. The government has also promised to \"increase returns\" of people with no legal right to be in the UK. It said it would set up a new returns and enforcement unit with 1,000 extra staff. Between July 2024 (when Labour came to power) and May 2025,there were 29,867 returns recorded by the Home Office. This is up 12% compared to the same period 12 months ago. So the government is meeting this pledge but it is worth noting that just 7,893 people were forcibly removed - which could involve being escorted on a plane by an immigration official. The figures also show 8,511 failed asylum seekers were returned in this period but they do not say how many were enforced or voluntary. Separate government figures from July to December gave a fuller breakdown showing many of those who did leave voluntarily did so without government assistance of even its knowledge at the time,as BBC Verify has previously pointed out. This is despite repeated claims from ministers that the government has \"removed\" or even \"deported\" this many people. The Home Office says all returns outcomes are the result of collective efforts by the department. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? Norfolk MP Rupert Lowe asks Sir Keir Starmer if her jail term is an \"efficient\" use of prison. The project was set up to help men or women who are originally from Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine. Josephine Maurice took citizenships tests at various centres while disguised as both men and women. HM Immigration Enforcement said the man found at Chicken N Beer entered the UK on a small boat.

    "title": "How a joke about rice cost a Japan cabinet minister his job",
    "article_text": "When Japan's farm minister declared that he never had to buy rice because his supporters give him \"plenty\" of it as gifts, he hoped to draw laughs. Instead Taku Eto drew outrage - and enough of it to force him to resign. Japan is facing its firstcost-of-living crisis in decades, which is hitting a beloved staple: rice. The price has more than doubled in the last year, and imported varieties are few and far between. Eto apologised, saying he had gone \"too far\" with his comments on Sunday at a local fundraiser. He resigned after opposition parties threatened a no-confidence motion against him. His ousting deals a fresh blow to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's minority government, which was already struggling with falling public support. Rice can be a powerful trigger in Japan, where shortages have caused political upsets before. Riots over the soaring cost of rice even toppled a government in 1918. So it's not that surprising that rice prices have a role in Ishiba's plummeting approval ratings. \"Politicians don't go to supermarkets to do their grocery shopping so they don't understand,\" 31-year-old Memori Higuchi tells the BBC from her home in Yokohama. Ms Higuchi is a first-time mother of a seven-month-old. Good food for her postnatal recovery has been crucial, and her daughter will soon start eating solid food. \"I want her to eat well so if prices keep going up, we may have to reduce the amount of ricemy husband and I eat.\" It's a simple issue of supply and demand, agricultural economist Kunio Nishikawa of Ibaraki University says. But he believes it was caused by a government miscalculation. Until 1995, the government controlled the amount of rice farmers produced by working closely with agricultural cooperatives. The law was abolished that year but the agriculture ministry continues to publish demand estimates so farmers can avoid producing a glut of rice. But, Prof Nishikawa says, they got it wrong in 2023 and 2024. They estimated the demand to be 6.8m tonnes, while the actual demand, he adds, was 7.05m tonnes. Demand for rice went up because of more tourists visiting Japan and a rise in people eating out after the pandemic. But actual production was even lower than the estimate: 6.61m tonnes, Prof Nishikawa says. \"It is true that the demand for rice jumped, due to several factors - including the fact that rice was relatively affordable compared to other food items and a rise in the number of overseas visitors,\" a spokesperson for the agriculture ministry told the BBC. \"The quality of rice wasn't great due to unusually high temperatures which also resulted in lower rice production.\" Rice farmers have been unable to make enough money for many years, says 59-year-old Kosuke Kasahara, whose family have been in farming for generations. He explains that it costs approximately 18,500 yen ($125.70; £94.60) to produce 60kg of rice but the cooperative in his area of Niigata on the west coast of Japan offered to buy it last year at 19,000 yen. \"Until three or four years ago, the government would even offer financial incentives to municipalities that agreed to reduce rice production,\" he adds. The ministry spokesperson confirms that the government has offered subsidies to those choosing to produce wheat or soybeans instead of rice. Meanwhile, younger farmers have been choosing to produce different types of rice that are used for sake, rice crackers or fed to livestock because demand for rice in Japan had been falling until last year. \"I got tired of fighting retailers or restaurants that wanted me to sell rice cheaply for many years,\" says Shinya Tabuchi. But that's been flipped on its head, with the going rate for 60kg of rice today at 40,000 to 50,000 yen. While higher prices are bad news for shoppers, it means many struggling farmers will finally be able to make money. But as the public grew angry with the surge, the government auctioned some of its emergency reserves of rice in March to try to bring prices down. Many countries have strategic reserves - stockpiles of vital goods - of crude oil or natural gas to prepare for exceptional circumstances. In Asia, many governments also have stockpiles of rice. In recent years, Japan's rice stockpile had only been tapped in the wake of natural disasters. \"The government has always told us that they would not release its emergency rice stocks to control the price so we felt betrayed,\" Mr Tabuchi says. Despite the government's rare decision to release rice, prices have continued to rise. The cost of rice is also soaring in South East Asia, which accounts for almost 30% of global rice production - economic, political and climate pressures have resulted in shortages in recent years. In Japan though the issue has become so serious that the country has begun importing rice from South Korea for the first time in a quarter of a century, even though consumers prefer homegrown varieties. PM Ishiba has also hinted at expanding imports of US rice as his government continues to negotiate a trade deal with Washington. But shoppers like Ms Higuchi say they are unlikely to buy non-Japanese rice. \"We've been saying local production for local consumption for a long time,\" she says. \"There has to be a way for Japanese farmers to be profitable and consumers to feel safe by being able to afford home-grown produce.\" This divides opinion among farmers. \"You may hear that the industry is ageing and shrinking but that is not necessarily true,\" says Mr Tabuchi, who believes the sector has been too protected by the government. \"Many elderly farmers can afford to sell rice cheaply because they have pensions and assets but the younger generation has to be able to make money. Instead of guaranteeing the income of all the farmers and distorting the market, the government should let unprofitable farmers fail.\" Mr Kasahara disagrees: \"Farming in rural areas like ours is about being part of a community. If we let those farmers fail, our areas will be in ruins.\" He argues the government should set a guaranteed buying price of 32,000 to 36,000 yen per 60kg of rice which is lower than today's price but still allows farmers to be profitable. And given what happened to Eto, it is also a sensitive topic for politicians. The country is due to hold a key national election this summer so pleasing both consumers and farmers - especially the elderly in both camps who tend to vote more - is crucial. The failed launch \"severely damaged the dignity and pride of our nation in an instant,\" says the North Korean leader. He has been accused of endangering India's sovereignty and inciting religious tensions - a charge he denies. It is the third such incident this month, stoking security concerns. The Lisbon Maru was torpedoed by a US submarine in October 1942 which did not know it was carrying PoWs. Japan's capital recorded a record number of deaths from heatstroke last year.",

    "title": "Israel's Eurovision result prompts questions over voting system",
    "article_text": "Israel's success in the public vote at last weekend's Eurovision Song Contest has prompted calls from a string of countries to examine the results and voting system. Singer Yuval Raphael came top of the viewer vote on Saturday with her ballad New Day Will Rise, but finished second overall to Austria when jury scores were also taken into account. Broadcasters in Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Iceland and Finland have since raised concerns or questions about the public vote, with some requesting an audit. Eurovision organisers the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said the vote had been independently checked and verified, that they took any concerns seriously. Israel was ranked joint 14th by the national juries, but shot up the leaderboard thanks to the results of the phone and online vote. Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom were among the countries whose viewers awarded Israel the maximum 12 points, with Ireland and Finland giving 10. Irish broadcaster RTE has asked for a full breakdown of the voting from organisers. That came after Spanish broadcaster RTVE said it would request an investigation of the results and a review of the televoting system. Viewers can currently vote up to 20 times each by phone, text or app. Katia Segers, a Flemish MP, said: \"A system in which everyone can cast up to 20 votes is a system that encourages manipulation. \"Whether this manipulation occurred in our country and all other participating and non-participating countries must be investigated.\" A spokesperson for Flemish public broadcaster VRT said: \"We have no indication that the counting of the televotes wasn't carried out correctly, but we are asking for complete transparency on the part of the EBU. \"The question is above all whether the current system guarantees a fair reflection of the opinion of viewers and listeners.\" Finland's YLE said: \"We will definitely ask the EBU whether it is time to update these rules or at least examine whether the current rules allow for abuses.\" On Tuesday, Dutch public broadcasters Avrotros and NPO issued a statement saying the contest was \"increasingly influenced by societal and geopolitical tensions\". Israel's involvement \"raises the question of whether Eurovision still truly functions as an apolitical, unifying, and cultural event\", they said. In response, the contest's director Martin Green said organisers were \"in constant contact with all participating broadcasters\" and \"take their concerns seriously\". \"We can confirm that we have been in touch with several broadcasters since Saturday's Grand Final regarding voting in the competition,\" he continued. There will now be a \"broad discussion\" with participating broadcasters \"to reflect and obtain feedback on all aspects of this year's event\", he said. \"It is important to emphasise that the voting operation for the Eurovision Song Contest is the most advanced in the world and each country's result is checked and verified by a huge team of people to exclude any suspicious or irregular voting patterns. \"An independent compliance monitor reviews both jury and public vote data to ensure we have a valid result. \"Our voting partner Once has confirmed that a valid vote was recorded in all countries participating in this year's Grand Final and in the Rest of the World.\" Eurovision News, which is operated by the EBU,  said an agency of the Israeli government paid for adverts and used state social media accounts to encourage people to vote for the Israeli entry. Mr Green said that did not break the rules. The US singer is accused of assault at a nightclub in central London in 2023. Rapper AJ hopes by sharing her past she can inspire working-class youngsters into the music industry. Bedford Corn Exchange hosts a range of entertainment including music, comedy and theatre. Harvey is invited to a top music school after teaching himself in just five months. French police came across the statue by chance during an unrelated investigation.",

    "title": "Mark Gordon blames baby's death on police manhunt, court hears",
    "article_text": "Mark Gordon has blamed the police manhunt for the death of his newborn baby Victoria. \"If it had naturally played out, I believe the baby would have been alive today,\" the court heard as he gave evidence for the first time during his retrial at the Old Bailey in London. Gordon, 50, and his partner Constance Marten, 38, deny manslaughter by gross negligence and causing or allowing the death of a child. Their daughter's decomposed body was found in a shopping bag in a Brighton allotment shed in March 2023, two months after they went on the run. During the previous trial, Marten and Gordon were found guilty of concealing Victoria's birth and perverting the course of justice by not reporting her death. Gordon no longer has barristers to represent him, so the judge Mark Lucraft KC asked him questions to lead him through his evidence. Talking of Marten, he described her as his \"beautiful, noble wife\" and \"a passionate strong individual\". But he said the couple face opposition. He said it \"made it very difficult for us who were in love, sincerely in love\". Wearing a blue shirt and a peach headwrap, he told the jury that private detectives hired by Marten's family were following them and observing them. Explaining why he and Marten started living in hotels and holiday lets before and after the birth of their fifth child Victoria, he said \"she wanted some time with the baby\" and the couple never would have predicted what went on to happen. \"It was a range of calamitous events, one after the other,\" he said. It was after their car caught fire in January 2023 that police realised the couple had another baby, leading to detectives launching a public appeal for the couple. Gordon told the jury \"if that manhunt hadn't happened… who knows what could have happened\". \"No laws were being broken to justify a national manhunt,\" he said. \"There are risk assessments that you should do, people - if somebody's on the side of a ledge about to jump off, you don't rush them.\" He added: \"If it had naturally played out, I believe the baby would have been alive today.\" \"Who gave the command to do a national manhunt?\" he asked. \"We are not silly people. We are not irresponsible people. \"My position is firmly is that had the manhunt not taken place, these circumstances would not have happened. \"Paranoia - call it what you want - but definitely not criminal intent,\" he told the court. \"It was as if we had become fugitives and terrorists overnight.\" Talking about how the couple felt when their first four children were removed he said: \"When someone doesn't have a child around them it affects them psychologically… when a parent loses a child they lose part of themselves.\" He told the jury it is \"bad enough\" to lose Victoria, who he has not \"had time to grieve\". \"When I was apprehended I was dehydrated, malnourished and completely out of my head,\" he explained. \"It is very important to consider, when you consider this allegation that has been made about us, our state of mind.\" As he spoke about the death of \"blessed, beautiful baby Victoria\", he became emotional and started crying. He said he was asleep when Marten had been feeding the baby and was in a \"state of shock and complete disbelief\" when he woke up and was told Victoria was not moving. \"It was a surreal moment for me. She was holding my baby's limp body in her arms,\" he said. \"At no point in time did we intentionally or recklessly put that baby at harm... We never wanted her to come to harm. I want you to know that,\" he said. \"We're seen like we are monsters - it is a horrible thing to see your life destroyed... Our names have been dragged through the mud\". \"Our baby is dead, she's gone. What more do you want? he asked. \"Don't put people in prison who don't need to be in prison.... We are the ones who have to live with what has happened forever.\" \"This isn't the right way to handle this case,\" he told the jurors. The trial continues.",

    "article_text": "A British teenager held in prison in Georgia on suspicion of drug offences has been described as \"not far from childhood\" by her new lawyer. Bella Culley, 18, from Billingham on Teesside, has had the first meeting with her new family-appointed lawyer Malkhaz Salakaia, who said he had to explain to her where she was geographically. She is being detained for 55 days before trial while the prosecution investigates where the 12kg (26lbs) of marijuana and 2kg (4.4lbs) of hashish found in a travel bag came from, and whether she was planning on handing it over to someone else. Mr Salakaia said Miss Culley was in \"good health\" but he would not describe her as an adequate adult. The lawyer, who does not speak English and specialises in juvenile law, has been communicating with his client using a translator. Their first meeting lasted two hours inprison number 5, near the town of Rustavi. Mr Salakaia said his client was in good health, did not have any complaints about the place of detention and was ready to defend herself in court. When asked whether he would describe Miss Culley as an adequate adult, his answer was \"no\". He said he had the impression she was \"not far from childhood\". During their meeting, the 18-year-old was also giving evidence to Georgian investigators. Miss Culley asked for advice about what to say and on some questions she chose to remain silent. At the previous pre-trial hearing on 13 May, Miss Culley told the court she was pregnant. Georgian Police said officers had seized marijuana and the narcotic drug hashish in a travel bag at Tbilisi International Airport. The BBC understands Miss Culley arrived in Tbilisi on a flight from Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates, on 10 May. The BBC has been told the British Embassy has advised the teenager's family not to speak to the press. Miss Culley was charged by Georgian police with illegally buying, possessing and importing large quantities of narcotics. A spokesperson said the arrest was the result of a joint operation between multiple departments and, if she was found guilty, Miss Culley could face up to 20 years in jail or life imprisonment.

    "title": "Low chance tornado could hit UK as rain forecast for bank holiday weekend",
    "article_text": "Wednesday's wet and windy weather comes after a record dry start to May There is a low chance of a small tornado on Wednesday as the UK faces a wet and windy bank holiday weekend. Forecasters say the chance of a tornado or isolated funnel cloud is extremely low and no warning has been issued by the Met Office. A funnel cloud is a cone-shaped cloud that reaches towards the ground but never touches it - if it does, then it becomes a tornado. The country has seen a change to wetter conditions on Wednesday with scattered heavy downpours and thunderstorms affecting affecting parts of the Midlands and southern England. The unsettled weather is set to continue on Saturday with spells of rain, turning heavy rain in the north and west, and into Sunday with wind in the north-west and showers in the west. It comes after the driest start to spring in more than a century. Rain is expected in most places on Saturday Downpours and thunderstorms are not unusual for UK weather in spring, and the risk of any particular place seeing a tornado on Wednesday is extremely low. No tornadoes have been reported so far. A Met Office spokesperson said: \"Funnel clouds and small scale tornadoes are possible in the UK in the sort of weather set up we have at the moment, with an unstable atmosphere and warm surface temperatures from the prolonged dry spell and strong sunshine. \"Any tornado would only be small scale and there is no warning. \"The risk is now diminishing as temperatures cool into the evening.\" Areas around Brighton and Hove have seen the worst rain so far, with around 0.3in (8mm) of rainfall recorded in Plumpton, East Sussex. The showers and thunderstorms should quickly die out during the evening. Northern parts of the UK have been largely sunny, with the wet weather affecting the south. Thursday is set to be a drier day with few showers across parts of the South West, and Friday is expected to mostly fine. On Saturday it will be a cloudy start for most. The best of any sunshine is likely to be in the south-east of England. There will be some patchy rain at times in the west, with the heaviest bursts and strongest winds across north-west Scotland. Temperatures will range between 17â20C. Sunday is likely to be the better day of the weekend. A mixture of sunshine and showers, mostly in the north and west, with gusts exceeding 45mph. It will feel cooler in the showers, with highs of 14-17C, but further south and east it will be a little warmer, potentially reaching 22C. Then for bank holiday Monday, with low pressure still anchored to the north of the UK, the showery theme continues. Expect a blustery day of sunshine and showers, and some of these could be heavy and thundery. This spring is currently thedriest spring in over a centurybut there are still a couple of weeks of May to go. May has been a pretty dry month so far - many sites have seen below 20% of the average rainfall. As of last Friday, 3.2in (80.6mm)  of rain had been recorded for the UK this spring. Some areas of the UK have gone three weeks with no measurable rain, leading to the Environment Agency warning of a 'medium' risk of drought without significant rainfall. Many of the UK's rivers also hit exceptionally low levels in May. Dry and sunny weather has also led to a larger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared with any other entire year. The high pressure which has been in charge so far during May, bringing us that warm and sunny weather, is on the move - with everything set to change this weekend as low pressure moves in from the Atlantic, bringing a spell of much-needed rain. Wet and windy across the bank holiday weekend at times, but Sunday is looking to be the better day The late May bank holiday doesn't have the best track record for sunshine. Over the past two decades, just seven out of 20 have been dry or mostly dry across the UK. The other 13 were marked by rain or cooler, unsettled conditions - and this year looks likely to follow that well-worn path. Do not expect any significant change in the weather pattern as we move into the following week. The outlook remains changeable, with sunshine, showers and blustery winds continuing into early June.

    "title": "Enhanced Games swimmer 'breaks world record'",
    "article_text": "Gkolomeev set his 'world record' time in a behind-closed-doors time trial in North Carolina in February The Enhanced Games - a controversial new event which promotes banned performance-enhancing drugs - says one of its athletes has beaten a long-standing world record. Organisers said Greece's Kristian Gkolomeev swam 20.89 seconds in a 50m freestyle time trial in the US in February, 0.02 seconds quicker than the world record set by Brazil's Cesar Cielo in 2009. Gkolomeev, who finished fifth at the 2024 Olympics in 21.59, began taking banned substances after signing up for the Enhanced Games in January. At a glitzy launch in Las Vegas on Wednesday, the Enhanced Games announced the city as the host of its inaugural event from 21-24 May 2026. The Enhanced Games are planned to be an annual competition, initially comprising short-distance swimming, sprinting and weightlifting, where participants will use drugs banned from elite sport. It has been criticised for endangering athletes' health and undermining fair play. However, it has also attracted heavyweight backing from a venture capital fund headed up by Donald Trump Jr, the US president's son, and billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel. For his 'world record' in North Carolina, USA, 31-year-old Gkolomeev was wearing a full-length polyurethane 'supersuit', which wasbanned from competitionby swimming authorities a few weeks after Cielo set the world record in one. However, in another attempt in April, Gkolomeev swam 21.03 in textile 'jammer' shorts, which comply with current World Aquatic regulations. That time is 0.01secs faster than anyone has gone without the aid of 'supersuits', beating a mark set by American nine-time Olympic champion Caeleb Dressel. The Enhanced Games say the two times are legitimate, with Gkolomeev's swims recorded using the same timing equipment deployed at the Olympics, staged at a certified pool which has hosted the past four US Open events, and overseen by experienced officials. Neither mark will be recognised by World Aquatics. \"The Enhanced Games are not a sporting competition built on universal values like honesty, fairness and equity: they are a circus, built on shortcuts,\" read a statement from swimming's world governing body. \"The enduring power of athletes to serve as role models for children and adults alike relies on their talent, hard work, respect and friendship. That's what we see in our champions and in our competitions, and that's what we'll continue to showcase.\" Gkolomeev received a $1m prize for beating a world record time, an incentive that the Enhanced Games have used to lure athletes since being was founded by Australian entrepreneur and lawyer Aron D'Souza in 2023. The mind behind the 'Doped Games' Magnussen to make doping 'world record' attempt \"The Enhanced Games gave me the resources and the team to unlock a new level of performance - and now the whole world can see what's possible,\" said Gkolomeev, whose previous 50m freestyle best was 21.44, winning silver behind Britain's Ben Proud at the European Championships in Edinburgh in 2018. He added that his body shape changed considerably between doping for two weeks in advance of beating Cielo's record in Feburary and then going quicker than Dressel in textile shorts in April. \"On the second attempt I was on a full two-month cycle,\" he added. \"I had an extra 10lbs of lean muscle â we did a pretty good job with my coach in that short amount of time to get used by my new strength and weight in the water. It was a very good result.\" The Enhanced Games did not reveal what substances he had taken, citing personal confidentiality and concern that others would follow Gkolomeev's regime unsupervised. It said they were prescribed \"medically and legally\". Organisers say they allow participants to take only \"medically prescribable and legally approved\" substances under clinical supervision, and that they are confident they will comply with the Drug Enforcement Administration laws in the US. Ukraine's Andrii Govorov, the 33-year-old 50m butterfly world record holder, and 21-year-old Bulgarian Josif Miladinov, a European 100m butterfly silver medallist, have also signed up. Govorov announced his retirement from Olympic sport this week. \"This choice wasn't easy,\" hewrote on Instagram.,external \"I spent a long time reflecting - putting everything I care about on the scale. Competing in Los Angeles [in 2028] was my dream. But life had other plans.\" The recruitment of Gkolomeev, Govorov and Miladinov is a coup for the Enhanced Games after critics claimed it would struggle to convince established names, still in their prime, to cross the divide. Australian former world champion James Magnussen, 34, came out of retirement to join the Enhanced Games in 2024, but his attempt to beat the 50m freestyle world record fell well short, recording a best time of 22.73. The Enhanced Games have aspirations to have a 100-strong roster of participants in next year's event. Organisers will build a four-lane 50m pool, a six-lane sprint track and a weightlifting venue at Resorts World in Las Vegas. The project also plans to market \"performance and longevity enhancements\" to the general public this summer. The Enhanced Games have been roundly criticised by senior figures in anti-doping and sports administration. Travis Tygart, chief executive of the US Anti-Doping Agency, called it a\"clown show\",externaland the World Anti-Doping Agency described it as a\"dangerous and irresponsible project\".,external Speaking in November, Brent J Nowicki, the executive director of World Aquatics, said it was\"a farce, and an extremely dangerous one\",external, adding that those who took part should be banned from sport for life. Jane Rumble, chief executive of UK Anti-Doping (Ukad), told BBC Sport: \"We are really, really concerned by this concept. \"It flies in the face of everything Ukad stands for and it flies in the face of fair play. \"Any sporting event which permits performance-enhancing drugs is ultimately unsafe - unhealthy for athletes. It is not good for their wellbeing. \"There are also much broader societal implications. It is well documented that steroid use has been linked to domestic violence and aggression in the nighttime economy.\" A Ukadsurvey,externalpublished this week said 85% of UK teenagers supported banning athletes caught taking prohibited drugs. Rumble said Ukad is unaware of any British athletes being approached by the Enhanced Games, but is planning for the possibility. \"We have clearly thought through that scenario,\" she said. \"There is the possibility of bans from sport for athletes taking part. If you are recently retired but still affiliated to a sports body, we could well be looking at taking action.\" Jim McVeigh, professor of substance use and associated behaviours at Manchester Metropolitan University, said organisers' assurances about athletes' safety were \"ignorant or deliberately misleading\". \"They are focusing on the power sports - sprinting, lifting and swimming - and, for those events, athletes will take anabolic agents,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Athletes won't use just in the weeks before. If it is $1m, those people are going to be training now. Are organisers looking out for them? Have they started their supervision? \"In the last 10 years we have really improved our understanding of the long-term effects of steroid abuse as a population of steroid users who started in 1990s have got to a certain age. \"There are the effects on the cardiovascular system, but the big turn-up has been the impact it has on the brain. Many people will never return to normal hormonal production and function. \"We know people in the Enhanced Games are going to be taking high doses because they know everyone else is free to.\" Enhanced Games officials say that by bringing the use of performance-enhancing drugs into the open and under the guidance of doctors, their event will be safer than conventional sport. They point to astudy,externalof the 2011 World Athletics Championships where athletes' responses to an anonymised survey suggested almost 44% had taken a banned substance in the previous year. Asurvey,externalof athletes in the UK in 2022 indicated that about 13% of athletes knowingly doped. Kristian Gkolomeev won the European 50m freestyle title in June Gkolomeev was born in the Bulgarian city of Velingrad in 1993. His father, Tzvetan Golomeev, represented Bulgaria at the Olympics in Moscow in 1980 and Seoul in 1988. Gkolomeev's mother died of medical complications shortly after his birth, and the family moved to Greece when he was young. He began swimming aged five, won junior medals at world and European level and raced at London 2012 as a teenager, finishing 31st fastest in the 100m freestyle. After the Games, Gkolomeev was recruited to the University of Alabama by former British Olympic coaches Dennis Pursley and Jonty Skinner, where he studied human performance exercise science alongside his swimming. He won two collegiate titles before beginning his professional career. In addition to fifth-place finishes at Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024, he won a world silver medal in the 50m freestyle in Gwangju in 2019 and the European title in Belgrade in 2024.

    "title": "Ukrainian ex-top official shot dead outside Madrid school",
    "article_text": "A former leading Ukrainian official has been shot dead outside an American school in the Spanish capital Madrid, authorities have confirmed. Andriy Portnov, 51, had just dropped his children off at the school in the Pozuelo de Alarcón area of the city and was walking to his car in the school parking area. At least one unidentified attacker fired several shots at the victim before fleeing into a wooded area in a nearby public park, witnesses said. Portnov had been an MP and deputy head in the administration of Viktor Yanukovych,the pro-Russian president ousted in 2014after months of protests. He had previously been an MP in Yulia Tymoshenko's governing party, but switched to Yanukovych's team when he won the presidential election in 2010. He left Ukraine after the revolution only to return in 2019 after Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president. He then left Ukraine again, and in 2021 was sanctioned by the US Treasury, which said he had been \"widely known as a court fixer\" who had taken steps to control the judiciary and undermine reform efforts. It was not clear who was behind the shooting that took place at about 09:15 local time (07:15 GMT) on Wednesday, reportedly as children were still entering the school. Witnesses said there had been five or six shots. One student told Spanish TV he thought they were \"firecrackers or fireworks\".  A woman who had rushed to Portnov's aid began to scream, according to El Mundo newspaper. Police drones and a helicopter searched the area for a gunman who, according to witnesses, was a thin man in a blue tracksuit. Spanish reports suggested the gunman may have had at least one accomplice riding on a motorbike. Hours after the shooting no arrests had been made. A similar gun attack took place in 2018, when a Colombian drug trafficker was fatally shot outside a British Council school a few kilometres away. But the motive behind Wednesday's attack is not yet known. Emergency services at the scene could only confirm that that Portnov had suffered several bullet wounds in the back and the head. Portnov's black Mercedes car was cordoned off and the school wrote to parents to confirm that all the students inside were safe. His body was later taken away for a post mortem examination. Portnov had successfully challenged a series of lawsuits against him in recent years, both in Ukraine and abroad. The European Union imposed sanctions on Portnov, but he challenged the move in court and won the case. Ukraine's SBU security service had also opened a case for suspected treason over Russia's annexation of Crimea but that was dropped when it concluded no offence had been committed. Although Ukraine's intelligence services have been linked to several killings in Russia and occupied areas of Ukraine, a fatal attack in Spain in February last year was linked to Russian hitmen. The victim, a Russian helicopter pilot, was shot dead near Alicante, months after defecting to Ukraine. Authorities in Kyiv said they had offered to protect Maxim Kuzminov in Ukraine, but he is believed to have moved to Spain's south-east coast under a false identity.",

    "article_text": "This video can not be played Dunkley stars as England see off West Indies First T20, Canterbury West Indies 146-7 (20 overs):Matthews 100* (67); Bell 2-29 England 150-2 (16.3 overs):Dunkley 81* (56); Fletcher 1-27 England won by eight wickets; lead series 1-0 Scorecard England's new era under captain Nat Sciver-Brunt and coach Charlotte Edwards started with a comfortable eight-wicket win in the first T20 against West Indies in Canterbury. The tourists posted 146-7 after captain Hayley Matthews' superb unbeaten century, but England made light work of the chase by reaching the target in 16.3 overs thanks to Sophia Dunkley's brilliant 81 not out from 55 balls. Sciver-Brunt fell for a duck in her first match as permanent skipper, but her predecessor Heather Knight finished 43 not out alongside opener Dunkley. Matthews' sensational solo effort held West Indies together, with Mandy Mangru's 17 the second-highest score after they had slipped to a dismal 87-6. She reached her 67-ball ton from the final ball of the innings, having expertly farmed the strike as the wickets tumbled around her, with England's Lauren Bell taking 2-29. England's new-look bowling attack after their Ashes humiliation included a recall for fast bowler Issy Wong, who took 1-35, while fellow seamer Em Arlott performed admirably with 1-28 on her international debut. The three-match T20 series continues at Hove on Friday, and is followed by three one-day internationals. England to bring in minimum fitness standards Sciver-Brunt's eclectic journey from Tokyo to England captain This video can not be played Dunkley hits four towards backward point to raise half-century The fallout from England's 16-0 thrashing in the Ashes that started the year resulted in a new captain and coach, and constant references to starting with a clean slate. England were presented with a below-par target, but delivered on their promises at the first time of asking. Opener Danni Wyatt-Hodge, dropped from the ODI side, only managed 17 but Dunkley continued her fine form from the winter when she was one of England's rare bright sparks in a miserable campaign. West Indies bowlers struggled for consistency on a chilly evening, offering far too much width as she dominated through the covers and down the ground with 12 fours in her knock. Meanwhile Knight looked rejuvenated without the shackles of captaincy, seemingly happy to support Dunkley's attacking approach as she kept to a simple plan of rotating the strike and punishing the bad balls in their unbroken stand of 94. West Indies offered little threat with the ball, with their spin-heavy attack struggling to extract any help from the surface. Despite England's struggles against slow bowling in the past, both Knight and Dunkley were proactive, using their feet and playing with more conviction and confidence than seen at any point over the winter. This video can not be played Matthews' brilliant century salvages West Indies innings With injuries to three of West Indies' other experienced batters in Deandra Dottin, Chinelle Henry and Stafanie Taylor, the pressure on Matthews shoulders was even greater than usual. Given their depleted resources, the tourists started cautiously and crawled to 37-2 from the powerplay after Bell's double-wicket maiden in the fourth over, with opener Qiana Joseph dismissed for two and Zaida James caught behind for a duck. Wong and Arlott bowled with lively pace and bounce to unsettle the middle order, while the spin of Charlie Dean and Linsey Smith stifled them to ensure that England did not miss Sophie Ecclestone too much - and at 87-6 in the 14th over, the tourists' innings looked to be stuttering to a sorry end. But Matthews was unfazed, familiar with the role of carrying her team's batting line-up. She was dropped by Charlie Dean on 73, albeit a very difficult one-handed chance at cover, but was otherwise sublime. Any width was greeted by her trademark elegant drives and she struck the spinners firmly down the ground, the only partnership of note coming for the seventh wicket as she shared a stand of 47 with Mangru. Starting the final over on 89, Matthews struck a four off Bell before having to turn down singles to keep herself on strike. A wide gifted an extra ball, and a scampered single saw her reach her third T20 century. West Indies' recentfailure to qualify for the autumn's 50-over World Cuphas given their tour a rather different outlook, with younger players likely to be given more opportunities and chances to experiment - but any possibility of success already appears to rely solely on their captain's brilliance.

It was brilliant to watch.\" West Indies captain and player of the match Hayley Matthews:\"It was a good day for myself but unfortunate not to get the win. We were 15 or 20 runs short. \"It is always pretty good to get a hundred. Hopefully, I can carry this form throughout this series.\" Former England bowler Alex Hartley:\"Really happy for England.

    "title": "Struggles down to off-field issues and injury - Foden",
    "article_text": "Phil Foden has scored only seven times in the Premier League this season Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden says he has \"struggled\" this season because of off-field issues and an ankle injury suffered against Manchester United. The 24-year-old enjoyed his best Premier League campaign last term by scoring 19 goals and helping City to an unprecedented fourth top-flight title in a row. Healso collectedthe Player of the Season and Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year awards, as well as being named in the PFATeam of the Year. Foden started all seven games as he helped England reach the final of the European Championship last July, where they were edged out by Spain. But he has managed only 10 goals in all competitions this term and has failed to score in his past 19 games for club and country - a run stretching back to January. Foden says he suffered \"bad\" ligament damage to his ankle when tackled by United midfielder Casemiro during the goalless derby draw on 6 April - he missed the next two games but returned to training \"quite early\". Asked to assess his own season, Foden said: \"It's been difficult. It took a while to heal before I can push myself back in training, I had to look after it. It's been a frustrating season for me. \"I know if everything was OK, I'd definitely be better on the field. Sometimes things happen and you have to deal with it and move on. Unfortunately I've had a difficult season. \"Now it's just about improving and getting back to my best. I know my standards and what I can reach. I'm looking forward to getting back.\" During the game at Old Trafford, Foden was subjected to derogatory chants about his mother, with City manager Pep Guardiola saying United fans showed\"a lack of class\". In January, Fodentold the Manchester Evening News,externalhe had felt physically and mentally burned out. Foden added: \"I've had a lot of things going on off the pitch mentally. It's one of them - sometimes there's things in life that are bigger than football. This season I've struggled a little bit. \"Hopefully come next year I can get my head mentally right, get back where I left the season before - because I know what I'm capable of doing and the quality I have.\" City have had a poor campaign, relinquishing hold of the Premier League trophy, exiting the Champions League in the last 16 and being stunned by Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final. They end the season with a trip to Fulham on Sunday (kick-off 16:00 BST), knowing a point should clinch a Champions League place for next season. But City have a quick turnaround this summer as they will be competing in the expanded Club World Cup, which starts in the US on 14 June. \"It's obviously difficult because the lads are mentally drained from this season,\" said Foden. \"I believe everyone needs the right time to recover to go back to next season. \"Obviously there will be this competition that's coming up. It's going to be a funny one, some clubs will take it more seriously than others but I know City and the club we are, we'll definitely take it seriously.\" Before that, manager Thomas Tuchel names his England squad on Friday for the World Cup qualifier in Andorra on 7 June and friendly against Senegal at the City Ground three days later. Asked if he needs to rest his ankle, Foden said: \"Obviously it's a difficult situation for me with the internationals right around the corner. \"It's something we have to speak with the club and national team to see maybe if it's better to rest and get my ankle fully 100% back how I want it. \"I just don't know at the moment. It's a conversation to be had and we'll see what happens.\"",

    "title": "Has F1's iconic Monaco Grand Prix become boring?",
    "article_text": "The answer is not a straightforward yes or no. Known for it's grandeur, Monaco has always been an iconic track since its first race in 1929, with rows of yachts along the harbour and a star-studded guest list in attendance. It is considered one of motorsport's triple crown events - an unofficial achievement - along with the Indianapolis 500 and Le Mans. Three different, but equally challenging races, and steeped in a rich history. In recent years, however, there have been discussions on whether the streets of Monte Carlo have made for a stagnant track, although a contest drivers still want to win. \"This is really boring... I should've brought my pillow,\" said four-time Formula 1 champion Max Verstappen after finishing sixth in the 2024 Monaco Grand Prix. The circuit is a unique challenge for drivers, with roads around the principality narrow with tight turns and a mile-long tunnel. With modern cars now much larger, this makes overtaking difficult. Saturday's qualifying is considered the most exciting part of the weekend as the race classification is deemed a foregone conclusion as the track averages just 10 overtakes per race, the lowest of any track in the last 10 years. In 2024, the top 10 remained unchanged from start to finish with only four overtakes in the 78-lap contest as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc took both pole position and the race victory over the weekend. The previous year's edition saw 22 overtakes because of rain, while in 2022 there were 13 on wet tarmac. This weekend, from May 23-25, will be the 82nd staging of the Monaco Grand Prix. It has been on the calendar since F1 began in 1950, becoming a permanent fixture from 1955, other than during the Covid-affected 2020 season. Send us your questions The Monaco Grand Prix is a lot of things - historic, spectacular, gaudy, even perhaps a little distasteful in its glamorisation of ostentatious wealth. But boring? Yes the race can be processional, because overtaking is so difficult. In recent years, it's become fashionable to blame the size and width of the cars. But it has always been thus, certainly in at least the last 40 or so years. Watching a driver thread the needle through the streets of Monaco, pushing the limits, shaving the barriers is an all-time great sporting experience. And the race? Well, they can be slow burn. But be patient. Sometimes they can be thrilling, too, in their own way. Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso has described Monaco as \"unique and the best moments of the season\". \"Maybe only Sunday is the bad day,\" he added. \"There is not much you can do. It could be a little bit boring as well, you just need to bring the car home and things like that. Brit Lando Norris said: \"It has never been the most exciting race, it's not a great Sunday so I wouldn't put it [as the] biggest race of the year\". But he also admitted it is \"one you want to win\". Norris added: \"It has been like this since Monaco started. It is just people in the world that are more stubborn nowadays and they get frustrated there is not an overtake. Monaco is still special, it still means just as much as it always has for every driver and every team member.\" Williams driver Alex Albon said: \"It's more just about Saturday though. I think that's what makes it special. When you think about qualifying laps, it's not so much of a Sunday race for the drivers. It's more focusing on Saturday and when you deliver those laps in qualifying, with the adrenaline in your body, that's pretty cool.\" Officials did consider dropping the Monaco Grand Prix after the race's latest contract was due to end in 2025 - butagreed a new six-year deal in 2024. The race faced criticism as it was not matching the speed and excitement of the other 23 circuits, so officials sought solutions. In February 2025, it was announced drivers must make at least two pit stops during the race \"with the primary intent of improving the sporting spectacle\". Another issue was Monaco was the only race where a local television company directed the pictures that were televised to the world. There were notable differences between how the race was covered, compared to how Formula One Management TV produced the other 23 races. This changed in 2023, the year prior to Monaco announcing its extension. The Monaco Grand Prix will move from its traditional date on the last weekend in May to to the first full weekend in June from 2026. \"The streets of Monte Carlo are unique and a famous part of Formula 1, and the Monaco Grand Prix remains a race that all drivers dream of winning,\" said F1 president and chief executive Stefano Domenicali.

    "title": "Stokes hints at England return for Bethell",
    "article_text": "Jacob Bethell scored half-centuries in each of the three Tests in New Zealand Captain Ben Stokes has given a strong hint that Jacob Bethell will come straight back into the England team for the series against India later this summer. Bethell, 21, impressed in his debut series in New Zealand before Christmas but is missing Thursday's one-off Test against Zimbabwe because he is playing for Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the Indian Premier League (IPL). Bethell's return for the five Tests against India, beginning on 20 June, could come at the expense of opener Zak Crawley or, more likely, number three Ollie Pope. \"If you're smart enough, the series that Beth had out in New Zealand, obviously he's going to be back in the UK for that India series,\" said Stokes. \"So, I think you put two and two together, you probably know what's going to happen.\" Any change to a long-established top order would be a huge decision for England, given the significance of the series against India and the Ashes in Australia that follow. But Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum have shown they will not shy away from big calls or investing in youth. In the past year the likes of James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow, Jack Leach, Ben Foakes and Ollie Robinson have been discarded in favour of Shoaib Bashir, Jamie Smith and Gus Atkinson. Left-hander Bethell only got his chance to play in New Zealand after an injury to Jordan Cox. As a result, Pope kept wicket and batted at number six, leaving Bethell at number three despite never previously batting higher than four for his county Warwickshire. He responded by making half-centuries in each of the three Tests, impressing with his temperament and strokeplay. In the third Test, Bethell made 76 amid a ferocious spell from New Zealand pace bowler Will O'Rourke, coping with the hostility better than Joe Root and Harry Brook. Woakes to return in England Lions matches Archer ruled out of Windies ODIs through injury England v Zimbabwe: Stokes eyes âdominanceâ as Test cricket returns Speaking to BBC Sport, Stokes said: \"You look at what Beth did in the winter for us, he has done himself the world of good by the performances he put in there with being part of our plans going forward.\" There is an argument that England should have insisted Bethell, who is centrally contracted, played in the Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge. But pulling him out of the IPL would have risked confrontation with the Board of Control for Cricket in India. There is also a feeling that his time with Royal Challengers Bengaluru, where he opened the batting with India legend Virat Kohli, is more beneficial to his development. Bethell is yet to score a century in professional cricket, though England feel they have seen enough in New Zealand and his appearances in white-ball internationals to suggest he will have a successful Test career. Although the evidence is limited, Bethell certainly has the potential to outstrip both Crawley and Pope, who have middling returns from what are now lengthy England careers. Crawley averages 30.51 from his 53 Tests, Pope 34.02 from 55. Crawley has endured a difficult few months. Struggles in New Zealand, where he averaged less than nine and was dismissed in all six innings by Matt Henry, were carried into the South Africa T20 league. He has at least made half-centuries in each of his past three matches for Kent. England have been willing to excuse Crawley's inconsistency for the impact he can have at top of the order. He memorably hit the first ball of the last Ashes series for four and followed up with a sensational 189 in the fourth Test at Old Trafford. He has also formed a strong opening partnership with Ben Duckett. This video can not be played We can be the best Test team in the world - Stokes Pope, therefore, is vulnerable, despite again being confirmed as England's vice-captain by Stokes on Wednesday. If he does lose his place, it would be unfortunate given his willingness to adapt for England over the past year. At various times he has been captain, wicketkeeper, opener, number three and number six. Indeed, he slipped down the order to make way for Bethell. Pope endured a rollercoaster 2024 with the bat. His 196 in the first Test against India in Hyderabad was one of the greatest overseas innings played by an Englishman in Test history, but he was inconsistent thereafter. Pope averaged 33.13, the lowest for any batter in Test cricket to have scored three hundreds in a calendar year. Following the series in New Zealand, head coach McCullum appeared to give greater backing to Crawley than to Pope. Speaking on Wednesday, McCullum said: \"It's a problem that we want, and our guys know that. Ultimately, our currency is runs. \"We do need to keep putting up performances to be earning the opportunity to keep getting picked, and especially when you get surrounded with good cricketers throughout your country. So it's a good problem to have, but, again, what a great opportunity these guys have got in front of them.\" England have also regularly talked up the advantages of Bethell's left-arm spin. In recent times spin has not played a prominent role in Tests in Australia, so Bethell would give the option of playing an Ashes Test without a specialist spinner.

    "title": "Trump’s ‘white genocide’ claims ignore the reality of life and crime in South Africa",
    "article_text": "It was an ambush crafted straight from a reality-TV playbook. The Oval Office meeting withSouth Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, started with exchanges of pleasantries, beforeDonald Trumpsaid “turn the lights down” and a video was played to support his false claims that white South African farmers are being murdered for their race. Ramaphosa came prepared with champion white South African golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen, whom thegolf-mad Trump referred to as “friends”, as well as South Africa’s richest person, Johann Rupert. Ramaphosa, who led the African National Congress (ANC) party’s delegation in the talks that ended apartheid white-minority rule three decades ago, needed to play his strongest cards. In February, Trumpsigned an executive ordercutting aid to South Africa, accusing it of “unjust racial discrimination” against the white Afrikaner minority, which ruled the country during apartheid. The order criticised a South African law allowing land expropriation in limited circumstances and set up a program to bring Afrikaners to the US as refugees. The first grouparrived earlier this month. South African media had speculated about whether Ramaphosa was walking into a televised trap, like Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had just a few months before. The White House video was likely a surprise for the South Africans. It spliced together clips of Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) opposition party, saying “We are going to occupy land” and “We must never be scared to kill”, before singing the controversial Kill the Boer song (“Boer” is another name for Afrikaners and means “farmer” in Afrikaans). Malema, whose populism is designed to shock – and whose EFF won just 9.5% of the vote in South Africa’s 2024 election – will probably be thrilled with the attention, after being buoyed up by South African courts ruling that Kill the Boer is not meant to be taken literally. Former South African president Jacob Zuma, now leading his own opposition party, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), also featured in the video, singing in Zulu: “We are going to shoot them. They are going to run.” The video ended with a drone shot of white crosses lining a road where vehicles were queued. Trump said they were paying respects to more than 1,000 murdered white farmers. Ramaphosa said he had never seen the video, which South African-born billionaire and Trump adviser Elon Musk reshared after it wasposted on X in March. Trump then whipped out a sheaf of printed-out news articles, intoning “death … death … death” before handing it over to Ramaphosa. It was not immediately clear where the white crosses had been filmed or even whether the footage was real. TheWhitkruis Monumentis a memorial to dead South African farmers, but the crosses are clustered on a hillside on private land. While there have been farm murders involving horrific violence, killers interviewed in jail told Rudolph Zinn, a University of Limpopo professor, that they targeted victims of all races for cash and valuables. In the last quarter of 2024, South African policerecorded12 murders on farms, including Black-owned smallholder plots, out of almost 7,000 murders across the country. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion South Africa’s agriculture minister, John Steenhuisen, the Afrikaner leader of the ANC’s main rival, the Democratic Alliance – which gets the bulk of its support from white South Africans – said most farmers wanted to stay in South Africa. He also defended the DA’s coalition with the ANC to keep out the “rabble” EFF and MK parties. The two golfers’ words were perhaps less helpful. Els was cryptic: “Two wrongs don’t make a right.” Goosen spoke of his brother’s “constant battle” with people trying to burn down and take away his farm. However, their presence could snap Trump out of attack mode. “I respect champions,” he said. “I think the country is very lucky. They really wanted to be here, these two. They could have been on a beautiful fairway.” South Africa’s most potent defender was Rupert, whose luxury goods conglomerate Richemont owns Cartier. Referring to Malema and Zuma, he said: “I’m their No 1 target.” Rupert pointed out that all South Africans are targets of crime. He said how much his wife loved JD Vance’s autobiography and begged for Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service at police stations. It remains to be seen, though, whether a fellow billionaire and a few rounds with South Africa’s finest golfers will be enough to mollify Trump and persuade him to attend the G20 summit in Johannesburg in November.",

    "title": "Judge rules White House violated order by deporting migrants to South Sudan",
    "article_text": "A federal judge has ruled the US government’s attempt todeport migrants to South Sudan“unquestionably” violated an earlier court order. Brian E Murphy, the US district judge in Massachusetts, made the remark at an emergency hearing he had ordered in Boston following theTrump administration’sapparent removal of eight people toSouth Sudan, despite most of them being from other countries. On Tuesday, Murphyruledthat the Trump administration could not let a group of migrants being transported to countries that were not their own leave the custody ofUS immigrationauthorities. Lawyers for seven men – including Burmese, Laotian, Mexican and Cuban nationals – deported on Tuesday were told that their clients were given little more than 24 hours notice that they were being expelled from the US. Murphy, the judge, said that little amount of time was “plainly insufficient”. An eighth man in the group was a citizen ofSouth Sudan, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Jonathan Ryan, a lawyer for Burmese man known in court documents as NM, who was expelled, said he initially received notice that his client was being sent to Libya, before being informed that client was actually being sent to SouthAfrica. About two hours after the second notice, Ryan was told his client was being sent to South Sudan. “I’ve never in 20 years seen anything close to this happening,” said Ryan, who has been representing clients detained in Pearsall, Texas, since 2005. Furthering the confusion, a lawyer for the Department of Justice first indicated that the Burmese deportee would ultimately be sent to Myanmar, but the government has not provided details about the final destination of the flight. Murphy ordered the administration to clarify the facts of NM’s removal, including the moment that officials first decided it would be impractical or impossible to remove him to Burma, and the time and reasoning behind the reversal of that decision and determination that NM should be sent to Burma after all. Ryan said his client was part of an ethnic minority in Myanmar, and faced immense risks if he were to be sent there. “Whether he’s sent to Burma or South Sudan, he is at risk of harm – of abuse, exploitation, death,” Ryan said. “In fact, this is a death penalty case with traffic court-level procedure,” said Ryan. “Or rather, this procedure wouldn’t even fly in a traffic court.” Burma is in the midst of a civil war, and recently experienced its worst earthquake disaster in more than a century. Meanwhile South Sudan, the world’s youngest country, has widely been described as being on the verge of descending into another episode of civil war. Flight trackers and a report from the New York Times suggest that the flight carrying deportees in question may have stopped inDjibouti, not South Sudan. “This is so opaque and obscure,” Ryan said, “I have no clarity.” In an earlier briefing on Wednesday, a homeland security spokesperson acknowledged the deportation was occurring, but refused to say whether the final destination wasSouth Sudan. “We conducted a deportation flight from Texas to remove some of the most barbaric, violent individuals illegally in the United States. These are the monsters that the district judge is trying to protect,” the spokeswoman, Tricia McLaughlin, said. McLaughlin went on to add: “It is absolutely absurd for a district judge to try to dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States.” Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion “Because of safety and operational security, we cannot tell you what the final destination for these individuals will be,” shecontinued. Federal immigration officials said the people were originally from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan, but that their home countries refused to accept them as deportations. Homeland security officials claimed that they had been convicted of murder, armed robbery and other serious crimes. Last month, Murphy had issued an injunction that required any people being removed to a third country to receive due process. After reports of the apparent South Sudan flight, the judge told Elianis Perez, a justice department lawyer: “I have a strong indication that my preliminary injunction order has been violated.” In anemailto his lawyer, the spouse of a Vietnamese man believed to have been sent to South Sudan wrote: “Please help! … They cannot be allowed to do this.” South Sudan’s police spokesperson, Maj Gen James Enoka,toldthe Associated Press on Wednesday that no migrants had arrived. Enoka said that if they did, they would be investigated and those found not to be from the country would be “re-deported to their correct country”. Immigration lawyers have accused theTrump administrationof violating Murphy’s order several times in the past month, including in the case of a planned flight of Laotian, Vietnamese and Filipino immigrants to Libya and the expulsion of a Guatemalan man to Mexico. During Wednesday’s hearing, Murphy also chastised government lawyers for their handling of the case of the Guatemalan man, known as OCG. Lawyers initially said in a sworn declaration that OCG had been informed he was being sent to Mexico and confirmed that he was not afraid to go there, but the justice department later said the declaration was erroneous, and it could not confirm that OCG had been informed he was being sent to Mexico. “This is a really big deal,” Murphy said. “It’s a big deal to lie to a court under oath.” Following the hearing, Murphy issued a clarification to his prior preliminary injunction in which he said any removals of immigrants to third countries should be preceded by a formal notice, and individuals much have at least 10 days to evaluate and contest the removal.",

    "article_text": "An attempt by the USto deport South Asian migrants to South Sudanhas cast a spotlight on the world’s youngest country, which is experiencing a renewed outbreak of the political tensions that have plagued it over the years. On Wednesday, a US federal judgesaidthe deportation of migrants from the US to South Sudan “unquestionably” violated a court order requiring that any people being deported to a third country should receive due process. US immigration authorities later confirmed that eight migrants from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan were on the deportation flight and claimed that they had been convicted of offences including murder, armed robbery and other serious crimes. South Sudan’s police spokesperson, Maj Gen James Enoka, told the AP on Wednesday that no migrants had arrived and if they did, they’d be investigated and those found not to be fromSouth Sudan“re-deported to their correct country”. If they do make it to South Sudan, they will find a country in the midst of political uncertainty and renewed fighting between rival factions. South Sudan became the world’s youngest country when it gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a referendum. The country of 11 million people is rich in oil reserves and its economy is heavily reliant on exports of the product. But the sector is marred by mismanagement and corruption and despite its vast resources, the country is underdeveloped, with most places lacking electricity, paved roads and other infrastructure.About two thirdsof its population live in extreme poverty. South Sudan also experiences some of the world’s most punishing climate phenomena, including extreme flooding, which displaced 380,000 people last year. In March, authorities put Riek Machar, the country’s first vice-president and main opposition leader, under house arrest,accusing him of agitating his supporters to cause a rebellion. Earlier that month, the White Army, a community militia loyal to Machar, had launched attacks against the country’s military in Nasir county and overran an army base. The militia said it had acted in self-defence. The government responded by bombarding areas where the group was based and arrested opposition figures. Machar’s party, SPLM-IO, said his arrest had in effect collapsed the peace deal that ended the 2013-2018 civil war in which an estimated 400,000 people were killed in fighting between Nuer fighters loyal to Machar and Dinka forces backing Salva Kiir, the current president. This year’s renewed tensions have put the deal to the test and shaken a fragile peace, with the United Nations warning that South Sudan wason the brinkof relapsing into widespread conflict. Machar remains under house arrest and government offensiveshave continuedin many parts of the north-east, where Nasir is located. On Tuesday, Kiir promoted second vice-president Benjamin Bol Mel as the deputy chairperson of his SPLM party. In his new role, Bol Mel, who is widely viewed as Kiir’s chosen successor, would become acting president if Kiir stepped down. The news about deportations of South Asians to South Sudan comes weeks aftera standoffbetween South Sudan and the US after the US sent a Congolese man to South Sudan, claiming he was South Sudanese.",

    "article_text": "The South African president,Cyril Ramaphosa, is expected to take the golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen with him to meet Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday, as the government attempts to reset relations with the US amid Trump’s accusations that it is fomenting a white “genocide”. Ramaphosa’s appeal to Trump’s love of golf, with the potential inclusion of Els and Goosen reported by South Africanlocal media, is part of his efforts to avoid a public dressing down of the kind Trump gave to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in February. The US has cut aid to South Africa and welcomed a plane-load ofwhite South Africans as refugees, claiming they have been victims of racial discrimination. South African officials and businesspeople are also worried that Congress will not renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) when it expires in September, ending tariff-free access to the US for goods including citrus fruits, nuts and cars. “The trade relations are the most important, that’s what brought us here. We want to come out of the United States with a really good trade deal,” Ramaphosa told South African reporters in the US. “Ernie Els was actually the person who, over the past month talked Trump into agreeing to the meeting,” said the billionaire Johann Rupert, the founder of Switzerland-based luxury goods conglomerate Richemont, which owns jewellery brand Cartier, who will also join the trip. Rupert has known Trump since 1996 and has played golf with the US president and Els. Rupert, thought to be South Africa’s richest man,told South Africa’s News24that he and Els visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in March 2024, months before Trump’s re-election, to ask him to keep AGOA. Far from being victims of a genocide – as in the telling of Trump, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the South African-born billionaire Elon Musk – Rupert, Els and Goosen are examples of successful white Afrikaners, a minority descended from mainly Dutch colonists who ruled SouthAfricaduring its decades of apartheid, legally mandated racial segregation and discrimination in favour of white people. South Africa was set to offer Musk a deal to bring his Starlink internet service to the country, Bloombergreportedon Tuesday.

    "title": "EU’s ‘chocolate crisis’ worsened by climate breakdown, researchers warn",
    "article_text": "Climate breakdown and wildlife loss are deepening the EU’s “chocolate crisis”, areporthas argued, with cocoa one of six key commodities to come mostly from countries vulnerable to environmental threats. More than two-thirds of the cocoa, coffee, soy, rice, wheat and maize brought into the EU in 2023 came from countries that are not well prepared for climate change, according to the UK consultants Foresight Transitions. For three of the commodities – cocoa, wheat and maize – two-thirds of imports came from countries whose biodiversity was deemed not to be intact, the analysis found. The researchers said the damage to food production by climate breakdown was made worse by a decline in biodiversity that has left farms less resilient. “These aren’t just abstract threats,” said the lead author of the report, Camilla Hyslop. “They are already playing out in ways that negatively affect businesses and jobs, as well as the availability and price of food for consumers, and they are only getting worse.” The researchers mapped trade data from Eurostat on to two rankings of environmental security to assess the level of exposure for three staple foods and three critical inputs into the EU’s food system. They used a ranking of climate readiness from the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index, which combines a country’s vulnerability to climate damages with its access to financial and institutional support, and a ranking of biodiversity intactness from the UK Natural History Museum, which compares the current abundance of wild species to pre-modern levels. They found the majority of imports came from countries they ranked “low-medium” on the climate scale and “low-medium” or “medium” on the biodiversity scale. Some food products were particularly exposed. The EU imported 90% of its maize from countries with low-medium climate readiness and 67% from countries with medium or lower biodiversity intactness, the report found. For cocoa, a key ingredient in the chocolate industry thatEuropedoes not grow itself, the import exposure was 96.5% for climate preparedness and 77% on the biodiversity scale, the report found. The industry is already struggling with rises in the price of sugar, driven in part byextreme weather events, and supply shortages of cocoa. Most of its cocoa comes from west African countries facing overlapping climate and biodiversity risks. The report, which was commissioned by the European Climate Foundation, argued that large chocolate manufacturers should invest in climate adaptation and biodiversity protection in cocoa-growing countries. “This is not an act of altruism or ESG [sustainable finance], but rather a vital derisking exercise for supply chains,” the authors wrote. “Ensuring farmers are in their supply chains paid a fair price for their produce would allow them to invest in the resilience of their own farms.” Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Paul Behrens, an environmental researcher at the University of Oxford and author of a textbook on food and sustainability, who was not involved in the research, said the findings painted an “extremely worrying picture” for food resilience. “Policymakers like to think of the EU as food-secure because it produces quite a lot of its own food,” he said. “But what this report shows is that the EU is vulnerable to climate and biodiversity risks in some vital food supply chains.” The report found coffee, rice and soy had fewer risks overall but noted hotspots of concern.Uganda, which provided 10% of the EU’s coffee in 2023, had low climate preparedness and low-medium biodiversity intactness, the report found. Joseph Nkandu, founder of the National Union ofCoffeeAgribusinesses and Farm Enterprises in Uganda, called for more access to international climate finance to help farmers become more resilient in the face of worsening weather. “The weather in Uganda is no longer predictable,” he said. “Heatwaves, prolonged dry spells and erratic rains are withering our coffee bushes and damaging production.” Marco Springmann, a food researcher at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the research, said a shift to healthier and more sustainable diets would be needed for food systems to withstand climate shocks. “About a third of grains and basically all imported soy is used to feed animals,” he said. “Aiming to make those supply chains more resilient therefore misses the point that this supports the very products that are to a large degree responsible for what is being tried to protect from.”",

    "article_text": "Hundreds of animals including elephants, crocodiles, lions and tigers have been moved from a violence-torn Mexican cartel heartland to a new home in an operation described as a “21st-century Noah’s Ark”. The transported species, which also included exotic birds, had been housed at the Ostok animal refuge near Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa state, home to one of the country’s most powerful drug gangs. The animal sanctuary’s administrators told reporters that for months they had received threats, with a truck and equipment stolen. “We are leaving because we run the risk of something happening to me and my team,” said Ernesto Zazueta, the director of the refuge. In total, about 700 animals were moved by road to a ranch on the coast. “This caravan of animals is a kind of 21st-century Noah’s Ark. But this time, the animals aren’t fleeing a flood, but rather insecurity, fear and anxiety,” Zazueta said. Since September, Culiacán has been the epicenter ofa bloody war between factions of the Sinaloa drug cartelthat has left more than 1,200 people dead and 1,400 missing, according to official figures. The cartel is one of six Mexican drug-trafficking groupsdesignated terrorist organizationsby the United States.Regular roadblocks and armed clashes in the region made it difficult for the sanctuary’s workers to keep the captive wildlife fed, another reason to relocate them. “The animals’ health began to suffer,” Zazueta said, adding that at least a ton of beef and chicken was needed every three days to feed the animals. Workers sedated the most dangerous of them, including lions and tigers, so they could be placed in cages for the 220km (nearly 140-mile) road trip. Two large containers and a huge crane were needed to load the elephants on to trailers. The final destination is a site called Bioparque El Encanto, located in the seaside resort town of Mazatlán on Sinaloa’s Pacific coast and owned by a local businessman, Zazueta said. Big cats and other exotic animals have long been found at Mexican ranches and other properties owned by drug traffickers. Since September, federal authorities have discovered at least 14 big cats, some seized in raids and others found in abandoned houses believed to be used for criminal activities. They were given a new home at the Ostok refuge, whose director said the mass animal transfer sent a “painful message” about the situation in the Sinaloa state capital. “If animals can no longer live in Culiacán, who can?” Zazueta said.",

    "article_text": "Former prisoners and hostages wrongly held abroad have urged the UK prime minister to urgently secure the release of the pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai before he dies in aHong Kongjail. The 77-year-old media mogul, who is a British citizen, has been held in solitary confinement for 1,602 days and his family fears he might not survive another summer in Hong Kong, where temperatures can reach 40C (104F). Aletter to Keir Starmersigned by 22 people who were detained abroad and their family members, says he must act “before it is too late”. The signatories includeNazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeandJason Rezaian, who were held in Iran,Matthew Hedges, who was imprisoned in the UAE, and Vladimir Kara-Murza, Alsu Kurmasheva and Paul Whelan, who were released by Russia last yearin a prisoner swapwith the US. They write: “We know firsthand the horror of these cases and the reality of living everyday with the knowledge you may never see your loved one again. We also know that resolving these cases and bringing British citizens home to the UK depends on robust, principled, strategic action by the UK government.” At a press conference in London on Wednesday, Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, lead international counsel for Lai and his son, Jimmy, said there had been “outrageous foot dragging” in Lai’s case, involving charges under the city’spunitive national security law. She said it was supposed to last 30 days when it started after multiple adjournments in December 2023 but a current six-month pause meant closing submissions would not take place until August. Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, said: “I think we do need to be looking at government squarely in the eye and saying … ‘How dare you not prioritise the protection of your citizens from torture, from profound injustice and from the risk of death?’” An emotionalAnoosheh Ashoori, 71, who was released in Iran at the same time as Zaghari-Ratcliffe, said: “Luckily, I was only 116 days in a solitary confinement. With someone who has been there for such a long time, even for me it is difficult to imagine how resilient he must be and what he has been through.” The signatories urge Starmer to urgently accede to theLai’s son’s request for a meetingwith the prime minister. Gallagher said that raising Lai’s case bilaterally was not enough, the UK government had to make the Chinese understand “that actually there is a conditionality or an impact if they don’t engage”. A UK government spokesperson said Lai’s case was a priority, adding: “We continue to call on the Hong Kong authorities to end their politically motivated prosecution and immediately releaseJimmy Lai.”",

    "article_text": "US chip exports controls have been a “failure”, the head ofNvidia, Jensen Huang, told a tech forum on Wednesday, as the Chinese government separately slammed US warnings to other countries against using Chinese tech. Successive US administrationshave imposed restrictionson the sale of hi-tech AI chips to China, in an effort to curb China’s military advancement and protect US dominance of the AI industry. But Huang told the Computex tech forum in Taipei that the controls had instead spurred on Chinese developers. “The local companies are very, very talented and very determined, and the export control gave them the spirit, the energy and the government support to accelerate their development,” Huang told media the Computex tech show in Taipei. “I think, all in all, the export control was a failure.” “China has a vibrant technology ecosystem, and it’s very important to realise thatChinahas 50% of the world’s AI researchers, and China is incredibly good at software,” Huang said. Nvidia, whichdesigns high-end GPUs, has beenbattered by US chip export controls. Huang said on Wednesday the company had written off “billions of dollars” in sales, and it’s share of China’s AI chip market had fallen from almost 95% at the start of the Biden administration to 50%. Last monthHuang made a surprise visit to Beijing, where he met with the head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, according to Chinese state media, and the DeepSeek founder, Liang Wenfeng, according to the Financial Times. His visit came just days after further US restrictions banned shipments to China of Nvidia’s H20 datacentre GPUs, a lower-powered version of other Nvidia chips which was designed specifically to comply with Biden-era restrictions. The US government told Nvidia the new rules were designed to address the risk that its products might be “used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China”. Huang’s Beijing meeting with Liang was to discuss new chip designs for the AI company that would not trigger the new US bans, the FT report said. Last week the Trump administration rescinded some of the existing controls on chip sales to China, after some countries said they were being shut out from crucial technology needed to develop artificial intelligence. But it also unveiled fresh guidelines for other countries, warning companies that using Chinese-made hi-tech AI semiconductors, specifically tech company Huawei’s Ascend chips, could put them in breach of existing US export controls. In response China accused the US of “abusing export controls to suppress and contain China”. The commerce ministry said on Wednesday the warning was “typical unilateral bullying and protectionism, which seriously undermine the stability of the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain”. It also warned that “any organisation or individual that enforces or assists in enforcing such measures” could be in violation of Chinese law.",

    "article_text": "Japan’s agriculture minister has resigned after saying he never buys rice because he gets it free, a remark that drew public fury in a country facing soaring food prices. Taku Etō’s resignation has added to pressure on the prime minister,Shigeru Ishiba, whose failure to rein in soaring rice prices and address a widercost of living crisishas angered voters ahead of upper house elections in July. “Just now I submitted my resignation to prime minister Ishiba,” Etō told reporters at the prime minister’s office. Etō had faced calls for his resignation after claiming that he never had to buy rice, relying instead on gifts from supporters. Etō had initially sympathised with the “hardship” felt by consumers after the governmentreleased about 300,000 tons of ricefrom emergency stockpiles earlier this year in the hope of bringing down prices. But speaking at a fundraiser last weekend, Etō said he had “never bought rice myself because my supporters donate so much to me that I can practically sell it”. Etō was replaced on Wednesday by Shinjirō Koizumi, a former environment minister whoran unsuccessfullyagainst Ishiba for the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) leadership last autumn. Etō’s comment incensed consumers, who are having to pay nearly double for a bag of rice compared with a year ago, according to figures published in April. “I asked myself whether it is appropriate for me to stay at the helm [of the agriculture ministry] at a critical time for rice prices, and I concluded that it is not,” Etō added, according to the Kyodo news agency. “Once again, I apologise to people for making extremely inappropriate comments as minister when they are struggling with surging rice prices.” Japan’sriceshortfall has been blamed on several factors, including poor harvests due to hot weather in 2023 and panic-buying prompted by a “megaquake” warning in 2024. Wholesalers and distributors are also thought to be hoarding rice stocks in anticipation of further shortages. Ishiba had earlier apologised for Etō’s remarks. The ongoing rice crisis and rising household food and energy bills havedented the popularityof Ishiba’s government, weeks before it faces voters in upper house elections that could determine his future as prime minister. In a recent Kyodo survey, 87% of respondents were dissatisfied with the government’s handling of the rice prices, while approval ratings for Ishiba’s cabinet have sunk to their lowest since he took office last October. The average price of rice sold at supermarkets in the week to 11 May reached a record ¥4,268 yen ($29) for 5kg, up from ¥4,214 the previous week and around double the price of a year ago. In April, Japanimported rice from South Koreafor the first time in a quarter of a century in an attempt to address growing consumer anger. Junya Ogawa, secretary general of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic party, described Etō’s comments as “extremely inappropriate, out of touch and intolerable”. Etō conceded that his remarks had angered his wife. “She told me that she does buy rice when the donated rice runs out,” he said. “It’s not like our family is living entirely off of rice given to us as gifts.”",

    "article_text": "The Pacific must be protected from becoming a military zone amid China’s growing push for influence in the region, New Zealand’s top diplomatWinston Petershas warned ahead of a meeting with his Australian counterpart Penny Wong. Peters, who is New Zealand’s deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, told the Guardian that his country has a good relationship with China. “But the reality is, as the geostrategic shape of the world changes, we do not want the Pacific to become the grounds for competition,” Peters said. Peters said the Pacific was known as a region of peace “and we want to make sure it stays that way and it does not become a military zone.” New Zealand has become embroiled in tensions this year over China’s activity in the Pacific, including an opaqueagreement between China and the Cook Islandsthat sparked a diplomatic row between the archipelago and New Zealand, and China’slive-drilling exercisesin the Tasman sea, which took Wellington and Canberra by surprise. Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump’s tariffs and the resulting trade war, as well as sweeping cuts to USAID are fuelling uncertainty in the region. “It’s not an exaggeration – this has been the most uncertain time for the last 79 to 80 years,” Peters said, adding that New Zealand is focusing on its relationships in the Pacific amid the tumult. Western nations that traditionally held sway in the region have become increasingly concerned about China’s push for influence in the Pacific, as Beijing has signedsecurityandpolicing dealswith countries in the region over the past three years. Beijing has alsodelivered significant aid,infrastructureandother fundingto Pacific Island countries. Tensions rose earlier this year when the Cook Islands government unveiled the details of astrategic partnership deal with China, after New Zealand expressed “significant concern” about a lack of transparency over the agreement. The Cook Islands has operated as a self-governing nation in “free association” with New Zealand for 60 years. Its roughly 17,000 citizens hold New Zealand citizenship and there areobligations between the two nationsto regularly consult on matters of defence and security. Later in February, New Zealand and Australian officials said that China had conducted live-fire exercises in international waters between the two nations, giving little notice and forcing commercial airlines to divert flights. Challenging China – New Zealand’s largest trading partner – can be a delicate process and as such Wellington has historically taken a more conciliatory approach than Australia or its other Five Eyes security partners, Canada, the US and the UK. But Peters raised his concerns about the agreement and the live-firing drills with China’s foreign minister Wang Yi in Beijing shortly after the incidents. “We made sure that they understood what our position was,” Peters said, adding that New Zealand’s relationship with China remained strong. “If you can’t talk frankly to them, its not a great relationship but we’ve got a good relationship … because we can say what we think.” Defence, security and development in the Pacific will be high on the agenda when Peters and Wong meet in Adelaide on Friday for their six-monthly foreign ministers’ consultations. Cooperation with Australia had “never been more important”, Peters said. Peters and Wong have both travelled “extensively” in the region to shore up New Zealand and Australia’s relationship with their smaller Pacific neighbours, he said. “You cannot to this over zoom, or over correspondence, you’ve got to do it face-to-face.” With the exception of Kiribati, Peters has visited all of the Pacific Island Forum nations during his 18 months in the role. This week, Wong is visiting Vanuatu, Tonga and Fiji, in her first standalone trip after Labor’s landslide re-election.",

    "title": "Macron’s party moots banning headscarves in public for under-15s",
    "article_text": "Emmanuel Macron’s centrist political party has suggested banning girls under 15 from wearing the Muslim headscarf in all public places, as the president chaired a high-level government meeting to discuss what it called “political Islamism” in France. The French president’s office said he had asked ministers to come up with proposals before June to address the “serious” findings of a report that Macron commissioned last year into the presence of the Muslim Brotherhood inFrance. The report found that the Muslim Brotherhood – the movement founded in Egypt more than 90 years ago that launched the modern phenomenon of politicalIslam– posed a “threat to national cohesion” in France and risked undermining “the fabric of society and republican institutions”. Before the meeting,Gabriel Attal, the former prime minister and now head of Macron’s party, Renaissance, proposed a ban on “minors under 15 wearing the veil in public spaces”. He said the Muslim head covering worn by young girls “seriously undermines gender equality and the protection of children”. Attal toldLe Parisienhe also wanted to introduce a criminal offence of coercion for parents who make their daughters aged under 18 wear the veil. Attal’s proposals were criticised by some on the left. The Socialist party lawmaker Jérôme Guedj said Attal was “chasing the far right” and turning French secularism against Muslims. Macron’s office said the report on the Muslim Brotherhood in France would be published by the end of this week. The Élysée Palace said that because of the “seriousness” of its findings, the government had been tasked to make proposals swiftly. Agence France-Presse, which obtained a copy of the report, said it pointed to the spread of Islamism “from the bottom up”. This was an apparent reference to municipal politics, charities, schools and sports groups. The report said this constituted “a threat in the short to medium term”. It is not certain if restrictions on the Muslim headscarf will be among the proposals made as a result of the report. In the 2022 presidential race, when Macron was re-elected, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who came second, proposedbanningthe wearing of the Muslim headscarf by any woman in all public spaces in France. Under current French legislation, civil servants in state buildings, including schools and hospitals, cannot wear obvious religious symbols such as a Christian crucifix, Jewish kippah, Sikh turban or Muslim headscarf. France is a secular republic built on a clear separation of church and state, intended to foster equality for all private beliefs. The state remains neutral in terms of religion but must safeguard everyone’s freedom to practise their own faith. In 2004, France banned girls from wearing Islamic headscarves in state schools – along with banning all other religious symbols such as crosses or turbans – arguing schools must be free of all religion. There is also debate in government over proposing a new law to ban the Muslim headscarf in domestic sports competitions. The Élysée said it had been important to commission a report on the Muslim Brotherhood. “The movement is present inEuropeand its target is clearly Europe,” an Élysée official said, adding that it was necessary to “raise awareness within the European Union”. But the Élysée also said: “We are all perfectly aligned in saying that we must not lump all Muslims together.” The official said: “We are fighting against Islamism and its radical excesses.” The report comes at a time when national politics in France is focused on issues of national identity and Islam, with Le Pen’s far right increasing its share of the vote.Bruno Retailleau, the hardline rightwing interior minister, was recently chosen to head the traditional right party Les Républicains, after its former leader Éric Ciotti left to join an alliance with Le Pen. Retailleau told the media before Wednesday’s meeting that political Islamism was “quietly infiltrating sporting, cultural, social and others associations” and its ultimate aim was to “tip the whole of French society into sharia [law]”. The French Muslim council issued a statement warning against targeting all Muslims. It said the state “must above all not feed a generalised suspicion towards Muslims in France”.",

    "title": "Israeli troops fire ‘warning shots’ at 25 diplomats visiting occupied West Bank",
    "article_text": "Israeli troops fired “warning shots” towards a group of 25 diplomats visiting Jenin in the Israel-occupiedWest Bankon Wednesday, prompting a wave of outrage and calls for an investigation from world leaders and ministers. Footage shows a number of diplomats giving media interviews when rapid shots rang out nearby, forcing them to run for cover. The delegation comprised ambassadors and diplomats representing 31 countries, including Italy, Canada, Egypt, Jordan, the UK, China and Russia. The group was on an official mission organised by the Palestinian Authority to observe the humanitarian situation there. The Israeli military said the visit had been approved but the delegation “deviated from the approved route” and Israeli soldiers fired warning shots to distance them from the area. The Canadian, British, French and other European ministers summoned Israeli ambassadors in their respective capitals to explain the “unacceptable” incident, which will fuel already growing international anger and concern as Israel continues its offensive in Gaza and ramps up the expansion of settlements in the West Bank that are illegal under international law. Germany, a longtime Israel ally, condemned what it called “unprovoked firing,” while Canada, Turkey and the EU demanded an investigation. “We expect an immediate explanation of what happened. It’s totally unacceptable,” Canadian prime minister Mark Carney told a press conference. Four Canadian diplomats were part of the group. A spokesperson for UN secretary general António Guterres also urged Israel to conduct a “thorough investigation”. “It is clear that diplomats who are doing their work should never be shot at, attacked in any way, shape or form, and their safety, their inviolability, must be respected at all times,” said the spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric. Egypt said the incident “violates all diplomatic norms”. The Palestinian foreign ministry accused Israel of having “deliberately targeted” the diplomatic delegation with live fire. The IDF said it regretted “the inconvenience caused” and that senior officials would contact diplomats to inform them of the results of its internal investigation into the incident. Jenin was the focus of a big Israeli assault in January that forced tens of thousands of Palestinians from their homes, one of the largest West Bank displacements in years. A new wave of airstrikes and artillery shelling killed at least 82 people inGazaon Wednesday, including several women and a week-old infant, the Gaza health ministry and hospital officials said. In Khan Younis, where Israel recently ordered new evacuations before an expected major attack into the southern city, 24 people were killed, including 14 from the same family, Palestinian officials reported. Late on Wednesday, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said “all of the Gaza Strip will be under the Israeli army’s control” by the end of its intensified offensive. Amid growing international pressure on Israel to allow food to reach starving Palestinians, he said: “We must avoid a humanitarian crisis in order to preserve our freedom of operational action.” About 100 aid trucks have entered Gaza since Monday when Netanyahu’s government agreed to lift the 11-week blockade that has led to the territory facing a “critical risk of famine”. On Wednesday, several dozen passed through the Kerem Shalom checkpoint but their cargos had yet to be distributed late on Wednesday. Abdel-Nasser al-Ajramy, the head of the bakery owners’ society in Gaza, said at least 25 bakeries that had been told they would receive flour from the World Food Programme had seen nothing and there had been no relief from the hunger for people waiting for food. Much of Gaza’s 2.3 million population rely for survival on free bakeries and community kitchens. Almost all have shut down. “There is no flour, no food, no water,” said Sabah Warsh Agha, a 67-year-old woman from the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. “We used to get water from the pump, now the pump has stopped working. There is no diesel or gas.” Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion Complex logistics, continued fighting, an Israeli requirement to reload cargoes on to new trucks after they enter Gaza, the limited availability of fuel and the poor condition of roads are all slowing the distribution of aid, humanitarian officials said. The Guardian understands that further delays were caused when the Israeli military instructed aid agencies to send convoys carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of flour on routes along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt and along the coast, both of which are considered prone to looting. The new offensive in Gaza followed a two-month ceasefire and has drawnfierce condemnationfrom countries that have previously avoided expressing open criticism of Israel. Even the US, the country’s most important ally, has shown signs of losing patience with Netanyahu. On Tuesday, Britain announced the suspension of talks with Israel on a free trade deal, and has, along with France and Canada, threatened “concrete actions” if Israel continues its offensive and restrictions on the free flow of aid. Separately, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the bloc was reviewing its agreement with Israel governing trade ties over its conduct of the war in Gaza. The pact specifies thatall signatoriesmust show “respect for human rights and democratic principles”. The EU’s review could be completed relatively quickly as officials could draw on a 34-page report compiled late last year that details multiple allegations of systemic violations of international law during the conflict by both Israel and Hamas. The report, seen by the Guardian, includes UN statistics on casualty figures and concludes that 44% of those killed in the first months of the Israeli offensive were children. It also lists Israeli strikes on hospitals and stresses that under international humanitarian law, states have the “negative obligation” not to aid or assist in violations of international humanitarian law by parties to a conflict. In Jerusalem, the MP Ayman Odeh, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, was removed from the Knesset podium by security after accusing the government of killing 19,000 children in Gaza and waging war on civilians and the innocent. Earlier this week, Yair Golan, a leftwing opposition leader, drew a furious response from the government and its supporters when he said “a sane country doesn’t kill babies as a hobby” and that Israel risked becoming a “pariah state among the nations”. Golan, a former deputy commander of the Israeli military, is leader of one of the bigger minority parties in Israel’s parliament. His words – and similar comments made by the former prime minister Ehud Olmert in an interview with the BBC – represented a rare focus on Palestinian suffering by leading Israeli political figures. Most domestic criticism of the war has centred on the fate of hostages held in Gaza. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, dismissed the criticism as “shocking”. “While IDF soldiers are fighting Hamas, there are those who are strengthening the false propaganda against the state of Israel,” Netanyahu, who leads the most rightwing government in Israel’s history, said. Indirect ceasefire talks in the Qatari capital of Doha have faltered. Israel recalled much of its negotiating team on Tuesday, saying it would leave lower-level officials in place instead. Qatari leaders, who are mediating negotiations, said there was a large gap between the two sides that they had been unable to bridge. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 others. The militants are still holding 58 captives, about a third of whom are believed to be alive, after most of the others were returned in ceasefire agreements or other deals.Israel’s ensuing offensive, which has destroyed large swaths of Gaza, has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.",

    "title": "Finland ‘preparing for the worst’ as Russia expands military presence near border",
    "article_text": "Finlandhas said it expects Russia to further build up troops along their shared border when the war in Ukraine ends, after reports that Moscow had strengthened its military bases near the Nato frontier. Maj Gen Sami Nurmi, the head of strategy of the Finnish defence forces, said the military is following Moscow’s manoeuvring “very closely” and that it was their job, as part of theNatoalliance, to “prepare for the worst”. The Finnish border guard announced on Wednesday it had completed the first 35km (22 miles) of a planned 200km fence on its eastern border with Russia, which has beenclosed for more than a year after Helsinki accused Moscow of directing asylum seekers to Finland in a “hybrid operation”. The fence also uses cameras and sensors to distinguish between people and animals crossing. Satellite images,published in the New York Times, appear to show an expansion of military infrastructure near the Finnish border, including rows of tents, military vehicles, renovations to fighter jet shelters and construction on a previously unused helicopter base. Nurmi said: “They are changing structures and we are seeing moderate preparations when it comes to building infrastructure close to our borders, meaning that they will, once the war inUkrainehopefully ends, start to bring back the forces that have been fighting in Ukraine, especially land forces.” While this was not unexpected sinceFinlandjoined Nato at record speed in 2023 after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Nurmi said they were following the preparations “very closely”. “They are doing it in phases. I would say it is still moderate numbers. It’s not big construction, but in certain places building new infrastructure and preparing, bringing new equipment in,” he said. “You also have to evaluate whether they are preparing to send more troops to Ukraine or preparing to build up their forces close to our border. But I guess they are doing both.” Responding to Russia’s changing activities, Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday he was “not worried about it at all”, adding that Finland and Norway were “going to be very safe”. Echoing the president’s sentiment, Nurmi said there was “no immediate military threat towards Finland or Nato from this direction”. He added: “What happened right after the Ukrainian attack was we applied for Nato membership and then when we were accepted Russia announced they would start to change their military posture across the border.” Finnish citizens have become accustomed to the looming threat from its eastern neighbour but hundreds are still signing up for training courses to prepare for emergency situations. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion The Finnish Women’s National Emergency Preparedness Association (known as Nasta) said interest in its training courses was still high since it first soared in 2022, with more than 800 women applying for its spring course and most courses filling up in three to four minutes. But Suvi Aksela,Nasta’s communications and organisation manager, said the border buildup was not a big talking point in Helsinki. “It is not very alarming for us,” she said. “We are used to hearing stuff from Russia, like all these threats, and we knew once we joined Nato they said they were going to build up presence on the border, and they probably will, just because it’s Russia.”",

    "title": "Russia accused of trying to hack border security cameras to disrupt Ukraine aid",
    "article_text": "Russia tried to hack into border security cameras to spy on and disrupt the flow of western aid enteringUkraine, the UK’s intelligence services and its allies have claimed. A unit of Russia’s military intelligence services is accused of using a host of methods to target organisations delivering “foreign assistance”, by hacking into cameras at crossings and railway stations and near military installations. GRU Unit 26165 is also accused of sending phishing emails containing pornography and fake professional information and obtaining stolen account passwords to get into systems. It was claimed the unit – also known as APT 28and Fancy Bear– has conducted the malicious cyber-campaign against public and private organisations in Nato states since 2022. In itsadvisorynote, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) – part of GCHQ – called on private companies involved in the delivery of aid to “take immediate action to protect themselves”. “In addition to targeting logistics entities, unit 26165 actors likely used access to private cameras at key locations, such as near border crossings, military installations, and rail stations, to track the movement of materials into Ukraine,” the advisory says. “The actors also used legitimate municipal services, such as traffic cams.” About 10,000 cameras were said to have been accessed near “military installations, and rail stations, to track the movement of materials into Ukraine”, of which 80% were in Ukraine and 10% in Romania. It is claimed 4% of the cameras targeted were in Poland, 2.8% in Hungary and 1.7% in Slovakia. The locations of the remaining cameras targeted were not provided. The hacking would have provided access to a “snapshot” of the cameras’ images, it is said. Other attempts were made that were designed to gather sensitive information on shipments, such as train schedules and shipping manifests, it is claimed. “In at least one instance, the actors attempted to use voice phishing to gain access to privileged accounts by impersonating IT staff,” says the advisory from 10 countries including the US, France and Germany. It adds: “The subjects of spearphishing emails were diverse and ranged from professional topics to adult themes. Phishing emails were frequently sent via compromised accounts or free webmail accounts. The emails were typically written in the target’s native language and sent to a single targeted recipient.” Paul Chichester, the NCSC’s director of operations, said: “This malicious campaign by Russia’s military intelligence service presents a serious risk to targeted organisations, including those involved in the delivery of assistance to Ukraine.

We strongly encourage organisations to familiarise themselves with the threat and mitigation advice included in the advisory to help defend their networks.” Actions suggested include increasing monitoring, using multi-factor authentication with strong factors – such as passkeys – and ensuring security updates are applied promptly to manage vulnerabilities. The advisory was drawn up with agencies from the US, Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, France and the Netherlands.

    "title": "‘It is time to ask if the rules allow abuse’: broadcasters call for overhaul of Eurovision voting after Israeli near win",
    "article_text": "Broadcasters across Europe are challenging the Eurovision song contest voting system, after an overwhelming public vote in favour of Israel’s entry saw it narrowly miss out on victory in a tense finale on Saturday. The contest was ultimatelywon by Austria’s JJ with Wasted Love. Finland’s Yle Entertainment said: “We will ask the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) whether it is time to update these rules or at least review whether the current rules allow for abuse.” Spain’s public broadcaster called for a “complete review” to avoid “external interference”. Ireland’s RTÉ has requested a breakdown of the numbers, and the Netherlands and Iceland are also among those to have raised issues. Director of the competition, Martin Green, said it is taking the concerns “seriously”. Israel’s song, New Day Will Rise, submitted by the Israeli public service broadcaster Kan,comprehensively wonthe public part of the vote, after scoring points from 34 of the 38 national and international phone votes. Its performer, Yuval Raphael, was a survivor of the terror assault on the Nova musical festival. The previous Israeli entry finished second in the public vote, earning fifth place in the 2024 contest. Kan had previously beenforced to change the lyricsof entry October Rain, which was deemed to directly reference the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack inside Israel. Performer Eden Golan instead sung the retitled Hurricane. Public Spotify and YouTube streaming data shows that Raphael’s track lags far behind other competitors in terms of popularity. New Day Will Rise wasthe 19th most popular songfrom this year’s competition on Spotify in the week of the event, yet scored the maximumdouze pointsfrom 13 national public votes. Israeli government social media channelshave been encouraging people to vote for its representative the maximum 20 times permitted. The Israeli embassy in London posted to social media during the final, encouraging people to vote 20 times for Raphael. The Israeli marketing appears to encourage people to submit multiple votes without even having listened to the song or watched the show. This is not currently against Eurovision’s rules. Belgium’s broadcaster VRT provided data to community news site Songfestival.be which alsoappeared to showa disparity between numbers of viewers and voters. Their statistics indicated that the number of votes cast from Belgium had increased from 1.3m in 2023, to 2m in 2024 and then 2.2m in 2025. However, the show had only about half as many viewers in 2025 as in 2023, as Belgium did not make the final. Dutch broadcaster AvroTros issued a statement this week saying that it attaches “great importance to the apolitical and binding value of the Eurovision song contest” but that it is “increasingly influenced by social and geopolitical pressures”. The results have delighted some quarters. The Jewish Chronicledescribed the 2025 resultas a “rebuff” to anti-Israeli activists and media pundits, writing that “Eurovision fans ignored the relentless campaigning against the Jewish state”. Ewan Spence, senior editor atESC Insight, which reports on Eurovision all year round, told the Guardian that there are potential issues with any future Israeli victory while the Gaza conflict continues. “If Kan wins the Eurovision song contest under the Israeli flag, it would be expected to host the following year, which would raise significant security challenges. “If the contest had to be hosted elsewhere in partnership, the reputation of Eurovision inside Israel would be damaged, and the co-host broadcaster taking on that challenge would face reputational PR issues.” German broadcaster ARD would most likely be the first port of call for the EBU approaching someone to co-host alongside Israel, the way the UK co-hosted on behalf of Ukraine in Liverpool in 2023. However, Benjamin Netanyahu’s administration, which has beenseeking to privatise Kan, would almost certainly apply pressure for the contest to take place in Israel itself. Broadcasters would be under pressure to boycott a contest hosted or co-hosted by Israel while the conflict in Gaza continued. Some in the Eurovision community believe the contest has been affected by changes made by the EBU to accommodate Israel’s participation. The volume of the crowd in the arena appears to be mixed lower now, to prevent TV broadcasting boos for Israeli acts or pro-Palestinian slogans, and stricter rules were brought in on fans having flags inside the arena. There wasa security incident during Raphael’s performancethat led to a Eurovision staff member being hit with paint, and on the day of the contest pro-Palestinian demonstrators clashed with police in the centre of host city Basel. Spence said: “If Kan had won Eurovision on Saturday, the song contest would have faced an increased loss of engagement from community media and the wider fanbase.” Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez explicitly called on Israel to be expelled from Eurovision on Monday, directly comparing the situation with that of Russia’s exclusion from international events, saying: “[Russia] had to leave international competitions and could not take part … Therefore Israel shouldn’t either, because what we cannot allow is double standards in culture.” The EBU has been contacted for comment.",

    "title": "Israel-Gaza war: Netanyahu says all of Gaza will be under Israel’s control by end of offensive – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This live blog is now closed. For the latest on the Israel-Gaza war, read our full report: Benjamin NetanyahusaysIsraelis “prepared” for an opportunity for a temporary ceasefire and hostage release deal. He says Israeli forces have “pounded” their enemy in the south and withstood “incredible” amounts of pressure to stop the war. On the subject ofOperation Gideon’s Chariots,the new Israeli ground offensive inGaza, Netanyahu says three days ago he made the decision to begin the next stage of the war. He says: At the end of this campaign, all of the territories of the Gaza Strip will be under Israel’s security control. It’s 10pm in Tel Aviv andGaza. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: Palestinians in Gaza are still waiting for aid to arrive, UN officials said, two days afterIsraelsaid it had lifted an 11-week-old blockadethat has brought the Palestinian territory to the brink of famine. A UN spokesperson said trucks were still in the loading area of the Kerem Shalom crossing, but sources told Reuters that at least 15 aid trucks left the crossing en route to World Food Program warehouses in central Gaza. At least 82 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strike in Gaza on Wednesday, including several women and a week-old infant,according to Gaza’s health ministry and area hospitals. Israeli strikes targeted a bus station in the Daraj neighbourhood of Gaza City and blew up residential buildings east of Jabalia, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces “probably” killed Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar,the younger brother of the former Hamas leader in Gaza,Yahya Sinwar.He said Israel has achieved “a lot” in its “clear and justified” goal of defeating Hamas, but he adds that “our work isn’t over yet”. The Israeli leader said the entire of the Gaza Strip will be under Israeli security control by the end of its new offensive.Netanyahu said he is “prepared” to end the war “under clear conditions that ensure Israel’s security”, which would include the Palestinian territory being “completely disarmed” and Israel “making the most of the Trump plan”. Israel acknowledged firing “warning shots” at a group of 25 diplomats visiting the occupied West Bank on Wednesday.The delegation comprised ambassadors and diplomats representing 31 countries, including Italy, Canada, Egypt, Jordan and the UK, who were on an official mission organised by the Palestinian Authority to observe the humanitarian situation there. The Israeli military said the visit had been approved but the delegation “deviated from the approved route”. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, condemned Israel’s firing at diplomats which he said was “unacceptable”.Countries including the Netherlands, Turkey, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and France all condemned the incident. The British, French and other European ministers summoned the Israeli ambassadors in their respective capitals to explain the “unacceptable” incident. Netanyahu said Israel’s government will appoint the next head of the domestic Shin Bet intelligence agency,despite Israel’s attorney general barring him from doing so. Israel’s supreme court ruled earlier on Wednesday that Netanyahu’s announcement that he was sacking Shin Bet chiefRonen Barwas “illegal and contrary to law”. The UK will send £4m worth of aid to Gaza as it ramps up pressure on the Israeli government to lift a blockade on the region.The aid will include essential medicines, safe drinking water and food parcels. It comes after the UK on Tuesday suspended trade deal talks with Israel, sanctioned West Bank settlers and summoned the country’s ambassador. The UN secretary general,António Guterres,has condemnedIsrael’s firing at a group of diplomats visiting the occupiedWest Bankon Wednesday. Stéphane Dujarric, Guterres’ spokesperson, told reporters: It is clear that diplomats who are doing their work should never be shot at, attacked in any way, shape or form. Their safety, their viability, must be respected at all times. These diplomats, including UN personnel, were fired at, warning shots or whatever... which is unacceptable. The Israeli military has admitted firing “warning shots” at a group of 25 diplomats who were visiting Jenin in the West Bank on an official mission organised by the Palestinian Authority. It said it “regrets the inconvenience caused” by the shooting, which resulted in no injuries. Dujarric added: We urge the Israeli authorities to conduct a thorough investigation, to share those findings with us and to take any measures that would prevent any other such incident to take place. Donald Trumphas been meeting with South Africa’s president,Cyril Ramaphosa,at the White House on Wednesday. Trump, speaking to reporters ahead of talks with Ramaphosa, said he does not “expect anything” to come of South Africa’sinternational court of justice (ICJ)case againstIsrael. South Africabrought a case against Israelat the ICJ accusing it of committing genocide in its military campaign in Gaza. Israel has fiercely rejected the claim. At least 15 aid trucks entered theGaza Stripthrough theKerem Shalom crossingen route to World Food Program warehouses in centralGaza, Reuters is reporting, citing two sources. As wereported earlier,UN officials said no humanitarian aid has yet been distributed in Gaza despite Israel’s government saying that it had lifted an 11-week-old blockade. Israel’s military said five aid trucks entered Gaza on Monday and 93 on Tuesday. But none of this aid has made it to Gaza’s soup kitchens, bakeries, markets and hospitals, according to aid officials and local bakeries. A UN spokesperson said trucks were still in the loading area of Kerem Shalom because access to the rest of Gaza was too insecure to allow safe distribution. Benjamin Netanyahuwas asked about Israel’s attorney general,Gali Baharav-Miara, barring him from appointing a new head of theShin Betinternal security service. It comes after Israel’s supreme court ruled that Netanyahu’s announcement that he was sacking Shin Bet chiefRonen Barwas “illegal and contrary to law”. In its ruling, the court determined that the dismissal was done in violation of the law, and that Netanyahu had a conflict of interest because of an investigation into the “Qatar-Gate” affair. Netanyahu, speaking during his news conference on Wednesday said his government would appoint the next Shin Bet chief despite the latest judgement. “Under my command, the government of Israel will appoint the next head of the Shin Bet” agency, he said. Benjamin Netanyahusays he is “prepared” to finish the war in Gaza under conditions that will “ensure Israel’s security”, return the hostages, and with Hamas leadership exiled from the territory. The Israeli leader saysGazamust be “completely disarmed” and Israel will be “making the most of the Trump plan”. He says the Trump plan is “correct” and “revolutionary”, where residents of Gaza who want to leave can leave. He says those who are calling on Israel to stop the fighting before its goals are achieved are “basically calling for keeping Hamas in control of Gaza”. Benjamin Netanyahusays he has been hearing from Israel’s “greatest friends” who have told him that they will give him their full support and send weapons, but that they “cannot accept a situation where there’s a humanitarian crisis in Gaza”. He says Israel has developed a new three-stage programme with the US to distribute basic food items to the civilian population inGaza. This plan includes bringing basic food items “to prevent a humanitarian crisis now”, opening food distribution points by American companies secured by Israeli forces, and creating a “sterile zone” in the south where Gaza’s civilians can get “full humanitarian assistance”, he says. Benjamin Netanyahusays Iran is still a “major threat” toIsrael. Israel is working in “full coordination” with the US and hopes to achieve a deal that will prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear arms, he says. In any case, the State of Israel retains the right to protect itself from a regime that’s ready to destroy it. Benjamin NetanyahusaysIsraelis “prepared” for an opportunity for a temporary ceasefire and hostage release deal. He says Israeli forces have “pounded” their enemy in the south and withstood “incredible” amounts of pressure to stop the war. On the subject ofOperation Gideon’s Chariots,the new Israeli ground offensive inGaza, Netanyahu says three days ago he made the decision to begin the next stage of the war. He says: At the end of this campaign, all of the territories of the Gaza Strip will be under Israel’s security control. Benjamin Netanyahuhas begun speaking at a press conference where he saysIsraelhas achieved “a lot” in its “clear and justified” goal of defeating Hamas, but he adds that “our work isn’t over yet”. The Israeli leader says his forces killedYahya Sinwar,the Hamas leader who was the rincipal architect ofthe attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, and “probably” his brotherMohammed Sinwar. Mohammed Sinwar was reportedly killed in an Israeli airstrike inGazalast week, according to reports. Caspar Veldkamp,the foreign minister ofthe Netherlands,has condemned the shooting and said he has “requested clarification from the Israeli authorities.” The Netherlands is “considering further steps,” hewroteon X, adding: Diplomats should be able to do their work and threatening them is unacceptable. Our video team have produced this report of the Jenin shooting No humanitarian aid has yet been distributed in the Gaza Strip, the United Nations said on Wednesday, two days afterIsraellifted an 11-week blockade and began allowing limited deliveries into the territory through the Kerem Shalom crossing. “So far … none of the supplies have been able to leave the Kerem Shalom loading area,” said UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, adding that it was because Israeli authorities had only allowed access withinGaza“that we felt was insecure” and where looting was likely due to the prolonged deprivation.",

    "title": "Trump administration accepts jet from Qatar for possible use as Air Force One",
    "article_text": "TheTrump administrationhas accepted the controversial gift of a Boeing 747 jetliner from the government ofQatar, and directed the air force to assess how quickly the plane can be upgraded for possible use as a new Air Force One. The offer of the jet has set off a firestorm of bipartisan criticism of Trump, particularly following the president’s visit to the country last week to arrange US business deals. A Pentagon spokesperson confirmed the gift to theNew York Timesand the Associated Press. “The secretary of defense has accepted a Boeing 747 fromQatarin accordance with all federal rules and regulations,” said Sean Parnell, chief Pentagon spokesperson, in a statement on Wednesday. “The Department of Defense will work to ensure proper security measures and functional-mission requirements are considered for an aircraft used to transport the president of the United States.” The aircraft will require major modifications to meet presidential security standards, including missile defense systems, secure communications and protection against electromagnetic pulses. Pentagon officials have acknowledged that the jet is not yet suitable for presidential use without significant upgrades. Members of Congress havevoiced concernsthat the air force may be pressured to rush the process, potentially compromising critical safety features. Lawmakers from both parties havealso questionedQatar’s motives, suggesting the gift could be an attempt to gain influence or that the plane might contain hidden surveillance devices. Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator for Connecticut, previouslycondemned the giftin the context of the president’s trip to the Middle East last week. “Why did he choose these three countries for his first major foreign trip? It’s not because these are our most important allies or the most important countries in the world,” he said of Trump’s visit to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. “It’s because these are the three countries willing to pay him off. Every single one of these countries is giving Trump money – the plane from Qatar, an investment in his cryptocurrency scam from the UAE – and they are asking for national security concessions in return.” Murphy added: “This is the definition of corruption. Foreign governments putting money in the president’s pocket and then the US giving them national security concessions that hurt our own security.” Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, denied any intention to sway the president, stating the gift was made with full governmental approval and was not meant to influence US policy. “I see it as a normal thing that happens between allies,” the prime minister told the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha on Tuesday. “I don’t know why people are thinking that this is considered as bribery.” He added that the partnership between the two countries “is a two-way relationship; it’s mutually beneficial for Qatar and for the United States”. Trump was highly critical of Qatar during his first presidency. In June 2017, the president said Qatar “has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level”, and said he supported a blockade against the country led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.",

    "title": "UK MPs to grill ministers over arms exports to Israel",
    "article_text": "Three ministers responsible for arms exports toIsraelhave been summoned by parliament’s committee overseeing UK exports to explain possible loopholes in the rules. Liam Byrne, the chair of the business select committee has ordered the trade minister, Douglas Alexander, and the relevant ministers from the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence and to offer urgent explanations. MPs are concerned that arms companies may be using the partial nature of the arms export ban imposed last September by the UK to send weaponry to Israel for use in Gaza, in breach of an undertaking by ministers. In his letter, Byrne raises concerns about statistics published on Friday that showed that in the fourth quarter of 2024 – after Labour’s partial arms export ban to Israel was imposed – the UK government nevertheless approved licences for £127.6m of military equipment to Israel. This is greater than the combined total for 2020-23, according to Campaign against the Arms Trade. Challenged on these figures by the independent Labour MP Zarah Sultana in the Commons on Tuesday, the foreign secretary,David Lammy, said he did not recognise the number and accused her of sensationalising the issue. He assured MPs “arms are not getting to Israel that could be used in Gaza”. However, the latest figures show the government authorised more than £61m in single-issue licences for military goods with an end user in Israel. This included licences for goods categories covering targeting systems, munitions and military aircraft parts. In his letter, Byrne points out that ministers assured MPs that the ban covered “equipment that we assess is for use in the current conflict in Gaza, such as important components that go into military aircraft, including fighter aircraft, helicopters and drones, as well as items that facilitate ground targeting”. He asks for an explanation for the increase and the proportion of arms going to the Israeli state. In addition, he has asked for the release of statistics on the number of licences that have been changed to remove Israel as the end user. The high court last week conducted a four-day judicial review of the UK government’s claim that it was lawful for the UK to sell components for F-35 fighter jets indirectly to Israel even though there was an acknowledged ministerial acceptance that those parts could be transferred for use in planes to bomb Gaza. Meanwhile, Labour MPs and human rights groups welcomed Lammy’s hardening in tone concerning the blockade of aid into Gaza on Tuesday, but almost every Labour backbencher who spoke during the 90-minute session expressed anger that ministers had only suspended talks on an expanded free trade deal with Israel, and hinted at further unspecified concrete measures.",

    "title": "Pakistan blames India for suspected suicide attack on school bus",
    "article_text": "Pakistan has blamed India for a suspected suicide attack on a school bus in its south-western province of Balochistan on Wednesday morning that killed three children. The bus was en route to the army public school in the city of Khuzdar. According to local officials, an attacker drove a vehicle into the bus and then detonated explosives. Officials said five people – three children, the bus driver and a security guard – were killed and dozens more children were critically injured. Police said the initial investigation indicated that it was a suicide bombing. The children killed were named as 12-year-old Hifsa Kausar, 16-year-old Esha Saleem and 12-year-old Sania Somroo. No militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. However, the media wing of Pakistan’s military swiftly issued a statement alleging that its neighbour and rivalIndiahad “planned and orchestrated” the attack. “Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians,” the military statement said. India’s foreign ministry denied what it called “baseless allegations regarding Indian involvement in unrest in Pakistan”. The accusation comes at a highly volatile moment in India-Pakistan relations. Earlier this month, the two nuclear-armed countries came the closest they had been to war in decades as they launched drones and missiles into each other’s territory, before a ceasefire was declared on 10 May. The trigger for the conflict was a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in April that killed 26 people. The Indian government accused Pakistan-backed militant groups of being behind the incident and launched targeted missile strikes as “terrorist infrastructure and camps” over the border. Pakistan responded by firing missiles at Indian military targets. In the aftermath of the ceasefire, the Indian government said any future terror attacks on its territory would be considered an act of war. Pakistan has denied any involvement in last month’s militant attack in Indian Kashmir. It has become more vocal in blaming India for a rising wave of militant attacks that have struck Pakistan, particularly in the regions of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Pakistan has repeatedly accused India of using proxy militant groups to carry out terror attacks in order to destabilise the country, which India has denied. In Balochistan, home to a decades-long bloody insurgency, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist militant group, has been behind a growing number of incidents including suicide bombings and the recent hijacking of a train. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which borders Afghanistan, attacks by the Pakistani Taliban, known as TTP, have been intensifying recently. Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, echoed the military in blaming India for Wednesday’s attack on the school bus. “Terrorists operating under Indian patronage attacking innocent children on a school bus is clear evidence of their hostility,” he said. A Balochistan government spokesperson, Shahid Rind, denounced the attack as the “hideous face of Indian state-sponsored terrorism”. The attack echoed an incident more than a decade earlier when the TTP struck an army public school in the city of Peshawar, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing more than 130 schoolchildren. It was one of the deadliest militant attacks on children in Pakistan’s history.",

    "title": "Bhutanese Nepalis fled ethnic cleansing for the US. Trump is returning them to the refugee camps",
    "article_text": "Aasis Subedi, a Bhutanese Nepali refugee, finds himself back in the same Nepal refugee camp he spent part of his youth, once again stateless. Last month,Subediand two dozen community members from across the US weredeported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers to Bhutan, the tiny Himalayan country where they had never previously set foot. At least four, including Subedi, were immediately rejected by Bhutanese authorities and then expelled to India, where they fled to a refugee camp in Nepal. “I have nothing right now. They brought us in [to Bhutan] without any documents,” he says from one of the three Beldangi refugee camps in the south-east of Nepal, where he is using his father’s cellphone. Subedi had been serving jail time for a third-degree felony offense committed in Columbus, Ohio, before he was put on a plane and deported via New Jersey. Subedi is one of the more than 100,000 Bhutanese Nepalis who fledethnic cleansingand were made stateless by the Bhutanese government who stripped them of their citizenship rights in the 1980s. Since 2008, more than 90,000 have been resettled in the US. But theTrump administrationhas upended life for the community. “Bhutan is still not safe for our community members to return [to]. It is a matter of putting our lives at risk … Now, people are going through the cycle of being stateless again,” says Robin Gurung of Asian Refugees United. Several of the deported people are believed to be missing in India. Icetold Global Press Journalthat Subedi was deported under a “targeted enforcement operation”. Green card holders – Subedi is a legal permanent resident – can be deported having been found guilty of a serious crime but only after having the opportunity to plead their case in court and once the US government has shown “clear and convincing evidence” that the person can be deported. US laws forbid the deportation of individuals to countries where their safety may be at risk. “Most of the folks who have been deported have already served their time. For me, that is the matter of concern,” says Gurung. “They served their time, they were in their communities, providing for their families, their children, and now they are gone.” Thousands of Bhutanese Nepalis have settled in parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania that faced major economic struggles and population loss due to the 2008 Great Recession. About 8,000 Bhutanese Nepali people now live in Reynoldsburg, a city outside Columbus, making up about one-fifth of the population. Along the suburb’s main thoroughfare, East Main Street, Bhutanese Americans have opened up more than 30 businesses ranging from hair salons to restaurants. “A lot of the community works at local Amazon and FedEx facilities. Those kinds of jobs were very attractive for folks, and the schools in Reynoldsburg are good,” says Bhuwan Pyakurel who came to Reynoldsburg in 2016 and has since becomeAmerica’s first-ever Nepali-Bhutanese elected official. “Many of those businesses were closed before we came here [and] we came and revived them. Cricket is a big thing for the Bhutanese community when it wasn’t known here in the past. Now the city is in the process of building a new cricket field.” While towns and cities across the Sun belt have grown significantly in recent years, northern states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and beyond have struggled to retain and attract residents. As a result, immigrants have played an important role in helping local economies grow, creating a tax base for city authorities and adding vibrancy to a region working to shed its Rust belt past. Nextdoor in Pennsylvania, about 40,000 Bhutanese Nepalis live in the cities of Harrisburg and Lancaster. Harrisburg has lost nearly half of its population since 1950, though in recent years that decline has been halted. But now a crippling fear has gripped immigrant communities across the country. Pyakurel, who was elected to Reynoldsburg’s city council in 2019 having lived in a refugee camp in Nepal for 18 years, says he now fields five to 10 phone calls a day from worried local Bhutanese Nepali residents, many asking for guidance. “People are wondering if they should apply for their citizenship or wait for three years, if they should renew certain documentation,” he says. Last month, the Palestinian green card holder and Columbia University student Mohsen Mahdawi was detained at a naturalization interview and deportation proceedings against him were enacted. On 30 April, Mahdawi wasreleased. “Nowadays, I carry my passport with me all the time,” says Pyakurel. “Even though I’m a [city council] representative here, I don’t look like a citizen to many Ice officers.” Subedi came to the US through a government refugee relocation program in July 2016 and had been living and working as a machine operator in Pennsylvania before his arrest in Columbus last July. Now 7,700 miles from home, he has little to do but sit all day in the refugee camp, where he lives in a bamboo-made hut – the very same camp he spent the first two years of his life and where his father still lives. The arrival of him and three others deported from the US caused a stir at the camp, which drew the attention of the Nepali police, who detained him for several weeks as his legal status was investigated. This month, his daughter turns three years old. He says his family has no money to assist him in the refugee camp in part because his wife stopped working when their child was born. He says he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to come back to the US. “I want to come back. I have family, my kids,” Subedi says. “This is the second time we have become a refugee.”",

    "title": "Shabana Mahmood considers chemical castration for serious sex offenders",
    "article_text": "Shabana Mahmood, the lord chancellor, is considering mandatory chemical castration for the most serious sex offenders, according to government sources. The minister’s department is planning to expand a pilot to 20 regions as part of a package of “radical” measures to free thousands of prisoners and ease prison overcrowding in England and Wales. As well as releasing and tagging killers and rapists after they have served half of their sentence, she is considering the findings of an independent sentencing review that has also called for the government to build an evidence base on drugs that “suppress libido” or reduce “sexual thoughts”. They are among 48 recommendations put forward by David Gauke, the chair of the review. Mahmood is expected to address the Commons on Thursday to outline which measures she will accept in a major overhaul of criminal justice. Government sources said she is expected to accept the review’s key measures including that well-behaved prisoners should be released on tag after serving a third of their sentences. She has also accepted that those who have committed serious sexual or violent crimes could be freed to serve their sentence in the community after they have served half of their sentence. One of Gauke’s suggestions – that the most dangerous offenders should be allowed to apply for parole earlier if they earn “credits” – has been dismissed by sources close to the justice secretary. The report has urged ministers to build a comprehensive evidence base around the use of chemical suppression for sex offenders and examine the findings of similar programmes in Germany, Denmark and Poland. “Problematic sexual arousal and preoccupation can be reduced via chemical suppressants and other medications, which can be prescribed for individuals who have committed a sexual offence under certain circumstances,” the report notes. It points out that a 2022 pilot programme at prisons in south-west England which uses libido-suppressing drugs is due to end next year and recommends “continued funding of services in this area”. The government plans to expand the pilot using these as a staging post to a full, nationwide rollout, a source close to Mahmood said. The approach is delivered through two drugs. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) limit invasive sexual thoughts. Anti-androgens reduce the production of testosterone and limit libido. The drugs are taken alongside psychiatric work that targets other causes of sexual offending, such as a desire for power and control. Mahmood is exploring whether chemical castration could be made mandatory, instead of voluntary, for the most serious offenders, the source said. Sexual offences accounted for 21% of adults serving immediate custodial sentences at the end of March 2025. The report notes that participation in any such programme would be voluntary in England and Wales. Among the main recommendations, Gauke, the former Conservative justice secretary, said the government should: Ensure custodial sentences under 12 months are only used in exceptional circumstances. Extend suspended sentences to up to three years and encourage greater use of deferred sentences for low-risk offenders. Give courts greater flexibility to use fines and ancillary orders like travel, driving and football bans. Allow probation officers to adjust the level of supervision based on risk and compliance with licence conditions. Expand specialist domestic abuse courts to improve support for victims. Expand tagging for all perpetrators of violence against women and girls. Improve training for practitioners and the judiciary on violence against women and girls. Change the statutory purposes of sentencing so judges and magistrates must consider protecting victims as much as they consider punishment and rehabilitation when passing sentences. Gauke has called for the need to increase funding and resources for the probation service, including expanding the availability of electronic monitoring equipment like tags, and warned that there will be a “public backlash” if money is not found. “If probation are left without additional resources then the risk is that we won’t make progress on rehabilitation and there will be a public backlash,” he said. The National Police Chiefs’ Council echoed Gauke’s calls for more resources. Chief constable Sacha Hatchett, national policing lead for criminal justice, said: “Out of prison should not mean out of control. If we are going to have fewer people in prison, we need to ensure that we collectively have the resources and powers to manage the risk offenders pose outside prison. “Adequate funding to support these measures must be reflected in the upcoming spending review, as well as investment in probation services and technology, including electronic monitoring.” Penal reform group the Howard League welcomed the recommendations. Andrea Coomber, the chief executive, said: “The ball is now in the government’s court. Solving the prison capacity crisis will require major intervention and, as the review recognises, this will only succeed if reform and investment deliver an effective and responsive probation service that works to cut crime in the community.” The Conservatives have condemned Gauke’s review. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, said: “By scrapping short prison sentences Starmer is effectively decriminalising crimes like burglary, theft and assault. This is a gift to criminals who will be free to offend with impunity.”",

    "title": "New report says ‘government must act’ to ease pressures on British theatres",
    "article_text": "A report by theSociety of London TheatreandUK Theatre, released on Thursday, puts the spotlight on an industry struggling with rocketing production costs and in need of urgent funding. The sister trade associations have called for the government’s comprehensive spending review to dramatically increase public investment, including £500m for infrastructure, and to support itsTheatre for Every Childinitiative which aims to ensure all pupils attend a professional theatre production before leaving school. The organisations’ co-CEOs, Claire Walker and Hannah Essex, said: “Theatres are doing more with less – and the strain is showing. Rising costs, shrinking support and ageing infrastructure are putting the sector under unsustainable pressure. We are seeing world-class organisations forced to cut programmes, delay maintenance and scale back outreach. If we want to maintain the UK’s position as a global leader in theatre – and continue to inspire the next generation of actors, writers, and technicians – then government must act.” The report, drawing on information from theatres that are members of the two organisations, states that one in five venues “require at least £5m over the next decade simply to remain operational”. Without substantial capital funding, nearly 40% “could close or become unusable”. Roughly one in four organisations ran a deficit in 2023–24, and almost one-third project a shortfall in the subsequent financial year. Since 2010, funding from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has fallen by 18% per person in real terms, notes the report, while local authority support has declined by as much as 48%. “Years of decline in creative education and underinvestment in skills training have left theatres struggling to recruit and retain staff,” it adds, with almost half of theatre leaders saying that new hires lack the necessary skills, particularly in technical roles. Against this backdrop, and the challenges of the pandemic and cost of living crisis, the two organisations’ member theatres drew audiences in excess of 37 million in 2024. ItsWest Endvenues “surpassed 17.1 million attenders [akin to 2023 levels] and generated more than £1bn in revenue”. Data from 48 regional venues shows a 4% increase in occupancy between 2019 and 2024 yet also underlined what regular theatregoers around the UK will have noticed: the number of shows being programmed has, in many cases, dropped in the last five years as theatres prune their schedules amid financial challenges. Bemoaning news headlines about premium ticket prices, the report stated that across the UK most tickets were sold for £39.50 or less (with 19% priced under £20 outside London), while in the West End most were sold at £56 or less. Since 2019, the average West End ticket price has fallen by 5.3% in real terms. Research quoted by the report shows that for every £1 spent on a theatre ticket, “an additional £1.40 is spent in the local economy”, while every pound of public investment returns more than £11 to the Treasury. The report said that the West End’s 11% post-pandemic audience growth is unmatched in the UK’s entertainment sector and highlighted that, last year, “nearly one in four international visitors to London attended a West End show – a testament to its global appeal”.",

    "title": "Sure Start centres saved UK government £2 for every £1 spent, study finds",
    "article_text": "Sure Start children’s centres provided £2 of savings for every £1 in costs, according to theInstitute for Fiscal Studies(IFS), prompting calls for the government to look at such services as potentially paying for themselves. The centres,championed by the last Labour government, created £2.8bn in savings and revenues at the scheme’s peak in England, according to the IFS study. Sarah Cattan, a research fellow at the IFS and an author of the report, said: “Our work shows that integrated early years services, done well, are cheaper than they initially seem once their benefits are taken into account.” After calculating the benefits for government and individuals, the IFS said: “We estimate that every £1 of up-front spending on Sure Start generated £2.05 in total benefits over the long run.” The IFS found the positive impacts of Sure Start were widespread and “remarkably long lasting”, producing better health, education and social care outcomes for families who enrolled in the programme offering support for children up to the age of five. Sure Start established “one-stop shops” initially in disadvantaged areas, from 1999 onwards, with early years, health and family support services under a single roof. It is often regarded as one of New Labour’s most successful social policies. The programme was dismantled by Conservative-led governments elected from 2010 onwards. At its peak in 2009-10 Sure Start had 3,600 centres in England, before austerity cuts reduced government funding by two-thirds, with local authoritiesscaling back or closing most of the centresby 2018. The IFS looked at children born in the 1990s and 2000s who took part, and found it improved health and educational outcomes, including better than expected GCSE results, as well as reducing school absences and less severe special educational needs and disabilities. Nick Ridpath, a research economist at the IFS and an author of the report, said: “These benefits are not only important in their own right, they also generate savings to the public purse and boost lifetime earnings. Sure Start did not quite pay for itself from the government’s perspective. But taking benefits for lifetime earnings into account, in the long run it will generate around twice as much value as it cost.” At its peak, Sure Start’s running costs were about £2.7bn a year in 2023–24 prices. The IFS calculated that the government benefited from savings of £600m each year in lower health, special needs and social care demands, and £1.9bn in extra income tax and national insurance revenue. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion In addition, the IFS said the programme generated a further £3.1bn in higher earnings for each year group who used the centres, equivalent to a £7,800 average boost to lifetime post-tax earnings. Neil Leitch, the chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: “As the IFS rightly points out, this kind of integrated early support has a positive impact not only on the children accessing the services but on society as a whole in the longer term. Clearly, then, investing in quality integrated early years services is not just the right moral decision, but a smart economic choice too.” The researchers warned that Sure Start was not a “silver bullet”, with the programme “unable to address all challenges that children and young people face”. It noted that it had no significant effect on the number of children spending time in council care and didn’t reduce support for more serious special needs provision.",

    "title": "Extra cancer scans for women with dense breasts could save 700 lives a year – UK study",
    "article_text": "Hundreds of lives could be saved every year with extra cancer checks for women with very dense breasts, a study suggests. Millions of women undergobreast screening, but regular mammograms can be less effective at spotting cancer in the 10% with very dense breasts, as the tissue can hide tumours on X-rays. This is because very dense breasts look whiter on scans, making it harder to detect early-stage disease, which also appears white. Offering this group of women enhanced scans could find 3,500 more cases of cancer and save 700 lives a year in the UK, researchers from the University of Cambridge said. Their findings werepublished in the Lancet. The study’s lead author, Prof Fiona Gilbert, said: “Getting a cancer diagnosis early makes a huge difference for patients in terms of their treatment and outlook. We need to change our national screening programme so we can make sure more cancers are diagnosed early, giving many more women a much better chance of survival.” She added: “In addition to the relevance for the UK’s breast cancer screening programme, this study has global implications for all countries where screening is undertaken for women with dense breast tissue.” The study involved 9,361 women in the UK who had dense breasts and had received a negative (no cancer) mammogram result. When additional scanning methods were trialled, an extra 85 cancers were found. Two methods examined were contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM), in which dye is used to make blood vessels more visible, and abbreviated magnetic resonance imaging (Ab-MRI), which is faster than a regular MRI. Researchers said adding either method to existing screening could detect 3,500 more cancers a year in the UK. With screening reducing mortality for about 20% of cancers detected, this could mean an extra 700 lives saved a year, the Cambridge team said. A third scanning method used in the trial – automated breast ultrasound (Abus) – also picked up cancers but was much less effective than CEM and Ab-MRI. CEM detected 19 cancers for every 1,000 women scanned, Ab-MRI found 17 and Abus found four. With mammograms already detecting about eight cases of cancer per 1,000 women with dense breasts, additional scans could more than treble breast cancer detection, the researchers said. The trial was funded byCancerResearch UK (CRUK) with support from the National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre. Although the trial showed the scans could detect additional small cancers, which would probably save lives, further research is needed to confirm whether they could reduce the number of deaths, in order to establish the risk of overdiagnosis and to estimate the cost-benefit ratio of offering extra scans. “More research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness of these techniques, but these results are encouraging,” said Dr David Crosby, the head of prevention and early detection at CRUK. Dr Kotryna Temcinaite, the head of research communications and engagement at Breast Cancer Now, said: “The UK National Screening Committee now needs to consider this research as part of their current review to determine whether women with very dense breasts should be offered additional imaging during their routine screening.” She added: “Routine breast screening is the most likely route to finding breast cancer early, when treatment is most likely to be successful. While we know that the current process can be less effective in detecting cancers in dense breasts, we still encourage all women to attend mammogram screening when invited.” The Department forHealthand Social Care said research into enhanced scans for women with dense breasts was being carried out as part of the NHS breast screening programme. “The UK National Screening Committee is reviewing this evidence as it becomes available,” a spokesperson said.",

    "article_text": "Liam O’Hanna, who performs with the Irish rap trio Kneecap, has been charged with a terrorism offence for allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a gig in London, police said. The 27-year-old, of Belfast, was charged after an investigation by the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command and is scheduled to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 18 June. O’Hanna, who performs under the stage name Mo Chara, was charged with displaying a flag at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town, north London, on 21 November last year “in such a way or in such circumstances as to arouse reasonable suspicion that he is a supporter of a proscribed organisation”, the Met said. The force added: “Officers from the Met’s counter-terrorism command were made aware on Tuesday 22 April of an online video from the event. An investigation was carried out, which led to the Crown Prosecution Service authorising the above charge.” Earlier this month, the Met said Kneecap was being investigated by counter-terrorism police after videos emerged allegedly showing the band calling for the deaths of MPs and shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”. The counter terrorism internet referral unit (CTIRU) is a national unit based within the Met’s counter-terrorism command, which is dedicated to identifying terrorist and extremist material online. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. A Metropolitan police spokesperson said at the time: “We were made aware of a video on 22 April, believed to be from an event in November 2024, and it has been referred to the counter-terrorism internet referral unit for assessment and to determine whether any further police investigation may be required. “We have also been made aware of another video believed to be from an event in November 2023.” Kneecap said they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and apologised last month to the families of murdered MPs but claimed footage of the incident had been taken out of context and was being “exploited and weaponised”. A number of concerts featuring the band have been called off since the videos emerged.",

    "title": "US Justice Department ends post-George Floyd police reform settlements",
    "article_text": "The administration of President Donald Trump has begun the process of ending the federal government’s involvement in reforming local police departments, a civil rights effort that gained steam after the deaths of unarmed Black people likeGeorge FloydandBreonna Taylor. On Wednesday, the United States Department of Justice announced it would cancel two proposed settlements that would have seen the cities ofLouisville, Kentucky, andMinneapolis, Minnesota, agree to federal oversight of their police departments. Generally, those settlements — called consent decrees — involve a series of steps and goals that the two parties negotiate and that a federal court helps enforce. In addition, the Justice Department said it would withdraw reports on six other local police departments which found patterns of discrimination and excessive violence. The Trump administration framed the announcement as part of its efforts to transfer greater responsibility towards individual cities and states — and away from the federal government. “It’s our view at the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division under the Trump administration that federal micromanagement of local police should be a rare exception, and not the norm,” said Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant attorney general at the Justice Department, said. She argued that such federal oversight was a waste of taxpayer funds. “There is a lack of accountability. There is a lack of local control. And there is an industry here that is, I think, ripping off the taxpayers and making citizens less safe,” Dhillon said. But civil rights leaders and police reform advocates reacted with outrage over the news, which arrived just days before the fifth anniversary of Floyd’s murder. Reverend Al Sharpton was among the leaders who called for police departments to take meaningful action after aviral videocaptured Floyd’s final moments. On May 25, 2020, a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, leaned his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes, causing him to asphyxiate and die. “This move isn’t just a policy reversal,” Sharpton said. “It’s a moral retreat that sends a chilling message that accountability is optional when it comes to Black and Brown victims.” He warned that the Trump administration’s move sent a signal to police departments that they were “above scrutiny”. The year of Floyd’s murder was also marked by a number of other high-profile deaths, including Taylor’s. The 26-year-old medical worker was in bed late at night on March 13, 2020, when police used a battering ram to break into her apartment. Her boyfriend feared they were being attacked and fired his gun once. The police responded with a volley of bullets, killing Taylor, who was struck six times. Her death and others stirred a period of nationwide unrest in the US, withmillions of peopleprotesting in the streets as part of social justice movements like Black Lives Matter. It is thought that the 2020 “racial reckoning” was one of the biggest mass demonstrations in US history. Those protests unfolded in the waning months of Trump’s first term, and when Democrat Joe Biden succeeded him as president in 2021, the Justice Department embarked on a series of 12 investigations looking into allegations of police overreach and excessive violence on the local level. Those investigations were called “pattern-or-practice” probes, designed to look into whether incidents of police brutality were one-offs or part of a larger trend in a given police department. Floyd’s murder took place in Minneapolis and Taylor’s in Louisville — the two cities where the Trump Justice Department decided to drop its settlements on Wednesday. In both cities, under Biden, the Justice Department had foundpatterns of discriminatory policing. “Police officers must often make split-second decisions and risk their lives to keep their communities safe,” the report on Minneapolis reads. But, it adds, the local police department “used dangerous techniques and weapons against people who committed at most a petty offence and sometimes no offense at all”. Other police departments scrutinised during this period included ones in Phoenix, Arizona; Memphis, Tennessee; Trenton, New Jersey; Mount Vernon, New York; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and the Louisiana State Police. Dhillon, who now runs the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, positioned the retractions of those Biden-era findings as a policy pivot. She also condemned the consent decrees as an overused tool and indicated she would look into rescinding some agreements that were already in place. That process would likely involve a judge’s approval, however. And while some community advocates have expressed concerns that consent decrees could place a burden on already over-stretched law enforcement departments, others disagree with the Justice Department’s latest move, arguing that a retreat could strip resources and momentum from police reform. At the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD), Chief Paul Humphrey said the commitment to better policing went beyond any settlement. He indicated he would look for an independent monitor to oversee reforms. “It’s not about these words on this paper,” he said. “It’s about the work that the men and women of LMPD, the men and women of metro government and the community will do together in order to make us a safer, better place.” And in Minneapolis, Mayor Jacob Frey doubled down, saying he could keep pushing forward with the police reform plan his city had agreed to. “We will comply with every sentence of every paragraph of the 169-page consent decree that we signed this year,” he said at a news conference. “We will make sure that we are moving forward with every sentence of every paragraph of both the settlement around the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, as well as the consent decree.”",

    "title": "Tottenham defeat Manchester United to win Europa League final",
    "article_text": "Tottenham beat Manchester United 1-0 to win the Europa League final, lifting its first European trophy in more than four decades to qualify for next season’s Champions League. It is the first major title for Tottenham since it won the English League Cup in 2008, and its first European triumph since it won its second UEFA Cup — the equivalent of the Europa League now — in 1984. Brennan Johnson squeezed in the winner at the end of the first half on Wednesday to help Spurs salvage a dismal season, in which it will finish near the bottom of the Premier League standings. The title guarantees Spurs a spot in next season’s Champions League, and brings some much-needed relief for manager Ange Postecoglou after he struggled to keep his team on track all year. The victory comes six years after Tottenham fell short against Liverpool in the Champions League final. The defeat adds pressure on United coach Ruben Amorim, whose team sits in 16th place — just ahead of Tottenham — in the Premier League. The club will not play in any European competition next season. United came close to equalising the match on Wednesday when a header by Rasmus Hojlund was cleared at the goal line by Tottenham’s Micky van de Ven in the 68th. Deep into stoppage time, a header by Luke Shaw prompted a difficult save by Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario. It had been an even match, with neither team creating many significant scoring opportunities, until Tottenham got on the board in the 42nd minute after a cross by Pape Sarr into the area. The ball ricocheted off Shaw and fell in front of Johnson, who seemed to get just enough of it to poke it across the goal line. United pressed forward after conceding, but was not able to get the equaliser in front of a split crowd of nearly 50,000 at Athletic Bilbao’s San Mames Stadium. United had last won a trophy in the 2024 FA Cup, and its last European triumph was at the 2017 Europa League under manager Jose Mourinho. The Red Devils lost all four matches against Tottenham this season and is winless against its rival in seven straight games, with the last six under Postecoglou. United and Tottenham had met in just one previous final — the 2009 League Cup when Alex Ferguson’s United won 4-1 on penalties after a 0-0 draw. Tottenham striker Son Heung-min, who came off the bench in the 67th, finally ended his decade-long trophy drought with Spurs.",

    "title": "Netanyahu says Israel will control ‘all of Gaza’ after latest offensive",
    "article_text": "The entireGaza Stripwill be under the Israeli military’s control at the end of its latest offensive, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says in his first news conference since December, setting out maximalist conditions for ending the devastating war on the besieged Palestinian enclave. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in relentless Israeli bombardments across Gaza in recent days, at least 82 since dawn Wednesday, as starvation takes hold and only a small amount ofaid trucksis allowed in with the blockade in effect in place. Netanyahu also said on Wednesday that if “there is an opportunity for a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange deal, Israel will be open to it”. The Israeli leader laid out the following conditions for ending the war: the release of all captives, the disarmament of Hamas, the exile of its leadership and the possibility of carrying on aplanoutlined by United States President Donald Trump in February that would expel Palestinians from Gaza. Trump has said the US should run Gaza and transform the territory into the “Riviera of the Middle East”. This is the first time Trump’s plan has been mentioned by Netanyahu as one of the conditions to halt fighting. Multiple nations and rights groups have called the plan ethnic cleansing. Netanyahu said Israel should avoid a “humanitarian crisis to preserve our freedom of operational action”, referring to Israel’s decision to allow a very limited number of humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza. He also referenced a much-criticised plan “developed with the US” to distribute food in the enclave without Hamas taking control of it. The Palestinian group denies it takes aid. Israel has come under international pressure to halt its punishing total blockade on Gaza, which had prevented any food or aid trucks from entering the territory since March 2. That has exacerbated the already dire humanitarian catastrophe inside the enclave. A United Nations-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification assessment found more than 93 percent of children in Gaza, or about 930,000, areon the brink of famine. On Wednesday, the Israeli army said it allowed 100 aid trucks carrying flour, baby food and medical equipment into Gaza. Yet UN officials said distribution problems had meant no aid had so far reached people in need. “The limited supplies finally being allowed to enter Kerem Shalom [in Arabic, the Karem Abu Salem border crossing] are nowhere near enough to meet the needs in Gaza, which are vast, which are tremendous. Much, much more aid needs to get in,” said Stephane Dujarric, the UN chief’s spokesperson. Aid groups have said the amount of aid that Israel is allowing is not nearly enough, calling Netanyahu’s efforts a “smokescreen to pretend the siege is over”. “The Israeli authorities’ decision to allow a ridiculously inadequate amount of aid into Gaza after months of an air-tight siege signals their intention to avoid the accusation of starving people in Gaza while, in fact, keeping them barely surviving,” said Pascale Coissard, the emergency coordinator in Khan Younis for Doctors Without Borders. Critics were swift in reacting to Netanyahu’s news conference. His “words today mean the occupation of Gaza for many years and waking up every day to the death of soldiers”, opposition leader Yair Lapid said, adding that the country’s international standing would collapse and the economy would be severely damaged. “I saw a presentation by a pressured, obsessed, lying man who takes no responsibility for anything,” the Democrats party leader Yair Golan said after the news conference. “I will sue you for defamation because of the lies you spread about me, and we will defeat you in the elections very soon and send you to the pages of history.” Netanyahu had slammed Golan on Tuesday after the opposition leader had said, “A sane country … does not kill babies as a hobby.” Netanyahu called the comment “appalling”.",

    "title": "Can Ramaphosa charm offensive help fix South Africa’s ties with Trump’s US?",
    "article_text": "Johannesburg, South Africa –When the millionaire mining magnate-turned-president of South Africa landed in Washington to meet the billionaire real estate tycoon-turned-president of the United States, it was with a deal in mind. Tensions have been escalating between the US and its African trade ally since Donald Trump took office this year, cut off aid to South Africa, repeated false accusations that a “white genocide” is taking place there and began welcoming Afrikaners asrefugees. At themeeting between Trump and Cyril Ramaphosain the White House on Wednesday, the South African president began by focusing heavily on trade and investments, highlighting the two countries’ years of cooperation, in keeping with statements made by South Africa’s presidency that Ramaphosa would present a trade deal to the US. But Trump responded with a well-prepared redirect that South African media and analysts described as an “ambush” and a move that “blindsided” Ramaphosa. Ready with printouts of news articles about alleged white victims of killings in South Africa and a video of firebrand opposition politician Julius Malema singingKill the Boer, Trump insisted that white farmers were being targeted and murdered – an assertion Ramaphosa politely yet firmly denied, saying criminality was a problem for all South Africans regardless of race. The team Ramaphosa assembled to join him on his working visit – which included four white South Africans: two golf legends, the wealthiest man in the country and the agriculture minister – all reaffirmed Ramaphosa’s facts that while violence was widespread, white people were not specifically being targeted. “We have a real safety problem in South Africa, and I don’t think anyone wants to candy-coat that,” said John Steenhuisen, the agriculture minister and a member of the Democratic Alliance party, which is part of South Africa’s governing coalition. “Certainly, the majority of South Africa’s commercial and smallholder farmers really do want to stay in South Africa and make it work,” the minister, who is himself an Afrikaner, said. Trump claimed that “thousands” of white farmers were fleeing South Africa. Steenhuisen added that the people in the video Trump showed were leaders of opposition minority parties and his party had joined forces with Ramaphosa “precisely to keep those people out of power”. The meeting began cordially where Trump complimented South African golfers, including well-known Ernie Els and Retief Goosen, who were part of the delegation. They both implored Trump for enhanced trade to uplift South Africa’s economy. Also in the delegation was South Africa’s richest man, Johann Rupert, a luxury-goods mogul and an Afrikaner. He countered claims of racial persecution against the white minority, saying that while criminality was rife, Black people were more often the victims. “We have too many deaths, but it’s across the board. It is not only white farmers,” Rupert said to Trump. Ramaphosa kept his cool, local media and observers said, noting that the South African president chose to remain calm, patient and light-hearted even in light of Trump’s attack. He steered talks back to trade, saying South Africa needed economic investment from its allies, and mostly sat expressionless while the video was played, occasionally stretching his neck to look at it. Ramaphosa went into “the lion’s den” and was met with an ambush but he remained calm, South African political analyst Sanusha Naidu said. “Ramaphosa and the delegation did not allow themselves to be baited into an emotional response. That’s critical. They made Trump feel like he had the upper hand in the meeting,” she told Al Jazeera, adding that given the narrative from Trump before Ramaphosa’s arrival, it “could have gone worse”. When asked by a reporter whether he wanted the impasse between the US and South Africa resolved, Trump said he was open to it. “I hope it has to be resolved. It should be resolved,” he said, adding that if it were not resolved, it would be “the end of the country”. Before the two leaders met on Wednesday, Ramaphosa’s office said the aim was to “reset” relations, especially as the US is South Africa’s second largest trading partner after China. “Whether we like it or not, we are joined at the hip, and we need to be talking to them,” the South African president said before his trip. Christopher Isike, a political scientist at the University of Pretoria, told Al Jazeera that direct engagement between the leaders was important, given the tense relations between their countries. “This is an opportunity for South Africa to correct misinformation peddled by President Trump and try to reset trade relations between the two countries,” he said. Isike noted that both presidents’ backgrounds as businesspeople could provide common ground for discussing mutually advantageous deals. “Rich friends of Ramaphosa are also rich friends of Trump, and that may have helped facilitate the meeting,” Isike added. Common ground and level heads would be useful as the leaders continued private talks away from the media on Wednesday, observers said. Before the visit, Ramaphosa maintained that while Trump was a dealmaker, he too was adept at making deals and even joked about the possibility of playing a round of golf with his US counterpart. Washington, however, has criticised Pretoria for a host of matters since Trump took office. This continued in the meeting on Wednesday. Trump focused on the white farmers, particularly Afrikaners – the descendants of mainly Dutch settlers who instituted apartheid. He alleged they are being killed because of their race despite evidence showing that attacks and killings are common across all groups in the country. Trump also mentioned South Africa’sland reform lawthat allows land in the public interest to be taken without compensation in exceptional circumstances in an effort to redress apartheid injustices. Pretoria said no white land has been taken, but the US said the law unfairly targets minority white South Africans who are the majority landholders. Despite Pretoria consistently seeking to rectify false assertions, the Trump administration has pushed ahead with a plan to take in Afrikaners as refugees. Thefirst grouparrived last week. He has also cut aid, including vital support forlife-saving HIV programmes, to South Africa. Additionally, there are worries that Trump may not attend the Group of 20 summit being held in South Africa in November and his government may not renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), key US trade legislation that assists economies in sub-Saharan Africa. It expires in September. Before Wednesday’s meetings, Ramaphosa said strengthening trade relations between the two countries was his primary motivation for travelling to Washington, DC. “We want to come out of the United States with a really good trade deal, investment promotion. We invest in the United States, and they invest in us. We want to strengthen those relations. We want to consolidate relations between the two countries,” he said. This week, South Africa’s ministers of trade and agriculture, Parks Tau and Steenhuisen, met with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to present the first draft of a trade deal. In 2024, total goods trade between the US and South Africa amounted to $20.5bn. This included $5.8bn in US exports to South Africa and $14.7bn in South African exports to the US. However, some observers said that at the heart of the potential trade deal is what South Africa could offer billionaire and close Trump ally, Elon Musk, given his ongoing claims about obstacles he allegedly faces in operating Starlink, his satellite internet company, in the country where he was born due to its transformation laws. These laws seek to redress past injustices that kept Black people destitute and require businesses over a certain size to have a 30 percent equity stake held by members of previously disadvantaged groups. Speaking at the Doha Economic Forum on Tuesday, Musk reiterated his assertions about laws he claimed were biased against white people despite experts explaining that most of those only seek to promote racial justice. “All races must be on equal footing in South Africa. That is the right thing to do. Do not replace one set of racist laws with another set of racist laws, which is utterly wrong and improper,” Musk said. “I am in an absurd situation where I was born in South Africa but cannot get a licence to operate Starlink because I am not Black,” he claimed. Before Wednesday’s meeting, a White House official told the Reuters news agency Trump is likely to tell Ramaphosa that all US companies in South Africa should be exempt from “racial requirements”. Opposition figure Malema’s party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), threatened legal action after news that the government was considering offering regulatory assurances to Musk’s Starlink. The EFF said the move would be unconstitutional and shows Ramaphosa is willing to compromise the country’s sovereignty to “massage the inflated ego of Musk and Trump”. Isike said that while trade concessions would be discussed, he doubted the South African government would give up its laws to appease Musk. “I will be surprised if Starlink gets its way by refusing to follow South African transformation laws, which require 30 percent Black ownership of a foreign company,” he said. Meanwhile, in private talks, Ramaphosa and Trump were also expected to discuss foreign policy issues, including peace prospects between Russia and Ukraine and South Africa’s support for Palestine and its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Some political observers said Pretoria is in the US crosshairs partly because of its actions against the key Washington ally. Patrick Bond, a sociology professor at the University of Johannesburg, predicted before the talks that the US might offer to retract claims of “white genocide” in exchange for South Africa dropping its case at the ICJ. South Africa is seeking to hold Israel accountable for its assault on Gaza, which has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians since October 2023. The US is Israel’s strongest ally and arms supplier. “We are very rational when it comes to discussing global and geopolitical matters. We will put South African positions first, and our foreign policy positions will be clarified,” Ramaphosa said before the meeting. As the Gaza genocide case against Israel continues in The Hague, US allegations of a widely discredited “white genocide” in South Africa continue to follow the country’s leadership. Before Trump and Ramaphosa retreated to private meetings on Wednesday, a reporter asked the US president if he had decided whether genocide was being committed in South Africa. “I haven’t made up my mind,” he replied. The unfounded claim of white genocide has “taken on a life of its own”, analyst Paolo von Schirach, president of the Global Policy Institute in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera. It will be difficult for Ramaphosa and Trump to rebound after the Oval Office “ambush”, he said. “We know that Elon Musk certainly fanned this story [about a white genocide], and he’s probably not the only one,” von Schirach said. “It’s going to be hard for Trump to say, ‘Oh, so sorry. I was misinformed.’”",

    "title": "Member of Irish rap band Kneecap charged with ‘terrorism’ offence",
    "article_text": "A member of the Irish rap band Kneecap has been charged with a “terrorism” offence in the United Kingdom for waving a flag of the armed Lebanese group Hezbollah at a concert in November 2024 in London. Liam O’Hanna, whose stage name is Mo Chara, is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London on June 18, charged under the Terrorism Act, British police said on Wednesday. Kneecap has been vocal in its support for the Palestinian cause since the October 7, 2023-led Hamas attacks and Israel’s devastating war on Gaza, equating the struggles of the Irish under British colonial rule to that of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation and siege. Pro-Palestinian chants are a regular fixture in their gigs. The band says they have been targets of a smear campaign for calling out Israel’s genocidal war. KNEECAP STATEMENT: Since our statements at Coachella — exposing the ongoing genocide against the Palestinian people — we have faced a coordinated smear campaign. For over a year, we have used our shows to call out the British and Irish governments' complicity in war crimes.…pic.twitter.com/mBojb5QBOP — KNEECAP (@KNEECAPCEOL)April 25, 2025 The Belfast trio is also well known for its political and satirical lyrics and use of symbolism associated with the Irish Republican movement, which seeks to unite Northern Ireland, currently part of the UK, with the Republic of Ireland. More than 3,600 people were killed during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland during “The Troubles” involving the Irish Republican Army (IRA), pro-British Loyalist militias and the UK security forces. Kneecap takes its name from a brutal punishment, which involved being shot in the kneecaps, that was meted out by paramilitary groups to informers and drug dealers. The band has been praised for invigorating the Irish-language cultural scene in Northern Ireland, where the status of the language remains a contested political issue in a society still split between Protestant British Unionists and Catholic Irish Nationalist communities. It has also been criticised for lyrics laden with expletives and drug references. Kneecap came under intense scrutiny and criticism last month during their performance at the music festival Coachella in California when they projected the words “F*** Israel. Free Palestine.” on stage. “The Irish not so long ago were persecuted by the Brits, but we were never bombed from the f****** skies with nowhere to go! The Palestinians have nowhere to go – it’s their f****** home and they’re bombing them from the sky. If you’re not calling it a genocide what the f*** are you calling it?” read the words projected by Mo Chara. Kneecap came under renewed scrutiny at the start of this month when UK intelligence said they would investigate comments made by the rap group about UK and Middle East politics. They were reported to police over footage from a 2024 concert in which a band member appeared to say: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” Footage from another concert, in 2023, appears to show a member of the trio shouting “Up Hamas, Up Hezbollah” – the UK considers both to be “terrorist” organisations. In response, Kneecap said it had “never supported Hamas or Hezbollah,” and accused “establishment figures” of taking comments out of context to “manufacture moral hysteria” because of the band’s criticism of Israel’s attacks on Palestinians in Gaza. Several Kneecap gigs have been cancelled as a result of the controversy, and some British lawmakers have called on organisers of June’s Glastonbury Festival to scrap a planned performance by the group.",

    "title": "US judge finds South Sudan-linked deportation flight violated court order",
    "article_text": "A federal judge in the United States has told the administration of President Donald Trump that an alleged effort to deport migrantsto South Sudanwas “unquestionably violative” of his court injunction. The announcement from US District Judge Brian Murphy on Wednesday tees up yet another judicial battle for the Trump administration, which has faced repeated criticism that it is ignoring court orders. Judge Murphy, who is based in Boston, Massachusetts, has yet to announce what he plans to do about the apparent violation. He left that question to another day. But he indicated that the people on board Tuesday’s flight had not been given enough time to challenge their deportations, in violation of their right to due process — and also in violation of Murphy’s April 18 injunction. Murphy had ruled that migrants facing removal to a third-party country besides their own had the right to a reasonable amount of time to challenge their deportations. But the Trump administration has repeatedly dismissed claims that it refuses to abide by decisions unfavourable to its policies, instead blasting judges like Murphy as “activist”. During Wednesday’s court hearing, a lawyer for Trump’s Justice Department, Elainis Perez, refused to confirm where the deportation flight had landed, saying that divulging the information raised “very serious operational and safety concerns”. Separately, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) held a news conference addressing the issue and defending the deportation flight. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said the people on board had been accused of murder, armed robbery, rape and sexual assault. In the case of one migrant, Lyons said, “his country would not take him back.” He called such countries “recalcitrant”. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), also framed the removals as a “diplomatic and military security operation”. Standing in front of photos representing eight migrants, she said they were deported alone for safety reasons and confirmed they remain in DHS custody, although they had indeed left the US. “We cannot tell you what the final destination for these individuals will be,” she added, again citing security issues. But she did address the possibility that they might currently be in South Sudan, as their lawyers indicated in court filings. “I would caution you to make the assumption that their final destination is South Sudan,” she said, later clarifying that the flight may make multiple stops: “We’re confirming the fact that that’s not their final destination.” In Tuesday’s court filings, lawyers for the migrants said their clients hail from Myanmar, Vietnam and other countries. They also explained that their clients speak little English but were provided no translator to understand their removal notices. They allegedly were deported with less than 24 hours’ notice. On Tuesday morning, as one lawyer tried to locate her client, she said she was informed he had been removed to South Sudan, a country with a turbulent history and a record of human rights abuses. Judge Murphy had previously ordered the migrants to be given at least 15 days to challenge their removals on the grounds that they could face dangers in the countries they were deported to. In the wake of Tuesday’s flight, he has also ruled that the US government must keep the migrants in its custody and ensure their safety while hearings proceed. McLaughlin, however, accused the “activist judge” of “trying to protect” the migrants, which she described as “some of the most barbaric, violent individuals”. “While we are fully compliant with the law and court orders, it is absolutely absurd for a district judge to try to dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States of America,” she said. McLaughlin and the other officials also argued that the Trump administration was exercising its right to find “safe third countries” to remove these individuals to. “No country on earth wanted to accept them because their crimes are so uniquely monstrous and barbaric,” she said. “Thanks to the courageous work of the State Department and ICE and the president’s national security team, we found a nation that was willing to accept custody of these vicious illegal aliens.” The Trump administration has been accused of amping up fears of criminality among immigration populations, as part of its justification for its “mass deportation” campaign. Police in South Sudan have told The Associated Press news agency that no migrants from the US have arrived in the country so far. The New York Times has reported that the plane is believed to have landed in the East African country of Djibouti.",

    "title": "Israeli top court rules Shin Bet chief Ban’s firing by Netanyahu ‘unlawful’",
    "article_text": "Israel’s Supreme Court has ruled that the government’s decision to fire domestic security chief Ronen Bar was “unlawful”, marking the latest twist in a bitter power struggle between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and the country’s justice system. The top court “ruled that the government’s decision to terminate the head of the Shin Bet’s tenure was made through an improper and unlawful process,” its ruling said on Wednesday. It also said that Netanyahu had a conflict of interest in moving to get Bar fired, as the Shin Bet was also conducting a probe into alleged ties between the prime minister’s close aides and Qatar. The two men have traded accusations and barbs over deep-seated security failures surrounding the Hamas-led October 7 attack. Netanyahu first said he would fire Bar due to a breakdown in “trust”, suggesting it was linked to October 7, which then led to the Gaza war. But Bar said Netanyahu’s decision was motivated by a series of events between November 2024 and February 2025. In the unclassified part of the court submission, BarsaidNetanyahu had told him “on more than one occasion” that he expected Shin Bet to take action against Israelis involved in anti-government demonstrations, “with a particular focus on monitoring the protests’ financial backers”. The Shin Bet head also said he had refused to sign off on a security request aimed at relieving Netanyahu from testifying at an ongoingcorruption trialin which he faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of public trust. The court said the decision to dismiss Bar was made without “a factual basis” and without giving him a formal hearing before firing him, according to a report by the Times of Israel. Wednesday’s ruling noted “irregularities” in the process that led to Bar’s sacking, as well as “a disregard for fundamental principles regarding internal security.” The Israeli cabinet voted to dismiss Bar in March, triggering mass protests and accusations of autocratic pursuits by the far-right government. The High Court of Justice haltedthe decision until a hearing could be held. Several groups, including opposition politicians, had filed petitions with the court against the government’s decision. In April, the government revoked the decision to fire Bar a day after he said he would step down. Following Bar’s decision to quit the job, Wednesday’s Supreme Court ruling said that “this announcement puts an end to the [legal] procedure.”",

    "title": "South Sudan on edge as Sudan’s war threatens vital oil industry",
    "article_text": "South Sudan relies on oil for more than 90 percent of its government revenues, and the country depends entirely on Sudan to export the precious resource. But this month, Sudan’s army-backed government said it was preparing to shut down the facilities that its southern neighbour uses to export its oil, according to an official government letter seen by Al Jazeera. That decision could collapse South Sudan’s economy and drag it directly into Sudan’s intractable civil war between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), experts warned. The announcement was made on May 9 after the RSF launchedsuicide dronesfor six consecutive days at Port Sudan,the army’s wartime capital on the strategic Red Sea coast. The strikes destroyed a fuel depot and damaged electricity grids, shattering the sense of security in the city, which lies far from the country’s front lines. Sudan’s army claims the damage now hampers it from exporting South Sudan’s oil. “The announcement read like a desperate plea [to South Sudan] for help to stop these [RSF] attacks,” said Alan Boswell, an expert on the Horn of Africa with the International Crisis Group. “But I think doing so overestimates the leverage that South Sudan has … over the RSF,” he added. Since South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011, the former has relied on the latter to export its oil via Port Sudan. In return, Sudan has collected fees from Juba as part of their 2005 peace agreement, which ended the 22-year north-south civil war and ultimately led to the secession of South Sudan from Sudan. When Sudan erupted into another civil war between the army and RSF in 2023, the former continued collecting the fees from Juba. “[Sudan and South Sudan] are tied at the hip financially due to the oil export infrastructure,” Boswell told Al Jazeera. Local media have recently reported that high-level officials from South Sudan and Sudan are engaged in talks to avert a shutdown of oil exports. Al Jazeera sent written questions to Port Sudan’s energy and petroleum minister, Mohieddein Naiem Mohamed, asking if the army is negotiating higher rent fees from South Sudan before resuming oil exports, which some experts suspected to be a likely scenario. Naiem Mohamed did not respond before publication. According to the International Crisis Group, Juba also pays off the RSF to not damage oil pipelines that run through territory under its control. In addition, South Sudan has allowed the RSF to operate in villages along the Sudan-South Sudan border. The RSF has increased its presence along the sprawling, porous border afterforming a strategic alliancewith the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement – North (SPLM-N) in February. The SPLM-N fought alongside secessionist forces against Sudan’s army. It controls swaths of territory in Sudan’s South Kordofan and Blue Nile regions and has historically close ties with Juba. South Sudan’s relationship with the SPLM-N and RSF has increasingly frustrated Sudan’s army, said Edmund Yakani, a South Sudanese civil society leader and commentator. “[Sudan’s army] is suspicious that Juba is helping RSF in its military capability and political space to manoeuvre its struggle against Sudan’s army,” Yakani told Al Jazeera. According to a report by the International Crisis Group from 2021, about 60 percent of South Sudan’s oil profits go to the multinational companies producing the oil. The report explained that most of the remaining 40 percent goes to paying off outstanding loans and to South Sudan’s ruling elites in the bloated security sector and bureaucracy. South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir, will likely not be able to keep his patronage network together without a quick resumption in oil revenue. His fragile government – a coalition of longtime loyalists and coopted opponents – could collapse like a house of cards, experts warned. Al Jazeera emailed written questions to South Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation to ask if the country has any contingency plan in case oil exports stop indefinitely. The ministry did not respond before publication. Experts warned that South Sudan has no alternative to oil. Security personnel and civil servants are already owed months of back pay, and they may turn against Kiir – and each other – if they have no incentive to uphold the fragile peace agreement that ended South Sudan’s own five-year civil war in 2018. “Kiir is on extremely fragile footing, and there is no backup plan for when the oil runs out,” said Matthew Benson, a scholar on Sudan and South Sudan at the London School of Economics. A halt in oil revenue would also drive up inflation, exacerbating the daily struggles of millions of civilians. The World Food Programme estimated that about 60 percent of the population is experiencing acute food shortages while the World Bank found that nearly 80 percent live below the poverty line. The hardship and pervasive corruption have given way to a predatory economy in which armed groups erect checkpoints to shake down civilians for bribes and taxes. Civilians will likely be unable to cough up any more money if the oil revenue dries up. “I’m not sure people can be squeezed more than they already are,” Benson said. Some commentators and activists also fear that Sudan’s army is deliberately turning off the oil to force South Sudan to cut off all contact with the RSF and SPLM-N. This speculation is fuelling some resentment among civilians in South Sudan, according to Yakani. Meanwhile, some supporters of Sudan’s army argued that South Sudan should not benefit from oil as long as it provides any degree of support to the RSF, which they view as a militia waging a rebellion against the state. Both the RSF and army have recruited South Sudanese mercenaries to fight on their behalf,Al Jazeera previously reported. “What Port Sudan [the army] wants is for Juba to absolutely distance itself from aiding the RSF in any way, and that is the complication that the government of [Kiir] is in now,” Yakani told Al Jazeera. “The majority of citizens of South Sudan – including myself – believe that South Sudan is becoming a land of proxy wars for Sudan’s warring parties and their [regional] allies,” he added. Sudan’s army also believes that South Sudan’s government is relying increasingly on the RSF’s regional backers to buttress its own security. Sudan’s army leaders were particularly spooked when Uganda, which it views as supporting the RSF, deployed troops to prop up Kiir in March, according to Boswell. In addition, Sudan’s army has repeatedly accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the RSF. TheUAE has repeatedly denied these allegations, which United Nations experts and Amnesty International have also made. “The UAE has already made absolutely clear that it is not providing any support or supplies to either of two belligerent warring parties in Sudan,” the UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously told Al Jazeera in an email. Despite tensions between Sudan’s army and the UAE, analysts said Juba may request a large loan from the UAE to keep its patronage intact if Sudan’s army does not promptly resume oil exports. “[Sudan’s army] has been worrying and watching closely over whether the UAE might loan South Sudan a significant amount of money,” Boswell said. “I think a massive UAE loan to South Sudan would be … a red line for Sudan’s army”, he added.",

    "title": "Oman confirms new round of US-Iran talks despite enrichment dispute",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –Officials from Iran and the United States will hold anotherround of talksin Rome on Friday, Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi has said, despite the growing gap between the two countries over uranium enrichment. Wednesday’s confirmation that the nuclear negotiations would continue comes after days of Washington and Tehran expressing irreconcilable positions on Iranian uranium enrichment. US officials have said they want Iran not just to scale back its nuclear programme, but also to stop enriching uranium altogether — a position that Tehran has said is a nonstarter. Enrichment is the process of altering the uranium atom to create nuclear fuel. Iran’s supreme leader, AyatollahAli Khamenei, also said on Tuesday that his country does not need US permission to enrich uranium. “Saying things like ‘We will not allow Iran to enrich uranium’ is nonsense,” he was quoted as saying by the Mehr News Agency. The 5th round of Iran US talks will take place in Rome this Friday 23rd May. — Badr Albusaidi – بدر البوسعيدي (@badralbusaidi)May 21, 2025 His statement was in response to the US’s lead negotiator, Steve Witkoff, dubbing uranium enrichment a “red line” and saying that Washington “cannot allow even 1 percent of an enrichment capability”. Several Iranian and US officials have reiterated their respective countries’ positions. Washington has said Iran can operate nuclear reactors for energy production by importing already enriched uranium, arguing that the domestic uranium production by Tehran risks potential weaponisation. Iran, which denies seeking a nuclear weapon, says uranium enrichment for civilian purposes is its right as a sovereign nation. Israel, the top US ally in the Middle East, is widely believed to have an undeclared nuclear arsenal. US PresidentDonald Trumphas repeatedly threatened Iran with military action if the two countries do not reach a deal, stressing that he will not allow Tehran to obtain a nuclear weapon. During his first term, in 2018, Trump nixed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which saw Iran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions against its economy. Since then, the US has been piling sanctions on the Iranian economy. After his return to the White House for a second term in January, Trump renewed his “maximum pressure” programmeagainst Iran, largely through economic penalties. He has, for example, pledged to choke off the country’s oil exports, particularly to China. Iran has been defiant in the face of Trump’s threats, promising to defend itself against any attack. Tensions began to ease in April as the US and Iran began to hold talks mediated by Oman, but it is not clear how the two sides will bridge the disagreement over Tehran’s enrichment programme. On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi suggested that the US positionhas been shifting, stressing that “there is no scenario” in which Iran will give up enrichment. “Iran can only control what we Iranians do, and that is to avoid negotiating in public — particularly given the current dissonance we are seeing between what our U.S. interlocutors say in public and in private, and from one week to the other,” Araghchi wrote in a social media post.",

    "title": "Classifying Taliban as ‘foreign terrorist organization’ under review: US",
    "article_text": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that the United States is reviewing whether to designate Afghanistan’s rulers, the Taliban, as a “foreign terrorist organization”. Rubio told the House Foreign Affairs Committee during a hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday, “I believe that classification is now, once again, under review.” The response came a day after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a “comprehensive review” of theUnited States’s chaotic military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, an evacuation operation in which 13 US service members and 150 Afghans were killed at Kabul’s airport in an ISIL (ISIS) bombing. Hegseth said in a memo on Tuesday that after three months of assessing the withdrawal, a comprehensive review was needed to ensure accountability for this event. “This remains an important step toward regaining faith and trust with the American people and all those who wear the uniform, and is prudent based on the number of casualties and equipment lost during the execution of this withdrawal operation,” Hegseth wrote. Former President Joe Biden’s administration, which oversaw the pull-out, mostly blamed the resulting chaos on a lack of planning and reductions in troops by the first Donald Trump administration, following its deal with the Taliban to accelerate the withdrawal of US forces. Trump had signed the deal with the Taliban in Doha in February 2020 aimed at ending its 18-year war in Afghanistan, beginning with the withdrawal of about 4,000 troops “within months”. The then-Trump administration had agreed it would withdraw from the country by May 2021 if the Taliban negotiated a peace agreement with the Afghan government and promised to prevent internationally designated terrorist groups, such as al-Qaeda and ISIL, from gaining a foothold in the country. After assuming office in January 2021, Biden said he had to respect the agreement or risk new conflicts with the Taliban, which could have required additional troops in Afghanistan. On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump frequently criticised Biden and his administration for the withdrawal, saying that the manner in which it was done “was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country’s life.” Trump said that the withdrawal should have been done with “dignity, with strength, with power.” Senior US military officials, including then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the then-top US general, Mark Milley, have already appeared before lawmakers to give their testimonies regarding the withdrawal. The war in Afghanistan from 2001-2021 was the US’s longest war, surpassing Vietnam. It remains unclear how Hegseth’s review would differ from the many previous reviews carried out by the US military, Department of State and Trump’sfellow Republicans in the House of Representatives. US Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East, has also carried out an investigation into the ISIL attack on Kabul during the last few days of the withdrawal.",

    "title": "UK retailer M&S puts cyberattack cost at $400m as disruptions continue",
    "article_text": "British retailer Marks & Spencer estimates that a cyberattack that stopped it from processing online orders and left store shelves empty will cost it about 300 million pounds ($403m). The company said in a business update (PDF) on Wednesday that disruption from the “highly sophisticated and targeted cyber attack,” which was first reported around the Easter weekend, is expected to continue until July. Online sales of food, home and beauty products have been “heavily impacted” because the company, popularly known as M&S, had to pause online shopping. The attack on one of the biggest names on the United Kingdom high street forced M&S to resort to pen and paper to move billions of pounds of fresh food, drinks and clothing after it switched off its automated stock systems. That led to bare food shelves and frustrated customers, denting profits. A month on, M&S’s large online clothing service remains offline, and the attack has wiped more than a billion pounds off its stock market value. Chairman Archie Norman said the timing of the attack was unfortunate as M&S, which has been implementing a comprehensive turnaround plan since 2022, had been starting to show its full potential. “But in business life, just as you think you’re onto a good streak, events have a way of putting you on your backside,” he said. M&S, which has 65,000 staff and 565 stores, said the hack would cost about 300 million pounds ($403m) in lost operating profit in its year to March 2026, although it hopes to halve that impact through insurance, cost control and other actions. Chief executive Stuart Machin said the company is focused on recovery and restoring its systems and operations. “This incident is a bump in the road, and we will come out of this in better shape,” Machin said. He did not provide any details on the attack or who might be behind it. Earlier this month, the company said customer personal data, which could have included names, emails, addresses and dates of birth, was taken by hackers in the attack. Two other British retailers, luxury London department store Harrods and supermarket chain Co-op, have also been targeted by cyberattacks at around the same time.",

    "title": "UnitedHealth paid nursing homes to reduce hospital transfers: Report",
    "article_text": "UnitedHealth has allegedly secretly paid nursing homes to reduce hospital transfers — the latest accusations in a series of woes facing the health insurance giant. The alleged action, first reported by The Guardian newspaper on Wednesday, was part of a series of cost-cutting tactics that have saved the company millions, but at times, risked residents’ health, the publication showed, citing an investigation. The story, which cites thousands of documents and firsthand accounts of more than 20 former employees of the healthcare company and nursing homes, says that the insurance giant sent its own medical teams to nursing homes to push the cost-cutting measures. As a result, patients who urgently needed medical care did not receive it, including one person who now lives with permanent brain damage after a delayed transfer. The allegations add to the litany of negatives that have hurt UnitedHealth in the last several months, following a massive cyberattack at its Change Healthcare unit, reports of criminal and civil investigations into the company’s practices, includingone for Medicare fraudand the abrupt departure of CEO Andrew Witty last week. UnitedHealth said in response to the story, “The US Department of Justice investigated these allegations, interviewed witnesses, and obtained thousands of documents that demonstrated the significant factual inaccuracies in the allegations.” The company also said that the DOJ “declined to pursue the matter”. Shares have stumbled all year, losing more than 39 percent compared with a 0.6 percent decrease for the Dow. As of noon ET (16:00 GMT), the stock is down more than 3.6 percent. “The news is only seemingly getting worse for UnitedHealth,” said Sahak Manuelian, managing director, global equity trading at Wedbush Securities. HSBC downgraded the stock to “reduce” from “hold,” and cut the price target to a street-low of $270. The brokerage said higher medical costs, pressure on drug pricing and its pharmacy benefit management unit, OptumRx, and a potential Medicaid funding cut can upset the company’s recovery journey.",

    "title": "Target cuts annual forecast as tariffs, boycotts weigh on sales",
    "article_text": "Target has slashed its annual forecasts amid a pullback in discretionary spending due to tariff-driven uncertainty and a backlash against shifts inits diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policy. The United States big box retailer, which reported its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, relies on China for 30 percent of its store label goods. While it is on track to reduce its dependency by another 5 percent by the end of the year, tariff-driven uncertainty has caused a slump. In its forecast, the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based retailer expects a low single-digit decline in annual sales. Wall Street analysts expected a marginal increase of 0.27 percent in annual sales, according to the LSEG. Target previously forecasted net sales growth of about 1 percent. This comes as Bank of America recently forecasted that consumers have eased up on spending as the most recent report from The Conference Board showed a slowdown inconsumer confidence, which hit a 13-year low in April.The US economy also showed the first contraction in three years in the first quarter. Target’s first-quarter comparable sales fell 3.8 percent compared with analysts’ estimates of a 1.08 percent decline. It expects annual adjusted earnings of $7 to $9 per share, compared with its prior forecast of $8.80 to $9.80. Analysts were expecting $8.40. “Expectations were very low for Target’s first quarter. Even against that, Target’s results came in light,” Michael Baker, a DA Davidson analyst, told the news agency Reuters. Target’s stock has performed poorly, down nearly 28 percent this year, in contrast to Walmart’s 9 percent gain and Home Depot’s 2.3 percent decline. Target’s stock is tumbling on the news of its disappointing earnings report. As of 11am in New York (15:00 GMT), it was down 2.91 percent from the market open although it is up more than 1 percent over the past five days. Target also said its first-quarter performance was impacted by changes made to its DEI policies in January. Target ended many of its DEI policies, drawing condemnation as some of its critics noted that its commitment to inclusiveness had helped attract younger, more diverse consumers. The decision generated more attention as it coincided with US President Donald Trump’s executive order to eliminate DEI policies in federal agencies and schools. The backlash led to economic boycotts, notably from Reverend Jamal-Harrison Bryant, a Georgia pastor who organised a 40-day “fast” of Target stores. He has since called for those efforts to continue in recognition of the fifth anniversary of George Floyd’s murder by police in Minneapolis, Target’s headquarters. CEO Brian Cornell said the reversal of some DEI policies played a role in first-quarter performance but he couldn’t quantify the impact. “Target’s [results] do nothing to restore confidence in the company. On the contrary, they are emblematic of a business that has made too many mistakes and has lost its way on several fronts,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders told Reuters, pointing to issues including poor inventory management and a lack of exciting merchandise. Target’s forecast contrasts with its bigger rival Walmart,which maintained its annual forecastslast week but said it would need to pass on higher prices due to tariffs. That has drawn the ire of Trump, who said Walmart should “eat the tariffs” on imported goods instead of passing on the costs. Unlike Walmart, which generates the bulk of its revenues by selling groceries like bananas, milk, toilet paper and shampoo, a majority of what Target sells falls in the nonessential category – largely apparel, home furnishings and beauty products, which it sources from China. TJX, the parent company of retailer TJ Maxx, also reported its earnings on Wednesday, and while tariffs loom, the company is set to maintain its forecasts. The Massachusetts-based big box retailer expects comparable sales to grow 2 percent to 3 percent during the current quarter. Unlike Target and Walmart, TJ Maxx, relies on expansive sourcing from middlemen in the US, which limits the impact of any new tariffs on China. On a media call, Target executives declined to provide details on potential price increases due to tariffs. Most tariff-related increases could be offset, they said, but acknowledged that raising prices could be a “last resort”. Cornell said pricing decisions will largely depend on ongoing efforts to source more products from the US and reduce reliance on China. “That is going to play a very important role,” he said. Rick Gomez, the company’s chief commercial officer, said Target is working on negotiating with suppliers, expanding sourcing to other Asian countries beyond China, re-evaluating its product assortment, and adjusting the timing and quantity of orders. “These efforts are expected to offset the vast majority of the incremental tariff exposure,” Gomez said.",

    "article_text": "Russia’s top diplomat has blamed the war in Ukraine for affecting the supply of arms to Armenia, and has expressed concern that Moscow’s longstanding ally would now look to the West for military support instead. Speaking in Yerevan on the second day of a two-day visit to Armenia, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that some of Russia’s weapons contracts with the former Soviet republic had been delayed or reassigned due to the pressures created by the war in Ukraine. Armenia has long relied on Russian weapons in its bitter dispute with neighbouring Azerbaijan, against whom it has fought a series of conflicts since the late 1980s. “We are currently in a situation where, as has happened throughout history, we are forced to fight all of Europe,” Lavrov said, in a barbed reference to European support for Ukraine in response to the Russian invasion. “Our Armenian friends understand that in such conditions, we cannot fulfil all our obligations on time.” As Russia has failed to deliver on weapons contracts paid for by Armenia, Yerevan has increasingly turned to countries like France and India for military supplies. Lavrov said that Russia would not oppose these growing ties, but said that they raised concerns about its traditional ally’s strategic intentions. “When an ally turns to a country like France, which leads the hostile camp and whose president and ministers speak openly with hatred toward Russia, it does raise questions,” he said. Armenia has strengthened its ties with the West amid recent ongoing tensions with Azerbaijan, fallout from the last major eruption of conflict and Russia’s role in that. In September 2023, Azerbaijan launched amilitary operationto retake Nagorno-Karabakh, a separatist enclave in Azerbaijan with a mostly ethnic Armenian population that had broken away from Baku with Armenian support amid the collapse of the Soviet Union. Armenia accused Russian peacekeepers of failing to protect the more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians who fled the region, fuelled by decades of distrust, wars, mutual hatred and violence, after Azerbaijan’s lightning takeover. Yerevan also suspended its involvement in the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, a Russian-led security umbrella of ex-Soviet countries, last year, saying it would not participate or fund the alliance.",

    "title": "EU, Arab diplomats come under Israeli fire in occupied West Bank’s Jenin",
    "article_text": "A diplomatic delegation from the European Union, Arab and Asian nations has come under Israeli fire while visiting the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Authority and numerous countries confirm. The diplomats were undertaking an official mission on Wednesday to assess the humanitarian situation in Jenin as a wide-scale Israeli military assault there, which has caused deaths and displacement, enters its fourth month. The Israeli army said its soldiers fired warning shots to move the delegation away because it had deviated from a previously agreed route and entered an area it was not authorised to be in. There were no injuries. The commander of the Israeli Civil Administration in the West Bank ordered Israeli officers to speak with representatives of the delegation’s countries who “will soon hold personal conversations with the diplomats and update them on the findings of the initial investigation conducted on the matter”, the military said in a statement. Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, because Al Jazeera has been banned from the West Bank and Israel, said the incident shows the reality on the ground and anyone in the occupied West Bank can come under Israeli fire. “These places in the Palestinian territory have come under complete siege – tens of thousands of Palestinians who have been forcibly uprooted from their homes as part of the ongoing military raids in Jenin, Tulkarem and in surrounding areas in the north of the occupied West Bank,” she added. Videos on social media show delegation members giving media interviews when shots are heard ringing out close to the group and forcing it to run for cover. Footage verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad fact-checking agency also showed two Israeli soldiers standing nearby with their rifles pointing towards the diplomats. The occupation forces opened heavy fire from inside the Jenin refugee camp to intimidate the diplomatic delegation that is conducting a field tour around the camp to witness the extent of the suffering endured by the residents of the area. قوات الاحتلال تطلق النار بشكل كثيف من…pic.twitter.com/qafjqQP0Sg — State of Palestine – MFA 🇵🇸🇵🇸 (@pmofa)May 21, 2025 About 20 diplomats were being briefed at the time about the situation in Jenin, an aid worker speaking on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press news agency. Witnesses said it was unclear where the shots came from and no one was injured. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates condemned in “the strongest possible terms the heinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces, which deliberately targeted by live fire an accredited diplomatic delegation”. Other European and Arab governments added their own condemnations with calls for answers. Turkiye’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the gunfire “in the strongest terms” and said Ankara was calling for an immediate investigation and for accountability. “This attack, which endangered the lives of diplomats, is yet another demonstration of Israel’s systematic disregard for international law and human rights,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that a diplomat from its own consulate in Jerusalem was in the delegation. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said he would summon the Israeli ambassador in Paris. Barrot, writing on X, called the incident “unacceptable” and said the ambassador would be required to explain. Simon Harris, Ireland’s minister for foreign affairs, said: “I am shocked and appalled,” noting that two Irish diplomats based in Ramallah in the West Bank were in the group. This is completely unacceptable and I condemn it in the strongest terms.” Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said his country has also summoned the Israeli ambassador in Madrid.  “We demand clarity and accountability,” he added. Ireland and Spain have been two of the strongest pro-Palestine voices in the EU and have called for an end to the Israeli war in Gaza and the suffering of the population in the enclave and in the West Bank. The government of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni demanded an explanation, saying its vice consul was among those who came under fire. Israel’s ambassador to Italy will be summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation to explain. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said firing even warning shots was unacceptable. She had said a day earlier that the 27-nation bloc was reviewing its trade agreement with Israel due to the “catastrophic” situation in Gaza. Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates also condemned “in the strongest terms … We call on the international community to assume its legal and moral responsibilities and compel Israel to stop its aggression on Gaza and its escalation in the West Bank,” its statement posted on X said. The Saudi Foreign Ministry called “on the international community and the Security Council for an immediate halt to Israeli violations against civilians and diplomatic missions”. Jenin – along with Tulkarem and Nur Shams – has been the main focus of a large-scale Israeli military operation in the northern West Banksince January. Since then, Israeli forces have accelerated an already ongoing process of enforced mass displacement, home demolitions and mass arrests of Palestinians. About 40,000 Palestinians remain displaced in the northern West Bank,accordingto the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.",

    "article_text": "We found the best cameras for your budget and needs. We found the best cameras for your budget and needs. bySheena Vasani If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure. Yet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, and Kodak. All of the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a different set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we pickedFujifilm’s Instax Mini 12as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully. Typically, I try to spend at least a couple of weeks — if not months — testing each camera to get an idea of what it would be like to actually own one. I’ll use them to capture photos of loved ones while hanging out, or subjects and scenes I stumble across as I’m exploring Los Angeles and its many beaches. I shoot indoors and outside, with and without the flash, allowing me to compare how each camera performs in both bright and low-light environments.I also ask friends and family — both young and old — for their input on image quality, and I have them take photos with the instant camera to get their thoughts on usability. If the camera comes with extra features, such as filters or support for a companion app, I’ll make sure to put them to the test in real-life situations. I note how easy it is to pull up and navigate the app, apply the effects, and, of course, how the results look. Instant cameras aren’t known for producing high-quality, sharp photos, and most of them struggle with low-light conditions. However, the photos should at least be clear and bright enough that the subject is discernible and the picture looks relatively true to life. How easy is it to set the instant camera up and take photos with it? Ease of use is a big part of what makes instant cameras fun and accessible to people of all ages. You shouldn’t need a professional photography background just to enjoy an instant camera. Instant cameras aren’t known for producing high-quality, sharp photos, and most of them struggle with low-light conditions. However, the photos should at least be clear and bright enough that the subject is discernible and the picture looks relatively true to life. Instant cameras come with different features at various price points. Generally, the more feature-rich cameras tend to be pricier, but do the extra capabilities justify the added cost? Some cameras, for example, pair with a companion app or feature a built-in selfie mirror, while others include the ability to print images from your phone. None of these are essential, though the added niceties may be worth it for some people. Some instant cameras aren’t as well suited for some situations and / or people as others. For example, there are instant cameras that print old-fashioned Polaroid photos that aren’t very clear. They frustrate me, but retro lovers might find them charming. Other cameras come with advanced creative modes that let you edit photos and even print smartphone pictures, but a young child might find them hard to use. Each instant camera requires a different kind of film, which means that the sticker price of the camera isn’t the true price. This is something you should take into account before making a purchase, as the cost of film can quickly add up. Depending on the brand, you may have to pay anywhere between 50 cents and $2 a shot.It’s also important to take into account that some film is easier to find. The Instax Mini 12, for example, uses credit card-size Instax Mini film that’s sold at most major retailers. Other types of film, including the film needed for Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, are available on Amazon but aren’t sold by as many retailers.Finally, most instant camera brands sell films of varying quality in a range of styles. Some are decorated with colorful frames and patterns, while others are black and white. They also vary in shape and size, from small rectangular prints you can stick in your wallet to square-shaped ones. You can also buy wider prints, and some brands even sell film with an adhesive backing that allows you to use the resulting images as stickers. If you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, theInstax Mini Evois our choice, one that boasts great image quality and allows you to choose which photos you’d like to print. Other instant cameras, like the second-genPolaroid Now PlusandKodak’s Mini Retro 3, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more. Take a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you. Produces relatively true-to-life photosTerrific ease of useVery affordable Instax film can get priceyMinimal creative controlFlash can be overpowering Film type:Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately)/Film size:2 x 3-inches /Weight:306 grams /Charging method:AA batteries /Companion app:None /Other features:Built-in selfie mirror, film counter If all you’re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well suited for those new to photography and kids. For an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most of the cameras I tested struggled to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash does help. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both dark and bright environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. If anything, the photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before. However, at least the Instax Mini 12 captured my features and skin color more accurately when I used the included selfie feature — which is really just a small mirror mounted on the front of the camera. You can also now zoom in a little easier thanks to a new lens structure, which you can twist to enter the Close-Up Mode in lieu of pressing a button. When in this mode, you can take advantage of the camera’s new “Parallax Correction” feature, which is supposed to result in a more aligned photo. The lens was fun to play with and reminded me of a traditional point-and-shoot, but actually using it to take quality photos takes some time to figure out. As with the Mini 11, it’s still somewhat tricky to center your subject in the frame using this mode, even with the updated lens. Thankfully, it became easier to properly align photos after a couple of attempts (as well as some composition guidance from the manual). The Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the fact that the camera comes with a small counter that displays the remaining number of shots, which is a feature many of the other instant cameras I tested lacked. It’s easy to lose track of how many photos you’ve taken, especially when out for drinks or while sightseeing on vacation. Yet given each print costs about $1, it’s important to be mindful of how many shots you’ve got left. All in all, the Instax Mini 12 is a basic camera that caters to all ages and experience levels and gets the job done — and done relatively well. It doesn’t feature Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it also doesn’t offer advanced features like filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for an instant camera that offers a great traditional analog experience, this is it. 8 Verge Score Great use of dials and buttonsLots of printing flexibilityGood battery life Internal storage is limitedMicro USB port is annoyingNo viewfinder Film type:Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately)/Film size:2 x 3-inches /Weight:285 grams /Charging method:USB-C (on newer models) /Companion app:Yes /Other features:LCD screen, smartphone printing One of Fujifilm’s newest instant cameras, the Instax Mini Evo, was a favorite ofmy former colleague Becca Farcase— and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a brown version andlimited edition models in silver and gold. It’s easy to balk at its $199 price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries. Unlike Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12, the Mini Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can actually turn off the flash on the Mini Evo and use the three-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder. You can also use the menu to adjust how bright you want the film to look when it’s printed out, which was helpful given neither the Evo nor the Mini 12 are particularly great at capturing dark environments. Additionally, there are dials you can use to apply various lens options and filters, ranging from retro to monochrome shades, as well as a mirror lens, vignette, soft focus, and more. You can take app-based remote shots, too, which adds an extra element of photographic control that can help you take better selfie shots than the selfie mirror in the front. Of course, it’s not a perfect device, and there are some downsides to consider outside the price. For instance, although you can add some filters and make a few edits using Fujifilm’s companion app, it just isn’t as feature-rich as some of the apps available for the other digital and hybrid instant cameras I tested. The Evo’s extensive menu system isn’t particularly easy to navigate, either, and it took me some time to figure out how to turn the flash on and off. Plus, if you rely on internal storage solely, you can only take 45 images before the device is full. Still, all of these are minor issues, and I was very happy overall with how portable the stylish camera is, as well as how easy it is to take good photos quickly. Lets you print photos from your phoneEntertaining companion appComes with film So-so image qualityUnable to store imagesNot as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo Film type:Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) /Film size:3 x 3-inch square prints /Weight:467 grams /Charging method:Micro USB /Companion app:Yes /Other features:LCD screen, smartphone printing Whereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app allows you to apply frames, stickers, filters, and a plethora of customization options to photos, making the camera great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature within the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making this a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties. Like the Instax Mini Evo, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro comes with an LCD screen (albeit a much smaller one) you can use to decide whether or not you want to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp photos from your smartphone. Unlike the Mini Evo, however, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of a film (it’s also often on sale for a lot less). It also uses cheaper film;you can currently pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for about $17.99, which equates to roughly $0.33 a shot. The fact that the film is cheaper arguably encourages play and creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than both Fujifilm’s and Polaroid’s. However, there are notable drawbacks to the Kodak Mini Shot 3. My biggest issue is that the resulting prints of photos taken with the camera aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone. Photo quality wasn’t consistently as good as the Mini Evo’s or Mini 12’s nor, for the most part, as clear and sharp. The photos also sometimes had an excessive pink tint that can interfere with quality. It doesn’t store images the way the Mini Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Mini Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish. Nonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro is a good choice. Handsome, retro designPrints dreamy, vintage-style photosSeveral creative modesUSB-C Struggles in low lightFilm takes up to 15 minutes to develop Film type:Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) /Film size:4.2 x 3.5-inch prints /Weight:451.5 grams /Charging method:USB-C /Companion app:Yes /Other features:Lens filter kit, film counter If you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus is the camera for you. Compared to the other instant cameras on this list, it most closely resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 with its classic, retro-inspired design. Meanwhile, its square I-Type film prints and iconic Polaroid-style frame give photos a more authentically vintage look. At the same time, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus comes with a suite of modern features, including support for USB-C charging. It also offers Bluetooth and a companion app that boasts several creative modes, allowing greater photographic control. These include a remote shutter, a self-timer, and the “Polaroid Lab,” which lets you adjust the exposure and various color settings. The app also features a handful of shooting modes — including a manual option — and the camera comes with a set of five colored lenses you can snap onto the front. These were enjoyable to play with and allowed for more artistic expression. If there’s one thing the Polaroid Now Plus isn’t known for, it’s portability. Given how heavy, large, and awkwardly sized it is, it’s not the kind of instant camera you can easily slip into your purse or carry around. Plus, it takes up to 15 minutes for prints to develop, and you have to ensure it’s not exposed to light while developing. That’s quite an inconvenience if you’re out with friends, say, at the beach on a sunny day. If you’re looking for an instant camera that can easily print a good, clear photo without much effort on your part, this is not the camera for you. Of all the cameras on this list, the latest Polaroid Now Plus struggles with low-light environments the most. I could barely see images I took indoors, and I could only get the clearest shots when the light was directly behind me during the day — specifically, in the morning. Even these images weren’t as clear in comparison to Instax film, and both contrast and color saturation levels tend to be quite low. Admittedly, this gave my pictures more of a dreamy vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust saturation and exposure settings. However, doing so is time-consuming. Given all these issues, I found it was easy to waste film, which proved expensive. After all, you only get eight I-Type sheetsfor $16.99, and that’s in addition to forking out $149.99 for the camera. Truth be told, however, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, and you don’t mind the price, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus is the perfect camera for you. All that being said, it’s worth pointing out that Polaroid recently launched the$139.99 Now Plus Generation 3. The instant camera costs $10 less than its predecessor’s MSRP, though, at the moment,the second-gen model is on sale starting at $119.26.The new camera seems like it’s largely an iterative update, with a built-in tripod and four new colors to choose from instead of just three. It should also offer brighter, more accurate lighting in high-contrast scenes and improved depth perception, courtesy of upgrades to the ranging sensor, light meter position, and autofocus. Tiny and lightweightPrints vintage-like photos just like the Polaroid Now PlusUSB-C Struggles in low lightFilm takes up to 15 minutes to developNo Bluetooth support or companion app Film type:Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) /Film size:2.6 x 2.1-inch prints /Weight:239 grams /Charging method:USB-C /Companion app:No /Other features:Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter Whereas the Polaroid Now Plus is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It easily fits into the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it easily the most portable instant camera on our list. It also produces the smallest prints of all the instant cameras I tested, which could be nice if you’re trying to save some space and want something more compact than Instax Mini prints. Weighing just over a pound, the latest Polaroid Go is also the lightest instant camera I’ve ever held, and you can easily use it with one hand. That’s actually pretty convenient, given I sometimes struggled to take pictures with the heavier Polaroid Now Plus and, to a lesser extent, some of the other instant cameras I tested. In fact, if the images produced looked more true-to-life and didn’t require you to hide them from light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d be tempted to call this the best instant camera for travel or small children. At $79.99, the latest Polaroid Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera on the market, with film that costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (or about$19.99 for a 16-sheet pack). It also sports a small number of upgrades over the last-gen model despite retailing for $20 less. The most significant is USB-C support, which allows for faster charging and prevents you from having to spend money on AA batteries. Polaroid also claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor, but truthfully, I didn’t see a significant difference from one generation to the next. The photos are a little brighter, but if anything, the original Polaroid Go — like the Now Plus — produced warmer pictures that I thought were truer to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Now Plus. Unlike the Now Plus, however, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features, although it does offer a helpful self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. There’s also no Bluetooth support and, thus, no fancy app that will allow you to add extra effects. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Instax Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. In addition, as mentioned, the prints are smaller than those of the Instax Mini, which could be a drawback for those who prefer larger, more traditional Polaroid photos. While it produces similar vintage-style shots, design-wise, it doesn’t look anything like old-school Polaroid cameras, which could also take away from the retro experience some desire. That said, none of the older Polaroid cameras came with an app, either. All in all, the Go’s simplicity makes it a suitable candidate for those seeking an easy-to-use camera that provides a more traditional instant film experience — one they can take advantage of just about anywhere for half the price of the Polaroid Now Plus. TheKodak Smile Plusis another hybrid instant camera you can use to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $99.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers. However, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark. That being said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app that’s similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software is not as snappy or feature-rich, it still allows you to add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it can often be found for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative. From photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos,Leica’s Sofort 2is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo. The drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s hard to recommend at $389 since most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The user interface is easier to navigate on the Leica, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also like that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more. If you’re looking for an analog instant camera that’s more advanced,Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99is one to consider. At around $200, Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click camera given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket and an aluminum extension column, as well as a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur while capturing fast-moving subjects. Thanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12 and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera and not a hybrid like the $199.99 Mini Evo, meaning you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The new model also isn’t as simple to use as the Mini 12, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters. While it didn’t make the cut, theInstax Square SQ1is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Instax Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and comes with a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $119.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100. That said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Now Plus and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots. Fujifilm also sells the newerInstax Square SQ40. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at$149. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos and rarely goes on sale, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more. Fujifilm’s forthcomingInstax Wide Evo Hybridis nearly identical to theInstax Mini EvoYou can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $349 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures. While it’s currently available in Japan and Australia, Fujifilm hasn’t specified a US launch date, other than “soon.” Ultimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Instax Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lens and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image. Plus, unlike the Wide 400 (which I’m still testing), it’s a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful perk that can cut down on wasted shots. However, at $349, it’s a whopping $150 more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken — something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects like a dog or a hyper toddler. ThePolaroid Flipis a new, $199.99 instant camera that introduces scene analysis, which helps prevent exposure and focus issues by flashing a red LED warning light through the viewfinder. That’s a handy addition, as Polaroid says the Flip has the most powerful flash of any of its instant cameras (though its intensity can be adjusted to prevent overexposing close-ups). In addition, the Flip features new autofocus capabilities powered by a sonar sensor that automatically selects from one of four lenses. Fujifilm recently announced the $129.95Instax Mini 41, which is the follow-up to the $99Instax Mini 40. The updated model retains its retro design but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups. Polaroid recently launched theNow Plus Generation 3, a sequel to our current pick for the best retro-inspired camera. The new model is nearly identical to the second-gen Now Plus, only it’s available in six colors and features a built-in tripod. It also benefits from autofocus improvements and a better light meter position, which, according to Polaroid, should result in better photos. We’ll be testing it soon, so stay tuned. Fujifilm’s $149.95Instax Wide 400is an upgraded version of its Wide 300. It’s the company’s first wide-format instant camera in nearly a decade, and like its predecessor, it prints photos that are twice as wide as the Instax Mini 12’s. It features a new self-timer and a rounded body for better grip, though it’s currently only available in a sage green hue. So far, I’ve been impressed with the photo quality, which, like the photos from the Instax Mini 12, look relatively true-to-life. I’m still testing it to see how it stacks up to other wide-format instant cameras, though, so I have yet to form a conclusion.

    "title": "Are Character AI&#8217;s chatbots protected speech? One court isn&#8217;t sure",
    "article_text": "A judge is “not prepared” to say companion chatbots should receive First Amendment protection. A judge is “not prepared” to say companion chatbots should receive First Amendment protection. byAdi Robertson A lawsuit against Google and companion chatbot service Character AI — which is accused ofcontributing to the death of a teenager— can move forward,ruled a Florida judge. In a decision filed today, Judge Anne Conway said that an attempted First Amendment defense wasn’t enough to get the lawsuit thrown out. Conway determined that, despite some similarities to videogames and other expressive mediums, she is “not prepared to hold that Character AI’s output is speech.” The ruling is a relatively early indicator of the kinds of treatment that AI language models could receive in court. It stems from a suit filed by the family of Sewell Setzer III, a 14-year-old who died by suicide after allegedly becoming obsessed with a chatbot that encouraged his suicidal ideation. Character AI and Google (which is closely tied to the chatbot company) argued that the service is akin to talking with a video game non-player character or joining a social network, something that would grant it the expansive legal protections that the First Amendment offers and likely dramatically lower a liability lawsuit’s chances of success. Conway, however, was skeptical. While the companies “rest their conclusion primarily on analogy” with those examples, they “do not meaningfully advance their analogies,” the judge said. The court’s decision “does not turn onwhetherCharacter AI is similar to other mediums that have received First Amendment protections; rather, the decision turns onhowCharacter AI is similar to the other mediums” — in other words whether Character AI is similar to things like video games because it, too, communicates ideas that would count as speech. Those similarities will be debated as the case proceeds. While Google doesn’t own Character AI, it will remain a defendant in the suit thanks to its links with the company and product; the company’s founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, who are separately included in the suit, worked on the platform as Google employees before leaving to launch it and were later rehired there. Character AI is also facinga separate lawsuitalleging it harmed another young user’s mental health, and a handful of state lawmakers have pushed regulation for “companion chatbots” that simulate relationships with users — including one bill,the LEAD Act, that would prohibit them for children’s use in California. If passed, the rules are likely to be fought in court at least partially based on companion chatbots’ First Amendment status. This case’s outcome will depend largely on whether Character AI is legally a “product” that is harmfully defective. The ruling notes that “courts generally do not categorize ideas, images, information, words, expressions, or concepts as products,” including many conventional video games — it cites, for instance, a ruling that foundMortal Kombat’sproducerscouldn’t be held liablefor “addicting” players and inspiring them to kill. (The Character AI suit also accuses the platform of addictive design.) Systems like Character AI, however, aren’t authored as directly as most videogame character dialogue; instead, they produce automated text that’s determined heavily by reacting to and mirroring user inputs. “These are genuinely tough issues and new ones that courts are going to have to deal with.” Conway also noted that the plaintiffs took Character AI to task for failing to confirm users’ ages and not letting users meaningfully “exclude indecent content,” among other allegedly defective features that go beyond direct interactions with the chatbots themselves. Beyond discussing the platform’s First Amendment protections, the judge allowed Setzer’s family to proceed with claims of deceptive trade practices, including that the company “misled users to believe Character AI Characters were real persons, some of which were licensed mental health professionals” and that Setzer was “aggrieved by [Character AI’s] anthropomorphic design decisions.” (Character AI bots will often describe themselves as real people in text, despite a warning to the contrary in its interface, and therapy bots are common on the platform.) She also allowed a claim that Character AI negligently violated a rule meant to prevent adults from communicating sexually with minors online, saying the complaint “highlights several interactions of a sexual nature between Sewell and Character AI Characters.” Character AI has said it’s implemented additional safeguards since Setzer’s death, including amore heavily guardrailed modelfor teens. Becca Branum, deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology’s Free Expression Project, called the judge’s First Amendment analysis “pretty thin” — though, since it’s a very preliminary decision, there’s lots of room for future debate. “If we’re thinking about the whole realm of things that could be output by AI, those types of chatbot outputs are themselves quite expressive, [and] also reflect the editorial discretion and protected expression of the model designer,” Branum toldThe Verge. But “in everyone’s defense, this stuff is really novel,” she added. “These are genuinely tough issues and new ones that courts are going to have to deal with.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

This is the same DRM that blocks users from easily screenshotting a Netflix show on their computer or phone, and using it here could cause problems for people who use accessibility features like screen readers. While Signal says it’s made the feature easy to disable, under Signal Settings > Privacy > Screen Security, it never should’ve come to this. Developer Joshua Lund writes that operating system vendors like Microsoft “need to ensure that the developers of apps like Signal always have the necessary tools and options at their disposal to reject granting OS-level AI systems access to any sensitive information within their apps.” Despite delaying Recalltwice beforefinally launchingit last month, the “photographic memory” feature doesn’t yet have an API for app developers to opt their users’ sensitive content out of its AI-powered archives. Itcould be usefulfor finding emails or chats (including ones in Signal) using whatever you can remember, like a description of a picture you’ve received or a broad conversation topic, but it could also be a massive security and privacy problem. Lund notes that Microsoft already filters out private or incognito browser window activity by default, and users who have a Copilot Plus PC with Recallcan filter out certain apps under the settings, but only if they know how to do that. For now, Lund says that “Signal is using the tools that are available to us even though we recognize that there are many legitimate use cases where someone might need to take a screenshot.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

The News/Media Alliance says Google ‘just takes content by force and uses it with no return’ to publishers like Condé Nast and Vox Media. byEmma Roth The trade association backing some of the biggest news publishers in the US slammed Google’s newly expanded AI Mode, which trades traditional search results for an AI chatbot-like interface. Ina statement on Wednesday, the News/Media Alliance said the new feature is “depriving” publishers of both traffic and revenue. During Google I/O on Tuesday, the company announcedthat it’s expanding AI Mode to all usersin the US, which appears in a new tab directly within Search. When users enter a query, AI Mode serves up an AI-generated response alongside a list of relevant links. “Links were the last redeeming quality of search that gave publishers traffic and revenue,” Danielle Coffey, the CEO and president of News/Media Alliance, said in the statement. “Now Google just takes content by force and uses it with no return, the definition of theft. The DOJ remedies must address this to prevent continued domination of the internet by one company.” This week, an internal document disclosed as part of Google’s antitrust trial over its search dominance showed that the companydecided againstasking publishers for permission to have their work included in its AI search features,as reported byBloomberg. Instead, publishers must opt out of search results completely if they don’t want their work included in AI features. Google Search head Liz Reid said during her testimony that allowing publishers to opt out of individual features would add “enormous complexity,” according toBloomberg. “By saying a publisher could be like, ‘I want to be in this feature but not that feature,’ it doesn’t work,” Reid said. “Because then we would essentially have to say, every single feature on the page needs a different model.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

Grand Prix,Commando, andPitfallare among the dozens of 1980s and ’90s classics added to Game Pass. byWes Davis If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Microsoft hasannouncedthat a new “Retro Classics” collection isnow availableto Game Pass subscribers. Reminiscent of the Nintendo Switch Online classic games library, the collection includesPitfall,Grand Prix, and more than 50 other Activision titles from the 1980s and 1990s. It’s not as many titles as the 1,300 retro games that Antstream, Microsoft’s partner in the offering, has available on its streaming service, but it won’t cost Game Pass subscribers any extra. Retro Classics, which Microsoft writes is part of its “commitment to game preservation and backwards compatibility,” is available on Xbox consoles, PC, or via Xbox cloud gaming on compatible devices like some LG and Samsung smart TVs and the Meta Quest headset. Other games included in the collection includeCosmic Ark,MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat, andAtlantis. Based on screenshots, it looks like the collection will include titles from the original PlayStation, the SNES, MS-DOS, and more. Players will be able to collect achievements and participate in events like tournaments and community challenges as well. Microsoft says this is only the start; the collection will expand to include more than 100 games from Activision and Blizzard eventually. Like Nintendo’s retro collection, you’re out of luck if you don’t have Microsoft’s gaming subscription, as the titles in the collection aren’t available for sale separately. Antstream Arcadeseparately announceda temporary deal for Game Pass subscribers. Until June 4th, members can sign up for a year of access to Antstream’s library, which includes more than 1,300 games, for $9.99 via the Microsoft Store.

    "article_text": "The influential musician pledged to donate his earnings from the Windows 95 chime to people in Gaza. The influential musician pledged to donate his earnings from the Windows 95 chime to people in Gaza. byMia Sato Artist and musician Brian Eno — who also composed the iconic Windows 95 operating system startup chime — called on Microsoft today to “suspend all services that support any operations that contribute to violations of international law,” saying the company plays a role in “surveillance, violence, and destruction in Palestine.” It’s the latest high-profile instance of the tech giant being pressed on its contracts with the Israeli government. “I gladly took on the [Windows 95] project as a creative challenge and enjoyed the interaction with my contacts at the company,” Eno wrote on Instagram. “I never would have believed that the same company could one day be implicated in the machinery of oppression and war.” The musician — who was a member of the influential rock band Roxy Music and has also had a long, storied solo career — specifically called out Microsoft’scontracts with Israel’s Ministry of Defense. Microsoftacknowledgedlast week that it has contracts with the Israeli government for cloud and AI services, but claimed that an internal review conducted found “no evidence” that its tools were used to “target or harm people” in Gaza. Microsoft has been taken to task in recent weeks over its business dealings with the Israeli government specifically. The outcry over Microsoft’s contracts relates to Israel’s ongoing bombardment of Gaza following the October 7th, 2023, Hamas attack. Human rights groups, including commissions at the United Nations, haveaccused Israel of war crimesandgenocidal actsin its military operation that has killed thousands; as of this month, the Gaza Health Ministry reported more than 52,000 deaths, thoughsome researchers saythat number could be as high as 109,000 people. Some of Microsoft’s fiercest critics are its own employees opposed to the company’s ties to Israel. Earlier this week during Microsoft’s developer conference, multiple onstage events were disrupted, including CEO Satya Nadella’s keynote speech on Monday. During the event,Microsoft employee Joe Lopez interrupted Nadella, yelling, “How about you show Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?” The following day, a protester described only as a “Palestinian tech worker”disrupted another executive’s presentation. On Wednesday, protesters disrupted a third session — and in the commotion,Microsoft inadvertently revealedinternal messages regarding Walmart’s use of AI. In April,Microsoft employee Ibtihal Aboussad disrupted a 50th-anniversary event, calling Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman “a war profiteer.” Another employeedisrupted a second Microsoft eventthe same day. The acts of protest were organized by theNo Azure for Apartheidgroup, which calls for Microsoft to terminate contracts with the Israeli government and endorse a permanent ceasefire, among other demands. Aboussad wasfiredfrom the company; the second protester, Vaniya Agrawal, was dismissed early after putting in her resignation. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Eno, a longtime critic of the Israeli governmentwho’s backed pro-Palestine efforts, said on Instagram he would use his original earnings from the Windows 95 startup chime to help “the victims of the attacks on Gaza.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "article_text": "The new trim offers a staggering 478 miles of range when paired with the max range battery. The new trim offers a staggering 478 miles of range when paired with the max range battery. byAndrew J. Hawkins The 2026 Chevy Silverado EV is going off road — way off road — withthe addition of the Trail Boss trimto the electric pickup’s lineup. The electric version of the automaker’s popular off-road trim, Trail Boss offers more capability and — insanely — even more range for the already class-leading Silverado EV. The upgraded electric truck has 2-inches of extra lift for more clearance while grinding gravel and climbing boulders, including 35-inch all-terrain tires and 18-inch wheels. Despite the added height, the Trail Boss will get a staggering GM-estimated range of 478 miles if you opt for the max range battery. And in terms of maneuverability, Sidewinder mode enables all four tires to turn in the same direction for diagonal driving. It sounds similar to the Silverado’s sister truck,GMC’s Hummer EVwith its Crab Walk andKing Crab diagonal driving features. But Sidewinder is also available to the RST trim, so what else is cool about Trail Boss? How about a trim-exclusive Terrain mode, which offers additional control while traversing uneven trails at low speeds. Compared to other drive modes, Terrain unlocks sharper 4-wheel steer, giving drivers better ability to control torque and traction at low speeds. Speaking of power, the Trail Boss version of the Silverado EV will put out 725 horsepower and 775 lb-ft of torque when combined with the max range battery. That battery also offers a max towing capacity of 12,500 lbs along with a 2,100 payload capacity. Of course, you should expect some range loss while towing heavy loads. Chevy is also dialing up the tech, offering enhanced Super Cruise with hands-free highway driving on both the Trail Boss and LT trims of the truck. The driver assist feature is also available while towing. The automaker is also lowering the base price for the Silverado EV to $54,895, including destination charges, which is down fromthe previous base price of $57,095. The interior features a 17.7 inch center touchscreen alongside an 11-inch instrument gauge, which now comes standard on the Work Truck for the first time. But the Trail Boss will run a lot higher, with the extended range version starting at $72,095 and the max range blasting off at $88,695. What, you thought all that extra range would be cheap?

    "article_text": "SynthID Detector is a ‘verification portal’ that determines if content has been created with Google’s AI tools. SynthID Detector is a ‘verification portal’ that determines if content has been created with Google’s AI tools. byJay Peters Google announced a new SynthID Detector tool at Google I/O that lets you check if content has been made with the assistance of Google’s AI tools. Ina blog post, Google DeepMind’s Pushmeet Kohli describes SynthID Detector as “a verification portal” that can “quickly and efficiently identify AI-generated content made with Google AI.” It’s also able to “highlight which parts of the content are more likely to have been watermarked with SynthID.” SynthID watermarks are applied to AI-generated images, text, audio, and videos, including content generated by Google’s Gemini, Imagen, Lyria, and Veo models, Kohli says. Here’s how the tool works, according to Kohli: When you upload an image, audio track, video or piece of text created using Google’s AI tools, the portal will scan the media for a SynthID watermark. If a watermark is detected, the portal will highlight specific portions of the content most likely to be watermarked. For audio, the portal pinpoints specific segments where a SynthID watermark is detected, and for images, it indicates areas where a watermark is most likely. Google is starting to roll out the tool to “early testers,” Kohli says in the post. “Following the initial testing phase, the portal will gradually be rolled out to users who sign up to thewaitlistto gain access to the SynthID Detector,” Kohli tellsThe Verge. “We will take learnings from this cohort of professionals and work to implement content transparency more broadly.” I’m on the waitlist, but I haven’t tested the tool myself, so I can’t vouch for how well it might work. And will people actually use it when it’s widely available? I hope so, but we’ll have to wait and see.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 21, 2025 / 6:08 PM EDT/ CBS News There's good news and bad news for the nearly 50% of Americans who say they're planning on taking a trip this summer despite inflation concerns, a recent analysis finds. First, the good news: While some expenses are up, there are a number of ways to save on your vacation. To start, look at flight costs. As a result of economic uncertainty, bookings are down slightly compared with one year ago, according to an analysis fromNerdWallet. As a result, travelers can find deals on airfares, which are down roughly 8% compared with the same period one year earlier. Hotel room rates are also down, falling 2.4% over the past year. Rental car costs are down by just over 2%, according to the analysis, which looks at data from travel categories, such as airfares an lodging, tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Consumer Price Index. Travel costs overall are down 2% compared with Memorial Day weekend a year ago, NerdWallet's Travel Price Index shows. The relief comes as overall prices rose 2.3% through April 2025, according to thelatest datafrom BLS. Americans who plan to travel are prepared to spend $300 more this summer compared with last summer, the analysis found. \"A lot of people are still taking those big international trips this year that they booked many, many months ago,\" NerdWallet's lead travel writer Sally French told CBS News. But while airfares are down, ride-share fares are up, as is the cost of entertainment. Overall, the cost of vacation-related activities is 3.4% higher this year from a year ago, while the cost of eating at restaurants has risen nearly 4%, according to NerdWallet's analysis. \"There are a lot of unanticipated expenses that cost more and these are the things that can really add up,\" French said. \"There are the Lyft and Uber rides, there are the parking expenses, there are the tips.\" Here are some ways to save on your summer trip.

    "title": "What is AI Mode, Google's new artificial intelligence search tech?",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 21, 2025 / 4:30 PM EDT/ CBS News Google on Tuesday rolled out AI Mode, its latest artificial intelligence feature designed to provide users with more detailed and tailored responses to questions entered into the search engine. Unveiled Tuesday at the search giant's annual Google I/O developer conference, AI Mode comes a year after the company introducedAI Overviews, its first tool to use generative AI technology to enhance its search engine capabilities. Sundar Pichai, CEO of both Google and parent company,Alphabet,saidin remarks at the conference that AI Mode represents a \"total reimagining of Search\" and that it would gradually be rolled out to all Google users. \"What all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,\" Pichai told the crowd yesterday at an amphitheater near the company's  headquarters in Mountain View, California, according to theAssociated Press. Avideoteasing the technology showcases how it works. In response to lengthy, detailed questions typed into Google search, AI Mode displays how many searches Google is performing and how many sites it's scanning as the technology quickly generates a summarized response at the top of the search platform. It also provides a side bar with links to relevant sites. Google said it's also testing a \"Search Live\" feature that will enable the search engine to respond to questions based on video content, as well as voice searches, or to questions verbalized by the user, rather than typed. As an example, Google'steasershows a person recording a video of themselves holding a bridge made of Popsicle sticks while asking the search engine what can be done to strengthen the structure. \"To make it stronger, consider adding more triangles to the design,\" an automated voice responds. Google said it will begin feeding its latest AI model, Gemini 2.5, into its search engine starting next week. The company calls Gemini 2.5 its \"most intelligent model\" yet. The California-based company begantestingAI Mode in March of this year. Google's latest AI search tool builds on AI Overviews, which was introduced in the U.S. inMay 2024and has 1.5 billion users, according to an article on theGooglewebsite. Some argue that AI Overviews, which provides an AI-generated summary of information online, at times eliminating the need to click directly on source links for further information, has undercut traffic to their sites. According to astudy by Ahrefs, AI Overviews led to a 35% lower average click-through rates for top-ranking pages on search engine results pages. \"By making AI Mode a core part of the experience, Google is betting it can cater to the demand for AI without alienating its massive base,\" Gadjo Sevilla, a senior analyst for research firm eMarketer, wrote in a blogpost. \"But there are risks for hallucinations and factual errors which could drive users towards competitors,\" he added. Such factual errors were spotted with AI Overviews soon after its release, prompting Google to admit in a statement at the time that the technology produced \"someodd and erroneous overviews.\" In one instance, AI Overviews suggested that users add glue to pizza or eat at least one small rock a day,accordingto the MIT Technology Review. As for AI Mode, Google has indicated that its new AI search tech is performing well and serving its intended purpose. \"We conduct quantitative research and collect in-product feedback to ask users whether they're satisfied with their results. And we've seen that introducing AI Overviews on Search leads to an increase in satisfaction and reported helpfulness,\" a Google spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.

    "title": "Markets sink as debt worries hammer U.S. bonds",
    "article_text": "Fears of a global government borrowing glut — likely to be compounded by the GOP’sspending and tax cut bill— helped fuel an unusually weak auction for U.S. government bonds that sent markets into a tailspin Wednesday. The broad S&P 500 fell 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined more than 800 points, or 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was off 1.4%. The Wall Street declines were followed by a fall in Asia-Pacific markets on Thursday, while stock futures were flat in overnight trading,CNBC reported. Investors are increasingly worried that central banks around the world, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, will have to hold interest rates higher for longer. That scenario could help keep a lid on inflation, which can be fueled by rising levels of government spending. It’s an issue ratings firm Moody’s highlighted Friday when it stripped America’s debt of its prime AAA status.While the market’s initial reaction to the downgrade was relatively muted, a combination of fears of rising interest rates abroad and the impact from the budget bill sought by PresidentDonald Trumpsent bond investors over the edge Wednesday. Dubbed by the president as “one big beautiful bill,” the proposed legislation would extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts while raising the debt limit by $4 trillion. It would also boost spending for immigration enforcement and the military, while making cuts to areas like Medicaid and clean energy tax credits. Third-party, ostensibly nonpartisan groups like the Congressional Budget Office and the Penn Wharton Budget Model have said the bill would fail to meaningfully address America’s debt and deficit issues — assertions that White House officials have disputed. Bond investors may have the final say. A Wednesday afternoon auction for bonds that pay off after 20 years saw investors asking for a significantly higher return than they did for a similar auction a month ago, Dow Jones reported. The category of bidders for the bonds that include foreign central banks saw lower participation. That caused bond yields, or the percentage amount that investors demand in return for lending to the government, to surge. The yield on the 10-year note reached its highest level since February, climbing to as much as 4.6%, while the yield on the 30-year note reached more than 5%, its highest level in 18 years. When bond yields go up, it means governments have to pay more in interest — and have less money to spend on other areas — unless they borrow even more money, which risks igniting inflation. “The market’s queasy here with this move in rates,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group and author of The Boock Report newsletter. He said the likely contents of the final spending bill, plus the recent recovery by stocks after Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement sent them plunging, make it increasingly likely that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates elevated for the foreseeable future. That, in turn, means less money would be available to help bid up stock prices, Boockvar said. “Investors have become highly sensitive to further rises in interest rates,” he said. Wednesday’s poor U.S. auction results were compounded by economic concerns about Japan and the U.K., whose central banks are facing increasing pressure to keep interest rates higher amid inflation and spending jumps. In the U.K., inflation jumped more than expected last month, while Japanese investors pushed the rate of return they demand to lend to that country to levels not seen in 25 years. The upshot is that investors worldwide are increasingly worried about governments’ abilities to pay back their debts in a timely manner without forcing price growth throughout their respective economies to accelerate. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucuswere scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the budget legislation.",

    "title": "Judge says Trump administration violated court order with deportation flight linked to South Sudan",
    "article_text": "After a deportation flight with eight migrants left Texas reportedly intended for South Sudan this week, a federal judge on Wednesday ruled that the Trump administration had violated a previous order. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts said at a hearing that the administration had failed to adhere to an injunction he issued in March that prevented people from being sent to countries other than their own without opportunities to raise fears of persecution or torture. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed Wednesday morning that eight people from Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba, Mexico and South Sudan had been deported this week. According to DHS, many of them had violent criminal convictions, including murder and sexual assault. “The department’s actions,” Murphy said, “are unquestionably violative of this court’s order.” The White House stood by its actions. “The Trump Administration removed dangerous criminal illegal aliens from America in full compliance with all court orders,”  White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement Wednesday evening. “We are confident in the legality of our actions and do not apologize for acting to protect the American people.” Government attorneys said that the migrants are in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody and that the plane has since landed. They declined to share the location of the plane’s final destination. In a written order Wednesday night, Murphy ordered that the individuals removed from the U.S.  \"be given a reasonable fear interview in private, with the opportunity for the individual to have counsel of their choosing present during the interview.” Murphy said they must be allowed all  the access they would have otherwise received in the United States. “The Court is not — in ordering this remedy — making any findings or conclusions that compliance with these processes before deportation would have satisfied the requirements of its Preliminary Injunction in the first instance,” the judge wrote. Murphy, who relayed the sequence of events leading to the deportations after more than 30 minutes in a sealed proceeding, said the people were notified of their destination “sometime in the evening” Monday, outside business hours.He added that they left the ICE facility en route to a nearby airport the next morning at 9:35 CT. Without sufficient time to consult an attorney or family members, the judge said, it was “impossible” for those people to “have a meaningful opportunity to object” to their deportations to a third country. “The non-citizens at issue had fewer than 24 hours’ notice, and zero business hours’ notice, before being put on a plane and sent to a country” for which the U.S. has issued a “do not travel” order, Murphy wrote, making very clear the parameters of his refined order — which includes a new nationwide 10-day window allowing migrants to provide a fear-based claim before being removed from the U.S. A State Department travel advisory warns Americans not to go to South Sudan “due to crime, kidnapping and armed conflict” and notes that in March, because of conditions on the ground, it “ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees from South Sudan.” Immigration attorneys told Murphy that at least two of their clients, from Myanmar and Vietnam, were deported Tuesday morning to South Sudan. It’s possible one of the migrants, Nyo Mint, might have been diverted to his home country, Myanmar (formerly known as Burma), but his San Antonio-based immigration attorney, Jonathan Ryan, said that he is still in the dark about where his client was, and that he has been “disappeared.” “I have not heard from my client,” Ryan said. “How am I supposed to take their word that they sent him to Burma?” Ryan said the government is acting as if due process is a privilege, saying it is a problem “when we stop doing due process for unpopular people.” At a DHS news conference before the hearing, spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told reporters about the migrants that “no country on Earth wanted to accept them because their crimes were so uniquely barbaric.” McLaughlin also criticized the court system. “Activist judges are on the other side, fighting to get them back onto the United States soil,” she said. South Sudan could beheaded for another civil war.A 2018 power-sharing agreement between President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar ended five years of civil war. But earlier this year, violent clashes between the factions ramped up once again. Murphy this month blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to deport people from the Philippines, Vietnam, Laos and other countries to Libya. Then, he reaffirmed his injunction on third-country deportations in response to an emergency motion from the migrants’ lawyers.",

    "title": "Trump's crypto dinner cost over $1 million per seat, on average",
    "article_text": "More than 200 wealthy, mostly anonymous crypto buyers are coming to Washington on Thursday to have dinner with President Donald Trump. The price of admission: $55,000 to $37.7 million. That’s how much the 220 winners of a contest to meet Trump spent on his volatile cryptocurrency token, $TRUMP, according to an analysis by the blockchain analytics company Nansen. The top $TRUMP coin holders at a specific time — determined by the dinner’s organizers — secured a seat. In total, the winners spent $394 million on Trump’s official cryptocurrency, Nansen found, though some have sold portions of or all of their holdings since the contest ended. The amount varied significantly by spender, with the top seven winners each spending more than $10 million and the bottom 24 each spending less than $100,000. A third of the winners — 67 of them — spent more than a million dollars, the research shows. The average winner spent $1,788,994.42. Like many meme coins, $TRUMP’s value fluctuates wildly,according toCoinMarketCap, which tracks cryptocurrency prices. Nansen tracked how much each of the contest winners spent on their $TRUMP at the time they purchased it. The top 220 contest winners were invited to the black-tie optional dinner at the Trump National Golf Club Washington, D.C. Whilethe website for the contestclaims that Trump “is appearing at the dinner as a guest and not soliciting any funds for it,”it also says that80% of the $TRUMP coin project is owned by two Trump-affiliated companies, CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight LLC. The personal cryptocurrency and associated contest, which ended last Monday, adds to the litany of ways Trump has appeared to use the office of the presidency to profit personally. His business interests are in a trust controlled by his son Donald Trump Jr., and he has intertwined many of his family businesses with his activities as president, including holding events, like the crypto dinner, at his social clubs, and issuing exclusive political statements on his social media app Truth Social. Trump’s cryptocurrency also makes money for the Trump-tied groups that created it simply by being traded. For every $TRUMP coin that’s traded, a transaction fee is taken. Chainalysis, another cryptocurrency research firm,has estimatedthat the $TRUMP coin made nearly $900,000 in transaction fees within the first two days of the contest being announced. While most federal employees would be legally barred from using their office for financial gain, the president is largely exempt, Dan Weiner, the director of the Elections and Government Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told NBC News. “The president is not subject to the broad prohibition on conflicts of interest that affects almost everyone else who works for the federal government,” Weiner said. “In general this is pretty wild even by the standards of the first Trump administration, when you had a variety of people doing business at the president’s hotels. This goes far beyond that, but that doesn’t necessarily make it illegal for him,” he said. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement: “The President is working to secure GOOD deals for the American people, not for himself. President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public — which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media.” Even the winners at the bottom of the leaderboard spent far more thanthe legal limitfor an American to donate directly to a political candidate, $3,500. The top spenderrevealed himself Tuesdayas Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto entrepreneur whotold Forbes in Marchhe had become a citizen of the tiny island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis. Sun was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that case has been paused under the Trump administration. The identities of most of the other contest winners are largely private, known only by their pseudonymous nicknames and cryptocurrency wallet addresses. However, a majority of the attendees appear to be foreign nationals, according to Molly White, an independent crypto researcher whohas written about the contest. White examined each winning wallet’s transactions as they crossed through different crypto exchanges, and noted when the holder appeared to use an exchange that does not legally allow U.S. citizens. Of the 220 wallets tied to contest winners, 158 of them, or 72%, appear foreign, White told NBC News. ANew York Times investigationreported that the leaderboard included people representing crypto businesses in Singapore and Australia. The prevalence of non-U.S. citizens among the contest winners is notable, as it is generally illegal for people who are not U.S. citizens to donate to American political candidates, Weiner said. “It’s an incredible contrast. We have very strict laws that prohibit foreign nationals from making campaign donations. So the great irony here is that many of the people buying this currency would not be eligible to donate $100 to the president’s campaign,” he said. “We have a variety of laws that are designed to prevent undue foreign influence over our politics, something actually both parties agree is a legitimate thing to try to avoid. And yet you have this happening,” he said.",

    "article_text": "This is a free article forDiddy on Trialnewsletter subscribers.Sign upto get exclusive reporting and analysis throughout Sean Combs’ federal trial. Cassie Venturaisn’t on the stand this week, but her testimony still looms over the proceedings. Today, federal prosecutors called witnesses seemingly meant to bolster her account of drug-fueled “freak offs” and years of domestic abuse. In the weeks ahead, prosecutors are expected to link her story to their wider sex trafficking allegations against Diddy. Today’s key moments: Two members of Diddy’s defense team were in the spotlight today.Teny Geragosaggressively cross-examined Gannon, suggesting that federal investigators who conducted the search of Diddy’s property in Miami manipulated what they found for the purpose of taking photos and arranged objects in a way that made them look nefarious. In the afternoon,Jonathan Bachcross-examined Hughes. Diddy sat back in his chair and appeared to be paying close attention during Bach’s line of questioning, which focused on the fact that Hughes hasn’t personally evaluated the key players in the case. Hughes earlier told the court that she wasn’t legally allowed to interview the defendant or witnesses. The government had to limit Hughes’ testimony about why victims remain in relationships, how they cope in such relationships, why they delay reporting abuse and the effect of trauma on memory. She was not allowed to testify to “interpersonal violence,” “coercive control,” or “psychological aggression.” The defense had tried to bar Hughes’ testimony, but it wasn’t successful. This kind of testimony is often permitted in similar cases, as the government pointed out in its filings. But did the defense have a point? Consider some of the areas of expert testimony from Hughes: Victims often stay in abusive relationships, victims will wait years before reporting abuse, and a trauma bond can make a victim unwilling to leave. Is this specialized knowledge that required expert testimony? Or is it something that is within the average juror’s everyday experience and knowledge? Hughes’ testimony was a victory the moment the judge decided it was admissible. Hughes isn’t supposed to bolster the testimony of witnesses like Ventura, but that’s effectively what she did. Tomorrow: Kaplan is expected to return to the stand for more direct questioning — and at some point rapperKid Cudiwill testify, too.

    "title": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander wins NBA Most Valuable Player award",
    "article_text": "When Shai Gilgeous-Alexander entered the NBA seven years ago, it took the then-20-year-old point guard from Canada only 10 games to own a starting job. Earning his driver's license took a bit longer. While he was practicing on a learner's permit during his rookie season, Gilgeous-Alexander relied on teammates or Uber to get around Los Angeles, where the Clippers had drafted him 11th overall and practiced 14 miles from their downtown arena. There was much ahead of him to navigate. Traded unexpectedly to Oklahoma City after his rookie season, he landed with a rebuilding Thunder franchise that would win just 46 games from 2020 to 2022. Yet this season, Gilgeous-Alexander has arrived among the game's greats. On Wednesday, Gilgeous was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player after he produced league-leading averages in points (32.7), free-throw attempts (7.9) and shot attempts (21.8) while leading Oklahoma City to a franchise-record 68 victories and the top seed in the Western Conference for the second consecutive season. The award is voted on by media members. Gilgeous-Alexander got 71 first-place votes and 913 points overall from a panel of 100 voters. Denver center Nikola Jokić, who this season became just the third player in NBA history to average a triple-double, finished second with 787 points, including 29 first-place votes. They were the only players to get first-place votes. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was third, Boston's Jayson Tatum was fourth, and Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell finished fifth. Jokić has finished in the top two of voting for the award in five consecutive seasons, including wins in 2021, 2022 and last season, when Gilgeous-Alexander was runner-up. In April, Jokić scored the most points ever recorded in a triple-double, 61. The Thunder are in the Western Conference finals for the first time since 2016, and if it beats the Minnesota Timberwolves it would advance to the team's first NBA Finals appearance since 2012. Though the franchise won the 1979 NBA championship during its incarnation as the Seattle SuperSonics, the Thunder has never won an NBA title since it moved to Oklahoma City in 2008. Gilgeous-Alexander joins Steve Nash as the only MVP winners to come from Canada. An international player has won the last seven MVP awards; an American-born player has not finished in the top three since 2021. “He's a special player,\" Jokić said after Oklahoma City beat Denver in last week's conference semifinals. \"His shot selection, his capability of making his own shots, separation, playing his rhythm. Defensively he’s always stealing the balls [and] always blocking the shots. ... He’s a special player.\"",

    "title": "Pregnant anchor's water breaks before she hosts the morning news, and she keeps on going",
    "article_text": "A news anchor in Albany, New York, delivered the day’s breaking news just minutes after her water broke. On May 21, viewers tuned into WRGB, a CBS affiliate in Schenectady, New York, to find co-anchors Olivia Jaquith and Julia Dunn with grins and big news: Jaquith’s water had broken moments earlier and instead of heading to the hospital, she would remain behind the desk, contractions and all. Jaquith is expecting her first baby, a boy, according toWRGB. (WRGB did not immediately respond to a request for an update on Jaquith.) “We do have some breaking news this morning. Literally, Olivia’s water has broke, and she is anchoring the news now in active labor,” Dunn said at the top of the show. “Early labor. Early labor,” Jaquith added with a smile. “Let’s not get carried away.” Dunn noted on air that they had been timing Jaquith’s contractions, estimating they were two minutes apart. “No, well, there was one, but it’s been a few minutes since then, so we’re still in good shape,” Jaquith said. “I’m happy to be here, and I’ll stay on the desk for as long as I possibly can,” Jaquith added. “But if I disappear, that’s what’s going on.” Dunn also went live onFacebookWednesday morning, and Jaquith explained that her water broke while she was in the studio bathroom. After Dunn asked why she was still at the newsroom, Jaquith said, “I think I can get through a three-hour show.” On the broadcast, her co-workers celebrated Jaquith with sweet references to her baby news, such as a chyron at the top of the screen that read, “Days Past Due Date: 2.” Later, a headline at the bottom of the broadcast read, “Baby Watch,” and, “Here Comes Baby P, Good Luck Olivia.” Throughout the show, Jaquith made references to her big day. “If my baby does come today, Craig, how’s the weather?” Jaquith asked, turning to the show’s meteorologist. When the show offered a prompt for a coffee break, Jaquith suggested viewers take a “water break.” Later in the show, Jaquith and Dunn welcomed viewers just tuning in with a recap of the developing story. “Olivia’s water broke, and she’s still here. She’s been doing the entire show,” Dunn said. “This is her decision to do this.” “I’d rather be at work than at the hospital,” Jaquith quipped. Jaquith was still behind the anchor desk at 7:56 a.m., according to footage from WRGB. “Whole show,” Dunn commented while giving her co-anchor a high-five. “Look at that. Three hours of news, in contractions. I think that’s a first for CBS6.” “Well, hopefully I don’t see you tomorrow, but make sure you join Julia,” Jaquith told viewers at the end of the broadcast. Dunn also happens to be pregnant. In March, the co-anchor shared the news of her second pregnancy in a post onInstagram. In her announcement, both Jaquith and Dunn held their baby bumps and smiled wide for the camera. “Every morning we have Chobani yogurt together on the anchor desk,” Dunn wrote in her announcement.",

    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, Bridget Bowman explores how Democrats are using Elon Musk in campaign attacks against each other, not just Republicans. Plus, Andrea Mitchell dives into yet another Oval Office showdown between President Donald Trump and a world leader. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Elon Musk has pulled back from his initial prominent role in the Trump administration and said he will spend “a lot less” on politics moving forward. But he’s still sure to a major figure on the campaign trail in the weeks and months ahead. The latest example comes in New Jersey, where the gubernatorial primary is in less than three weeks, asBridget Bowman reports. Two new attack ads launched this week note that Democrat Mikie Sherrill’s House campaign received donations from a corporate PAC for Musk’s company SpaceX. It underscores how Democrats are looking to invoke Musk in attacks, not just against Republicans — as they notably did in last month’sWisconsin Supreme Court race— but also against members of their own party. And it offers a potential preview of what’s to come in Democratic contests heading into the 2026 midterm elections, with Musk emerging as a political boogeyman for the left following his roles as a major 2024 GOP donor and with the Department of Government Efficiency. Sherrill’s House campaign was one of nearly 180 Democratic congressional campaigns to receive donations from SpaceX’s corporate PAC since 2008, according to campaign finance records. The corporate PAC also donated to roughly 240 Republican congressional campaigns over that same period. If the New Jersey race is any indication, the donations could become political liabilities for Democrats this year. And the list of recipients includes some who are in competitive Senate primaries in 2026. That includes Reps. Angie Craig of Minnesota and Haley Stevens of Michigan, as well as Reps. Robin Kelly and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. Craig’s campaign previouslysaid it donatedher campaign’s SpaceX contributions to charity. Krishnamoorthi’s campaign also donated the funds to charity before he launched his Senate run, according to his campaign. Sherrill has done the same, donating the $24,000 her campaign had received from the SpaceX corporate PAC since 2019 to the Community Food Bank of New Jersey on March 20, according toa recent campaign finance report. One of Sherrill’s rivals in the gubernatorial primary, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, also received a $2,500 donation from Musk last year. Gottheimer campaign spokesperson Peter Opitz said in a statement to NBC News that Gottheimer “gave away the contribution last year to help Democrats in New Jersey beat Republicans at the ballot box.” Read more from Bridget → President Donald Trump’s unique method of conducting diplomacy in public — especially when seizing advantage over a less powerful foreign leader —was on full display in the Oval Officetoday in what is being widely described as a political ambush of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. Reminiscent of the White House dressing down of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyin February, Trump — flanked by Vice President JD Vance, deputy chief of staff Steven Miller and South African native Elon Musk — began politely, as Ramaphosa tried flattery. He spoke of trade agreements, and brought with him South African golf legend Ernie Els and a book displaying the attractions of his country’s golf courses. But instead of listening to Ramaphosa in private defending his government against baseless U.S. accusations it is committing genocide against minority white farmers, Trump dimmed the Oval Office lights to show videos promoting those claims. The State Department has not designated a genocide in South Africa, as would be required by law, but a spokesperson says it is enough that the president has said one is taking place. Musk has also repeatedly posted on X that South African law permits white-owned land to be confiscated. That is correct, in some instances, but it does require judicial review. The U.S. has also cut off $400 million in foreign aid to South Africa, including funding through the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) that has saved millions of lives by preventing the spread of HIV. Several Democratic senators challenged Secretary of State Marco Rubio at a Foreign Relations Committee hearing about the genocide charge Tuesday. Reached today, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told NBC News no one questions that South Africa has a terrible crime problem, but that the genocide charge is a “fabrication by Trump to justify bringing 59 white South Africans to the U.S. as refugees”last week. That move came after Trump hadsuspended the refugee asylum programin a Jan. 20 executive order and last week cancelled Temporary Protective Status to thousands of Afghans living in the U.S. since the Taliban takeover. On a separate but related issue, a spokesperson for Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NBC News that the senator is introducing a privileged resolution denouncing the administration’s recent deportation flight with eight migrants that was reportedly intended for South Sudan. A federal judge ruled the Trump administrationhad violated a previous court orderwith that deportation flight. The resolution, which would require a simple majority for passage in the GOP-led Senate, is expected to be voted on after the Memorial Day recess. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

    "title": "Senate Republicans trigger a clash over the filibuster with vote to kill electric vehicle rule",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans pushed forward with a simple-majority vote late Wednesday to undo an electric vehicle mandate set by California, which Democrats and the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office said should be subject to the 60-vote filibuster rule. The vote of 51-46 to proceed against objections turns a battle over clean energy policy into a high-stakes clash over the fate of the 60-vote filibuster rule, with consequences for the future of the Senate. The vote bypassed the filibuster, which can be done in limited circumstances. Democrats had warned that if Republicans proceed in defiance of the Senate parliamentarian, who has sided with the GAO in the dispute, they’d be setting a precedent to nuke the legislative filibuster and turn the Senate into a majority-vote body. “Republicans just overruled the Parliamentarian, violated the plain text of the Congressional Review Act, changed the Clean Air Act, and broke the filibuster,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said in a statement after the vote. “Make no mistake, Democrats will not forget this, and Republicans will rue the day.” In a warning to Republicans, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters before the vote, “What goes around comes around.” The unusual clash has created tension in both parties. Democratscampaigned last year on scrappingthe filibuster to pass major bills if they won, while Senate Republicansvowed to protect the 60-vote rule, even after they captured the White House and control of Congress last fall. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., insisted that he isn’t trying to end the filibuster and that the move applies only to a narrow and particular case. He has argued that the parliamentarian is wrong to defer to the GAO on this question, saying that under the Congressional Review Act, theresolution is subject to a simple-majority threshold to repeal regulations. “Democrats are attempting to derail a repeal by throwing a tantrum over a supposed procedural problem. The California waivers are not rules, Democrats claim, and thus the Congressional Review Act cannot be used to repeal them,” Thune said, referring to the Biden administration's move to permit California to enact the rules. “I think we need to act to ensure that this intrusion into the Congressional Review Act process doesn’t become a habit and that the Senate doesn’t end up transferring its decision-making power on CRA resolutions to the Government Accountability Office.” Thune said the issue “is not about destroying Senate procedure or any other hysterical claim the Democrats are making.” As Republicans have warned Democrats in the past, breaking precedent in the Senate has a way of boomeranging on the party that starts it. Democrats say ignoring the in-house referee in this case would open the door for future majorities to do the same on other issues. In a new memo to colleagues, Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., argued that the move would “be the first time in Senate history that a majority overruled the Parliamentarian to pass a bill by a majority vote, bypassing a filibuster.” The vote puts Republican senators on the spot, as many of them have vowed not only to protect the filibuster but also to abide by the parliamentarian's rulings. “If something is directly presented to the parliamentarian by way of a parliamentary inquiry, she answers one way and then you have an effort to override that, that’s a concern, right?” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told NBC News, noting that she supports undoing the EV mandate in California but does not support overruling the parliamentarian. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she plans to support the resolution to undo the EV mandate, despite her history of supporting the filibuster rule. Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, has said he would oppose any effort to overrule the parliamentarian in the budget reconciliation package. But he said he’s fine with the decision to proceed to undoing the California mandate. “I walked through it a lot, spent a lot of time on it,” Curtis said. “Count me in the camp that just has been very thoughtful to make sure that what we’re doing doesn’t set a precedent that we’re not happy with.” If Republican leaders structure the process so members vote against the GAO decision without directly going after the parliamentarian, that is a distinction without a difference, Democrats say. “That’s nonsense,” said Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. “There have been dozens of times where Republicans have gotten opinions from the GAO. This is just their way of trying to put a favorable spin on breaking their word. Leader Thune in his inaugural speech as majority leader said he would not overturn the parliamentarian. The parliamentarian has ruled. He is now advocating overturning the parliamentarian. And there’s just no way to put a positive gloss on that.” Asked whether she worries that the vote would open the door for Democrats to try to eliminate the filibuster, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said: “Well, they already tried that.” When Democrats had full control in 2021 and 2022, they tried to pierce the legislative filibuster to pass a federal voting rights law — but were stymied by internal opposition. They also faced pressure from liberals to ignore the parliamentarian to raise the minimum wage in their party-line bill, but they declined for fear of the precedent it would set. Now, some Democrats say the GOP move would strengthen their case to smash the filibuster in the future. “The silver lining here is that Republicans would be overruling the parliamentarian by majority vote, which is one step closer to nuking the legislative filibuster,” said Adam Jentleson, a former longtime Senate Democratic aide who wrote a book criticizing the filibuster. “Democrats won’t like the policy outcome here, but there’s nothing they can do to stop it, so they might as well pocket the procedural marker and use it when they are back in power to pass their agenda on majority-rule votes.”",

It is intended as a safety measure that will allow crew members to respond more quickly to potential fires. \"Using portable charging devices while stored in a bag or overhead bin will no longer be permitted,\" Southwest said in a statement. \"Nothing is more important to Southwest than the Safety of its Customers and Employees.\" Lithium-ion batteriesare commonly foundin a variety of modern gadgets, such smartphones and medical devices, but they can occasionally overheat and catch fire. According todata collected by the Federal Aviation Administration, there have been at least 22 incidents related to air travel this year involving lithium batteries,some of whichhave resulted in fires. Currently, the FAAprohibitspassengers from carrying spare lithium-ion batteries, including power banks, in their checked bags. But Southwest's new policy goes even further by requiring passengers to remove these items from their carry-on bags and keep them visible to the crew during flight if they are in use. \"When a portable charger/power bank is used during a flight, it must be out of any baggage and remain in plain sight,\" a page on Southwest'swebsite reads. \"Do not charge devices in the overhead bin.\" In addition, the governments of South Korea and Hong Kong as well as some airlines in China, Thailand, Malaysia and other countries have recently implemented new restrictions on the use of portable power banks during flights, Reutersreported. South Korean investigators say that a fire, which engulfed an Air Busan plane in January and prompted the evacuation of passengers and crew, was likely started by a portable power bank,according to the BBC.

    "title": "Trump administration officially accepts jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One",
    "article_text": "By Kat Lonsdorf A Qatari Boeing 747 sits on the tarmac of Palm Beach International airport after President Trump toured the aircraft on Feb. 15. The U.S. has since accepted the luxury Boeing jet from the Qatari royal family.Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The United States has officially accepteda Boeing 747-8 luxury jetlineras a gift from the Qatari government, and the Air Force has been tasked with upgrading it to be used as a new plane for President Trump, according to an Air Force spokesperson. The spokesperson, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, told NPR that the Air Force is currently \"preparing to award a contract to modify a Boeing 747 aircraft for an executive airlift,\" saying further details about the contract are classified. The plane — worth hundreds of millions of dollars — is a gift that Trump said he would be\"stupid\" to turn down, suggesting that it could be converted quickly to be ready for use as the presidential aircraft. But experts warn that no matter how luxurious the plane is, it would take years to rework it to meet the current standards set for Air Force One. Democratic lawmakers and independent watchdogs saythe gift violatesthe Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause. The White House said the plane was a gift to the Department of Defense, and would go through the legal protocols required when something is given to the government. Trump has said he would not use it after leaving office and wants to keep it in his presidential library at that point. There are currently two new Boeing 747-8 planes being customized to become the next generation of Air Force One. Trump announced a$3.9 billion deal with Boeingduring his first term for the project. The planes were supposed to be ready by last year, but the project has been marred by setbacks, and now the customized aircraft aren't expected for several more years. \"Some of that is due to poor execution. But some of that is just due to the huge amount of requirements and work needed to take a commercial jet and wire it up,\" for the extensive security measures standard in Air Force One planes,said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory and an aviation analyst, speaking to NPR'sMorning Edition. He called Trump's plan for the plane from Qatar to be converted quickly a \"fantasy.\" Technically, \"Air Force One\" is the call signal used for any plane carrying the president of the United States. But more commonly it's used to refer to the specific specialized planes — currently Boeing 747-200B models — outfitted with state-of-the-art communications and defense systems, along with lots of other (often highly classified) features. The two Boeing planes currently serving as Air Force One have been in operation since 1990. A plan to replace them has been in the works for years, withBoeing winning the contract back in 2016under then-President Obama. \"It's a mobile White House,\" says Doug Birkey, executive director of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. \"All the functions of the president have to be executed in it, no matter what circumstances, including warfare.\" Birkey says that includes requiring an \"incredibly robust command and control suite\" and defenses against anything from surface-to-air missiles to a nuclear blast and warfare. He says in terms of luxury, the plane from Qatar probably looks and feels better than the current or planned Air Force One planes — but it's unlikely that it has any of the communications or defense systems needed. \"And installing those is not an easy thing. I mean, you have to deconstruct the aircraft a fair amount to do that,\" Birkey says. Trump has repeatedly stressed that the plane from Qatar was free, but several experts NPR talked to agreed that it will likely end up costing a significant amount of money — up to a billion dollars by Aboulafia's estimate — to outfit it properly to current standards to become Air Force One. A U.S. official who requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about the matter told NPR the conversion would likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

    "article_text": "Tom Dreisbach Shane Jenkins, seen here in police bodycam footage from Jan. 6, 2021, was convicted of multiple charges in connection with the Capitol riot, including assaulting police. Months after receiving a pardon from President Trump, Jenkins visited the White House along with another former Jan. 6 defendant.U.S. Department of Justicehide caption Just months after being freed through a pardon from President Trump, two men convicted of felonies for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol scored visits to the secure grounds of the White House. During their visit, the men took turns posing for pictures and videos behind the lectern in the White House press briefing room. \"Thank you so much President Trump, if you're seeing this, we appreciate you setting us free,\" said Shane Jenkins, ina videohe posted on social media. Jenkins, who had a criminal record before Jan. 6, was sentenced toseven years in prisonfor assaulting police protecting the Capitol and using a metal tomahawk to try to smash a window. The day after the attack, Jenkins wrote in atext message, \"I have murder in my heart and my head.\" \"Never would have thought in only a few short months I would be going from the big house to the White House,\" said another pardoned Jan. 6 defendant, Dominic Box, who alsorecorded a videofrom the briefing room. Dominic Box appeared exuberant as he recorded videos for social media in the White House press briefing room this month. Box was convicted of felony civil disorder and other nonviolent misdemeanors in connection with Jan. 6.  His case was dismissed by the Justice Department before he was sentenced.Screenshot by NPR/@DomFreePresshide caption Box was convicted offelony civil disorder and nonviolent misdemeanor chargesrelated to the Capitol breach. He had not yet been sentenced when Trump returned to office and issued mass clemency to all Jan. 6 defendants, including the most violent offenders. Separately, in 2023, Box was arrested in Florida on a DUI charge. According to thepolice report, while in the back of the squad car, Box used \"various racial slurs,\" including the n-word. In a message to NPR, Box said , \"I am not racist,\" and noted that he did not use \"the hard r\" when he said the n-word. The circumstances of the visit to the White House were somewhat murky. \"An individual within the Trump Administration extended the invitation,\" Box told NPR, \"but I am not at liberty to disclose their identity.\" In a message to NPR, Jenkins said he was also \"not at liberty to discuss\" how the tour was arranged, adding, \"but of course J6 Hostages were wronged and will be welcomed to the White House.\" The two men said that, in addition to the press briefing room, they saw the Oval Office and the Roosevelt Room, though they did not post any videos or photos of those areas. The White House did not respond to NPR's messages seeking comment. Since taking office, Trump has continued to embrace Jan. 6 defendants as \"political prisoners.\" \"I pardoned J6 people who were assaulted by our government,\" Trumptold reportersin February. The Department of Justice estimated that 140 police officers were injured in the attack. The Trump administration is also currently negotiating a settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the estate of Ashli Babbitt, the rioter who was shot and killed by a Capitol police officer while trying to climb through a broken window. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger condemned the news of the pending settlement. \"I am extremely disappointed and disagree with this settlement,\" Manger said in a written statement. \"In 2021, the DOJ investigation determined no wrongdoing by police. This settlement sends a chilling message to law enforcement nationwide, especially to those with a protective mission like ours.\" Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys, also said he briefly met with Trump while visiting the president's Mar-a-Lago resort earlier this month. Tarrio was convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in the Jan. 6 attack and sentenced to 22 years in prison. According to Tarrio, Trump called him over while he was dining at the resort. \"I thanked him for giving me my life back,\" Tarriowrote on social media. \"He replied with…I Love You guys.\" There is no indication that Jenkins or Box met with Trump when they visited White House. (Trump spent most of the day at his golf club in Virginia, according to hispublic schedule.) Both men have declined to disclose the precise details of their visit. \"Thank you to our friend, who shall go unnamed, for giving us that opportunity,\" Box said on a video live stream. The visit occurred on a Sunday – outside of the regular public tour schedule, which typically runs from Tuesday through Saturday, according to theWhite House website. In a break with the Biden administration, the Trump White House has stopped releasing visitor logs. Jenkins, who also had a criminal record before Jan. 6, smiled and posed for photos and videos behind the lectern in the White House press briefing room. Months earlier, he was serving a seven-year prison sentence for his actions during the Capitol riot.Screenshot by NPR/TheRealJ6Shanehide caption Jenkins' appearance at the White House was especially striking given his convictions for assaulting police on Jan. 6, and his extensive criminal record, which stretches back to the late 1990s. \"I was in and out of prison from 23 on,\" Jenkins said at his sentencing hearing. Prosecutors said Jenkins assaulted police officers on Jan. 6 using nine different objects, including \"a flagpole, a metal walking stick, and a broken wooden pole with a spear-like point on one end which he launched like a javelin.\" At his trial, prosecutors pointed out his large neck tattoo reading \"MAMA TRIED.\" In his defense, Jenkins' lawyersaid he was a victimof \"the poisonous propaganda of a former president.\" \"[Trump] cares nothing about his supporters, nor anyone else,\" defense attorney Dennis Boyle said inclosing arguments. \"To him they're just cannonfodders [sic] to serve his needs and his needs alone.\" Jenkins told NPR he disagrees with his lawyer's remarks. He maintains that he did not injure any police officers on Jan. 6, and said his actions were justified. \"We were standing not for Trump but in opposition to a stolen election,\" Jenkins said in a message. \"It was my duty as a citizen to object. In the process we were assaulted and responded in kind.\" \"I'm thankful no one was hurt by what I did but am I sorry, f[***] no!\" he wrote. Jenkins' legal troubles began long before Jan. 6. According tocourt documentsfiled by the Department of Justice, he had prior convictions for assault, resisting arrest, drug possession, making a \"terroristic threat\" and driving while intoxicated. When he was 20 years old, Jenkins shot and killed his stepfather. At his sentencing, hetestifiedthat he acted in self defense and murder charges against him were ultimately dropped. Like Jenkins, Box has also faced criminal charges unrelated to Jan. 6. In Aug. 2023, while awaiting trial for his Capitol riot case, Box was arrested in Florida for driving under the influence. According to thepolice report, a witness saw Box back into a pole and pass out. When officers arrived, they found Box slurring his speech, along with an open can of Natural Light beer and a bottle of Skol vodka in the car. NPR asked Box about the allegation that he used \"various racial slurs\" after the arrest. \"At one point, in an admittedly & regrettably intoxicated state after being woken up while in the back of the squad car I said, 'what's up n[****]?'\" Box wrote. \"I am not a racist, have dated women of all racial backgrounds & the majority of my friends in both Jacksonville & Savannah are black.\" Following the DUI arrest, Box was jailed for violating the terms of his pretrial supervision orders in the Jan. 6 case. He laterpleaded no contestto the Florida DUI charge, and said he is \"actively working a program of recovery\" from substance abuse. In a statement to NPR, the Secret Service said it followed standard protocol when they allowed Jenkins and Box to enter the White House. \"Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Box were subject to a rigorous security screening prior to their entry being approved,\" the agency wrote. \"In all cases, the U.S. Secret Service works in conjunction with White House staff to review pertinent visitor information and develop plans to ensure a safe and secure visit for all.\" \"Secret Service knew who we were and they were cool,\" Box said in a livestream video. \"They weren't looking at us like we were suspicious.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "The pros and cons of PSA tests for prostate cancer for midlife and older men",
    "article_text": "By Ronnie Cohen A blood test called a PSA can help screen men for prostate cancer but it can also lead to unnecessary treatment.miodrag ignjatovic/E+/Getty Imageshide caption News that former President Joseph Biden hasadvanced prostate cancerhas revived long-standing questions about the benefits versus the harms of a blood test that screens for themost commonly diagnosed cancer among menin the U.S. Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, screening tests are an imperfect tool for detecting prostate cancer, doctors and public health experts say. Part of the problem is identifying and treating aggressive cancers like Biden's while not unnecessarily treating men with slow-growing cancers unlikely to sicken them.Autopsies foundthe disease to be so widespread that more than one-third of white men and half of Black men in their 70s had prostate cancers that would never do any harm. \"PSA testing alone leaves a lot to be desired as a cancer screening test,\" said radiation oncologist Dr. Brent Rose, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine. The test measures the level of PSA, a protein produced by normal as well as malignant prostate gland cells, in the blood. Elevated PSA can be a marker for cancer. It also can signal a false positive or an inactive cancer, triggering a painful biopsy, and leading to overtreatment with punishing side effects, including impotence, incontinence and bowel dysfunction. \"PSA screening is beneficial,\" Rose said. \"There are risks, though, and so it is a personal decision whether or not to do PSA screening.\" The key is to target and treat aggressive cancers while waiting and watching cancers that might never become troublesome, Rose and other oncologists told NPR. Physicians have been walking this tightrope since they began regularly using PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer in healthy men in the 1990s. There is no other test that effectively screens for prostate cancer — thesecond deadliest cancerfor American men, oncologists said. Attempts to balance the possible harms against the number of lives saved have led totwo decades of fluctuating– and confusing – public health guidelines on PSA screening. In 2012, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advised against any screening, only to issue a watered-down recommendation in 2018 that men ages 55 to 69 discuss screening with their health care providers. Various physicians' groups offer conflicting guidance for this age group. In its advice to older men, however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has been somewhat more consistent. In 2008, the independent panel of national experts recommended men 75 and older not be screened, and since 2018, the panel has advised against screening men 70 and older. Biden, 82, apparently followed the guidance. He last had a PSA screening test in 2014, when he was 71 or 72 years old, aspokesman said. For men between the ages of 55 and 69, the task forcerecommendstalking to their health care providers about their preferences before deciding whether to get a PSA test. It classifies the recommendation as Grade C, which means it offers only a small benefit and insurers may not cover it. Finding the time to have a conversation about a topic as complicated as the value of prostate-cancer screening can be challenging for most primary-care physicians, oncologists interviewed for this story said. And while some men might welcome what's called \"shared decision-making,\" others find it agonizing. Still, the only advice for men for now is to talk the issue over carefully with their doctors. Dr. Alicia Morgans, a genitourinary medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, recognizes the problem and hopes that the task force will address it in new guidelines, which it is currently drafting. In August, she met with the volunteer panel in her role as chair of the medical advisory board for the advocacy group Zero Prostate Cancer. Morgans believes the current guidance was based on a flawed clinical trial. It concluded that men screened with PSA tests were no less likely to die of prostate cancer than men assigned to a group that was not screened. But the results were muddied because nearly 90% of the men in the control group had at least one PSA test before or during the trial, she said. Morgans would like to see the recommendation beefed up so more men get screened for prostate cancer and Black men and men with a family history, who are more vulnerable get screened earlier. \"I take care of people who have very advanced prostate cancer, as well as some people who have curable prostate cancer,\" she said, \"so my perspective is really skewed by the fact that I really want to make that diagnosis when things are curable.\" So does Dr. Matthew Cooperberg, a urologic oncologist and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. He has pushed to rename early-stage prostate cancer in part to ease the stress of a cancer diagnosis. One possible name, \"acinar neoplasm,\" describes an abnormal growth but one lacking the potential to spread or kill. Cooperberg also advocates monitoring men with elevated PSAs before rushing to biopsy their prostates. \"Men should get PSA testing in midlife with the goal of finding aggressive prostate cancer,\" he said. \"If we find low-grade disease along the way, whether or not we call it cancer, we should not treat it. We just monitor it with active surveillance. If we do that, we can erase this cancer.\" Dr. Tyler Seibert, a radiation oncologist and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, is not as optimistic about eliminating prostate cancer. But he too is dedicated to finding ways to identify the bad prostate cancers and treating only them. When doctors first began doing PSA screening tests, he said, \"there was a flawed assumption that was implicit that if you find any kind of prostate cancer, you must treat that kind of prostate cancer aggressively,\" he said. \"Many of them would never have harmed the patient.\" A new era in prostate-cancer screening has arrived, Seibert believes. Today, instead of men immediately having their prostates biopsied when they get an elevated PSA test, he and an increasing number of prostate-cancer specialists recommend first getting an MRI and, when possible, watching and waiting. \"For these patients with low-risk prostate cancer, we have really strong evidence that we can follow them closely, and they basically can just carry on with their life,\" he said. Not everyone is comfortable with getting periodic blood tests to see if their PSA might be rising and they might indeed need cancer treatment, Seibert acknowledged. But most of his patients do become comfortable with the protocol, he said. \"Every time you get that blood test, you're kind of a little bit nervous,\" he said. \"If you can tolerate that, and you don't think that it's going to be causing you too much anxiety, then screening makes a lot of sense.\" Ronnie Cohen is freelance health journalist based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

    "article_text": "Elizabeth Blair President Donald Trump talks to the media in the Hall of Nations during a tour at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts after leading a board meeting on March 17, 2025.Chip Somodevilla/Getty Imageshide caption Deborah Rutter, the former Kennedy Center president who was fired by President Donald Trump in a major shakeup of the institution, is rejecting criticisms of her tenure. In February, Trump abruptly ousted Rutter, as well as board chair and major donor David Rubenstein and board members appointed by President Joseph Biden. Trump's newly-elected board voted him in as the new chair. At a dinner with the Kennedy Center board Monday evening, Trump said the previous leadership spent millions of dollars. \"I don't know where they spent it,\" he said. \"They certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\" Also in the video, current Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell claimed the \"deferred maintenance of the Kennedy Center is criminal\" and that a review of previous years' budgets \"found $26 million in phantom revenue.\" He said he planned to \"refer this to the U.S. attorney's office.\" In response to the assertions, Rutter wrote in a statement, \"I am deeply troubled by the false allegations regarding the management of the Kennedy Center being made by people without the context or expertise to understand the complexities involved in nonprofit and arts management.\" Rutter's statement was emailed to the media Tuesday and is nowpostedon her website. She continued, \"This malicious attempt to distort the facts, which were consistently, transparently and readily available in professionally audited financial reports, recklessly disregards the truth.\" The Kennedy Center is a vast performing arts hub in Washington, D.C., with seven theaters and some 2,000 performances and events per year. On a tour of the center in March, Trump said it was \"in tremendous disrepair,\" and claimed \"bad management\" was the cause. Former Kennedy Center board chair David Rubenstein, top left, and former president Deborah Rutter, top right, pose during the 43rd Annual Kennedy Center Honors on May 21, 2021 with honorees Joan Baez, Garth Brooks, Debbie Allen, Dick Van Dyke, Midori Gotō.Paul Morigi/Getty Images/Getty Images North Americahide caption While Rutter did not address the president's allegation that the center was in \"disrepair\" in her statement, she responded to NPR via email, saying, \"Due to the limited and decreased funding from the federal government, there is a backlog of maintenance that has been prioritized to mirror the appropriated funding.\" She added \"This is true of federal buildings and properties in Washington and across the country.\" In 2021 the Smithsonian, another institution that receives federal funds,estimatedits deferred maintenance backlog at more than $1 billion. A House committee has approved aproposalfor an enormous budget increase for the Kennedy Center. It would allocate more than $250 million to the Center, most of which would go towards repairs. That's a sixfold increase from the roughly $40 million the center has received from Congress each year. In her statement, Rutter said that in each of her 10 years as president, the Kennedy Center's budget \"served as a blueprint for our operations and programming — standard and responsible practice in arts management.\" She noted that the budget was approved by Kennedy Center's board, which included appointees from Trump's first term as President. Trump appointed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to the Kennedy Center's board in 2020 and she still serves. At the time she was appointed, she was a member of Trump's legal team. Rutter continued, \"Perhaps those now in charge are facing significant financial gaps and are seeking to attribute them to past management.\" Asked about Grenell's claim of finding \"$26 million in phantom revenue,\" Rutter told NPR, \"We have no idea what they are referring to.\" The Kennedy Center claims previous leadership misled the board. In a statement, the center's current Chief Financial Officer, Donna Arduin, wrote, \"The former leadership built a broken budget with an operating deficit of 100 million dollars and a bottom-line deficit of 26 million dollars.\" Former board chair David Rubenstein refuted the allegation. \"With full transparency, the financial reports were reviewed and approved by the Kennedy Center's audit committee and full board as well as a major accounting firm,\" he wrote in a statement. Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center and thelayoffsthat followed under Grenell's leadership have angered many artists and led to canceled performances by people like actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens. A production of the Broadway musicalHamiltonwas also canceled. This week,the Kennedy Centerannouncedits 2025-2026 season, which includes the touring Broadway productions ofThe OutsidersandMoulin Rouge, the musicalFraggle Rock: Back to the Rock LIVEand performances by the New York City Ballet and the Martha Graham Dance Company. At Monday night's board dinner, Grenell mentioned the Kennedy Center productions ofLes MisérablesandPorgy and Bessand urged those in attendance \"to go out and buy tickets.\" Jennifer Vanasco edited this story.

    "title": "First FDA-cleared Alzheimer's blood test could make diagnoses faster, more accurate",
    "article_text": "Jon Hamilton The first Alzheimer's blood test cleared by the Food And Drug Administration is set to make diagnosis more accessible and accurate — and change the way doctors treat the disease.Westend61/Getty Imageshide caption A new blood test that detects a hallmark of Alzheimer's is poised to change the way doctors diagnose and treat the disease. The test, the first of its kind to beclearedby the Food and Drug Administration, is for people 55 and older who already have memory problems or other signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's. The results show whether the brain of a person with cognitive symptoms also has amyloid plaques, clumps of toxic proteins that build up in the spaces between brain cells. The presence of plaques in a person with cognitive symptoms usually confirms an Alzheimer's diagnosis. \"I think the blood test is going to really revolutionize the way people with Alzheimer's are cared for and diagnosed,\" saysDr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer at the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation. \"Primary care physicians will now have access to something that can give them a quicker read\" on whether a patient has Alzheimer's, saysMaria Carrillo, chief science officer of the Alzheimer's Association. One benefit of a readily-available blood test will be more accurate diagnoses, Fillit says, noting that currently, primary care doctors correctly diagnose patients only about 60% of the time. \"Specialty neurologists get it right like seventy, eighty percent of the time,\" He says. \"With the blood test, we can get it up to over 90%.\" APET scanis the gold standard for detecting the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's. But the technology is costly, and unavailable in many communities. Another option is to test fluid from a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that most doctors and patients tend to avoid. There are alreadylab-developed blood teststhat can signal the presence of amyloid. But the Lumipulse assay, made by the diagnostic company Fujirebio, is the first to receive marketing clearance from the FDA. Having such a test is likely to mean that many more people will be diagnosed when their symptoms are still mild, and potentially treatable. Asurveyfrom the Alzheimer's Association found that the vast majority of older Americans would take a blood test to find out if they have the disease. People who are diagnosed while still in the early stages of Alzheimer's may be eligible to receive one of the twoamyloid-reducing drugsnow on market. Lab-developed blood tests have been used primarily by researchers, or by specialists in large medical centers. The test cleared by the FDA is likely to attract a much broader audience. \"It's been through rigorous evaluation, and it provides guidance for prescribers on who's eligible and when the test should be provided,\" Carrillo says. The result should be more testing of people in rural or underserved areas. \"Blood tests have given us an opportunity to really democratize this kind of testing,\" Carrillo says. It also means that many more of the estimated7.2 million Americansthought to be living with Alzheimer's are likely to get a formal diagnosis. To help health health care providers counsel these individuals, the Alzheimer's Association is writing guidelines on how to speak to patients about the results of a blood test, what it means to live with the disease, and what the treatment options are. The guidelines are expected this summer. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "RFK Jr. calls WHO “moribund” amid US withdrawal; China pledges to give $500M",
    "article_text": "As the rest of the world signed a pandemic agreement, the US sent an abrasive video. China is poised to be the next big donor to the World Health Organization after Trump abruptly withdrew the US from the United Nations health agency on his first day in office, leavinga critical funding gapand leadership void. On Tuesday, Chinese Vice Premier Liu Guozhong said that China would give an additional $500 million to WHO over the course of five years. Liu made the announcement at the World Health Assembly (WHA) being held in Geneva. The WHA is the decision-making body of WHO, comprised of delegations from member states, which meet annually to guide the agency's health agenda. “The world is now facing the impacts of unilateralism and power politics, bringing major challenges to global health security,\" Liu told the WHA,according to The Washington Post. \"China strongly believes that only with solidarity and mutual assistance can we create a healthy world together.\" This year, China sent its largest-ever delegation—180—to the WHA, while the US was absent,according to Health Policy Watch. The increased involvement and large donation are seen as clear examples that China is working to take the place of the US. Although the US has cut all ties with the WHO—and reportedly still owes the agency $260 million in 2024–2025 dues—US health secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made an unexpected appearance at the WHA viaa six-minute video. In the abrasive, pre-recorded speech, Kennedy described the WHO as \"moribund\" and \"mired in bureaucratic bloat [and] entrenched paradigms.\" \"WHO's priorities have increasingly reflected the biases and interests of corporate medicine,\" Kennedy said, alluding to hisanti-vaccine and germ-theory denialist views. He chastised the health organization for allegedly capitulating to China and working with the country to \"promote the fiction that COVID originated in bats.\" Kennedy ended the short speech by touting his Make America Healthy Again agenda. He also urged the WHO to undergo a radical overhaul similar to what the Trump administration is currently doing to the US government—presumably including dismantling and withholding funding from critical health agencies and programs. Last, he pitched other countries to join the US in abandoning the WHO. \"I would like to take this opportunity to invite my fellow health ministers around the world into a new era of cooperation.... we're ready to work with you,\" Kennedy said. Meanwhile, the WHA embraced collaboration. During the assembly this week, WHO overwhelmingly voted to adopt the world's first pandemic treaty, aimed at collectively preventing, preparing for, and responding to any future pandemics. The treaty took over three years to negotiate, but in the end, no country voted against it—124 votes in favor, 11 abstentions, and no objections. (The US, no longer being a member of WHO, did not have a vote.) \"The world is safer today thanks to the leadership, collaboration and commitment of our Member States to adopt the historic WHO Pandemic Agreement,”WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. “The Agreement is a victory for public health, science and multilateral action. It will ensure we, collectively, can better protect the world from future pandemic threats. It is also a recognition by the international community that our citizens, societies and economies must not be left vulnerable to again suffer losses like those endured during COVID-19.” Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "I helped a lost dog’s AirTag ping its owner: An ode to replaceable batteries",
    "article_text": "The most repair-friendly device Apple makes needs to stick with coin batteries. Out of all the books I read for my formal education, one bit, from one slim paperback, has lodged the deepest into my brain. William Blundell'sThe Art and Craft of Feature Writingoffers a \"selective list of what readers like.\" It starts with a definitive No. 1: \"Dogs, followed by other cute animals and well-behaved small children.\" People, Blundell writes, are your second-best option, providing they are doing or saying something interesting. I have failed to provide Ars Technica readers with a dog story during nearly three years here. Today, I intend to fix that. This is a story about a dog, but also a rare optimistic take on a ubiquitous \"smart\" product, one that helped out a very good girl. Note: The images in this post are not of the aforementioned dog, so as to protect their owner's privacy. TheHumane Rescue Allianceof Washington, DC, provided photos of adoptable dogs with some resemblance to that dog. My wife and I were sitting with our dog on our front porch on a recent weekend morning. We were drinking coffee, reading, and enjoying DC's tiny window for temperate spring weather. I went inside for a moment; when I came back, my dog was inside, but my wife was not. Confused, I cracked open the door to look out. A dog, not my own, stuck its nose into the door gap, eager to sniff me out. \"There's a dog here?\" my wife said, partly to herself. \"She just ran up on the porch. I have no idea where she came from.\" I secured my dog inside, then headed out to meet this fast-moving but friendly interloper. She had a collar, but no leash, and looked well-groomed, healthy, and lightly frantic. The collar had a silicone band on it, holding one of Apple's AirTags underneath. I pulled out the AirTag, tapped it against my phone, and nothing happened. While my wife posted on our neighborhood's various social outlets (Facebook, Nextdoor, and a WhatsApp group for immediate neighbors), I went into the garage and grabbed aCR2032 battery. That's not something everyone has, but I have a few AirTags, along witha bit of a home automation habit. After some pressing, twisting, andreplacing, the AirTag beeped and returned to service. I tapped the AirTag against my phone, this time receiving a link to a webpage with the tag's serial number and the last four digits of its owner's phone number. I had not yet needed to actually find something truly lost with an AirTag, so I looked uphow it worked. Once you set an AirTag in your Apple account to \"Lost\" status, you can then choose to have a full phone number and message appear to anybody who taps it with their device (iOS or Android). If you don't know that your AirTag or Find-My-compatible item is missing and mark it that way, you can't preemptively have it offer up details. Maybe Apple should change that, for certain kinds of tracking. I had to leave the house, leaving my wife to negotiate space and sight lines between our concerned, confused dog and this excited newcomer. The local animal control encouraged my wife to monitor social channels before dropping the dog off at their facility. After two hours of unexpected fostering, we were anxiously texting one another. We were glad to have gotten this dog off the street and into a home with leashes and a crate available, but we had to make a decision before the animal shelter closed for the day. Then the doorbell rang. The dog's owner, led by the AirTag, asked if we had her dog. She explained how the dog got loose and pledged to keep a fresh battery in there from now on. My wife said goodbye to her temporary charge, and I came home to find both her and my dog far more relaxed. Maybe the dog's owner would have seen postings on Facebook or Nextdoor, though I cannot blame anybody who doesn't want those networks in their life. Perhaps a neighborhood phone chain would have come through, or the shelter could have connected us. But Apple's coin battery-powered nub came through in the nick of time, and I'm grateful. I was working at iFixit whenrumors circulatedabout Apple developing a \"Tile-like\" item tracker in early 2019. The teardown and communications teams at iFixit were largely expecting Apple to release another tiny product that was impossible to fix or have its batteries swapped, filling the gaps in landfills alongsideAirPods. Tile, one of the first in the Bluetooth tracking market, hadintroduced replaceable batteriesa few months prior. But Apple, at that pointstill defending its butterfly MacBook keyboardsandholding tight to Lightning ports, seemed unlikely to go the way of the common denominator. But Apple chose wisely. Afteraddressingsome of theearly concernsabout their potential misuses (though others remain), AirTags have become very handy devices. Some dog owners go for GPS tracker collars, which might fare better in rural areas. But it's a good bet that somebody with an iPhone will get close enough to your dog—or wallet, or keys—to update its location. Even if they don't have an iPhone to provide a location ping, they can get some information on who owns this tag. Apple is seeminglygearing up to offer a new AirTag, one with purportedly greater range and fewer avenues for privacy-invading misuse. I humbly request that the new model continue to be powered by a coin cell battery. When something important goes missing—especially something that likes ear scritches and pumpkin treats—it is best not to have to find a charging cable or magnetic charging pad, or discover the cells inside are dead. Coin cells are not perfectly recyclable, because nothing really is, but they're generally much easier to handle thanlithium-ion waste. I have AirTags on my family's bikes, keys, wallets, and a couple other things. Depending on what the next AirTag looks like, I'm keen to get one on my dog's collar, too. Take the battery warnings seriously, and they can help some wayward good boys and girls. And I hope they made this human, telling a story about coin batteries, momentarily interesting.

    "title": "Trump admin tells Supreme Court: DOGE needs to do its work in secret",
    "article_text": "DOJ complains of \"sweeping, intrusive discovery\" after DOGE refused FOIA requests. The Department of Justice today asked the Supreme Court to block a ruling that requires DOGE to provide information about its government cost-cutting operations as part of court-ordered discovery. President Trump's Justice Department sought an immediate halt to orders issued by US District Court for the District of Columbia. US Solicitor General John Sauer argued that the Department of Government Efficiency is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as a presidential advisory body and not an official \"agency.\" The district court \"ordered USDS [US Doge Service] to submit to sweeping, intrusive discovery just to determine if USDS is subject to FOIA in the first place,\"Sauer wrote. \"That order turns FOIA on its head, effectively giving respondent a win on the merits of its FOIA suit under the guise of figuring out whether FOIA even applies. And that order clearly violates the separation of powers, subjecting a presidential advisory body to intrusive discovery and threatening the confidentiality and candor of its advice, putatively to address a legal question that never should have necessitated discovery in this case at all.\" The nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed FOIA requests seeking information about DOGE andsuedafter DOGE officials refused to provide the requested records. US District Judge Christopher Cooper has so far sided with CREW. Cooperdecidedin March that \"USDS is likely covered by FOIA and that the public would be irreparably harmed by an indefinite delay in unearthing the records CREW seeks,\" ordering DOGE \"to process CREW's request on an expedited timetable.\" DOGE then asked the district court for a summary judgment in its favor, and CREW responded by filing a motion for expedited discovery \"seeking information relevant to whether USDS wields substantial authority independent of the President and is therefore subject to FOIA.\" In an April 15order, Cooper ruled that CREW is entitled to limited discovery into the question of whether DOGE is wielding authority sufficient to bring it within the purview of FOIA. Cooper hasn't yet ruled on the motion for summary judgment. \"The structure of USDS and the scope of its authority are critical to determining whether the agency is 'wield[ing] substantial authority independently of the President,'\" the judge wrote. \"And the answers to those questions are unclear from the record.\" Trump's executive orders appear to support CREW's argument by suggesting \"that USDS is exercising substantial independent authority,\" Cooper wrote. \"As the Court already noted, the executive order establishing USDS 'to implement the President's DOGE Agenda' appears to give USDS the authority to carry out that agenda, 'not just to advise the President in doing so.'\" Not satisfied with the outcome, the Trump administration tried to get Cooper's ruling overturned in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The appeals courtruled against DOGElast week. The appeals court temporarily stayed the district court order in April, but dissolved the stay on May 14 and denied the government's petition. \"The government contends that the district court's order permitting narrow discovery impermissibly intrudes upon the President's constitutional prerogatives,\" the appeals court said. But \"the discovery here is modest in scope and does not target the President or any close adviser personally. The government retains every conventional tool to raise privilege objections on the limited question-by-question basis foreseen here on a narrow and discrete ground.\" A three-judge panel at the appeals court was unswayed by the government's claim that this process is too burdensome. \"Although the government protests that any such assertion of privilege would be burdensome, the only identified burdens are limited both by time and reach, covering as they do records within USDS's control generated since January 20,\" the ruling said. \"It does not provide any specific details as to why accessing its own records or submitting to two depositions would pose an unbearable burden.\" Yesterday, the District Courtset a discovery schedulerequiring the government to produce all responsive documents within 14 days and complete depositions within 24 days. In its petition to the Supreme Court today, the Trump administration argued that DOGE's recommendations to the president should be kept secret: The district court's requirement that USDS turn over the substance of its recommendations—even when the recommendations were \"purely advisory\"—epitomizes the order's overbreadth and intrusiveness. The court's order compels USDS to identify every \"federal agency contract, grant, lease or similar instrument that any DOGE employee or DOGE Team member recommended that federal agencies cancel or rescind,\" and every \"federal agency employee or position that any DOGE employee or DOGE team member recommended\" for termination or placement on administrative leave. Further, USDS must state \"whether [each] recommendation was followed.\" It is difficult to imagine a more grievous intrusion and burden on a presidential advisory body. Providing recommendations is the core of what USDS does. Because USDS coordinates with agencies across the Executive Branch on an ongoing basis, that request requires USDS to review multitudes of discussions that USDS has had every day since the start of this Administration. And such information likely falls within the deliberative-process privilege almost by definition, as internal executive-branch recommendations are inherently \"pre-decisional\" and \"deliberative.\" The US further said the discovery \"is unnecessary to answer the legal question whether USDS qualifies as an 'agency' that is subject to FOIA,\" and is merely \"a fishing expedition into USDS's advisory activities under the guise of determining whether USDS engages innon-advisory activities—an approach to discovery that would be improper in any circumstance.\" CREW, like others that have sued the government over DOGE's operations, says the entity exercises significant power without proper oversight and transparency. DOGE \"has worked in the shadows—a cadre of largely unidentified actors, whose status as government employees is unclear, controlling major government functions with no oversight,\" CREW's lawsuit said. \"USDS has provided no meaningful transparency into its operations or assurances that it is maintaining proper records of its unprecedented and legally dubious work.\" The Trump administration is fighting numerous DOGE-related lawsuits at multiple levels of the court system. Earlier this month, the administrationasked the Supreme Courtto restore DOGE's access to Social Security Administration records after losing on the issue in both a district court and appeals court. That request to the Supreme Court is pending. There was also a dispute over discovery when 14 states sued the federal government over Trump \"delegat[ing] virtually unchecked authority to Mr. Musk without proper legal authorization from Congress and without meaningful supervision of his activities.\" A federal judgeruledthat the states could serve written discovery requests on Musk and DOGE, but the DC Circuit appeals courtblocked the discovery order. In that case, appeals court judges said the lower-court judge should have ruled on a motion to dismiss before allowing discovery.

    "title": "“Microsoft has simply given us no other option,” Signal says as it blocks Windows Recall",
    "article_text": "Even after its refurbishing, Recall provides few ways to exclude specific apps. Signal Messenger is warning the users of its Windows Desktop version that the privacy of their messages is under threat by Recall, the AI tool rolling out in Windows 11 that will screenshot, index, and store almost everything a user does every three seconds. Effective immediately, Signal for Windows will by default block the ability of Windows to screenshot the app. Signal users who want to disable the block—for instance to preserve a conversation for their records or make use of accessibility features for sight-impaired users—will have to change settings inside their desktop version to enable screenshots. “Although Microsoft made several adjustments over the past twelve months in response to critical feedback, the revamped version of Recall still places any content that’s displayed within privacy-preserving apps like Signal at risk,” Signal officialswrote Wednesday. “As a result, we are enabling an extra layer of protection by default on Windows 11 in order to help maintain the security of Signal Desktop on that platform even though it introduces some usability trade-offs. Microsoft has simply given us no other option.” When Recall was introduced in May 2024, security and privacy practitioners quickly warned that it created undue risks for both Windows users and those using other platforms who interact with Windows users. Many of the criticisms were based on specific designs. Recall was turned on by default. Screenshots and OCR data were stored in plaintext, where it could be accessed by any app with user system rights. It provided few granular tools to limit the type of content that was sucked into its massive vacuum bag of data. After facing one of its worst PR disasters in recent memory, Microsoft pulled Recall out of Windows 11 previews a few months after adding it. Then, last month, Microsoft reintroduced a significantly overhauled version of the tool. As Ars Senior Technology Reporter Andrew Cunninghampainstakingly documenteda few weeks later, the refurbished Recall went to great lengths to correct some of the poorly thought-through designs in the first iteration. Recall was now opt-in, rather than on by default. The database storing Recall data was now encrypted, with the keys secured in a secure enclave separate from Windows. And the tool now provided some level of user control to limit the type of content it indexed. But the changes go only so far in limiting the risks Recall poses. As Ipointed out, when Recall is turned on, it indexes Zoom meetings, emails, photos, medical conditions, and—yes—Signal conversations, not just with the user, but anyone interacting with that user, without their knowledge or consent. Researcher Kevin Beaumont performed his owndeep-dive analysisthat also found that some of the new controls were lacking. For instance, Recall continued to screenshot his payment card details. It also decrypted the database with a simple fingerprint scan or PIN. And it's unclear whether the type of sophisticated malware that routinely infects consumer and enterprise Windows users will be able to decrypt encrypted database contents. And as Cunningham also noted, Beaumont found that Microsoft still provided no means for developers to prevent content displayed in their apps from being indexed. That left Signal developers at a disadvantage, so they had to get creative. With no API for blocking Recall in the Windows Desktop version, Signal is instead invoking an API Microsoft provides for protecting copyrighted material. App developers can turn on the DRM setting to prevent Windows from taking screenshots of copyrighted content displayed in the app. Signal is now repurposing the API to add an extra layer of privacy. “We hope that the AI teams building systems like Recall will think through these implications more carefully in the future,” Signal wrote Wednesday. “Apps like Signal shouldn’t have to implement ‘one weird trick’ in order to maintain the privacy and integrity of their services without proper developer tools. People who care about privacy shouldn’t be forced to sacrifice accessibility upon the altar of AI aspirations either.” Signal's move will lessen the chances of Recall permanently indexing private messages, but it also has its limits. The measure only provides protection when all parties to a chat—at least those using the Windows Desktop version—haven't changed the default settings. Microsoft officials didn’t immediately respond to an email asking why Windows provides developers with no granular control over Recall and whether the company has plans to add any.

    "title": "Scientists figure out how the brain forms emotional connections",
    "article_text": "Neural recordings track how neurons link environments to emotional events. Whenever something bad happens to us, brain systems responsible for mediating emotions kick in to prevent it from happening again. When we get stung by a wasp, the association between pain and wasps is encoded in the region of the brain called the amygdala, which connects simple stimuli with basic emotions. But the brain does more than simple associations; it also encodes lots of other stimuli that are less directly connected with the harmful event—things like the place where we got stung or the wasps’ nest in a nearby tree. These are combined into complex emotional models of potentially threatening circumstances. Till now, we didn’t know exactly how these models are built. But we’re beginning to understand how it’s done. “Decades of work has revealed how simple forms of emotional learning occurs—how sensory stimuli are paired with aversive events,” says Joshua Johansen, a team director at the Neural Circuitry of Learning and Memory at RIKEN Center for Brain Science in Tokyo. But Johansen says that these decades didn’t bring much progress in treating psychiatric conditions like anxiety and trauma-related disorders. “We thought if we could get a handle of more complex emotional processes and understand their mechanisms, we may be able to provide relief for patients with conditions like that,” Johansen claims. To make it happen, his team performed experiments designed to trigger complex emotional processes in rats while closely monitoring their brains. Johansen and Xiaowei Gu, his co-author and colleague at RIKEN, started by dividing the rats into two groups. The first “paired” group of rats was conditioned to associate an image with a sound. The second “unpaired” group watched the same image and listened to the same sound, but not at the same time. This prevented the rats from making an association. Then, one day later, the rats were shown the same image and treated with an electric shock until they learned to connect the image with pain. Finally, the team tested if the rats would freeze in fear in response to the sound. The “unpaired” group didn’t. The rats in the “paired” group did—it turned out human-like complex emotional models were present in rats as well. Once Johansen and Gu confirmed the capacity was there, they got busy figuring out how it worked exactly. “Behaviorally, we measured freezing responses to the directly paired stimulus, which was the image, and inferred stimulus which was the sound,” Johansen says. “But we also performed something we called miniscope calcium imaging.” The trick relied on injecting rats with a virus that forced their cells to produce proteins that fluoresce in response to increased levels of calcium in the cells. Increased levels of calcium are the telltale sign of activity in neurons, meaning the team could see in real time which neurons in rats’ brains lit up during the experiments. It turned out that the region crucial for building these complex emotional models was not the amygdala, but the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which had a rather specialized role. “The dmPFC does not form the sensory model of the world. It only cares about things when they have emotional relevance,” Johansen explains. He said there wasn’t much change in neuronal activity during the sensory learning phase, when the animals were watching the image and listening to the sound. The neurons became significantly more active when the rats received the electric shock. In the “unpaired” group, the active neurons that held the representations of the electric shock and the image started to overlap. In the “paired” group, this overlap also included the neuronal representation of the sound. “There was a kind of an associative bundle that formed,” Johansen says. After Johansen and Gu pinpointed the neurons that formed those associative bundles, they started looking at how each of these components works. In the first step, the team identified the dmPFC neurons that sent output to the amygdala. Then they selectively inhibited those neurons and exposed the rats from the “paired” group to the image and the sound again. The result of disconnecting the dmPFC neurons from the amygdala was that rats exhibited a fear response to the image but no longer feared the sound. “It seems like the amygdala can form the simple representations on its own but requires input from the dmPFC to express more complex, inferred emotions,” Johansen says. But there are still a lot of unanswered questions left. The next thing the team wants to take a closer look at is the process that enables the brain to tie an aversive stimulus, like the shock, to one that was not active during the aversive event. In the “paired” group of rats, some multi-sensory neurons responding to both auditory and visual stimuli apparently got recruited. “We haven’t worked that out yet,” Johansen says. \"This is a very novel type of mechanism.” Another thing is that the emotional model Johansen and Gu induced in rats was relatively simple. In the real world, especially in humans, we can have many different aversive outcomes tied to the same triggers. A single location could be where you got stung by a wasp, attacked by a dog, robbed of your wallet, and dumped by your significant other—all different aversive representations with myriad inferred, indirect stimuli to go along with them. “Does the dmPFC combine all those representations into sort of a single, overlapping representation? Or is it a really rich environment that bundles different aversive experiences with the individual aspects of these experiences?” Johansen asked. “This is something we want to test more.” Nature, 2025.  DOI:10.1038/s41586-025-09001-2 Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "The physics of frilly Swiss cheese “flowers”",
    "article_text": "Tête de Moine is often served by scraping the top of a cheese wheel in a circular motion with a special tool. Cheese connoisseurs are no doubt familiar with a particular kind of semi-hard Swiss cheese called \"Tête de Moine.\" Rather than spreading or slicing the cheese, Tête de Moine is usually served by scraping the top of the cheese wheel in a circular motion using a specialized tool called a Girolle. This produces elegant thin shavings known as rosettes, since they resemble a frilly flower. The method is both aesthetically pleasing and serves to enhance the aromas and mouth feel of the cheese, according to the authors of anew paperpublished in the journal Physical Review Letters (PRL). This group of physicists based in Paris noted a marked similarity between the frilly edges of those cheese flowers and certain leaves, fungi, corals, and even torn plastic sheets—all formed by different mechanisms. So naturally the physicists decided to conduct their own research to determine the underlying mechanism(s) for the delicate frills of Tête de Moine shavings. Tête de Moine translates as \"monk's head,\" and the name dates back to the 1790s, although the actual cheese originates back to a 12th-century Bellelay monastery in Switzerland. It's made from raw unpasteurized cow's milk and is matured for a minimum of 75 days on spruce boards and boasts a firm reddish-brown crust. The Girolle (named after the French word for chanterelles, which have a similar rosette shape) is a more recent innovation, invented in 1982 specifically for Tête de Moine by a man named Nicolas Crevoisier. It's just a round wooden plate with a pin stuck vertically in the middle—the better to skewer one's cheese wheel—and a crank handle to control the slicing blade. For their experiments, the authors of the PRL paper selected samples of Monk's head cheese wheels from the Fromagerie de Bellelay brand that had been aged between three and six months. They cut each cheese wheel in half and mounted each half on a Girolle, motorizing the base to ensure a constant speed of rotation and making sure the blade was in a fixed position. Their measurements of how the cheese deformed during scraping enabled them to build a model based on metal dynamics on a two-dimensional surface that had \"cheese-like properties.\" The results showed that there was a variable friction between the core and the edge of the cheese wheel, because the core stayed fresher during the ripening process. Because the harder outer edge had lower friction with the blade, the edges of the cheese shavings were uneven in thickness—hence the resemblance to frilly rosettes. This essentially amounts to a new shaping mechanism with the possibility of being able to one day program complex shaping from \"a simple scraping process,\" per the authors. \"Our analysis provides the tools for a better control of flower chip morphogenesis through plasticity in the shaping of other delicacies, but also in metal cutting,\" they concluded. Granted, \"flower-shaped chips have never been reported in metal cutting. But even in such uniform materials, the fact that friction properties control the metric change is particularly interesting for material shaping.\" Physical Review Letters, 2025.

    "title": "Google pretends to be in on the joke, but its focus on AI Mode search is serious",
    "article_text": "The future of search comes at you fast. MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.—Google used to be all about the 10 blue links, but that was then, and this is now. You have to scroll farther than ever to get to the links in Google search results, and now this trend is being taken to itsultimate conclusion. At I/O, the company has announced a major expansion of AI Mode search, which heralds a new era for its signature product. There are big changes coming, some of which will start rewriting the web sooner than you think. The past several years at Google have been marked by an all-consuming obsession with generative AI. It has invaded your search results as AI Overviews, but Google has made it clear at I/O 2025 that AI Overviews was just practice. AI Mode is thegame. Everyone at Google is acutely aware of this shift—at the end of the I/O keynote, CEO Sundar Pichai showed a cheeky AI counter graphic that tracked how many times speakers had mentioned \"AI\" and \"Gemini.\" But Google is serious about AI in general and AI search in particular. To that end, the AI Mode search thatdebuted a few months agoas a Labs experiment is graduating to the main Google search page for everyone, and it'savailable to everyone. It's not the default way of searching the web, but it seems like only a matter of time before that happens. According to Pichai, people search more and enter longer, more complex queries in AI Mode, which is exactly the kind of search AI is good at handling. As AI Mode increasingly takes over the search experiences, you'll notice some new features. AI Mode is running a customized version of Gemini 2.5, and Google wants the answers generated by it to be relevant to the person asking. The best way to do that, it would seem, is to pipe some of your personal data into AI Mode. That's starting with support for Gmail, which allows AI Mode to adjust based on things like booking emails and online purchase receipts. Google is careful to point out you can enable and disable this feature at any time, and AI Mode will indicate when it's using your personal context. Google is the world's largest advertising entity, but search is what fuels the company. Quarter after quarter, Google crows about increasing search volume—it's the most important internal metric for the company. Google has made plenty of changes to its search engine results pages (SERPs) over the years, but AI mode throws that all out. It doesn't have traditional search results no matter how far you scroll. To hear Google's leadership tell it, AI Mode is an attempt to simplify finding information. According to Liz Reid, Google's head of search, the next year in search is about going from information to intelligence. When you are searching for information on a complex issue, you probably have to look at a lot of web sources. It's rare that you'll find a single page that answers all your questions, and maybe you should be using AI for that stuff. The challenge for AI search is to simplify the process of finding information, essentially doing the legwork for you. When speaking about the move to AI search, DeepMind CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu says that search is the greatest product in the world, and if AI makes it easier to search for information, that's a net positive. Latency is important in search—people don't like to wait for things to load, which is why Google has always emphasized the speed of its services. But AI can be slow. The key, says Reid, is to know when users will accept a longer wait. For example, AI Overviews is designed to spit out tokens faster because it's part of the core search experience. AI Mode, however, has the luxury of taking more time to \"think.\" If you're shopping for a new appliance, you might do a few hours of research. So an AI search experience that takes longer to come up with a comprehensive answer with tables, formatting, and background info might be a desirable experience because it still saves you time. As part of Google's AI Mode rollout, it's previewing some upcoming features, includingshopping results(Google likes money, after all) and Deep Search. The latter is a more \"agentic\" take on search, using the same fan-out technique as standard AI Mode but taken to the extreme. By gathering more data, Google predicts expert-level reports on your most complex search queries. It will take longer to create a result, but for some searches, that may still save you time. This feature is still in testing, but Google suggests we could see it roll out later this year. AI Mode is adopting an agentic take on search, moving Google closer to its goal of deploying AI that has human-like capabilities—artificial general intelligence, or AGI. That kind of system could theoretically answer any question you have by poking around the web much faster than you ever could. Google co-founder Sergey Brin isn't shy about predicting the future, noting during an I/O talk that he believes Gemini will become the world's first AGI before 2030. There's a long way to go before we get there, and Google's leadership is upfront about that. According to DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, it's still far too easy to find the gaps in today's AI systems. Even the best generative AI gets simple things wrong at random. We've all seen that when an AI hallucinates a person or piece of media or screws up simple arithmetic. According to Hassabis, identifying errors in an AGI should take a team of data scientists months. Currently, anyone can trip up AI in minutes. Hassabis slightly disagrees with Brin on the timeline for AGI, but not by much. He thinks Gemini will be something we could call AGI in the early 2030s. Whether Google's AI search actually saves you time right now is heavily dependent on what you need to know. But as the company expands AI, you're probably going to see more robots talking to you and fewer search results. We can only hope that we are getting closer to the AGI future envisioned by Hassabis and Brin before Google puts the blue links even more out of reach.

    "title": "Apple legend Jony Ive takes control of OpenAI’s design future",
    "article_text": "$6.5B acquisition of Ive's firm puts him in charge of moving OpenAI \"beyond screens.\" On Wednesday, OpenAIannouncedthat former Apple design chief Jony Ive and his design firm LoveFrom will take over creative and design control at OpenAI. The deal makes Ive responsible for shaping the future look and feel of AI products at the chatbot creator, extending across all of the company's ventures, including ChatGPT. Ive was Apple's chief design officer for nearly three decades, where he led the design of iconic products including the iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and Apple Watch, earning numerous industry awards and helping transform Apple into the world's most valuable company through his minimalist design philosophy. \"Thrilled to be partnering with jony, imo the greatest designer in the world,\"tweetedOpenAI CEO Sam Altman while sharing a 9-minute promotional video touting the personal and professional relationship between Ive and Altman. Ive left Apple in 2019 to found LoveFrom, a design firm that has worked with companies including Ferrari, Airbnb, and luxury Italian fashion firm Moncler. The mechanics of the Ive-OpenAI deal are slightly convoluted. At its core, OpenAI will acquire Ive's company \"io\" in an all-equity deal valued at $6.5 billion—Ive founded io last year to design and develop AI-powered products. Meanwhile, io's staff of approximately 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists, and product development specialists will become part of OpenAI. Meanwhile, Ive's design firm LoveFrom will continue to operate independently, with OpenAI becoming a customer of LoveFrom, while LoveFrom will receive a stake in OpenAI. The companies expect the transaction to close this summer pending regulatory approval. In some ways, the deal is no big surprise. Ive's design firm and Altman have beenworking ona new devicefor two yearsthat aims to create an AI-focused consumer electronics device. The collaboration reportedly focuses on creating devices that will reduce screen time, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke toThe Wall Street Journal. The project has so far experimented with options including headphones and devices with cameras. While Ive made his reputation designing physical products at Apple, he also took on more software responsibilities toward the end of his tenure. At OpenAI, his work will extend across future versions of ChatGPT, audio features, apps, and other products. A big part of marketing the deal has focused on the reported friendship between Altman and Ive. In a statementpublishedon OpenAI's website, Altman said he hopes the team-up can “bring some of the delight, wonder and creative spirit that I first felt using an Apple Computer 30 years ago.” (Altman once told Ars Technica that his first computer was aMacintosh LC II, introduced in 1992.) The former Apple designer shared a similar sentiment that reached into his long and storied history as an industrial designer. “I have a growing sense that everything I have learned over the last 30 years has led me to this moment,\" said Ive.

    "title": "Incredible shrinking clownfish beats the heat",
    "article_text": "Shrinking down to size boosted clownfish survival rates up to 78 percent during heat waves. Pixar'sFinding Nemoimmortalized the colorfulclownfish, with its distinctive orange body and white stripes, in the popular imagination. Clownfish, like many other species, are feeling the stress of rising temperatures and other environmental stressors. Fortunately, they have a superpower to cope: They can shrink their body size during dangerous heat waves to substantially boost their odds of survival, according to anew paperpublished in the journal Science Advances. “This is not just about getting skinnier under stressful conditions; these fish are actually getting shorter,\"said co-author Melissa Versteeg, a graduate student at Newcastle University. \"We don’t know yet exactly how they do it, but we do know that a few other animals can do this too.\" Many vertebrates have showngrowth declinein response to environmental stressors, especially higher temperatures. Marine iguanas, for example, reabsorb some of their bone materialto shrinkwhen their watery habitat gets warmer, while young salmonhave been knownto shrink at winter's onset. This can also happen when there is less food available. And social factors can also influence growth. When female meerkats, for example, are dominant, they havegrowth spurts, while a disruption in their social status can causestunted growthin malecichlids What has been lacking in prior research is an investigation into how environmental and social factors interact to influence growth rates, according to Versteeg et al. They thought clownfish were the best species to study to fill that gap, since they've been extensively studied and are well understood. The fish live on Indo-Pacific coral reefs where heat stress has been increasing and has become more severe—an environment that is close to the thermal tolerance limits of clownfish. Clownfish also live in social groups: They form breeding pairs with a dominant female and subdominant male, sometimes adding subordinate non-breeding fish. The dominants tend to grow to match the size of the host anemone, while the subordinates only grow to a size that ensures there are sufficient resources—otherwise they risk being evicted and likely dying. The team observed 67 breeding pairs of wild clownfish—briefly caught and photographed for distinctive markings and measured before being returned to the water—living on single anemones in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, between February and August 2023. This happened to coincide with the world'sfourth global bleaching event. They measured the body size of the fish once a month and measured the temperature around the individual anemones every four to six days. Then the team analyzed the collected data. The results: Over the course of those months, 101 of the 134 clownfish shrank at least once in response to heat stress, and doing so boosted their likelihood of survival up to 78 percent compared to the 33 fish that did not shrink. And between breeding pairs, there were distinctive growth ratios between the dominant and subordinate fish; those pairs that shrank together were also more likely to survive the heat waves. “We were so surprised to see shrinking in these fish that, to be sure, we measured each fish individual repeatedly over a period of five months,\"said Versteeg. \"In the end, we discovered it was very common in this population. It was a surprise to see how rapidly clownfish can adapt to a changing environment, and we witnessed how flexibly they regulated their size, as individuals and as breeding pairs, in response to heat stress as a successful technique to help them survive.” Versteeg et al. have not yet identified a possible mechanism for the shrinkage, but suggest the triggering of neuroendocrine pathways via thyroid hormones might play a role, since those hormones regulate growth. The adaptive strategy could also be a means of adjusting to changing metabolic needs. But there are trade-offs: While shrinking in response to heat waves ensures greater survivability, there can also be a corresponding decrease in birth rates. \"Our findings show that individual fish can shrink in response to heat stress, which is further impacted by social conflict, and that shrinking can lead to improving their chances of survival,\"said senior author Theresa Rueger, also of Newcastle University. \"If individual shrinking were widespread and happening among different species of fish, it could provide a plausible alternative hypothesis for why the size of many fish species is declining, and further studies are needed in this area.” Science Advances, 2025.

    "title": "Verizon tries to get out of merger condition requiring it to unlock phones",
    "article_text": "Verizon wants to escape promises it made in exchange for merger and spectrum. Verizon petitioned the Trump administration to let it lock phones to its network for longer periods of time, making it harder for customers to switch to other carriers. There are two rules that require Verizon to unlock phones more quickly than other major carriers. Verizon agreed to both rules and gained significant benefits in return—first in 2008 when itpurchased licensesto use 700 MHz spectrum that came withopen access requirementsand in 2021 when it agreed tomerger conditionsin order to obtain approval for itspurchase of TracFone. The Biden-era Federal Communications Commission last yearproposeda 60-day unlocking requirement that would apply to all wireless providers, which would have made AT&T and T-Mobile follow the same unlocking timeframe as Verizon. But now that the FCC is chaired by Republican Brendan Carr, it's looking to eliminate telecom regulations instead of making them stricter. Verizon sees this as an opening to seek an end to its unlocking obligations. Carr opened a so-called \"Delete, Delete, Delete\" proceeding in order to identify rules that should be scrapped. Verizonsubmitted commentslast month asking for deletion of the locking rules and followed up this week with aformal requestto waive the rules \"until such time as the Commission decides on an appropriate industry-wide approach for the unlocking of wireless devices.\" Verizon argues that unlocking phones encourages theft and is bad for customers. \"The Unlocking Rule applies only to particular providers—mainly Verizon—and distorts the marketplace in a critical US industry,\" the Verizon petition said. \"The rule has resulted in unintended consequences that harm consumers, competition, and Verizon, while propping up international criminal organizations that profit from fraud, including device trafficking of subsidized devices from the United States. These bad actors target and harm American consumers and US carriers like Verizon for their own profit, by diverting unlocked trafficked devices to consumers in foreign countries.\" Verizon also said that after it bought TracFone, there was \"a sharp increase in the number of TracFone devices that deactivated before making enough payments for Verizon to recover the subsidy on the device.\" With FCC Republicans backingDOGE-style changes, Verizon name-dropped Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency in its petition. The unlocking rule is \"the perfect example of the type of rule that the Commission should eliminate as part of the Department of Government Efficiency's Deregulatory Initiative,\" Verizon said. During Trump's first term, the FCC granted Verizon apartial waiverallowing it to lock phones for 60 days to fight fraud. Verizon claims 60 days isn't enough, and it wants to lock phones for at least six months. \"Recent industry experience shows that even a lock of 60 days does not deter device fraud—a huge and growing problem in the United States—and instead enables trafficking in devices that are illicitly sent to foreign marketplaces. This is why the industry standard for providers not subject to the Unlocking Rule is a minimum of 6 months or longer,\" Verizon's petition said. Verizon said the FCC spectrum rules it agreed to in 2008 were based on concerns related to net neutrality and open access that are no longer relevant. \"The concerns about the nascent wireless broadband and smartphone marketplace that animated the adoption of that rule—such as new iPhones being designed to work exclusively on one provider's network or restrictive 'walled gardens' for applications—no longer apply today,\" Verizon said. \"It is past time for the Commission's experiment with the Unlocking Rule to end, because today's wireless marketplace bears little resemblance to the one that existed when the rule was adopted, and the rule harms consumers, competition, and Verizon.\" Former FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, who served under President Biden, didn't agree that the rules were outdated. In the November 2021 approval of Verizon's TracFone purchase, Rosenworcel's FCC required Verizon to extend its 60-day unlocking policy to devices sold by TracFone that use the 700 MHz spectrum. TracFone previously had a 12-month locking policy. Rosenworcel later proposed that a similar rule be applied to all major carriers. \"You bought your phone, you should be able to take it to any provider you want,\" Rosenworcel said in July 2024, when she proposed extending the 60-day period to the rest of the industry. A nationwide standard of 60 days \"is in the best interest of consumers and competition,\" she said. Rosenworcel's proposal would have required carriers to unlock each phone 60 days after activation unless a carrier determines a handset was purchased through fraud. The FCC voted 5–0 to seek comment on Rosenworcel's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. While Carr joined that vote, Verizon is hopeful that his push to eliminate regulations will include the 60-day unlocking rules. \"[T]he Unlocking Rule is an outdated regulation that has become both burdensome and harmful—precisely the kind of regulation that the current Administration is focused on rescinding in the public's interest,\" Verizon's waiver request said.

    "title": "Paris Agreement target won’t protect polar ice sheets, scientists warn",
    "article_text": "Calls for a more ambitious climate goal are rising as Earth hits several tipping points. This article originally appeared onInside Climate News, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment. Sign up for their newsletterhere. Sea levels in some parts of the world could be rising by as much as 8 to 12 inches per decade within the lifetime of today’s youngest generations, outpacing the ability of many coastal communities to adapt, scientists warned in a new study published this week. Theresearchby an international team of sea level and polar ice experts suggests that limiting warming to 2.7° Fahrenheit (1.5° Celsius) above the pre-industrial temperature—the Paris Climate Agreement’s target—isn’t low enough to prevent a worst-case meltdown of Earth’s polar ice sheets. A better target for maintaining a safe climate, at least for the long term, might be closer to 1.8° Fahrenheit, said Durham University geographer and glacier expertChris Stokes, a co-author of the new paper. “There have been a couple of quite high-profile papers recently, including a synthesis in Nature looking atsafe planetary boundaries,” he said. “They made the argument that 1° Celsius is a better goal. And a couple of other papers have come out suggesting that we need a stricter temperature limit or a long-term goal. And I think the evidence is building towards that.” It’s not a new argument, he said, noting that climate research predating the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 1990 already highlighted the high risks of more than 1° C of warming. “Those studies were saying, ‘We’re warming. We really don’t want to go past 1°. We really don’t want to exceed 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide,’” he said. “Because we know what could happen looking at past warm periods and at simple calculations of ice sheet mass balance. And, you know, 30 years later, 40 years later, here we are seeing the problem.” Scientific calls for a more ambitious long-term climate goal are rising just as Earth’s average global temperature has breached the Paris Agreement target of 1.5° C of warming over the pre-industrial level nearly every consecutive month for the past two years. Atmospheric carbon dioxide has reached a concentration of430 ppm, a 50 percent increase over pre-industrial levels. But missing those goals doesn’t diminish the importance of potentially revising the target, for which the Paris Agreement includes a review mechanism, Stokes said. Even if the global temperature overshoots the 1.5° mark, it’s important to know for the long term how much it would have to be lowered to return to a safe climate range. The new study focused on how melting polar ice masses drives sea level rise by combining evidence from past warm periods that were similar to the present, measurements of how much ice is being lost under the present level of warming, and projections of how much ice would be lost at different warming levels over the next few centuries. Sea level rise of several inches per decade would likely overwhelm adaptation efforts by many coastal communities in the US, said co-author Andrea Dutton, a geoscientist and sea level expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “Coastal communities that are adapting to and preparing for future sea level rise are largely adapting to the amount of sea level rise that has already occurred,” she said. In a best-case scenario, she added, they are preparing for sea level rise at the current rate of a few millimeters per year, while the research suggests that rate will double within decades. The last time atmospheric carbon dioxide was at a concentration similar to now was in themid-Pliocene warm period, just over 3 million years ago, when average global sea level rose 35 to 70 feet higher than today over the course of thousands of years. But the current rate of warming is far faster than any other time identified in the geological record. How the ice sheets will respond to warming at that speed is not clear, but nearly every new study in the past few decades has shown changes in the Arctic happening faster than expected. The United States’ ability to prepare for sea level rise is also profoundly threatened by the cuts to federal science agencies and staffing, Dutton said. The current cuts to science research, the retraction of funds already promised to communities through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the abandonment of the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment, and changes to federal rules on air pollution “collectively threaten our ability to project future sea level rise, to prepare our communities, and to mitigate climate change and stem the rate at which sea-level is rising,” she said via email. Many researchers are working closely with coastal communities, but as federal grants continue to get cut, these collaborations will founder, she added. “The ice sheets won’t care what different political parties ‘believe’ about climate change,” she said. “Like it or not, they are simply at the mercy of rising temperatures.” The mass of ice lost from the polar ice sheets has quadrupled since the 1990s, and they are currently losing around 370 billion metric tons of ice per year, said co-authorJonathan Bamber, a physicist at the University of Bristol who focuses on studying how Earth’s frozen regions interact with the rest of the climate system. “We switched on some new technology 30 years ago, and we discovered that the ice sheets are responding with a large amplitude and rather rapidly,” he said. The extent of the changes to the ice sheet are much greater than models had ever suggested they would be, he noted. “That was a bit of a shock for the whole community.” Most of the climate models of the past three decades projected only about half as much melting as has actually been observed during that time, he said. That suggests the “safe operating zone for humanity is about 350 ppm” of atmospheric carbon dioxide, corresponding to about 1° C of warming. “I think we’ve known for a long time that we’re interfering with the climate system in a very dangerous way,” he said. “And one of the points of our paper is to demonstrate that one part of the climate system, the ice sheets, are showing some very disturbing signals right now.” Some of the most vulnerable places are far from any melting ice sheets, including Belize City, home to about 65,000 people, where just 3 feet of sea level rise would swamp 500 square miles of land. In some low-lying tropical regions around the equator, sea level is rising three times as fast as the global average. That’s because the water is expanding as it warms, and as the ice sheets melt, their gravitational pull is reduced, allowing more water to flow away from the poles toward the equator. “At low latitudes, it goes up more than the average,” Bamber said. “It’s bad news for places like Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, and the Nile Delta.” Global policymakers need to be more aware of the effects of a 1.5° C temperature increase, Ambassador Carlos Fuller, long-time climate negotiator for Belize, said of the new study. Belize already moved its capital inland, but its largest city will be inundated at just 1 meter of sea-level rise, he said. “Findings such as these only sharpen the need to remain within the 1.5° Paris Agreement limit, or as close as possible, so we can return to lower temperatures and protect our coastal cities,” Fuller said. While the new study is focused on ice sheets, Durham University’s Stokes notes that recent research shows other parts of the Earth system are already at, or very near, tipping points that are irreversible on a timescale relevant to human civilizations. That includes changes to freshwater systems and ocean acidification. “I think somebody used the analogy that it’s like you’re wandering around in a dark room,” he said. “You know there’s a monster there, but you don’t know when you’re going to encounter it. It’s a little bit like that with these tipping points. We don’t know exactly where they are. We may have even crossed them, and we do know that we will hit them if we keep warming.” Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Brembo develops brakes with almost no brake dust and less wear",
    "article_text": "Called \"Greentell,\" the brakes and pads feature a laser metal deposition coating. As electric vehicles reduce car exhaust as a source of particulate emissions, people are increasingly focusing on other vehicular sources of pollution that won't go away with electrification. Tires are one of them, particularly as we grapple with overweight EVs with tire-shredding torque. And brakes are another—even an EV with regenerative braking will occasionally need to use its friction brakes, after all. Over in Europe, the people responsible for writing regulations have taken this into consideration with theupcoming Euro 7 standard, which sets new limits on 10- and2.5-micron particulate emissionson all new vehicles—including EVs—starting next year. And to help OEMs achieve that target, Brembo has developed a new brake and pad set called Greentell that it says cuts brake dust emissions by 90 percent, improving durability in the process. \"We started 10 years ago to investigate a different solution. The main topic that we had in mind was to develop a disk that is greener than the current production of cast iron,\" said Fabiano Carminati, VP of disc technical development at Brembo. The solution had to be feasible for mass-market applications, not just as a specialty product. \"For the first time, we apply this technology in a huge volume, not like just a niche, but in a high-volume product,\" he told me. \"Greentell is the best compromise from a green point of view and [for] performance because the direct pleasure of the end user is a must for us,\" he said. \"So the goal is to find a coupling that mix[es] the best driving pleasure with the best green product. Green means low emission and green process. It was a really, really difficult challenge for us. We invested a lot of time; we invested a lot of money.\" Brembo investigated a range of solutions before settling on using laser metal deposition. Physical vapor deposition, as used as a durability coating for wristwatches and firearms, was ruled out due to cost. \"So it can be used for some special application or some small pieces, but when you are speaking about 20 kilos of cast iron, PVD is not the right solution. LMD is a technology that [has been] available... [for] years, but [it hasn't yet been] applicable in a high volume application. So the goal is to find the best compromise between performance and process,\" Carminati told me. Together with the reduction in brake dust, there's an 80 percent reduction in surface corrosion compared to conventional brakes, but they won't last forever. \"The thickness of the layer that we apply is not so high—we apply just 100–120 microns. That means that the disk is not a lifetime disk,\" he said. That said, Greentell brakes should need replacing less often, and while that's not entirely in Brembo's best financial interests, neither is not being able to offer its customers a Euro 7-compliant product. Here in the US, with no such legislation to drive the use of low-emission brakes, Carminati thinks we might see Greentell brakes show up in performance cars, where heavy brake wear is a fact of life and having the brake dust cleaned off the side of one's supercar is one of life's little chores.

    "article_text": "FLP02 has a throwback facade but can fit a thoroughly modern PC inside. SilverStone's first '80s throwback PC case started life asan April Fools' joke, but the success ofthe FLP01was apparently serious enough to merit a follow-up. The company brought another beige case to the Computex trade show this week, the vertically oriented FLP02 (via Tom's Hardware). If the original horizontally oriented FLP01 case called to minda 386-era Compaq Deskpro, the FLP02 is a dead ringer for the kind of case you might have gotten for a generic 486 or early Pentium-era PC. That extends to havinga Turbo buttonbuilt into the front—on vintage PCs, this button could actually determine how fast the processor was allowed to run, though here, it's actually a fan speed control instead. A lock on the front also locks the power switch in place to keep it from being flipped off accidentally, something else real vintage PCs actually did. Despite its retro facade, the FLP02 is capable of fitting in even higher-end modern PC parts than the original FLP01. Front USB-A and USB-C ports are hidden behind a magnetic door on the front of the case, and its faux-5.25-inch floppy drives are just covers for drive bays that you could use for an optical drive or extra front I/O. On the inside, the case can fit full-size ATX motherboards and up to a 360 mm radiator for CPU cooling, andmodern high-end GPUs like theGeForce RTX 5090or5080should be able to fitinside. SilverStone says the FLP02 will ship in Q3 or Q4 of this year and that US buyers should be able to get it for $220. You can, of course, buy a modern high-end PC case for much less money.

If you ask the man who has largely shaped how friends and family connect on social media over the past two decades about the future of social media, you may not get a straight answer. At the Federal Trade Commission's monopoly trial, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg attempted what seemed like an artful dodge to avoid criticism that his company allegedly bought out rivals Instagram and WhatsApp to lock users into Meta's family of apps so they would never post about their personal lives anywhere else. Hetestifiedthat people actually engage with social media less often these days to connect with loved ones, preferring instead to discover entertaining content on platforms to share in private messages with friends and family. As Zuckerberg spins it, Meta no longer perceives much advantage in dominating the so-called personal social networking market where Facebook made its name and cemented what the FTC alleged is an illegal monopoly. \"Mark Zuckerberg says social media is over,\" a New Yorker headline said about this testimony in areportnoting a Meta chart that seemed to back up Zuckerberg's words. That chart, shared at the trial, showed the \"percent of time spent viewing content posted by 'friends'\" had declined over the past two years, from 22 to 17 percent on Facebook and from 11 to 7 percent on Instagram. Supposedly because of this trend, Zuckerberg testified that \"it doesn't matter much\" if someone's friends are on their preferred platform. Every platform has its own value as a discovery engine, Zuckerberg suggested. And Meta platforms increasingly compete on this new playing field against rivals like TikTok, Meta argued, while insisting that it's not so much focused on beating the FTC's flagged rivals in the connecting-friends-and-family business, Snap and MeWe. But while Zuckerberg claims that hosting that kind of content doesn't move the needle much anymore, owning the biggest platforms that people use daily to connect with friends and family obviously still matters to Meta, MeWe founder Mark Weinstein told Ars. And Meta's own press releases seem to back that up. Weeks ahead of Zuckerberg's testimony, Meta announced that it would bring back the \"magic of friends,\" introducing a \"friends\" tab to Facebook to make user experiences more like the original Facebook. The company intentionally diluted feeds with creator content and ads for the past two years, but it now appears intent on trying to spark more real conversations between friends and family, at least partly to fuel its newly launched AI chatbots. Those chatbots mine personal information shared on Facebook and Instagram, and Meta wants to use that data to connect more personally with users—but \"in a very creepy way,\" The Washington Postwrote. In interviews, Zuckerberg has suggested these AI friends could \"meaningfully\" fill the void of real friendship online, as the average person has only three friends but\"has demand\"for up to 15. To critics seeking to undo Meta's alleged monopoly, this latest move could signal a contradiction in Zuckerberg's testimony, showing that the company is so invested in keeping users on its platforms that it's now creating AI friends (wh0 can never leave its platform) to bait the loneliest among us into more engagement. \"The average person wants more connectivity, connection, than they have,\" Zuckerberg said, hyping AI friends. For the Facebook founder, it must be hard to envision a future where his platforms aren't the answer to providing that basic social need. All this comes more than a decade after he sought $5 billion in Facebook's 2012 initial public offering so that he could keep building tools that he told investors would expand \"people's capacity to build and maintain relationships.\" At the trial, Zuckerberg testified that AI and augmented reality will be key fixtures of Meta's platforms in the future, predicting that \"several years from now, you are going to be scrolling through your feed, and not only is it going to be sort of animated, but it will be interactive.\" Meta declined to comment further on the company's vision for social media's future. In a statement, a Meta spokesperson told Ars that \"the FTC’s lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" claiming that it threatens US leadership in AI and insisting that evidence at trial would establish that platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and X are Meta's true rivals. \"More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" Meta's spokesperson said. \"Regulators should be supporting American innovation rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI.” Weinstein, the MeWe founder, told Ars that back in the 1990s when the original social media founders were planning the first community portals, \"it was so beautiful because we didn't think about bots and trolls. We didn't think about data mining and surveillance capitalism. We thought about making the world a more connected and holistic place.\" But those who became social media overlords found more money in walled gardens and increasingly cut off attempts by outside developers to improve the biggest platforms' functionality or leverage their platforms to compete for their users' attention. Born of this era, Weinstein expects that Zuckerberg, and therefore Meta, will always cling to its friends-and-family roots, no matter which way Zuckerberg says the wind is blowing. Meta \"is still entirely based on personal social networking,\" Weinstein told Ars. In a Newsweekop-ed, Weinstein explained that he left MeWe in 2021 after \"competition became impossible\" with Meta. It was a time when MeWefaced backlashover lax content moderation, drawing comparisons between its service and right-wing apps like Gab or Parler. Weinstein rejected those comparisons, seeing his platform as an ideal Facebook rival and remaining a board member through the app's more recent shift to decentralization. Still defending MeWe's failed efforts to beat Facebook, he submitted hundreds of documents and was deposed in the monopoly trial, alleging that Meta retaliated against MeWe as a privacy-focused rival that sought to woo users away by branding itself the \"anti-Facebook.\" Among his complaints, Weinstein accused Meta of thwarting MeWe's attempts to introduce interoperability between the two platforms, which he thinks stems from a fear that users might leave Facebook if they discover a more appealing platform. That’s why he's urged the FTC—if it wins its monopoly case—to go beyond simply ordering a potential breakup of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp to also require interoperability between Meta's platforms and all rivals. That may be the only way to force Meta to release its clutch on personal data collection, Weinstein suggested, and allow for more competition broadly in the social media industry. \"The glue that holds it all together is Facebook’s monopoly over data,\" Weinstein wrote in a Wall Street Journalop-ed, recalling the moment he realized that Meta seemed to have an unbeatable monopoly. \"Its ownership and control of the personal information of Facebook users and non-users alike is unmatched.\" Cory Doctorow, a special advisor to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Ars that his vision of a better social media future goes even further than requiring interoperability between all platforms. Social networks like Meta's should also be made to allow reverse engineering so that outside developers can modify their apps with third-party tools without risking legal attacks, he said. Doctorow said that solution would create \"an equilibrium where companies are more incentivized to behave themselves than they are to cheat\" by, say, retaliating against, killing off, or buying out rivals. And \"if they fail to respond to that incentive and they cheat anyways, then the rest of the world still has a remedy,\" Doctorow said, by having the choice to modify or ditch any platform deemed toxic, invasive, manipulative, or otherwise offensive. Doctorow summed up the frustration that some users have faced through the ongoing\"enshittification\" of platforms(a term he coined) ever since platforms took over the Internet. \"I'm 55 now, and I've gotten a lot less interested in how things work because I've had too many experiences with how things fail,\" Doctorow told Ars. \"And I just want to make sure that if I'm on a service and it goes horribly wrong, I can leave.\" Weinstein pointed out that Meta's alleged monopoly impacts a group often left out of social media debates: non-users. And if you ask someone who hates social media what the future of social media should look like, they will not mince words: They want a way to opt out of all of it. As Meta's monopoly trial got underway, a personalblog posttitled \"No Instagram, no privacy\" rose to the front page of Hacker News, prompting adiscussionabout social media norms and reasonable expectations for privacy in 2025. In the post, Wouter-Jan Leys, a privacy advocate, explained that he felt \"blessed\" to have \"somehow escaped having an Instagram account,\" feeling no pressure to \"update the abstract audience of everyone I ever connected with online on where I am, what I am doing, or who I am hanging out with.\" But despite never having an account, he's found that \"you don’t have to be on Instagram to be on Instagram,\" complaining that \"it bugs me\" when friends seem to know \"more about my life than I tell them\" because of various friends' posts that mention or show images of him. In his blog, he defined privacy as \"being in control of what other people know about you\" and suggested that because of platforms like Instagram, he currently lacked this control. There should be some way to \"fix or regulate this,\" Leys suggested, or maybe some universal \"etiquette where it’s frowned upon to post about social gatherings to any audience beyond who already was at that gathering.\" On Hacker News, his post spurred a debate over one of the longest-running privacy questions swirling on social media: Is it OK to post about someone who abstains from social media? Some seeming social media fans scolded Leys for being so old-fashioned about social media, suggesting, \"just live your life without being so bothered about offending other people\" or saying that \"the entire world doesn't have to be sanitized to meet individual people's preferences.\" Others seemed to better understand Leys' point of view, with one agreeing that \"the problem is that our modern norms (and tech) lead toeveryonesharingeverythingwith a large social network.\" Surveying the lively thread, another social media hater joked, \"I feel vindicated for my decision to entirely stay off of this drama machine.\" Leys told Ars that he would \"absolutely\" be in favor of personal social networks like Meta's platforms dying off or losing steam, as Zuckerberg suggested they already are. He thinks that the decline in personal post engagement that Meta is seeing is likely due to a combination of factors, where some users may prefer more privacy now after years of broadcasting their lives, and others may be tired of the pressure of building a personal brand or experiencing other \"odd social dynamics.\" Setting user sentiments aside, Meta is also responsible for people engaging with fewer of their friends' posts. Meta announced that it woulddouble the amount of force-fed fillerin people's feeds on Instagram and Facebook starting in 2023. That's when the two-year span begins that Zuckerberg measured in testifying about the sudden drop-off in friends' content engagement. So while it's easy to say the market changed, Meta may be obscuring how much it shaped that shift. Degrading the newsfeed and changing Instagram's default post shape from square to rectangle seemingly significantly shifted Instagram social norms, for example, creating an environment where Gen Z users felt less comfortable posting as prolifically as millennials did when Instagram debuted, The New Yorkerexplainedlast year. Where once millennials painstakingly designed immaculate grids of individual eye-catching photos to seem cool online, Gen Z users told The New Yorker that posting a single photo now feels \"humiliating\" and like a \"social risk.\" But rather than eliminate the impulse to post, this cultural shift has popularized a different form of personal posting: staggered photo dumps, where users wait to post a variety of photos together to sum up a month of events or curate a vibe, the trend piece explained. And Meta is clearly intent on fueling that momentum, doubling the maximum number of photos that users can feature in a single post to encourage even more social posting, The New Yorker noted. Brendan Benedict, an attorney for Benedict Law Group PLLC who has helpedlitigate big tech antitrust cases, is monitoring the FTC monopoly trial on a Substack calledBig Tech on Trial. He told Ars that the evidence at the trial has shown that \"consumers want more friends and family content, and Meta is belatedly trying to address this\" with features like the \"friends\" tab, while claiming there's less interest in this content. Leys doesn't think social media—at least the way that Facebook defined it in the mid-2000s—will ever die, because people will never stop wanting social networks like Facebook or Instagram to stay connected with all their friends and family. But he could see a world where, if people ever started truly caring about privacy or \"indeed [got] tired of the social dynamics and personal brand-building... the kind of social media like Facebook and Instagram will have been a generational phenomenon, and they may not immediately bounce back,\" especially if it's easy to switch to other platforms that respond better to user preferences. He also agreed that requiring interoperability would likely lead to better social media products, but he maintained that \"it would still not get me on Instagram.\" Meta thought it may have already beaten the FTC's monopoly case, filing for a motion for summary judgment after the FTC rested its case in a bid to end the trial early. That dream was quickly dashed when the judge denied the motion days later. But no matter the outcome of the trial, Meta's influence over the social media world may be waning just as it's facing increasing pressure to open up its platforms more than ever. The FTC has alleged that Meta weaponized platform access early on, only allowing certain companies to interoperate and denying access to anyone perceived as a threat to its alleged monopoly power. That includes limiting promotions of Instagram to keep users engaged with Facebook Blue. A primary concern for Meta (then Facebook), the FTC claimed, was avoiding \"training users to check multiple feeds,\" which might allow other apps to \"cannibalize\" its users. \"Facebook has used this power to deter and suppress competitive threats to its personal social networking monopoly. In order to protect its monopoly, Facebook adopted and required developers to agree to conditional dealing policies that limited third-party apps’ ability to engage with Facebook rivals or to develop into rivals themselves,\" the FTC alleged. By 2011, the FTC alleged, then-Facebook had begun terminating API access to any developers that made it easier to export user data into a competing social network without Facebook's permission. That practice only ended when the UK parliament started calling out Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct toward app developers in 2018, the FTC alleged. According to the FTC, Meta continues \"to this day\" to \"screen developers and can weaponize API access in ways that cement its dominance,\" and if scrutiny ever subsides, Meta is expected to return to such anticompetitive practices as the AI race heats up. One potential hurdle for Meta could be that the push for interoperability is not just comingfrom the FTCor lawmakers who recently reintroduced bipartisanlegislationto end walled gardens. Doctorow told Ars that \"huge public groundswells of mistrust and anger about excessive corporate power\" that \"cross political lines\" are prompting global antitrust probes into big tech companies and are perhaps finally forcing a reckoning afteryears of degrading popular productsto chase higher and higher revenues. For social media companies, mounting concerns about privacy and suspicions about content manipulation or censorship are driving public distrust, Doctorow said, as well as fears of surveillance capitalism. The latter includes theories that Doctorow is skeptical of. Weinstein embraced them, though, warning that platforms seem to be profiting off data without consent while brainwashing users. Allowing users to leave the platform without losing access to their friends, their social posts, and their messages might be the best way to incentivize Meta to either genuinely compete for billions of users or lose them forever as better options pop up that can plug into their networks. In his Newsweek op-ed, Weinstein suggested that web inventor Tim Berners-Lee has already invented a working protocol \"to enable people to own, upload, download, and relocate their social graphs,\" which maps users' connections across platforms. That could be used to mitigate \"the network effect\" that locks users into platforms like Meta's \"while interrupting unwanted data collection.\" At the same time, Doctorow told Ars that increasingly popular decentralized platforms like Bluesky and Mastodon already provide interoperability and are next looking into \"building interoperable gateways\" between their services. Doctorow said that communicating with other users across platforms may feel \"awkward\" at first, but ultimately, it may be like \"having to find the diesel pump at the gas station\" instead of the unleaded gas pump. \"You'll still be going to the same gas station,\" Doctorow suggested. Opening up gateways into all platforms could be useful in the future, Doctorow suggested. Imagine if one platform goes down—it would no longer disrupt communications as drastically, as users could just pivot to communicate on another platform and reach the same audience. The same goes for platforms that users grow to distrust. The EFF supports regulators' attempts to pass well-crafted interoperability mandates, Doctorow said, noting that \"if you have to worry about your users leaving, you generally have to treat them better.\" The FTC has alleged that \"Facebook’s dominant position in the US personal social networking market is durable due to significant entry barriers, including direct network effects and high switching costs.\" Meta disputes the FTC's complaint as outdated, arguing that its platform could be substituted by pretty much any social network. However, Guy Aridor, a co-author of a recentarticlecalled \"The Economics of Social Media\" in the Journal of Economic Literature, told Ars that dominant platforms are probably threatened by shifting social media trends and are likely to remain \"resistant to interoperability\" because \"it’s in the interest of the platform to make switching and coordination costs high so that users are less likely to migrate away.\" For Meta, research shows its platforms' network effects have appeared to weaken somewhat but \"clearly still exist\" despite social media users increasingly seeking content on platforms rather than just socialization, Aridor said. Interoperability advocates believe it will make it easier for startups to compete with giants like Meta, which fight hard and sometimes seemingly dirty to keep users on their apps. Reintroducing the ACCESS Act, which requires platform compatibility to enable service switching, Senator Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) said that \"interoperability and portability are powerful tools to promote innovative new companies and limit anti-competitive behaviors.\" He's hoping that passing these \"long-overdue requirements\" will \"boost competition and give consumers more power.\" Aridor told Ars it's obvious that \"interoperability would clearly increase competition,\" but he still has questions about whether users would benefit from that competition \"since one consistent theme is that these platforms are optimized to maximize engagement, and there’s numerous empirical evidence we have by now that engagement isn’t necessarily correlated with utility.\" Consider, Aridor suggested, how toxic content often leads to high engagement but lower user satisfaction, as MeWe experienced during its 2021 backlash. Aridor said there is currently \"very little empirical evidence on the effects of interoperability,\" but theoretically, if it increased competition in the current climate, it would likely \"push the market more toward supplying engaging entertainment-related content as opposed to friends and family type of content.\" Benedict told Ars that a remedy like interoperability would likely only be useful to combat Meta's alleged monopoly following a breakup, which he views as the \"natural remedy\" following a potential win in the FTC's lawsuit. Without the breakup and other meaningful reforms, a Meta win could preserve the status quo and see the company never open up its platforms, perhaps perpetuating Meta's influence over social media well into the future. And if Zuckerberg's vision comes to pass, instead of seeing what your friends are posting on interoperating platforms across the Internet, you may have a dozen AI friends trained on your real friends' behaviors sending you regular dopamine hits to keep you scrolling on Facebook or Instagram. Aridor's team's article suggested that, regardless of user preferences, social media remains a permanent fixture of society. If that's true, users could get stuck forever using whichever platforms connect them with the widest range of contacts. \"While social media has continued to evolve, one thing that has not changed is that social media remains a central part of people’s lives,\" his team's article concluded.

    "title": "Toyota debuts all-new RAV4 with hybrid and PHEV powertrains only",
    "article_text": "New software platform enables Toyota Safety Sense 4.0 and better infotainment. An all-new version of Toyota's bestselling RAV4 crossover debuted last night. For generation six, Toyota North America is going all-electrified, with hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains on offer. And while the RAV4 isn't quite a software-defined vehicle as we understand the term, it features an all-new software platform tying everything together. Toyota has grouped the various RAV4 configurations into three groups: core, rugged, and sport. And there are three different powertrain options: front-wheel drive hybrid, all-wheel drive hybrid, and all-wheel drive PHEV, although some trims are only available in certain configurations. Front-wheel drive hybrid RAV4s feature a 226 hp (168 kW) 2.5 L engine, with all-wheel drive hybrid models offering a slight increase at 236 hp (176 kW). The PHEV generates a combined 320 hp (239 kW), and Toyota says it can go 50 miles (80 km) on a single charge. Better efficiency is thanks in part to the adoption of more efficient silicon carbide inverters, although the battery has also increased in capacity. Certain trims (Woodland, XSE) even offer the ability to DC fast-charge the PHEV, which Toyota says takes 30 minutes to go from 10–80 percent state of charge. Because I am predictable, the one that interests me most is the new GR Sport trim. Only available as an all-wheel drive PHEV, it has an interesting microsuede interior (also available on the XSE) and tuned suspension and steering, and I'm curious to know if the driving experience matches its looks. The Woodland trim is also all-new. This clads the RAV4 in some protective bodywork and raises the ride height a little—this version is about an inch bigger all around than the other 2026 models, the rest of which are the same sizeas the outgoing version. Only available with all-wheel drive, this is the spec to go for if you plan to spend lots of time away from the blacktop. Toyota's new software platform is called Arene. While it doesn't run the entire vehicle, it does handle the advanced driver assistance systems and infotainment. To keep the occupants protected, the new RAV4 features Toyota Safety Sense 4.0, the newest version of the automaker's suite of ADAS features. The infotainment is said to have a better HMI, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard features. Toyota says the 2026 RAV4 will go on sale later this year, with pricing announced closer to that time. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "AMD’s $299 Radeon RX 9060 XT brings 8GB or 16GB of RAM to fight the RTX 5060",
    "article_text": "New midrange RDNA 4 GPUs launch starting on June 5, just weeks after RTX 5060. AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070were fairly well received when they were released in March, ably competing with Nvidia'sRTX 5070andRTX 5070 Tifor the same or a little less money. We were impressed by the cards' performance and power efficiency, even if they still have some of the same caveats as older Radeon cards (lack of DLSS upscaling and lower relative ray-tracing performance being two). Today AMD is formally expanding its family of RDNA 4 graphics cards with the Radeon RX 9060 XT, a GPU that will go up against Nvidia's RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti GPUs. These GPUs have just half the compute units of the RX 9070 XT, but at $299 and $349 for 8GB and 16GB configurations, they ought to be decent options for 1080p or entry-level 1440p gaming PCs (with the eternal \"if you can find them\" caveat that comes with buying a GPU in 2025). AMD says the new GPUs will be available starting on June 5th from the typical range of partners—AMD released renders of a reference GPU design, but sometimes these are starting points that manufacturers can take or leave, rather than products AMD intends to manufacture and sell itself. Per usual, AMD has priced the cards competitively with Nvidia's offerings, but not so aggressively as to totally undercut the GeForce cards. The 8GB variant of the card is priced against Nvidia's $299 RTX 5060, where the 16GB version attempts to undercut the $429 RTX 5060 Ti. Adding more RAM won't improve performance across the board in all games, but it ought to improve things disproportionately at 1440p, and it seems like AAA games are bumping up their RAM requirements all the time. AMD didn't provide much by way of performance comparisons, but it's promising that the cards have the same number of compute units as AMD's last-generation RX 7600 series. AMD says that RDNA 4 compute units are much faster than those used for RDNA 3, particularly in games with ray-tracing effects enabled. This helped make the Radeon RX 9070 cards generally as fast or faster than the RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT series, despite having around two-thirds as many compute units. Sticking with 32 CUs for the 9060 series isn't exciting on paper, but we should still see a respectable generation-over-generation performance bump. The RX 7600 series, by contrast, provideda pretty modest performance improvementcompared to 2022's Radeon RX 6650 XT. AMD says that the cards' total board power—the amount of power the entire graphics card, including the GPU itself, RAM, and other components—starts at 150 W for the 8GB card and 160 W for the 16GB card, with a maximum TBP of 182 W. That's a shade higher than but generally comparable to the RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti, and (depending on where actual performance ends up) quite a bit more efficient than the RX 7600 series. This partly comes down to a more efficient 4nm TSMC manufacturing process, a substantial upgrade from the 6nm process used for the 7600 series. It's unusual for a GPU maker to define a TBP range—more commonly we're just given a single default value. But this is in line with new settings we observed in our RX 9070 review; AMD officially supports a range of different user-selectable TBP numbers in its Catalyst driver package, and some GPU makers were shipping cards that used higher TBPs by default. Higher power limits can increase performance, though usually the performance increase is disproportionately small compared to the increase in power draw. These power limits should also generally mean that most 9060 XTs can be powered with a single 8-pin power connector, rather than using multiple connectors or the 12-pin 12VHPWR/12V-2x6 connector.

    "title": "Google Beam Hands-On: The Most Lifelike 3D Video Calling That Didn’t Totally Blow Me Away",
    "article_text": "AfterAndroid XR smart glasses, I was most excited to try outGoogle Beam, a shrunken and commercialized version ofProject Starline 3Dvideo calling booth that Google has been plugging away at over the past couple of years. Seemingly everyone who has tried Project Starline has told me how mind-blowing it is to video call with someone inside of what’s essentially a glasses-free 3D TV, and feel like they’re really sitting in front of them. I finally got the opportunity to try the technology atGoogle I/O 2025âit’s impressive, but it’s far from some perfect replication of the person you’re talking with. Let me just repeat myself so there’s no confusion: that Google can replicate a person from a bunch of 2D videos that are then stitched together into 3D using a custom AI neural network is nothing short of wizardry. The 3D person inside of the screen really feels as if they’re sitting across the table. In my demo, which was actually using the older Project Starline setup and not the more compact one HP is making, a friendly guy named Jerome, who said he was being streamed from Seattle, Wash. to my screen in Mountain View, Calif., reached out to hand me an apple that was in his hand, and I instinctively tried to grab it. A few beats later, when he told me the demo was over, we high-fivedâI, again, did it without much thought. All the while, during our 1-2 minute convo, we made eye contact, smiled, and laughed, as if we were together IRL. It was all very… normal. Ridiculously short as my demo was, the limitations of the current version of 3D video calling technology were immediately obvious as soon as I sat down in front of the TV “booth.” When Jerome appeared on the screen, I could see that the 3D render of him was jittering very slightly. The entire time, I could see the slightly horizontal jitters as he moved around. The closest thing I can compare it to is like slightly jittery TV scanlinesâbut it was something that I noticed right away and became fixated on. Another limitation is the camera tracking and viewing angleâit only really works looking at it dead center. Whenever I shifted my chair to the left or right, Jerome’s picture darkened and became distorted. Even with an 8K resolution, the light field display still looked grainy. I also noticed that if you try to “look around” the other person’s body, there’s nothing there. It’s just… empty particle-like space. That makes sense because Beam/Starline’s cameras are only capturing the front and parts of a person’s sides, not back angles. If you’ve ever seen the back of a person’s portrait mode photo (see below), you’ll know there’s just no captured data back there. This is too cool: iPhone Portrait mode…exploded into depth layerspic.twitter.com/oA8FicilWG — Ray Wong (@raywongy)November 22, 2018 I’m also suspicious as hell about how well Beam works in less-than-optimal lighting. The room I was in had nicely diffused lighting. I suspect that the image quality might be greatly degraded with dimmer lighting. There would probably be some real noticeable image noise. I should also note that my chat with Jerome was actually my second demo. My first demo was with a guy named Ryan. The experience was equally as brief, but Starline crashed and his image froze, and I had to be transferred to Jerome. Prototypes! Sure, Zoom calls can freeze up too, but you know what doesn’t freeze up? Real-life conversations in person. Because these units were Project Starline onesâthe cameras and speaker modules were attached to the sides of the screen instead of built into themâthere’s no way to know whether Google Beam is a more polished product or not. I really expected to have my mind blown like everyone else, but because it felt so natural, the whole experience didn’t quite make me freak out. And I’m known for freaking out when some new technology seems amazing. Maybe that’s a blessing in disguiseâthere’s no shock factor (not for me, at least), which means the Beam/Starline technology has done its job (mostly) getting out of the way to allow for genuine communication.

    "title": "Southwest Airlines Will Require Passengers to Keep Portable Chargers Out During Flights",
    "article_text": "Southwest Airlines announced it will require all portable device chargers to be kept in plain sight during all flights while they’re in use. The new policy comes after a number of lithium-ion batteries fires on flights worldwide inrecent years. The new policy will start May 28 and will require all Southwest passengers to make sure they don’t have any portable chargers, including power banks and cell phone battery charging cases, in overhead bins or even just inside a bag in under the seat in front of them, while they’re in use. “Using portable charging devices while stored in a bag or overhead bin will no longer be permitted,” the airline told Gizmodo in an emailed statement. “Nothing is more important to Southwest than the Safety of its Customers and Employees.” The airline told Gizmodo that it’s okay to keep your portable charger in your carry-on bag if itâs not connected to anything else. But any charger in active use, including one that may be connected to the phone in the form of a case, should be kept visible for the entire flight. The TSA already bans rechargeable and non-rechargeable lithium batteries for phones and laptops from checked baggage. Carry-on baggage is fine, but Southwest Airlines will soon require those chargers to be outside of all bags and visible while in use during the duration of the flight. It’s unclear if other U.S.-based airlines will follow Southwest’s lead, but other airlines around the world have also been cracking down on lithium-ion batteries in an effort to fight fire hazards. As theAssociated Pressnotes, Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways both already prohibit the use of portable chargers on all flights. And Korean Airlines also bans portable chargers from overhead bins. The average U.S. passenger brings four different rechargeable devices with them on a flight, according to theUL Standards & Engagementresearch group, with the most common devices being smartphones (82%), laptops (41%), wireless headphones (39%), and tablets (36%). The most common incidents were caused by vaping devices, which accounted for 35% of all incidents on flights in 2023, while power banks accounted for 16% of all incidents reported. “Flight crews are trained to recognize and respond to lithium battery fires in the cabin,” the FAA explains on its website. “Passengers should notify flight crew immediately if their lithium battery or device is overheating, expanding, smoking or burning.” Indeed. If you see something on fire on your flight, battery or otherwise, please let the flight crew know. That’s just generally a good idea.

    "title": "Epic Universe’s Best Ride Might Just Come From the Dark Universe",
    "article_text": "The portal into a whole world of gods and monsters has been opened atEpic Universe,Orlando, Florida’s newesttheme park. The Universal Monsters reign supreme at the Dark Universe, where you explore the world of Darkmoor that just so happens to be the place where so many ofUniversal Studios’classic horror films intersect. io9 was thrilled to be among the first to ride its main attraction:Monsters Unchained: The Frankenstein Experiment. At the center of the action is the Frankenstein Manor, where Victoria Frankenstein resides and continues the mad work of her ancestor Victor. She’s built a new monster prototype and aims to capture the horrors of the icons of fright. Under her watch she’s got the Phantom of the Opera, the Creature From the Black Lagoon, and more with the help of her Frankenstein she aims to dominate Dracula. What transpires is an awesome and action-packed thrill ride into the monster mash of your dreams if you’re a horror fan. You see Victoria, a badass leather-donning scientist, and her monster attempt to harness Drac’s powerâbut it might be more than they can keep their grip on because: BAT! Dracula can burst into smaller creatures of the night and aims to escape domestication for some sort of Monsters Avengers team-up. Yes, really. The ride itself uses a similar mechanism toHarry Potter and the Forbidden Journey,where you are moved around practical and video scenes to witness the story. Along the way you bear witness to exciting monster squad squabble up moments with state of the art animatronics. To me, it’s my favorite ride and I love how passionate the lore crafted around it seemed to be. If the ride were to breakdown, I’d say “Well, I guess I live here now”âthat’s how amazing the showrooms are. For thrill ride fans, Epic Universe also featuresCurse of the Werewolf, a spinning coaster inspired by the Wolf-Man that also features incredible animatronic work. While you might not be able to live there, Darkmoor feels the most lived-in, in the best way. The wandering interactions with Igor, the Invisible Man, the Monster, and the Bride of Frankenstein weave a new classic story you’re a part of. The Bride even calls this new Frank her friend as the body of her Frankenstein rests in the queue of Frankenstein Manor. They’re existing in a timeline where monsters are celebrated and feared by the villagers. They even have a Burning Blade Tavern, which homages the studio’s original horror film universe and incorporates the lore into the ambiance and even the menu items. I love myself a character-shaped pretzel and you’ll find a Frankenstein one here to suit your snacking needs. And one of the most killer facts? The score of the land is composed by none other than “Dead Man’s Party” legend Danny Elfman (Beetlejuice). There’s even a part-exclusive vinyl you can buy of his work, pressed for a limited special release only in the theme park land. The Dark Universe also offers the chance to not only walk among the creatures of the night but be one too, thanks to the Darkmoor Monster Makeup Experience. It’s the most important spooky, scary appointment you need to make if you go. Mad scientists, er, makeup artists transform you and help you look like you walk among the shadows beneath the scorching Florida sun. It’s worth it and there’s even cosplay lite fashion gear to feel like you belong. For the first time in my life, I finally found a theme park land where I felt the most at home and in my true form.

    "title": "Russell T Davies Reveals Why Now Was the Time for ‘Doctor Who’ to Resurrect the Rani",
    "article_text": "One of themany,manythingsthat happened on the latest episode ofÂDoctor Whowas that the show finally lifted the lid on what two years of teasing who Mrs. Flood was leading towards. Turns out, it was exactly what manyÂDoctor Whofans had, jokingly or otherwise, guessed immediately. In some ways, according to showrunner Russell T Davies, that was the point. “The Interstellar Song Contest” climaxed with the reveal that Mrs. Flood was, in fact, the latest incarnation of the Rani, the renegade Time Lady scientist originally played by the late, great Kate O’Mara across two classicDoctor Whoserials, “Mark of the Rani” and “Time and the Rani,” and the absurd 1993 anniversary special/charity driveDimensions in Time. Very quickly after that she become the second-latest, as a mortally wounded Flood prepared to regenerate,only to bi-generatejust like the 14th and 15th Doctors had, revealing a new Rani, played by Archie Panjabi. The Rani, aside from being something of a camp icon thanks to the winning combination of an immaculate 1980s fashion sense and O’Mara’sdelectably scenery-devouring performance, has become something of a running joke in the era of modernÂDoctor Who, with fans immediately joking that the second a mysterious female character comes up, sheÂmustbe the Rani. The Master’s wife in season three? The Rani. River Song? The Rani. Missy? The Rani. That woman from “End of Time” who may or may not be the Doctor’s mother? No, clearly the Rani! Mrs. Flood was no exception to that joking theory, it’s just that this time it was decided to pay it off. “Whenever you introduce any woman into any role onDoctor Who, half the internet seems to conject that sheâs the Rani,” Daviesrecently told the BBC. “Sometimes, you just have to go with it.” For Davies, it was also an opportunity to play with a character who is both, almost paradoxically, a returning legacy character (something this current era ofDoctor Whohas largely stayed away from playing with outside oflast year’s Sutekh return), and also one who could essentially be brand new to a less-familiar audience. “I think sheâs great in two ways. Sheâs a famous classic villain if you know her. At the same time, sheâs not up there with the Master, the Cybermen, or the Daleks, sheâs just a little bit more niche,” Davies continued. “Thatâs good. That allows her to become a new character for the newer audience, sheâs not weighted down in continuity.” As to why not making herÂactuallya new characterâafter all, the Time Lords are no stranger to Getting Better after seemingly beingwiped out foreverâwell, Davies thought about that too. But for Davies, finally invoking the Rani meant an opportunity to have those less-familiar viewers check out her prior appearances. “Itâs one of those things where you think we could have just made a new Time Lord and cast Archie Panjabi. That would have been wonderful. That would have been great,” Davies concluded. “But, naming her the Rani leads us into this conversation about the character. It leads some children to BBC iPlayer, where theyâll discover some great old stories with Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy.” We’ll learn just how different this new Rani isâthese new Ranis are, ratherâwhenDoctor WhoÂbegins its two-part finale this weekend.

You havenât really heard music until youâve listen with a solid set of headphones. The technology has been around long enough at this point that you really don’t need to burn a hole through your wallet to afford a pair. Look at Sony.Right now, Sonyâs WH-CH720N noise-canceling headphones which normally go for $150 have been cut in price for a limited time.The pink and white options have been brought down by 35% each, landing on the new price of $98. The black, however, have been discounted even further at 35% off which brings it down to just $88. That’s a savings of $62. Iâve got to hand it to Sony. The companyâs name choice when it comes to its flagship set of headphones never seizes to amaze me. If we check out Appleâs over-the-ear headphones, weâll see they appropriately been dubbed the AirPods Max. Samsungâs earbuds are eloquently named Galaxy Buds, fitting into line all the other Samsung Galaxy personal devices. See at Amazon But then we have Sony. Oh, Sony. Here we have the WH-CH720N noise-canceling headphones. One might think some product manage at Sony was having a hectic day and mistakenly filled out the field on some form with not the product name but with its SKU number. Honestly though? It kind of rocks. Good noise-cancellation is a deal-breaker on any premium pair of over-the-ear headphones, and Sony has delivered here.Powered by Sony’s integrated V1 processor and an array of microphones, the WH-CH720N are able to reverse the soundwaves coming from exterior noise in your surrounding so they cancel each other out. What your left with in your ear is the soundwaves produced by your favorite music or the podcast youâve queued up. When taking calls hands-free, the built-in microphones are able to isolate your voice even in noisy environments. You come across crystal clear to everyone else listening in on the other end. The soft, synthetic leather feels comfortable, allowing you to wear the the lightweight WH-CH720N5 all day long. I donât even mean that as a figure of speech. The impressive 35 hour battery life will carry you from the dayâs start well passed the dayâs end. If you ever find yourself having forgotten to charge them, you have nothing to worry about. The headphones will provide a full hour of playback time after just a three minute charge.

    "title": "Florida Fisherman Saves Drowning Teenager With a Drone",
    "article_text": "Rip currents have already killed11 peoplein the U.S. this year, but last week, a Florida teenager managed to avoid joining that group after a quick-thinking shark fisherman used his drone to save her. On Thursday, Andrew Smith went fishing at Pensacola Beach after work. Per WSVN, Smithsaid, “I wasn’t even going to go out and then my friend convinced me to go.” Only 10 minutes after he arrived, a girl came running up asking if anybody could swim. About a hundred yards away from the shore, her friend was battling a rip current. Smith can’t swim due toa seizure disorder. However, that disorder is also why he uses a drone instead of a kayak to set bait for sharks. As the ocean continued dragging the teenage girl out, Smith said, “I looked down at the drone and I was like, ‘Well, the drone can swim but I can’t.'” After attaching a flotation device to his drone, Smith flew it across the water. The idea was to provide something for the girl to hold onto until first responders arrived.Unfortunately, the first attempt was a “terrible miss.” Per WSVN, Smith explained, “I released it too early, it was really windy. Like, it wasn’t close at all.”Â A bystander handed Smith another flotation device to try again. With this try, Smithsaid,“You had to go slower and slower down to her because that was it. That was the last opportunity we were going to have.” Luckily, Smith was able to lower the device “until you could see her hands grab it, and then I lowered it a little more and I released it. Then she climbed on and started floating.” Paramedics arrived several minutes later. In total, the girl spent about ten minutes caught in the riptide. After being checked over by medical professionals, she was sent home with a clean bill of health. In his ABC News interview, Smith said that authorities told him the girl wouldn’t have survived without his help. Luck was on the girl’s side in more ways than one. Pensacola Beach is home to Fort Pickens, which has restricted airspace. If the teenagers were just a little farther down, Smith told WSVN, he wouldn’t have been able to fly his drone. According toABC News, the entire ordeal has prompted public officials to consider regularly using drones as lifeguards, which raises an old question:Can drones be good? Drones rightfully catch a lot of flack. In the hands of law enforcement, largelyunregulateddrone use has facilitated mass surveillance. And regular people flying drones can cause major disruptions. During the Palisades Fire earlier this year, afirefighting aircraft collided with some idiot’s droneand, in February, Florida’s Senate introduced a bill that wouldallow property owners to use “reasonable force” against drones. But drones can be quite useful in competent hands. For example, drones are used to track fires, and researchers havedeveloped dronesthat could possibly enter and map the layouts of burning buildings. In search and rescue,drones are also revolutionizing missions. Several years ago, a Scottish mountaineer was located by drone after he fell from an ice cliff. A case studyÂnotedthat rescuers would have normally have faced “immense challenges” like “a vast search area and altitudes near the limits of human physiologic function.” “Without the use of the drone,” it continued, “locating the climber and executing such an efficient rescue would have been unlikely.” Drones Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Speaking tothe Wall Street Journal, Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman said “It feels like itâs going to work very well, and itâs the kind of property that lends itself to more.” He also noted that the demand forLilo & Stitchmerch, which was already strong, has skyrocketed as the remake’s release date approachesâ”Weâve seen the thing explode from a Disney+ and consumer-products perspective”âwhich is surely another compelling reason for the company to get a sequel going ASAP. Casual Disney fans who think the 2002 animatedLilo & Stitchis the only existing entry in the franchise might be surprised to know that the storyâfollowing a Hawaiian girl and her mischievous alien bestieâhas enjoyed a robust life beyond the big screen. There are two direct-to-video sequels as well as a made-for-TV sequel, three animated series, two TV specials, and a handful of short films. There have also been severalLilo & Stitchvideo games and/or games featuring the characters, who’ve also enjoyed a prominent ongoing presence at Disney theme parks. And as previously mentioned, there’s a seemingly insatiable demand for Stitch-related merch. According to the WSJ, director Dean Fleischer Camp’s Friday release is likely to beatMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoningat the Memorial Day weekend box office, and capture the number one spot worldwide too. And there’s already a foundation in place for live-action remake sequels, with102 Dalmations(and spin-offCruella),Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, andMufasa: The Lion Kingexploring the world beyond the films that preceded them.

    "title": "Making Android XR Glasses That Don’t Suck Is Going to Be Very Hard",
    "article_text": "I’ll be honest with you: I thinksmart glassesare awesome. I don’t mean to say they work well all the time, or that they don’t do half of what they should do at this stage, or that they don’t need a massive dose of computing power. Those things are all true in my honest opinion. But even despite having to scream at my pair ofMeta Ray-Bansto play Elton John this morning, only for them torepeatedlytry and play John Prine instead, I love them for one thing: their potential. And Googleâif I/O 2025 is any indicationâsees that same potential, too. It spent quite some time during its keynote laying out its vision for what smart glasses might be able to dovia its Android XRsmart glasses platform and supporting hardware made with Xreal. The possibilities are enticing. With Android XR and smart eyewear likeProject Aura glasses, the form factor could actually get to the next level, especially with optical passthrough that can superimpose stuff like turn-by-turn navigation in front of your eyeballs. If you were watching the live demo yesterday, it probably looked like we were all right on the cusp of being able to walk around with the futuristic pair of smart glasses we’ve been waiting for, and partly that impression is true. Smart glassesâones that do all the fun stuff we want them to doâareimminent, but unfortunately for everyone, Google included, they’re likely going to be a lot harder to perfect than tech companies would have us believe. When it comes to glasses, there are still constraints, and quite a few of them. For one, if smart glasses are going to be the future gadget we want them to be, they need some kind of passthrough. Technologically speaking, we’re already there. While Gizmodo’s Senior Editor, Consumer Tech, Ray Wong, only gotabout a minute to try Project Aura at Google I/Ohe can attest to the fact that the glasses do indeed have an optical display that can show maps and other digital information. The problem isn’t the screen, though; it’s what having a screen might entail. I’m personally curious about what having optical passthrough might do to battery life. Size is still the biggest issue when it comes to functional smart glasses, which is to say that it’s difficult to cram all of that architecture we need into frames that don’t feel much heavier than a regular pair of glasses. Think about it: you need a battery, compute power, drivers for speakers, etc. All of those things are relatively small nowadays, but they add up. And if your glasses can suddenly do a lot more than they used to, you’re going to need a battery that reflects those features, especially if you’re using optical passthrough, playing audio, and querying your onboard voice assistant all at once. A bigger battery means more weight and a bulkier look, however, and I don’t really care to walk around with Buddy Holly-lookin’ frames on my face all day. I was promised 5 minutes with the Google Android XR smart glasses, but they only gave me 3 minutes, and half of that was explaining what they were and how they worked, so I actually only had 90 seconds to use Gemini on a painting on a wall, two books on a bookshelf, and theâ¦pic.twitter.com/Ly60boX91G — Ray Wong (@raywongy)May 20, 2025 Then there’s the price. Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are already relatively expensive ($300+, depending on the model) despite not even having a screen in them. I don’t have the projected bill of materials for Project Aura or Google’s prototype Android XR glasses, obviously, but I am going to assume that these types of optical displays are going to cost a little bit more than your typical pair of sunglasses. That’s compounded by the fact that the supply chain and manufacturing infrastructure around making those types of displays likely isn’t very robust at this point, given people really only started buying smart glasses in the mainstream about five minutes ago. I sound like I’m naysaying here, and maybe I am a little bit. Shrinking tech down, historically speaking, has never been easy, but these are some of the most powerful and resourced companies in the world making this stuff, and I don’t for a second doubt that they can’t figure it out. It’s not the acumen that would prevent them; it’s the commitment. I want to believe that the level of focus is there, given all of the time Google devoted to showcasing Project Aura yesterday, but it’s hard to say for sure. Google, despite the behemoth it is, is being pulled in various directionsâfor example, AI, AI, and AI. I can only hope in this case that Google actually puts its money where its futuristic spy glasses are and actually powers Project Aura through to fruition.

    "title": "SpaceX Poised to Profit From Trump’s Golden Dome Fantasy",
    "article_text": "Elon Muskâs SpaceX is reportedly chomping at the bit to build Trumpâs $175 billion âGolden Domeâ defense system, designed to protect the U.S. from foreign missiles âeven if they are launched from the other side of the world.âÂ Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegsethunveiledthe first details of the project during an Oval Office briefing on Tuesday, claiming that it can be completed in three years at the cost $175 billion. Both the budget and timeline conflict with a Congressional Budget Office assessment, whichestimatesthat the project could take 20 years and cost $524 billion.Â This unusually large and complex space shield would consist of a vast network of satellites capable of detecting, tracking, and intercepting incoming missiles, in addition to a smaller fleet of offensive satellites, Reutersreports. The GOP-led budget reconciliation bill, which is progressing to the House for consideration, includes $25 billion to jumpstart the Golden Dome project, according toThe Hill. Leaders in aerospace tech are already clamoring to get their hands on a contract, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, andâof courseâSpaceX.Â In April, sourcestoldReuters that Muskâs satellite and spaceflight company made a bid to build key parts of the Golden Dome in partnership with two other U.S.-based companies: software firm Palantir and drone manufacturer Anduril.Â Around that time, these companies pitched their plan to the Trump administration and the Pentagon, which would involve launching potentially more than 1,000 new defense satellites for sensing and tracking missiles, in addition to a separate fleet of 200 attack satellites armed with missiles or lasers, according to Reuters. In a letter sent to Defense Department inspector general Steven Stebbins on May 1, a group of 42 Democratic lawmakersrequesteda review of the Pentagonâs procurement process for the Golden Dome project, citing conflict of interest concerns over this potential deal with Musk. âAll of this raises concerns about whether defense contracts to build a Golden Dome are an effective way to protect Americans or are meant to enrich Mr. Musk and other elites,â they wrote.Â In addition to generating substantial new revenue for SpaceX and boosting the companyâs valuation, a Golden Dome contract could give Musk âunacceptable ongoing leverageâ over U.S. national security, the lawmakers warned.Â The group pointed to SpaceXâs proposal to run this defense system via a âsubscription service.â This could allow the company to bypass the Pentagonâs procurement rules and exercise unchecked control over the cost and development of the Golden Dome, The Hill reported.Â âMr. Musk could, as he allegedly did in Ukraine, determine when to provide the U.S. government with access to Golden Dome satellite systems,â the lawmakers wrote.Â Gizmodo reached out to SpaceX for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.Â Since donating more than $250 million to Trumpâs election campaign, Musk has become part of the furniture of his administration, serving as a special government employee, senior advisor to the president, and a key official at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Â Itâs worth noting that his Golden Dome bidding partners, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, are alsolongtimesupportersof Trump. It’s hardly the first time Muskâs ties to the president have raised concerns. In April, a report from Senate Democratsestimatedthat he and his companies face at least $2.37 billion in legal exposure due to the many conflicts of interest he has acquired through his work with DOGE.Â Despite this, itâs reasonable to believe that the Pentagon could select SpaceX to lead construction on the Golden Dome. Defense officials may feel that Muskâs company is well-positioned to tackle this project for several reasons.Â For one, SpaceX haslaunchedhundreds of spy satellites over the last five years, and sources told Reuters that several recently launched prototypes could be retrofitted for the project. The company also has experience building satellite constellations through Starlinkâa network made up of more than 11,000 satellites. Whatâs more, SpaceXâs fleet of reusable rockets could help ensure that the Golden Dome project stays within the tight budget and timing constraints the Trump administration has set for it, though that will still be a herculean task.Â If SpaceX is not chosen for this task, itâs not immediately clear which launch provider could do the heavy lifting. United Launch Allianceâs Vulcan Centaur and Blue Originâs New Glenn are both possible contenders, but these heavy-lift vehicles have yet to prove themselves.Â Depending on the size and weight of the Golden Dome satellites, other U.S. launch providers could conceivably help, including Firefly Aerospace. In February, Fireflysigneda $21.8 million contract with the Pentagon to launch a mission under the militaryâs quick-reaction space program, whichaimsto demonstrate the Space Forceâs ability to rapidly deploy satellites in an emergency.Â Even with SpaceXâs advantages, itâs not clear whether itâor any leading tech company for that matterâcould actually pull this project off. No country has ever launched a space-based defense system of this scale before, and itâs difficult to predict the amount of time and money it will take to build and deploy this technology.Â There are geopolitical tensions to consider as well. Today, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry urged the U.S. to abandon the project, stating that Golden Dome will “heighten the risk of turning space into a war zone and creating a space arms race and shake the international security and arms control system,” ABC Newsreports. Whether the Pentagon and its future Golden Dome contractors can overcome these hurdles remains to be seen. If SpaceX gets in on the action, it could open up a whole new world of technological, ethical, and legal challenges for Musk. defense techSPACEXTrump administration Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "They Just Gave Kleya a Goddamn Gun",
    "article_text": "There’s a scene in the ninth episode ofÂAndor‘s second seasonwhere Vel Sartha, inspecting a table full of requisitioned weaponry at the Rebellion’s Yavin base, picks up a blaster and asks whose it is. Except, that’s not what she asks, raising the pistol into the air in front of a crowd of new recruits. What she actually says is “Who belongs tothis?” I was thinking a lot about that linean episode later, when, as she infiltrates a hospital in a desperate attempt to end the life of the man who saved hers as a child, Kleya Marki, one ofAndor‘s standout characters, slips a tiny blaster with one hell of a kick out of her purloined nurse’s scrubs and calmly executes an ISB tactical officer. And then does it again. AndÂagain. It’s the climactic, tense moment of an episode that builds up to this singular moment of emotional and dramatic release as she tearfully turns off Luthen’s life support. In many ways, Kleya’s whole life, one torn apart by the Empire, and rebuilt out of her hatred of it, is leading to this moment, and this moment of infiltration and execution is just the final flourish. The scene is incredible beyond the slickness of Kleya’s mission, but in the week sinceÂAndorcame to an end I find myself drawn back to that blaster. Or really, it’s just a gun. Not in the way that those terms are particularly a differentiator, inÂStar Warsthe former is far more common, but they are interchangeable.Star Warsis famous for having many of its most iconic blasters have origins in real-world weaponryânot just inspired by but literally being actual guns that just have bits greebled on or lopped off and shifted around. Kleya’s pistol feels less like that approach ofStar Warsdesign. Sure, what little we see of it there is a little acquiescence to sci-fi beyond the fact it shoots energy clean through a Stormtrooper’s skull, like a little light on the side. But it’s theÂStar Warsblaster that’s just looked the most like a regular gun that I’ve seen in a while, it almost looks like a derringer with its stacked barrels and the small grip. It almost doesn’tÂfeellike a blaster. It’s not the first time we’ve seen that kind of design philosophy inverted onAndorâthe Aldhani heist crew in season one, before they purloined moreStar Wars-y weapons from the base, were essentially running around with AK-74s. But being stripped of so much of theStar Warsartifice in that way feels like a parallel to how Kleya handles it and herself alike. It’s telling that this scene is actually the first time we see her wielding a weapon inAndor; up to this point Kleya has been a coordinator, a go-between for Luthen, and her tools of resistance have been her comms system and icy looks in equal measure. And yet that little blaster is still thoroughly her. There’s no frills, there’s nothing more than what it needs to do: point, pull the trigger, put a bolt through someone. If Cassian’s Bryar pistol reflected his own sense of character in that characteristiclittle whirring soundwhenever he primed it, it’s that simplicity that makes Kleya’s reflect her. It’s notelegant in its simplicity, it’s almost brutal even, because the blaster isn’t meant to be grand or say something about her character in that regard. It’s not even meant to be iconic, even if the scenes of her using it have quickly become since the episode aired. It’s a tool that puts people who are in her way down, and that’s all it needs to be. It all comes back, again, to that scene with Vel. The story ofAndoris, in some ways, the story of that blaster she picks up: it’s Syril’s pistol from when he came to arrest Cassian on Ferrix, which Cassian then stole, took with him to Niamos, then he gifted it to Melshi after their Narkina 5 breakout, and now it’s made its way to the heart of the Rebel Alliance. DoAndor‘s characters belong to their weapons, once they’ve chosen to pick them up? Are they defined by that choice, the symbolic gesture of their resistance to the Imperial regime? Sometimes they are. Or sometimes a gun is just a gun, no more, no less. In Kleya’s case, it can be a bit of both. After all, that in-between is where she’s always worked best. Want more io9 news?

If youâve ever found yourself wishing for a second screen while working from a coffee shop, on a plane, or even at the kitchen table, youâre not alone. Portable monitors are extremely convenient, even if you’re just working from home. More real estate for all the things you need to do on your computer is always a good idea. And if you donât want to be tied to a traditional desk setup, that goes double. There’s just one problem, though. Second monitors can be overpriced, or just not that great in general. The 15.6-inch MNN Portable Monitor is just $61 at Amazon, down from its usual price of $89. That’s $30 off and a discount of 31%. That’s an absolutely excellent price if you’re looking to supplement a monitor you already have, and in fact is less than the price than a fancy dinner out. See at Amazon Plus, this monitor checks all the right boxes: itâs lightweight, slim, easy to carry, and has full HD visuals perfect for when you’re crunching spreadsheets or watching Netflix. Nearly 16 inches makes it the perfect size to act as a secondary screen next to your laptop without feeling too small or cramped.

It also comes with a smart cover that doubles as a stand, so you donât need to bring a separate stand or prop it up awkwardly. The cover folds into position to give you multiple viewing angles depending on how and where youâre using it. And while it doesnât have built-in speakers or touch features, it’s a solid screen. And that’s probably what you’re looking for, anyway. You aren’t beating this monitor’s price for just $61. It’s an invaluable addition to a portable work station and an even better way to spruce up your desktop area at home. But if you’re planning on buying it, be sure to do so quickly.

    "article_text": "OpenAIdeclaredit will put up an astronomical $6.5 billion to merge with Jony Ive and his secretive AI device design company. Ive, who helped bring us legendary products like the iMac and iPhone, will lead the makers of ChatGPT not just in making a better chatbot but in creating a product that âreimaginesâ a personal computer. Perhaps Ive and Silicon Valley darling OpenAI CEO Sam Altman may finally help us escape our screen addiction, or it could just be another Humane pin. Altman and Ive came together in a massive media blitz to announce their new match made in heaven. Iveâs company,LoveFrom, alongside other big names in tech design spaces, includingformer lead iPhone designer Tang Tan, was alreadyworking with Altmanon this device. Now, the engagement is official. Ive and fellow Apple vets will now be heavily involved in all aspects of OpenAIâs software and hardware development. While LoveFrom is partnered with OpenAI on this project as an independent company, those at Iveâs separate company, âio,â will work hand-in-hand with the makers of ChatGPT to bring forth âa family of productsâ designed for our current age of AI. In anannouncementvideo posted to X, Altman said this merger was âformed with the mission of figuring out how to create a family of devices that would let people use AI to create all sorts of wonderful things.â For his part, Ive mentioned that the world is still fixated on a device whose design hasnât radically changed for well over a decade. Sam & Jony introduce iopic.twitter.com/ej5K59kJq3 — OpenAI (@OpenAI)May 21, 2025 Ive still hasnât offered an iota of what this supposed device looks like, what it does, or how it has, in his words, âcaptured our imagination.â It does exist, it is somehow portableâas Altman said he has used an early prototypeâbut it will be kept under wraps until some unknown date.The Wall Street Journalreported, based on anonymous sources, that the makers of the still-unknown device want to âmove consumers beyond screens.â OpenAI, under the new big tech chimera spearheaded by Ive and Altman, said this device may not replace smartphones, at least not initially, according toBloomberg. In the meantime, Iveâs team will âtake overâ all other design space at OpenAI, including progressing development on ChatGPT. Perhaps these veteran designers can move the chatbot beyond its current iteration as a cheating tool used by students tokeep themselves from learning. As for that unknown AI hardware, we canât help but remind ourselves about last yearâs deluge of AI wearables akin to the Humane AI Pin. That device included connectivity to a chatbot that could also handle light tasks like texts or emails on the behalf of users. The Ai Pin was inundated with problems and sold so poorly thatHumane sold itself off to HPfor a fraction of its initial $850 billion valuation. In the interview with Bloomberg, Ive said the Humane Ai Pin and fellowAI-centric doohickey, the Rabbit R1, were both âvery poor products.â He further added, âthere has been an absence of new ways of thinking expressed in products.â Without actual product details, prospective customers will just have to take his word for it. In a recent interview with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, the man who worked alongside Steve Jobs to create the original iPhoneaired his grievanceswith the screen-obsessed world he helped create. He called out social media as a societal ill, and maybe he can convince the company to quash itsreported plans for a Twitter clone.

    "title": "19-Year-Old to Plead Guilty to Hacking Charges After Data Breach of Millions of Schoolchildren",
    "article_text": "A Massachusetts teenager has pled guilty to a number of hacking crimes, including his role in the penetration of a cloud company with data on tens of millions of children, the government says. On Wednesday, the Justice Departmentsaid that19-year-old Matthew D. Lane of Sterling, Massachusetts, had entered into a plea agreement for his role in a number of high-profile hacking episodes. The former college student pled guilty to charges related to cyber extortion, as well as aggravated identity theft, and other crimes. Lane is accused of personally hacking a company using stolen employee login credentials. While this company hasn’t been named in court documents, NBChas reportedthat the victim is PowerSchool, a cloud and analytics provider that says it services K-12 schools across North America. NBC describes it as “one of the top tech education companies” in the country. Lane’s compromise of it last year led to the theft of data on tens of millions of children. The information that Lane stole included the “Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and confidential medical information, among other data, of the students and faculty” sourced from the company’s network. Not long after Lane stole the data, the company received an extortion message. That message threatened to âleak . . . worldwideâ the “names, email addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, medical information, residential addresses, parent and guardian information, and passwords, among other data, of more than 60 million students and 10 million teachers if Victim 2 did not send 30 Bitcoin (approximately $2.85 million at the time) to a specific Bitcoin address,” federal prosecutors write. Gizmodo reached out to PowerSchool for comment. According to the Justice Department, Lane was also part of a criminal group that stole data from a telecommunications firm and then sought to extort the company for $200,000. It is unknown who actually hacked the telecom, though Lane is said to have used an anonymous email to contact the telecom directly, telling it to fork over the ransom in Bitcoin or suffer a humiliating data breach. Lane purportedly said: âWe are the only ones with a copy of this data now. Stop this nonsense [or] your executives and employees will see the same fate . . . . Make the correct decision and pay the ransom. If you keep stalling, it will be leaked.” âMatthew Lane apparently thought he found a way to get rich quick, but this 19-year-old now stands accused of hiding behind his keyboard to gain unauthorized access to an education software provider to obtain sensitive data which was used in an attempt to extort millions of dollars,” said FBI official Kimberly Milka.

    "title": "Rated 4.6/5 on Amazon, These Bose Headphones Are a Few Dollars Shy of a Record Low for Memorial Day",
    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. If youâre looking for a new pair of headphones, youâve probably noticed the large number of options with active noise cancellation. While many brands promise great sound and total escape from the world, only a select few consistently deliver on that promise.Bose is one of those rare names that stands out, and theQuietComfortheadphones have become an icon for a reason. Just before Memorial Day, this classic model isavailable on Amazon for as little as $229, which is 34% off the regular $349 price.That’s only a couple of dollars short of its lowest price ever, so this is one offer not to be blown. See at Amazon It’s not the name brand that separates Bose from the pack: it’sthe focus on quality, comfort, and user experience. As soon as you wear them, you’ll sense the plush earcup cushions that softly cup your ears, and the headband that keeps everything firmly in place. If youâve ever struggled with headphones that pinch or feel heavy after an hour or two, youâll appreciate just how effortless it is to wear these Bose models for an entire day. The real magic of the BoseQuietComfortlies inits noise-cancelling technologywhich combines both active and passive features to create a truly immersive listening environment. Whether you’re trying to drown out the whine of an airplane engine or the chatter of a busy office building, these headphones let you tune out distractions and tune in to what matters most: your music, your shows, or even a little peace and quiet. And when you need to tune back into your environment,Aware Mode allows you to toggle between full noise cancellation and full awarenesswith a single tap. With wireless headphones, that kind of battery life is always on our minds. TheBose QuietComfort offers up to 24 hours of playtime from one charge, and if you find yourself momentarily in a pinch, that quick 15-minute charge will give you additional 2.5 hours of playback-funny enough. And if all else fails, and you need to go wired, the provided audio cable with in-line microphone has you covered. The multipoint Bluetooth connectivity is great because it allows you to move between devices instantly without having to disconnect and reconnect constantly. Whether you’re switching from your phone to your laptop or tablet, the experience is seamless and convenient. And with the Bose app, you’ll be able to access new features and updates. Be that as it may, with Memorial Day almost here, opportunities such as this are not common. BoseQuietComfortheadphones are not frequently seen this close to their all-time low price. For comfort, for great performance, and reliability, this is a shrewd buy. See at Amazon Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "You’ll have to construct your ownDevils Towerout of mashed potatoes (or garden dirt, depending on how much room you’ve got), but an authenticClose Encounters of the Third Kindalienmask is going up for auction, and it’s equal parts cool, cute, and creepy. It’s part of Propstore’s auction of items from Planet Hollywood’s extensive memorabilia collection (see the whole cataloghere), kicking off May 21 and running through June 11. There’s aGremlinspuppet,Ghostbustersminiatures, Spock ears from two differentStar Trekmovies, and lots more, but theClose Encountersalienâcomplete with “functional eye mechanisms”âis the standout pick. According toPropstore’s listing, the climacticClose Encounterssequence in which the musically inclined aliens land their ship at Devils Tower “was achieved by dressing dozens of young girls as the friendly Grays. Multiple versions of their extraterrestrials masks were built by production, including a number of tests and prototypes, while two versions were ultimately selected for filming: non-articulated masks for wide or long shots of the aliens, and mechanical versions capable of a limited number of facial expressions.” This particular item, the listing explains, “originated from Academy Award-nominated special mechanical effects artist and regular Spielberg collaborator Roy Arbogast. It features a foam latex-backed slip latex skin dressed over a fiberglass underskull and painted gray-brown on the exterior. The interior is inset with wide cast resin eyes painted with blue irises and black pupils. The eyes are designed to move from side-to-side via cables installed along the interior.” Arbogast’s many special effects credits also include several John Carpenter films (Escape From New York,The Thing,They Live, and more) as well asStar Wars: Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. Some “sympathetic restoration” has been applied to the mask in the intervening decades, though the listing notes it’s in quite fragile condition. In other words, it’s for display onlyâdon’t try to wear it around the neighborhood to freak out unsuspecting Richard Dreyfuss types.

    "title": "A delayed review, a GOTY controversy, and a Big Geralt: Our strange 10-year relationship with The Witcher 3",
    "article_text": "A look back at PC Gamer's slightly odd history with one of the best RPGs ever made. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I got my first look atThe Witcher 3at E3 2013 (say that three times fast), and dutifully explained to PC Gamer readers that although Geralt may be a pretty wild guy and also a kind of hunter, that's not what \"The Wild Hunt\" meant. Truth be told, the term was new to me, too. To celebrate its 10th anniversary, all this week we're looking back on The Witcher 3—and looking ahead to its upcoming sequel, too.Keep checking backfor more features and retrospectives, as well as in-depth interviews with the developers who brought the game to life. A decade and change later and The Witcher is now one of the world's most-recognized fantasy series—even my mom knows about the Netflix show, although I'm not sure if she watched past the first episode about the wizard with a sex tower. The Witcher 3 is also one of the games PC Gamer has celebrated and covered the most in its 30-year history. We've got a special, sometimes strange relationship with the game (you may have heard about our tub obsession). ForThe Witcher 3's 10th anniversary, here's a brief history of that relationship. Cast your mind back to the distant past: 10 whole years ago. It's a long time in PC gaming terms. Steam Greenlight was still around, no one was talking about 'extraction shooters,' and even though we thought ofCD Projektas a PC developer, it didn't come as a big surprise to us that console review copies of The Witcher 3 were available before PC review copies. \"While review copies of The Witcher 3 were sent out for the PlayStation 4 more than a week ago, PC code is still missing in action, despite being pre-loadable on Steam,\" wewrote at the timeto explain why we didn't have a review yet. \"Bandai Namco tells us that this is because a big day-one patch hasn't been finalized on PC in time for today's review embargo, but will be ready for worldwide release next Tuesday.\" (If it seems strange to see Bandai Namco mentioned there, it's another sign of how much has changed: Back then CD Projekt relied on Bandai Namco and Warner Bros to help publish physical copies of its games in Europe and North America, respectively.) These days, it's more often the console versions that reviewers have to wait for while a day one patch is finalized and certified. How far we've come! Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. When we did publish ourWitcher 3 reviewabout a week after the console-focused outlets, we gave it a 92%. That's a very high score for us, although it was one notch below the score that appears on ourMetal Gear Solid 5 reviewfrom the same year, which brings me to… What game did PC Gamer award Game of the Year in 2015? Metal Gear Solid 5 was our2015 GOTY. Did anyone argue that it should be The Witcher 3 instead? Yes, they did. Did anyone point out that it was kind of odd togive The Witcher 3 a 'Best Singleplayer' awardeven though MGS5 was also a singleplayer game, mostly? Yes, I think a few people mentioned that. PC Gamer alsodeclared Death Stranding GOTY in 2020. Are you in love with Hideo Kojima? Disagreements over how much to praise or not praise Kojima games has been one of the top causes of hurt feelings at PC Gamer in my time here. (Not joking.) Do you regret not awarding The Witcher 3 GOTY in 2015? Speaking for myself, I like that we chose to celebrate the systems-driven design of MGS5. Our GOTY picks often do align with popular opinion (Baldur's Gate 3), but there wouldn't be much point to picking a staff GOTY if our method were to try to predict what the most people will agree with, which would be better accomplished with a poll. MGS5 won on its merits, as determined by the PCG team at the time, and that will always be the best we can do. (But I'm certain some of us who were around then would argue harder for The Witcher 3 if we did 2015 over.) Was MGS5 PC Gamer's most controversial GOTY pick? Wepicked Spelunky in 2013and people were pretty mad about that. It may not have won our 2015 GOTY award, but it wasn't long before The Witcher 3 became PC Gamer's top game ofallyears. We publish a new list of the Top 100 games every year, and in 2016 weput The Witcher 3 at the top, unseating Mass Effect 2 and previous champions like Skyrim and Half-Life 2. \"Wow! Our game in top spot over all these amazing games on the list... I'm a bit lost for words,\" said Witcher 3 game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz at the time. \"It means a lot for us, proving that all the hard work that we’ve put into making The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and both expansions was time well spent.\" The Witcher 3 stayed in that spot until being unseated in 2019 by Divinity: Original Sin 2 (thanks to its Definitive Edition update). Original Sin 2 was unseated by Disco Elysium in 2020, which was finally usurped by Baldur's Gate 3 last year. In our currentTop 100 PC games list, published last year, The Witcher 3 sits at #6. We were just goofing off, really. We couldn't have known that we'd one day have a small but real connection to Henry Cavill soaking in a tub by candlelight. It was Phil Savage, current Global Editor-in-Chief of PC Gamer, who started it. And there really wasn't much to it: We just overused a screenshot of Geralt in the tub in articles about The Witcher 3 because it seemed funny to do that. People on Twitter noticed. Some of them were delighted. Others were mad about it. So we kept doing it. If asked why we kept posting the tub image, I'd sometimes say that we simply didn't have any other screenshots of The Witcher 3, which once prompted a PR person to email me a press kit with more screenshots. We didn't stop. For some, the gag was a political statement, and we did receive some angry messages about \"double standards.\" I just enjoyed keeping the bit alive, but I do like to believe that Tub Geralt brought good things into the world: When \"hot tub streams\" became a thing on Twitch in 2021, the opportunity was not lost on us, nor on CD Projekt. With Netflix, the developerstreamed Geralt cosplayerMaulCosplay reenacting the tub scene in advance of WitcherCon. For our part, we streamed a loop of The Witcher 3's tub scene for hours, occasionally playing clips of Geralt dialogue from a soundboard. (Yes, one of us was manually playing sound clips for hours.) We archived the stream on YouTube. Behold: A lesser-known running Geralt joke came about after modder Votislav posted a stretched-out Geralt face from The Witcher 3's files.We dubbed it \"Big Geralt.\" If I'm being honest, I like Big Geralt more than Tub Geralt. He's so serene, and he still appears sometimeswhen we write about ultrawide displays. We've written a lot about The Witcher 3 over the past 10 years. Here are a few more highlights: Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs. He was later captivated by Myst, SimCity, Civilization, Command & Conquer, all the shooters they call \"boomer shooters\" now, and PS1 classic Bushido Blade (that's right: he had Bleem!). Tyler joined PC Gamer in 2011, and today he's focused on the site's news coverage. His hobbies include amateur boxing and adding to his 1,200-plus hours in Rocket League.

    "title": "The Battlefield subreddit is an endless feed of leaked Battlefield 6 gameplay, and it might be the best marketing campaign of 2025",
    "article_text": "The next Battlefield keeps looking promising, though one controversial change from 2042 is coming back. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When alpha footage of an unreleased multiplayer game leaks onto the internet, how studios react can tell you a lot. Often, they make the call to go full scorched earth: Issuing DMCA takedowns to wipe leaked videos or screenshots from the web as much as possible. That's not what's happening with the yet-to-be-officially-named Battlefield 6, which for months has held early playtests that have sprung more leaks than a porcupine's water bottle. Most attempts to upload huge chunks of Battlefield 6 alpha gameplay are getting sniped by EA lawyers, but the company is being surprisingly chill about all the other clips and screenshots making their way onto X, Reddit, and elsewhere. It's kinda funny that the front page of the official Battlefield subreddit is basically a nonstop feed of Battlefield 6. A few minutes of scrolling turned up: Battlefield 6 (placeholder) continues to look promising. Though, it's also striking how much it looks like a less futuristic Battlefield 2042. There's nothing especially surprising about what I've seen so far, but it's nice to see generic soldiers back, if only because it reminds me of simpler times, before every FPS soldier had to have a backstory and 007 gadget. Even under the grainy blur of a clip splattered with Chinese watermarks, those maps look very pretty and the enhanced building destruction is obvious. Walls still appear to crumble in square-sized \"units\" similar to the Bad Company games, so we probably shouldn't expect the crumbly freeform destruction of The Finals. While we consume the Battlefield alphas in little chunks, DICE keeps blogging about them. Its latest topic is a spicy one:Classes. In part one of its class system series, DICE reiterates that classes will once again be the star of role selection. It sounds like operators with specialized gadgets and names are gone, but the studio is folding in a controversial change from 2042: Any class can carry any weapon, but you're incentivized to use the weapons that match your class with passive buffs. \"For example, using our same ongoing test subject, the Recon class, if you select a weapon from the Sniper Rifle category, you will benefit from increased breath-holding duration,\" the post reads. \"In contrast, an Assault player choosing from the same category will not receive this bonus.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That's exactly how things have worked in 2042 ever since the class system reworks of 2023, and it sounds like DICE liked that system so much it's coming back. The news was a gut punch to some fans, with several already rallying alpha players to pressure DICE against it. \"To everybody that got invited to the playtest this weekend, give your feedback when the playtest is over: WE WANT CLASS-LOCKED WEAPONS! RETURN TO BF4 SYSTEM,\" wrote reddit userbshaoulian. \"Make it like Battlefield 4\" is an increasingly common sentiment among the fan base, which is funny, because when BF4 was new, I remember equally loud cries to make it more like Battlefield 2.

    "title": "A Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 dev has formed an anime rivalry with the godlike buildcrafters who only needed 'like, one week' to beat his record of dealing 3.4 billion damage with one attack",
    "article_text": "Number go up. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The more tools you give players to fine-tune their builds, the sooner they'll find a way to crack your game's math wide open. That's a lesson thatClair Obscur: Expedition 33developer Sandfall Interactive learned in record time, as two of its leads explained in a YouTube interview earlier this week (viaGamesRadar). While speaking withPirate Software, Clair Obscur game director Guillaume Broche said the studio had hosted \"an internal small competition\" during the game's development to see which of its developers could deal the most damage in a single attack. Once the game launched, however, that internal damage record didn't last long.\"The players broke it in like, one week,\" Broche said. However, the Clair Obscur devs haven't surrendered the title just yet. Broche said that Sandfall VFX artist and internal damage recordholder Léo Paris has become the proverbial Vegeta to the playerbase's Goku. \"Someone took the throne online and now he's engaging with him on Twitter,\" Broche said. Art director Nicholas Maxson-Francombe acknowledged the burgeoning anime rivalry, saying there's \"constant posts of the score constantly going up between the two.\" I dove into the X timeline to see if I could reconstruct the ongoing DPS race. The one upsmanship seemed to begin on April 24—Clair Obscur's launch day—when userBltzZ11posted a screenshot showing an attack dealing 410.9 million damage. Parisappeared in the repliesas though summoned by the emergence of a worthy challenger. \"Are you in NG+ ? I won't say a lot but there might be something out here to do more than this,\" Paris said. \"I'm the current holder of the record at the studio so I'm watching out for my throne you know.\" Undaunted by Paris's omen, BltzZ11 and fellow contender Schrodingersba4 entered the laboratory to concoct a build that could unseat Sandfall's champion. First, Schrodingersba4 crossed the 688 million threshold. Then, BltzZ11 dropped a screenshot of a staggering 1.1 billion damage attack. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Parry this,\" Paris said, almost tripling BltzZ11's numbers with his standing record: a3.2 billion damage attack. Then, on April 30, Schrodingersba4 did the impossible, declaring \"Maelle supremacy\" with a record-breaking 3.4 billion damage, which the officialClair Obscur account acknowledgedas having \"gone and done it.\" My god. He's only gone and done it. @SandfallEorys come here.April 30, 2025 Like all good anime rivals, however, Schrodingersba4 encouraged Paris—who he called his \"muse\"—to surpass his limits, telling the Sandfall dev \"I believe in you.\" That belief, it seems, was well placed. Paris reclaimed his title the next day afterlanding a 4.3 billion damage swing. As a wise manonce said, \"What's better than this—guys being dudes?\" In this week's interview with Pirate Software, Broche said it's proof of a game's success when players have an urge to turn its combat math inside out, even if it means the studio has tonerf a skill like Stendahlevery now and then. \"The speed at which people found broken builds and everything were a testament to how much they love the systems,\" Broche said \"So that's great.\" Expedition 33 tips: Conquer the continentExpedition 33 lost Gestrals: Runaway kidsExpedition 33 mime locations: Beat the buskersExpedition 33 old key: What it opensExpedition 33 weird pictos: Where to use them Lincoln has been writing about games for 11 years—unless you include the essays about procedural storytelling in Dwarf Fortress he convinced his college professors to accept.

    "article_text": "Truly exceptional games don't just appeal to their audience, David Gaider says, they expand it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Former Dragon Age lead writer David Gaider is not known to be shy about sharing his opinions, and so he did in April, saying thatClair Obscur: Expedition 33is \"kind of to JRPGs whatBaldur's Gate 3was to CRPGs.\" Not everyone took the statement quite as he meant it, though, and so speaking recently toGamesRadar, Gaider clarified that what he meant was simply that both games are \"kind of love letters to their genre that allow what they've created to translate to a larger audience than what that genre normally hits.\" \"The sales for Baldur's Gate 3 were amazing, and kind of make a lie out of—I remember when I was at EA, there was a lot of investigation into how large is the RPG audience, and how large is the action audience, and so forth,\" Gaider said. \"And they would have an estimate and they'd say it caps out, oh, the RPG audience caps out at about five million. But that doesn't seem to be true when the game is good.\" \"Good\" is very subjective, and it doesn't always add up to success: Plenty of good games are overlooked or fail to meet some arbitrary sales goal for any number of reasons, not least of which is the overwhelming number of \"good\" games out there. One obvious example is EA's own recent RPG epic,Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which was well received by critics and players but failed to put up sufficient numbers and may well mark the end of the series, at least for now. But Gaider is seemingly talking about the much rarer phenomenon of games that are trulyexceptional, rather than merely good. \"I think there's such a thing as expanding the audience, as opposed to treating the audience as this finite number of people, right?\" he said. \"And I think that's what Expedition 33 really does. I think it manages to take the elements of JRPGs—and I don't think it's doing a lot of new things, honestly. It's taking a number of more recent trends and kind of bundling them up in an interesting way that I think makes it very accessible to people who normally wouldn't play JRPGs.\" And, he said, the successes of Clair Obscur and Baldur's Gate 3 also demonstrates \"what's possible when a game is given time to cook. \"Baldur's Gate 3 had an extended and very front-facing early access period, while Clair Obscur director Guillaume Broche said earlier in May (viaMP1st) that it would've taken years to get the project approved at his former companyUbisoft. \"[Publishers] want mass appeal,\" Gaider said. \"They want to feel comfortable, de-risk it by imagining how the appeal translates to many different kinds of audiences, which I think often kind of ends up diluting the very specific things a game can do. Like I said, what BG3 did and what Expedition does is, yes, they appeal very, very strongly to that one audience, but it's so strong that it ends up growing that audience.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. He's not wrong. Coming up on two years after its full release, Baldur's Gate 3 remains among themost-played games on Steam, and while Clair Obscur has only been around for a month it's right up there too, posting enviable numbers for what should by rights be a relatively niche RPG—and both are rolling with \"overwhelmingly positive\" user ratings on top.

    "title": "Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford wades back into the Borderlands 4 pricing controversy: 'Game budgets are increasing ... it's getting gnarly out there'",
    "article_text": "Pitchford shared a recent video from PAX East to explain \"the truth\" about videogame pricing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford took some heat yesterday when he dismissed concerns aboutBorderlands 4potentially launching with an $80 price tag, saying on X that \"if you're a real fan, you'll find a way to make it happen.\" Today, in an effort to calm the roiling waters left in the wake of that ill-advised statement, he shared a brief video clip he described as \"the truth\" about Borderlands 4 pricing, and the \"reality\" of the rising costs of videogame development. The clip was actuallyrecorded a couple weeks agoat PAX East, but Pitchford reshared it earlier today because it's definitely relevant to the controversy of the moment, and provides a slightly more nuanced take on the matter of game pricing. Pitchford begins by saying he doesn't know what the price of Borderlands 4 will be, but then dips into why higher prices across the board are almost certainly on the horizon. \"On one level we've got a competitive marketplace where people that make those [pricing] choices want to sell as many units as possible, and they want to be careful about people that are price sensitive,\" Pitchford says in the clip. \"So there's some folks that don't want to see the prices go up—even the ones deciding what the prices are. \"There's other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing and there's tariffs for the retail packaging, and like—it's getting gnarly out there, you guys. Borderlands 4 has more than twice the development budget of Borderlands 3. More than twice.\" And that, he continued, is \"why Borderlands 4 is so awesome: Because you guys showed up and supported Borderlands 3 and we had the budget so we could more than double the budget [of Borderlands 4] and feel confident in that. And that's awesome, when the revenue comes in we could spend it to make better bigger games and better games.\" There's no doubt that videogame development costs have exploded, but I can't shake the feeling that Borderlands 4 costing twice as much to make as Borderlands 3 isn't so much \"awesome\" as it is a reflection of the inherent unsustainability of big-budget game development. Simply put, is Borderlands 4 going to be twice as good as Borderlands 3? I'm going to guess not: It's nice to have lots of money to throw around but no guarantee of quality or, more importantly, success—and as we've seen with recent releases likeDragon Age: The Veilguard, \"success\" is a highly malleable term, subject to the whims of the C-suite. If you want the truth, here it is: pic.twitter.com/3bqdA5gIU2May 21, 2025 Pitchford's biggest problem, though, isn't the reality of our capitalist society, but the nature of his original messaging that left everyone so cold, and today's post doesn't seem to have changed many minds. While there's some sympathy for his kinder, gentler approach to Borderlands 4 pricing in this PAX video, plenty of anger remains, as do assumptions that the new Borderlands will launch at $80 for the standard edition. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"The thing that you guys need to realize is that most people don't care what your game's budget is,\"PanicRollingwrote in reply to Pitchford's post. \"It is your own fault that you decided to spend 'more than twice' what BL3 cost to make this one, and I almost promise your game is going to fail financially because of that decision.\" \"Videogames aren't food, they're entertainment and each game is fighting for a customer's money and time,\"GetFitWithJaredwrote in a separate reply. \"If gamers feel that $80 is too much for one game, they're going to move on to something more affordable and not look back.\" Maybe inevitably, Pitchford didn't help himself on that front with his closing remarks. \"If it is cheaper [than $80] then maybe we'll sell you that minimap that you guys want, but we'll develop later,\" he said. \"How bad do you want that? 10 bucks?\" He then repeated, \"I'm just kidding!Or am I?\" no fewer than three times, to awkward silence.

    "title": "The Witcher 3's development took CDPR from 'How do we escape annihilation?' to having Sony on speed-dial",
    "article_text": "A meteoric rise with, uh, a few bumps along the way. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 10 years on from its release,The Witcher 3is unequivocally a phenomenon—one of the bestselling games of all time that turned CDPR from a relatively small studio that makes niche RPGs to one that excites a level of interest comparable to, well,Bethesda. But if you think that success was easily come by, guess again. When I sat down with CDPR devs to talk about their memories of working on the game that would light the touchpaper on the studio's meteoric ascent, they mostly remembered a whole bunch of challenges. \"That was a very tricky period for the company,\" says CDPR co-CEO Michał Nowkowski of the very, very start of The Witcher 3's development—before the company had even released The Witcher 2. \"We just went off the crisis that was 2008, 2009, and I was really deeply involved with, like, making sure we don't fall apart.\" The world economy was circling the drain and CDPR was struggling to stay afloat in the turmoil: \"The early days were quite—for me, personally—focused on 'How do we escape annihilation?'\" The release of The Witcher 2 put CDPR \"in a better shape, but not in a perfect one,\" but it wasn't exactly smooth sailing from there. The studio's big ambition to evolve the closed hubs of The Witcher 1 and 2 to a huge open world proved to be a stumbling block more than once. \"We didn't know exactly how it's going to be done,\" says Kajetan Kapuscinski, who worked as a cinematic artist on The Witcher 3. \"Maybe this lack of knowledge was kind of a blessing at this point, because the scale of the game, trying to make an open world game, created new challenges that we couldn't have imagined beforehand.\" Those challenges were, well, pretty much everywhere. CDPR had to figure out how to integrate monster contracts in a game where players could stumble across and kill their bounty before they even picked up the quest, and how to lay out quests where a player might pop into a dungeon through the back entrance and read all the carefully placed journal entries out of order. Above those challenges was the big picture: How on Earth would they make entirely different quests influence each other when they had no idea what order people would do them in? To celebrate its 10th anniversary, all this week we're looking back on The Witcher 3—and looking ahead to its upcoming sequel, too.Keep checking backfor more features and retrospectives, as well as in-depth interviews with the developers who brought the game to life. Even studio head (and CDPR's other CEO) Adam Badowski got in on the fun when he pointed out that, since the game had all sorts of bodies of water in it, they were gonna have to put swimming in. \"'I asked a very difficult question,\" says Badowksi, \"'there's water, where's swimming?' The whole room was quiet. If there's water, there's swimming, if there's swimming, there's diving, if there's diving, you have to build completely new locations.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For a little bit, the devs scrabbled around to figure out how tocutenough of the game that they wouldn't have to put swimming in and generate—in effect—a whole new underwater open world. Eventually they opted to let Geralt go for a splash. There were other issues, too. \"I remember this conversation with one of the programmers,\" recalls Kapuscinski, who played a key role in creatingthe dynamic, cinematic dialogue scenes. \"I was asking, 'Okay, could I make Geralt, you know, move two steps to the right?' He was like, 'No, it's not possible.' That's where we started.\" The devs were, all throughout the creation of the game, having to invent their way around problems that, perhaps, weren't quite apparent when they first decided to put Geralt in an open world. It never really got easier. Witcher 3 quest designer Blazej Augustnyek says that when the team felt like it had pretty much finished, \"I remember, I think it was someone from the board saying, 'Yeah, this plays great, but the world is empty. There's nothing but quests.' \"It turns out, in an open world, you have to have other stuff, right? So we created this little strike team.\" That strike team had the task of filling The Witcher 3's world with \"meaningful content,\" most of which you'll probably remember as the question marks strewn across the world map. Meanwhile, on the other side of the equation, concerns that the game was overstuffed—justtoo big—led devs to cut questlines like the one that would have seen Geralt join the Wild Hunt itself as a spy. Still, it all paid off. The game came out and, as you're probably dimly aware, proceeded to become one of the biggest games of all time. \"It opened the door to conversations with everybody as well,\" says Nowakowski. \"It's not like nobody wanted to talk to us before but, you know, once you have Witcher 3 in your portfolio, it's a little bit different… I mean, we launched Witcher 3—PlayStation [was] working on the next console—Mark Cerny comes down to Warsaw to talk to our engineering team and saying he's very impressed with what we did, and he couldn't believe we managed to cram that game in the PS4. \"And then we have a private, whole-day chat with Mark Cerny, the architect of PlayStation, talking about what we would need in the next PlayStation that could help us make it even better. That was something very new and fresh for us, that was not the kind of attention we were used to.\" Not bad for a studio that started its game worrying about whether it would be able to pay its staff.

    "title": "Live service games are 'innovating' all the way back around to what worked 20 years ago, except way worse",
    "article_text": "What's old is new again. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The kids are intoFortnite, forever and always, but what exactly being into \"Fortnite\" means is a moving target these days. Lately, Epic Games has decided the future of Fortnite is to become Roblox by expanding its battle royale with a free toolset for creating and publishing games within Fortnite, and incentivizing participation with a revenue share program based on engagement. Some veteran game developers are giving Fortnite a real go, laying down swords bloodied with Steam wishlist requests and joining the ranks of Tim Sweeney's content army. One such outfit is Teravision Games, developer of 2024'sKiller Klowns from Outer Space. In a recent profile byIGN, Teravision said the studio has experienced the same struggles as the rest of the industry during the most volatile time in gamedev history, and describes its short time making UEFN (Unreal Engine for Fortnite) games as a \"dream come true.\" Teravision's first Fortnite release, a little roguelike where you shoot your way up floors of a hotel, did well enough to justify making two more in the last year. Teravision's latest UEFN project, Courtyard King, is an officially licensed The Walking Dead game where players pick a faction and play King of the Hill on a map inspired by the show's prison (you know, that place with the Governor I haven't thought about since 2013). Courtyard King's most \"unique\" element, according to the profile, is how it never ends. \"Players can drop in and drop out whenever they want,\" said creative director LD Zambrano. \"They can even change teams whenever they like, which generates situations for betrayals. Maybe you enter a party with your friend, but then in the middle of the match you don’t tell him and change teams. Which is very Walking Dead-like.\" Infinite respawns, never-ending matches, rotating objectives, drop in/drop out friendly rules—holy crap, Fortnite creatorsinnovatedso hard they just invented '90s FPS server culture. What's old is new, time is a flat circle, so on and so forth. It's nice to see live service games coming back around to what PC games understood by the early aughts: Great multiplayer shootersgive players lots of different things to do, and the best ones foster an environment of modding and curation. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Courtyard King's 24/7 meatgrinder (and the dozens of similar deathmatch lobbies in Fortnite's feed) are anomalous among a generation of shooters with strictly regimented matchmaking and modes designed to play exactly one way, but it's nothing new to those of us who spent our afternoons server surfing in Garry's Mod, voting for 2Fort CTF in Team Fortress 2, running Rocket Race in Halo 3, or in a slightly older age, hogging the phone line for hours to play Quake Rocket Arena. That's just what a huge corner of multiplayer gamingwasfor a long time: A playground where recess never ended. Modes provided structure, but they weren't always prescriptive. Multiplayer shooters used to be places, not services. When I played Day of Defeat: Source almost daily in high school, I'd hop between two to three servers, sometimes based on activity, but usually based on the distinct map pools, modes, and vibes I knew those servers to have. Some took the game seriously, others were chat rooms. Sometimes I'd capture zones like you're supposed to do, and sometimes I'd just mindlessly shoot while chatting with friends, or when that got boring, create my own stealth challenges by hiding in dark corners and going for knife kills. Multiplayer shooters used to be places, not services. I was enraptured by this silly WW2 shooter that Valve had all but abandoned years earlier, not because the guns looked better than Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 (they did not), but because Day of Defeat was a canvas for whatever antics we were in the mood for. I came to click heads, but honestly, I stayed for the hangout. That's where Fortnite's UEFN scheme utterly fails. Epic calls the arrangement innovative. I see a worse version of the community-driven multiplayer scenes we had decades before. There is no sense of community among the hundreds of disparate Fortnite games competing for attention. Matchmaking is still totally centralized, so you can't hope to recognize regulars or seed your favorite modes unless you party up. Then there's the actual content of the community modes, which largely suck. Scroll past all the Epic-developed stuff and you'll find yourself waist-deep in a rank, disreputable sea of \"tycoon\" simulators and half-assed idle clickers designed to farm hours. It's a noxious cocktail of boundless creativity and deep-rooted cynicism—a place where the most popular games are shameless reskins of 11 other games, and genuine novelty is deliberately difficult to find. Epic has created Garry's Mod for slop artists. One obvious consequence of paying creators based on engagement is that every UEFN game bombards you with progression paths, upgrades, and pseudo-battle pass FOMO, no matter the context and regardless of whether it makes any sense. Courtyard Kings is a good example: Every time you respawn, you're taken back to a hub where you can spend coins to buy permanent advantages over other players—more health, better guns, straight-up damage buffs. That means people who've been grinding Courtyard Kings for a week can easily mow down folks checking it out for the first time. It's a pretty horrible experience, and the kind of design choice nobody would ever land on when trying to make a fun arena shooter. Unfortunately, the shooting part is secondary to the numbers-go-up part that actually pays the bills. Toolsets like UEFN should be elevating weird, creative remixes of Fortnite that push its boundaries. But there is no joy on Fortnite's front page, just engagement traps. Fortnite, and by extension Roblox, are adopting the shape of classic server culture, but they don't understand or seem particularly interested in what made those FPS scenes special—ironic, considering Epic's roots in Unreal Tournament. The good news is that many of the older shooters I mentioned still boast live servers bolstered by loyal communities, and they're way more fun than Fortnite anyway.

    "article_text": "That sounds good to me. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The sequel toCyberpunk 2077was announced a couple of years agoduring an investors' presentation—but all we were told was that it was only in the early stages of development. Since then, we've not heard a whole lot about Project Orion, but that's where Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith comes in. During an interview withtvgryas part of the Digital Dragons event, Pondsmith discussed his history with Cyberpunk from its inception to the development of Cyberpunk 2077 to Project Orion. \"I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining the new place in Orion that we visit,\" Pondsmith says. \"I remember looking at it and going 'Yeah, I understand the feeling that you're going for with this, and this really does work.' And it doesn't feel like Blade Runner, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong.\" Chicago gone wrong is a wild descriptor, but I kind of get it. I've never been to Chicago, but a Cyberpunk game set in its clustered urban environment with all the railroads, frozen rivers, and industrial sites sounds really cool and exactly the kind of new place I'd love to explore in the sequel. It also seems like a great alternative to the iconic Night City, which was sleek but gaudy with its neon signs and glass skyscrapers. A more industrial, lived-in take on Cyberpunk seems like a great idea. And Pondsmith saying that \"I can see this working\" is all the reassurance I need.

At 1:24, he reads a tweet posted during The Game Awards reveal, bemoaning the \"entire Game Awards chat spamming 'woke' because the Witcher 4 has you playing as Ciri\". \"It's not woke,\" he says. \"There's nothing woke about it. It's a cool character from The Witcher and they're going to focus on that character. I think that's awesome. We can't just have Geralt for every single game for The Witcher ad nauseum out through eternity. Besides, we've seen the end of Geralt's journey. Blood and Wine was supposed to wrap up Geralt's journey. I celebrate Ciri; I celebrate her being the protagonist.\" Cockle goes on to advise the impotent Ciri-haters to read the books. \"If you read the books, then you understand why CD Projekt went down this avenue—there's a whole rich world of stuff to explore with Ciri that they didn't do when they put her into The Witcher 3 because the story was about Geralt. But she hints at it. If you think it's woke, read the damn books. They're good, first of all. And secondly, you won't think it's so woke anymore.\" Unsurprisingly, I completely agree with Cockle, though I am so incredibly tired of \"woke\" still being this pejorative spat about by the most unimaginative, toothless nerds. It simply means you're aware of injustice and bigotry. It's like the absolute bare minimum for not being an ignorant muppet. So we should celebrate accusations of wokeness. It's a lovely (if accidental) compliment. Granted a female protagonist isn't woke, because acknowledging the mere existence of 50% of humanity is a million miles away from being alert to systemic injustice. Anyway! While I'm really looking forward to playing as Ciri, who's a flipping badass, I still hope we'll hear more of Cockle's voice and see more of Geralt down the line, as more than just a cameo.

    "article_text": "TGP to the max. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you're lucky enough to have your hands on an RTX 50-series gaming laptop, you might be in store for a small performance boost Well, actually, you've probably already received it if you keep your graphics drivers up to date, because this boost comes in the form of a fix packaged in with the latest Nvidia driver. The fix is packaged in the latest 576.52 GeForce Game Ready Driver, released just a couple of days ago. According toNvidia(viaVideoCardz), what's now fixed was a previous issue that meant the \"GeForce RTX 50 series [notebook GPU] TGP limit may be clipped earlier.\" This is strange phrasing, but it essentially means that there was previously a problem with RTX 50-series mobile GPUs getting up to their maximum rated TGPs, ie, their maximum power draw. TheRTX 5090's TGP, for instance, is rated up to a base 150 W but should be able to reach 175 W with Dynamic Boost by shifting power from the CPU to the GPU when needed, such as when gaming in a GPU-bound game. In practice, however, we at PC Gamer and some others found the RTX 5090 andRTX 5080never actually hit 175 W at any point. This, of course, translates to extra game performance being left on the shelf, untapped. The latest drivers, according to the forum post, even if not the official release notes (fixed it on the sly, huh, Nvidia?), seem to have fixed this problem, removing unnecessary throttles from the GPUs living up to their promised max potential. Of course, this doesn't mean that every laptop with an RTX 5080 or RTX 5090 inside will be able to hit it—much will depend on the laptop form factor and thermals. It's doubtful whether theRazer Blade 16 2025, for instance, and despite it being in our view thebest gaming laptopright now, will be able to hit it due to how slim it is.

    "title": "Ducky's year of the snake keyboard is my favourite shown off at Computex so far, and it's limited to just 2025 units",
    "article_text": "It's much prettier than 2013's year of the snake model. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I have a bit of a soft spot for Ducky, and itsOne 3Matcha keyboard was one of my most used of 2023, only partially because of how gorgeous it looks. Not one to disappoint in aesthetics, its new year of the snake keyboard is so pretty that I'm preemptively sad I won't be one of the 2025 lucky enough to actually use one. However, our Jacob managed to get a look atComputex 2025, in Taipei, Taiwan—and he's proven to have better willpower than I for not sneaking it out under his vest. As you can see in the bottom right-hand corner, each keyboard is numbered between 1 to 2025, with the Computex stand model being number 1348. The 2025 units available are relatively large when compared to the equally droolworthyyear of the dragon editionlast year, which only got 999 units. This year's model is aTinker 75, which is a 75% keyboard with hot-swappable switches. The new model is much more colourful than last year's, with splashes of pink, cream, off-white, and a hint of black to really make the more vibrant colours shine. If you catch a peek of the keys from the wrong angle, you may believe they are insignia or abstract designs of some form, but it's a standard QWERTY keyboard (or should I say a QUIRKY one?). The G is perhaps the most prominent interpretation of its relative key, and the U may be the hardest to read. With how rare this keyboard is likely to be, it would be better served as an ornament instead, and its looks and relatively hard-to-read keys certainly contribute to that idea. Ducky actually launched a year of the snake-themedkeyboard back in 2013, which, as you may be able to guess, was also the year of the snake. However, the older model looks like a much more standard keyboard, being almost all grey, with a snake on the space bar and a few symbols throughout the board.

Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. It's a more muted aesthetic and shows how much Ducky has come on in the looks department over the last 12 years. 'A lot' is the answer. Once you flip over the 2025 year of the snake Ducky keyboard, it gets even better. In the centre of the back is a two-piped flute, with a dragon wrapping around it. That same imagery is also present on the space bar. This isn't the first Tinker 75 keyboard that has wowed me, with theNuka Cola modellooking particularly clean. The year of the snake edition is my favourite Tinker 75 yet. It's just a shame I won't actually see it for myself.

    "title": "Cherry proclaims a 'new era' for keyboard switches: induction is 'half the cost of a regular mechanical switch', more reliable, and less power hungry than analog alternatives",
    "article_text": "Though whether it gets used for analog gaming keyboards is up to keyboard makers—Cherry says it is aiming at the mass market. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When you think of Cherry, you think of the Cherry MX switch or the fruit. I'm talking about the former today, as the company behind the world's most renowned mechanical switch tells me it's in a 'new era' with its latest, the Cherry IK. Move aside, mechanical. Cherry IK are analogue induction switches and, speaking to Gunnar Schreck, Cherry global product manager, atComputex 2025, I'm told they're more reliable, flexible, and somehow cheaper to manufacture than mechanical. \"So if you have a TMR or the old generation Hall effect switches, you need a sensor to read out the signal. And these sensors make those solutions very expensive,\" says Cherry's Schreck. \"So our technology works without the sensor.\" How doesthatwork? I'm way ahead of you, asking Schreck exactly that moments later. \"It uses a very basic electronic component, which is called a comparator. And with this, basically all the workload is done by the MCU [microcontroller] on the keyboard, and that drives the cost massively down to a level where the switch is even cheaper than our MX switch.\" That means no magnet, only metal, and makes for a \"contactless\" actuation. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Cherry's MX switch is a well-known entity in the gaming and wider keyboard industry, and no doubt the economies of scale are working tremendously in Cherry's favour after many years of making absolutely heaps of them, which is why this cost analysis for IK is hella surprising. But there's more to these switches than cost savings, Schreck says. These switches also have a \"higher lifetime, because you don't have the abrasion on the mechanical contact system anymore. It feels better because when a mechanical switch is pressed, the contact system is pressing sidewards against the stem when it goes down, so that is gone now. \"We're also more free in which materials we want to use. Why? Because the MX needed to be heat resistant for the soldering process.\" One material that could be used for a smoother switch is POM, or Polyoxymethylene, Schreck says, which wasn't possible on traditional mechanical switches due to heat. Cherry is aiming at the mass market with IK. That's not instead of the enthusiast/gaming segments, but that's also not really the target here. If these really are as cheap as Cherry says, we could see membrane office keyboards finally kick the bucket in favour of less pricey induction boards, which would be a pretty massive improvement. Though I suspect membrane will stick around like a cockroach after the apocalypse. As for gaming on IK, Cherry didn't totally rule it out, it's just not focusing too much on that market. It all comes down to making the MCU powerful enough to make gaming features like rapid trigger and fully analogue actuation possible. I asked Schreck whether rapid trigger or analogue features, such as those found on aWooting 80HEorNZXT Function Elite(to name a few), would be possible with IK. Here's what he said: \"In terms of performance, it's now up to you [keyboard manufacturers] to choose which MCU you want to use in your keyboard. The higher the processing power of the MCU, maybe you could do more of that stuff. The switch itself is dumb. The switch doesn't care so much.\" It's worth noting that Cherry has also announced a new MK Series of magnetic switches that are actually designed for gaming, and likely more of a match for existing Hall effect switches. And some more mechanical switches, so those aren't dead yet. So there are other options—tried and tested options that work very well—but Cherry seemed very excited by what inductive switches could deliver overall. \"We at Cherry say, after 30 years of MX, this is the old era. Our combustion engine. This [IK] is the new era.\" No wonder, really, considering these are reportedly half the cost to make versus mechanical switches, which I still cannot really get my head around. How much of that cost will need to go back into the PCB and MCU to actually use these switches isn't entirely clear yet, but clearly there will be an associated cost for beefing up the MCU for any truly analogue features, beyond reliability and feel. One thing I had to ask Cherry while I had them was whatever happened to its first wave of induction switches, MX Multipoint, which were announced and displayed at Computex 2024, as a part of Ducky's booth, then swiftly disappeared from the scene. Later in that same year, Ducky released a keyboard with induction switches, but these were notablynotCherry's MX Multipoint switches, but Ducky's own. You can read more about those in myDucky One X review. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. \"The first switch we did relied on a very specific sensor, which made the whole solution pretty expensive. Also, the results of the switch, like where the earliest actuation point is, were not so impressive. So this has been improved a lot by the new design.\" \"We have a much, much better response curve on the [IK] switch, and more precision, and much earlier activation.\" It all sounds quite promising for better, longer-lasting switches on many keyboards. I do hope Cherry sticks it out with this lot. It'll be something to watch in the gaming space too, if a manufacturer tries to take advantage of these benefits for any gaming board, but it definitely sounds like we'll be sticking with Hall effect for the time being. I also spoke to Wooting at Computex, the company being the first to popularise analogue gaming keyboards, and it said the same thing: it's sticking with Hall effect for now. There's no rush to hop onto the next new thing for gaming, then, but someone is sure to try. Cherry is keen to hop on the new thing regardless: Cherry IK comes out \"Fall 2025\".

    "article_text": "\"AI researchers are still doing AI research in China,\" say Jensen Huang. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Attempts by the US government to put a cap on China's development of AI technologies by limiting exports of GPUs has been a \"failure\". So says no less an authority on the subject than Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang. The New York Times quotes Huangat the ongoingComputex show in Taipei, Taiwandenouncing GPU export controls. \"AI researchers are still doing AI research in China,\" Huang said on Wednesday. \"If they don’t have enough Nvidia, they will use their own,\" he said. All of which means, \"the export control was a failure.\" He may have a point. But then Nvidia does rather have a dog in this fight. Huang himself says thatrestrictions on Nvidia's H20 GPU will cost the company $15 billion in sales. So, it's not hard to understand why he might prefer those limitations to be lifted. Just for context, back in 2022 the former Biden administration imposed limits on the export of the most powerful GPUs from the US into China. Into the void left by restricted Nvidia exports has moved local outfit Huawei, whose GPUs currently do not match those of Nvidia for AI prowess. However, the fear is that the GPU export restrictions have only encouraged Huawei to put even more effort into closing the gap. Indeed, according to the New York Times, Nvidia is concerned about just that, with an adjacent worry that, \"any advantage gained by Huawei in China could eventually spread into other markets, helping Huawei build a stronger foundation from which to compete around the world.\" Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. Meanwhile, it's a little difficult to gauge Jensen Huang's strategy and loyalties in all this. He recently appeared with other business leaders as a guest of the Trump administration in Saudi Arabia. But Nvidia has alsojust unveiled what will be a new Global headquarters in Taiwan, which doesn't entirely square with the broader push to reshore tech manufacturing to the US. Likewise, the New York Times reports that, \"the day after the US government opened an investigation into whether Nvidia's previous sales to China had violated its rules, Mr. Huang met with top economic and trade officials in Beijing.\" The plot, as they say, thickens. At the very least, it seems Huang and Nvidia are keeping their options fully open.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Bursting with ideas, enthusiasm, and a solid physics model, but JDM seems more preoccupied with throwing another idea in than polishing what’s already there. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. You’ll remember, of course, the drift events in classic Need for Speed. During that noughties era when the games were soundtracked by crunk songs, told quasi-Fast and Furious tales, and reached Christmas number one in the charts with the certainty of an X Factor winner, NFS introduced drifting as a sort of side-show. There was a totally different physics model underpinning it, one that made ordinary driving nigh-impossible but allowed for some outrageous skidding about in search of a high score. What is it?An open world racer with drifty physics and life sim elements.Release dateMay 21, 2025Expect to pay$35/£29DeveloperGaming FactoryPublisherGaming FactoryReviewed oni7 9700K, RTX 2080 TI, 16GB RAMSteam DeckTBALinkOfficial site JDM understands the nostalgic appetite for that era of NFS game—you can tell that by its car collection of noughties NFS cover stars. But its ambitions are far higher than the throwaway drift events in EA’s racers, and in fact higher than those games in their entirety. Here’s a game that wants to capture every nuance of drift culture and its Japanese origins, wants to tell you a story about an outsider in an insular community, a failing sushi delivery business and an unsolved murder all at once, all through the medium of anime comic panels. It’s also an open-world game with NPC storylines, with an impressive roster of licensed vehicles and a heaving catalogue of visual and performance parts for all of them. And at the nucleus is a driving discipline which most games treat as a momentary diversion. The handling model takes on crucial importance here. Not only does it need to make drifting fun, challenging, and vaguely authentic as a simulation, it also needs to make driving around the open world when you’re not powersliding for high scores feel pleasant. There are drag events, grip races and delivery runs in JDM’s event roster and in all of them, getting a drift going is a bad idea because it slows you down. It also offers arcade and sim handling options, with a range of assists within them. Is it versatile enough to pull that off? It is not. Using either arcade or sim physics, trying to drive your car conventionally around the narrow suburban streets of JDM’s fictional Japanese burgh always feels a bit awkward and that only comes to the fore when you race in track events. Fortunately, the drift physics are spot on. And that’s why I completely forgive it for not being Forza Horizon in a straight line. Once the steering angles are applied, It’s an odyssey of tire smoke and revs bouncing off the limiter. There’s such a pure sense of gratification to holding a drift angle in parallel with the angle of a turn, reminiscent of pulling off a nice long grind in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, it’s enough to make you care about drifting as much as Gaming Factory clearly does. That’s the other thing: this feels like a pleasantly personal game. It’s fascinated with esoterica that other games would brush past. How many stories have you read about a young Polish boy trying to ingratiate himself in a suburban Japanese community? Hardly any, is my guess. How many games let you clutch-kick during a drift, or mess about with your wheel alignment angle to fine-tune the sensation of mid-corner control? But JDM does, because it seems determined to be the alpha and omega of this one thing. And that’s smart. A small independent project like this isn’t going to topple Need For Speed, but it can put its flag resolutely in one specific piece of its territory. You know how it goes with ambitious, eccentric passion projects, though: there are rough edges. And boy howdy, you could lose a few layers of skin brushing against this thing. Know that I take no pleasure in reciting this list. There are translation issues (an early tutorial message explains how ‘breaking’ to slow the car works). There are optimization issues. And I say that with the considerable qualification that my RTX 2080 TI is no longer the frame-vaporizing powerhouse it once was—I’m fine with not hitting max settings if the pixel fidelity’s appropriately high, but JDM’s scenes just don’t justify the chug. Loading screens are onscreen more often than they should be, hanging around for just a few extra seconds whenever you teleport between garages on the map, enter or exit a mission. And the map markers sometimes blend into the map detail. It takes too long to turn a page in the anime sections (really, though). After completing an event, there’s five to ten seconds of awkwardness, waiting for the UI to show you various messages about things you just unlocked, levelled up, or completed, before it’ll show you the next mission on the map. Trying to set that mission location as a waypoint and have the map show you a route there is not a foregone conclusion. There are odd difficulty spikes, and other events at which the AI drivers seem fairly hapless. So it goes, throughout the game’s five chapters. If you look for them, you’ll see morsels of jank just about everywhere. Some are pretty inconsequential, or even endearing (there’s an earnestness to the storytelling in those comic panels that’s hard to hate, however basic the component parts may be), but a couple—the performance and AI issues—are harder to turn a blind eye to. It leaves you with the sense that there’s a brilliant game in here which isn’t releasing in its final form. But since this isn’t an Early Access release, and indeed Gaming Factory ran a demo and collected plenty of feedback from it earlier this year, I can’t ignore the rough bits just because I like the game. Nor can I ignore the awkwardness JDM evokes when it delves into 'impress the busty anime girl with your drifting skills' territory. One mission has you giving your friend a lift home and amassing drift points to raise her excitement level, with accompanying facial expressions. All I can say is that those diversions do nothing for me. However: mechanically and (for the most part) conceptually, I really like the game. I want it to succeed. It’s so inventive with its mission types, switching between Crazy Taxi-esque sushi delivery runs in which you’re scored on damage taken and style points, duels against unfriendly locals, and helping your influencer friend to create content (whatever she’s saying on camera simply shows up as ‘Blah blah blah’ in the comic panels). It’s generous with its unlocks and currency rewards. It actually wants you to buy all the cars on its roster and tune them so that they feel like your own. And it really succeeds as a walk-in encyclopedia of Japanese tuner and touge culture, taking every opportunity in NPC interactions, training missions, and loading menu text to add another tidbit about the discipline’s history and evolutions. And over the course of the next year or so, its rough edges probably will be sanded down. Probably. I can only play and evaluate the game as it appears today though, and that game doesn’t always let JDM’s best qualities shine. Bursting with ideas, enthusiasm, and a solid physics model, but JDM seems more preoccupied with throwing another idea in than polishing what’s already there.

    "article_text": "If it's not your own, give back the bone. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Bones are cool, bones are fun—just make sure you pop them back when you're done. Indeed, Jacob, one of our intrepid Computex 2025 reporters, took these words to heart when Havn let him play with their funky fake skull. The aforementioned metallic noggin' is currently on display as part of their soon-to-be-released Doom special edition PC case—and Jacob didn't even try to run off with it. This may be one reason why I have yet to be invited to Taipei. Joking aside, the case in question is a very snazzy special edition of Havn's HS 420 PC case. Our Jacob already rated this case in hisHS 420 VGPU review, rating it so highly that it's still our top pick overall for thebest PC caseyou can spend your hard-earned cash on. ThisDoom: The Dark Agesspecial edition case comes in Doomslayer green, featuring white sigils screen printed upon the fishtank-style glass front panels, with not one but TWO metallic skulls to judge your whiffed shield bashes. Final retail details have yet to be confirmed, but the Doom special edition PC case will be available in the near future at a similar price point to the standard, non-VGPU version of the HS 420. I mean, sure, for that price you could pick up almost 30 of thesefoam skulls from Epic Armouryand be arealnuisance at your next LARP event—not that I'm speaking from experience. Leaping away from that implication at Doom Eternal speed, a limited number of this special edition case are likely to be available worldwide. Just how limited? Well, let's just say it's likely to be at least a few more than the Doom Edition ROG AstralRTX 5080graphics cardsgoing for $2,000 a pop. Look closely at the image above and you'll see the two skulls inside the case. The larger on on the right hand side has been hollowed out so you can slot your closed loop liquid cooling reservoir underneath it, and the little one looks to be a somewhat macabre way to support your expansive and expensive Doom-themed GPU. Doom guys, girls, and others have been especially well fed this year—just for a start, that ROG RTX 5080 GPU isn't even the only50-series card getting a Doom: The Dark Ages makeover.

    "title": "Monster Train 2 review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. An all-time great deckbuilder gets a sequel worth risking God’s wrath for. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. What is it?A devilish deckbuilder with an inspired injection of tower defence.Release dateMay 21, 2025Expect to pay$25 / £21DeveloperShiny ShoePublisherBig Fan GamesReviewed onGigabyte G5,ASUS Rog AllySteam DeckVerifiedLinkOfficial site I’ve been more hyped for this sequel than I am for the return of Christ. And if you didn’t care for that bit of blasphemy, then Monster Train, a game about helping the demons of Hell defeat the goody two-shoes of Heaven, is likely not for you. Everyone else, though, should get ready to play a roguelike deckbuilder that’s every bit the equal to Slay the Spire and Balatro. Hyperbole? Hardly.Monster Trainwas one of 2020’s few pleasant surprises. A game thatshamelessly ripped offsmartly built on Slay the Spire’s structure with a welcome layer of tower defence. Structurally, this sequel is near-identical. You still occupy a fancy four-floor train, with a fragile pyre you need to protect occupying the top floor. Every turn several enemies rudely break into your train via floor one. The fools telegraph exactly how they’re going to attack so you can plan accordingly, and any surviving enemy at the end of each turn ascends one floor closer to that crucial pyre. To defend it, you have a deck of spells and the all-important monsters that you strategically place on each floor of the train. It’s often as chaotic—and exhilarating—as playing three games of Slay the Spire at once. Each deck is made up of a unique clan of monsters, and these are what had had the original Monster Train troubling ‘best deckbuilder ever’ lists. I adored the Melting Remnant, a zombie-like race of candle people who could temporarily be brought back from the dead. Other monsters in that same deck had a ‘harvest’ ability, which buffed them whenever a monster died. This was such a brilliant fit with a deck full of constantly-returning undead that it managed to make zombies feel fresh in a videogame again. And Monster Train 2’s most audacious move is to take all those brilliant cards and tear most of them up. Start the game, and the decks that introduced you to the first Monster Train are nowhere to be seen. Instead, you get the Pyreborn, a clan of gold-hoarding dragons, and the Banished, angels who are now workingwiththe forces of Hell. The Pyrebound can cover enemy units in pyregel, which increases the damage they’ll take. They also gain Dragon’s Hoard, a new currency that can be exchanged for increasingly generous rewards. Both these ideas are immediately more interesting than the Hellborn that opened the last game, whose cards were easily the most simple. That’s because they were more a tutorial deck to get you up to speed, something Monster Train 2 could justly be accused of lacking. Still, there’s worse sins for a sequel to commit than being overexcited to show you new stuff. They’re sentient mushrooms whose powers revolve around spawning and decaying. Like the other starter deck, the Banished, which is all about constantly moving units and gaining valor. Valor is a buff that gives more attack power, and at the end of each turn more armor, but only if they’re at the front. So if you want that armor bonus, you’re going to have to risk putting your poor monsters directly into the line of fire. I’m not planning on visiting Hell myself, so I won’t spoil every new clan, but I’m hopelessly in love with the Underlegion. They’re sentient mushrooms whose powers revolve around spawning and decaying. Certain cards will spawn a funguy, a laughably weak lil shroom who at least serves as an effective shield for my more important monsters. Except spawning more funguy on the same floor doesn’t add another. It ‘stacks’, essentially buffing the first funguy with more health and strength. Another monster has the power to spawn two more funguy stacks at the end of every turn, andanothergives the funguy an attack boostandthe ability to ‘trample’, which means any overflowing damage from a successful enemy-slaying will carry over to the next. Steadily you can Magikarp your funguy into a monster that rivals anything in the game. Decay is a nasty status effect that inflicts a set amount of damage every turn. Lots of the Underlegions monsters and spells can inflict it, but one monster in particular, my special horrid mushroom boy, inflicts three decay on all enemies every time you summon a monster. Oh, and spawning another stack of funguyabsolutelycounts as a summon. I can’t tell you how many runs I’ve lost because I’ve been stubbornly trying to create a self-sustaining engine of spawning and decaying that means no foe will even get a glimpse of my pyre. Monster Train 2 is full of these delightful synergies. Each run is played with two clan decks combined, so the fun comes from trying to discover and create them. What if I used the Banished clan with the Underlegions? A clan that offers armor bonuses to the front unit and a clan that’s all about making an increasingly strong front unit has to be a match made in Hell, right? The best synergies feel like you’ve broken the game. Occasionally you have, but Monster Train remains the master of tricking you into feeling like you’re playing a duller deckbuilder with all the cheats on. Between bouts you’ll be offered incredible rewards, like the ability to clone almost any card in your deck, or upgrades to your monsters like multistrike or huge boosts in attack power. Artifacts, powerful talismans with potentially battle-winning power-ups (think Balatro’s jokers), are also unlimited and often handed out like sweets. For every gift it gives, it brutally counters with a terrific new bestiary of enemies and bosses. But the game is no pushover. For every gift it gives, it brutally counters with a terrific new bestiary of enemies and bosses. One flies between floors, doing instant damage to the pyre if it finds no monsters there—a clever reprimand of my foolish ‘just ignore the other two floors and focus on one’ strategy. Some opponents gain a truly horrible amount of power every time they climb a floor or you play a spell card. But because the game has givenyouso much power, it rarely feels unfair. Which bosses you face changes between runs too, keeping things feeling fresh. All true of the last game, but the fact they’ve been able to introduce five great new clans along with new artifacts, spells, enemies and curveballs without breaking that balance makes for one Hell of an encore. A new undo button is a godsend, even if I can no longer blame a misplaced click for screwing up. There’s also now a deployment phase where you have access to most of the monsters in your deck and can play them before the battle starts properly. It's a great change that cuts down on the RNG massively. Do youreallywant to lose because God decided you were only going to draw spell cards for the first three turns? New room cards set a rule on an entire floor, like bonus energy when units die, or a wonderfully risky one that deals 50 damage to everyone at the end of each turn. Equipment cards are also new, offering permanent buffs when applied. Stick an equipment card that grants multistrike on one of your monsters and you can likely guess what happens next. Ah, but Monster Train never met a simple game mechanic that it couldn’t resist complicating and pumping full of steroids. All two of you who were hoping for a more narrative-heavy Monster Train sequel are in luck. So there’s a new clan of mad scientists, with grunts that drop valuableequipment upon death, encouraging you to kill your own monsters. There’s also a monster who gains attack power and health every time you attach some equipment to it, and this boost persists between battles. Will I ever learn to stop screwing myself over because I can’t resist the Faustian bargain of persistent buffs? Maybe in Monster Train 3… Let’s take a break from all this praise for a moment to talk about the story. All two of you who were hoping for a more narrative-heavy Monster Train sequel are in luck. The rest of us have to click through several cutscenes that occasionally pop up between runs, or ‘comedy’ vignettes between the characters. None of this is terrible, but I much preferred the last game’s storytelling, where you got hints of its wider world through chance encounters on runs, or creatures near the track you could click on for more lore if you wanted it. Anyone hoping for a revolution will also admittedly be disappointed. This is definitely a sequel that adds new ideas to the old train engine, rather than trying something completely original. But Monster Train’s terrific locomotive didn’t need an overhaul, and when there’s so many brilliant ideas in the huge roster of new cards, it feels churlish to complain. Sixty hours in and I still feel like I’ve only scratched the surface. Slay the Spire 2 might have to grant access to actual Heaven to top this.

    "article_text": "It is a very big PC case. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I present to you the hoo-mamma of PC cases, the tube of Babel, El Capitan Lite, the 'doubles as a cryochamber', the Chonka 9000, the Compensator, the Pillar to Prometheus, the Modern Megalith, the Slabomatic, the… you get the idea. This is one chonky PC case, and it's out there right now in the halls of Computex Taipei, sitting, waiting. That's no joke on the 'waiting', either, because this case from Geometric Future has a power button that's activated by a proximity sensor, although it didn't seem to be working when our Jacob Ridley approached it—trepidatiously—on the Computex show floor. The one pictured above is the Model 9, and to be more direct, now: Doesn't it look like something straight out of a sci-fi movie? Or Death Stranding, perhaps. Though perhaps I shouldn't be surprised, given we already knew Geometric Futureisn't exactly shywith pushing the boat out for its case designs, big or small. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. The big yellow button you see at the top right is the power button, but as I said, it's meant to be activated by proximity. The portion above the curved fish tank that houses the components is hidden. It presumably houses a liquid reservoir for custom loops, and this is what, more than anything, gives it its imposing look. We've seen similar approaches to cooling before, with sectioned-off areas for liquid radiators or reservoirs, for instance with theHP Omen 45L, but not quite to this extent. It is, of course, a full-tower case, and it's made out of aluminium, steel, and tempered glass and measures in at 750 x 288 x 563 mm. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Apart from being mighty large, it'll also probably be mighty heavy. That's because although the one on show has an acrylic window, it'll have tempered glass when it ships. So it certainly won't be portable, and it probably won't be ideal for a PC you intend to do a lot of fiddling around with after an initial build. What it will be ideal for, though, is as a statement piece, monument, or landmark. I'd particularly like the PC Gamer hardware team to get one of these to use as a landmark. 'Looking for the hardware team? Yeah, just look for the monument erected to the technology gods, you won't miss it.' Jacob got his hands on a gaming PC for the first time when he was about 12 years old. He swiftly realised the local PC repair store had ripped him off with his build and vowed never to let another soul build his rig again. With this vow, Jacob the hardware junkie was born. Since then, Jacob's led a double-life as part-hardware geek, part-philosophy nerd, first working as a Hardware Writer for PCGamesN in 2020, then working towards a PhD in Philosophy for a few years (result pending a patiently awaited viva exam) while freelancing on the side for sites such as TechRadar, Pocket-lint, and yours truly, PC Gamer.

    "title": "Hate RGB software but still want all the pretty LEDs on your AIO cooler? Lian Li might just have the very thing for you",
    "article_text": "You can still control it all through an app, but I like the twist-n-go simplicity. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you're a maker of AIO liquid CPU coolers, it's getting harder to stand out in the crowd. Just about every vendor has something that boasts an additional VRM fan, cable-free fan connections, or a massive LCD screen, so what more can you offer to the discerning buyer? Lian Li reckons that simplicity is what's missing in the market, and its forthcoming Hydroshift 2 LCD-C CL cooler keeps things as simple as it can (even if the name has an awful lot of Ls and Cs). We were given a demonstration of the new cooler at this year's Computex event, and at first glance, the Hydroshift 2 LCD-C CL just looks like any other liquid cooler. The one thing that perhaps all coolers share is clunky RGB software, though, and despite the best efforts of the likes of Corsair with its iCUE package, changing the colours or patterns isn't as straightforward or quick as changing the DPI on a gaming mouse, for example. Well, that's the first feature of Lian Li's new cooler. The RGB LEDs in the fans and pump unit can be controlled via an app, but if such things give you the heebie-jeebies, then fear not, because all you need to do is twist a dial on the pump, and that's a bingo! Fresh new colours and whatnot. But let's say that it's not the software that you dislike, with RGB-toting AIO coolers, but all the wires that you have to use to connect the fans together, and then again to your PC to control them. The new Hydroshift sports cheaper versions of Lian Li'sSL Wirelessrange, which as the name suggests, uses a 2.4 GHz wireless connection for RGB and fan speed control. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. The fans themselves daisy-chain together via electrical contacts, rather than a nest of wires, making the whole setup and subsequent control as easy as pie. (Are pies easy? I've always found making decent pastry really quite hard!) Anyway, the whole shebang is topped off with a 2.1-inch LCD screen, which you can probably adorn with a picture of your face, looking all smug and satisfied with how simple and easy the Hydroshift 2 LCD-C CL has been to rig up and use. If that sounds like it's right up your street, then you won't need to wait very long to pick one up, because Lian Li is targeting May 29 as the launch date, with an MSRP of $180 for both black and white versions. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Of course, we don't know just how effective Lian Li's new cooler is or how quiet the fans and pumps are, but having got our sticky paws on it at Computex, we can confirm that itissimple to use and looks pretty nice, to boot. Nick, gaming, and computers all first met in 1981, with the love affair starting on a Sinclair ZX81 in kit form and a book on ZX Basic. He ended up becoming a physics and IT teacher, but by the late 1990s decided it was time to cut his teeth writing for a long defunct UK tech site. He went on to do the same at Madonion, helping to write the help files for 3DMark and PCMark. After a short stint working at Beyond3D.com, Nick joined Futuremark (MadOnion rebranded) full-time, as editor-in-chief for its gaming and hardware section, YouGamers. After the site shutdown, he became an engineering and computing lecturer for many years, but missed the writing bug. Cue four years at TechSpot.com and over 100 long articles on anything and everything. He freely admits to being far too obsessed with GPUs and open world grindy RPGs, but who isn't these days?

    "article_text": "Why, you ask? Allow me to explain. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Computex always delivers copious amounts of things that swivel and twist for who knows what reason—just askLian Li's motorised curved water cooler. But I didn't expect to see apower supplyof all things to get the swivel treatment. This power supply featuring swivelly tech is from Lian Li too, so let's go back and ask them what exactly is going on here. What's going on is the company has decided to make the power connector portion of a power supply rotatable by 90 degrees. My reaction to this came in three phases. First: What the hell is that for? Second: Oh, that's what it's for, but why the hell would you need that? Third: Oh,that'swhy you'd need that, that's hella cool. True story. The long and short of it is this seems to be something Lian Li has done to allow for different cable management in different systems. The power connector rotates onto one side of the PSU or another, meaning inside your case the power cables can jut out of it in one direction or another. I wasn't entirely sure how useful this would be, but the more I think about it the more it makes sense. For instance, just look at the rear side of theLian Li O11 Vision case, our current pick for thebest budget PC case(image below). With the power supply in its pictured rotation, the cables jut out and must take a circuitous route to the passthroughs. If the PSU could be rotated, the cables would have a more direct route. It might not be the most exciting thing in the world—not when you have agaming mouse with a fan insideandweird and wonderful PC caseson the Computex show floor—but I'm here for it. Something simple and practical. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. There is one concern with this, however, this being safety and longevity—it could add a big point of failure to a PSU to have stuff moving about in there. I'm sure it's all been designed with that in mind and it's not like any capacitors are being spun around in there, but it's still surely a concern when compared to one that has zero parts that swivel. Still, I can't help but be impressed by the simple ingenuity of this: a simple mechanism that might make a lot of practical difference in someone's build. Forget all that glitzy RGB and bendy screen nonsense, give me a solid, simple, practical improvement any day. This 'Rotation PSU' seems to come in a couple of configurations right now: 1,000 W and 1,200 W, designated by RS1000G and RS12000G monikers respectively.

    "article_text": "They're just little guys. They're just little guys with semi-automatic weapons. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If there's one thing I've discovered through years of playing—and now writing—about videogames, it's that players love a little guy. They just adore having darling underdogs that are on their side, as long as they're unobtrusive and perhaps minimally helpful. So it goes with Helldivers 2's latest update,Heart of Democracy, which has introduced the Super Earth Armed Forces to its city maps. \"AH can we please keep them after the assault ends,\" writes one player in a separate thread on thegame's subreddit, like a young patriot that's just seen a puppy in a window. \"I missed extract keeping my boys alive earlier,\"confesses one playerin response. \"They were getting swarmed and I helped them, then we ran off together into waves of Illuminate—and they had my back! So the least I could do was miss the Pelican and stay with my brothers.\" Inanother thread, a whole host of Helldivers react in shock horror at one of their precious SEAF troopers getting absolutely beaned by a Leviathan mid-salute. \"I will make calamari out of every single squid that dares touch down on Super Earth for this,\" seethes userSlothfulBradypus. The comments themselves are worth a skim, just for the sheer variety of reaction images all crying out for vengeance. Having played a bit of thenew update myself, I can confirm that Arrowhead has absolutely nailed the delicate balance between usefulness, fragility, and unobtrusiveness to make these SEAF troopers incredibly endearing. They rarely get in your way, but are just competently coded enough to have moments where they shine. Here's one player being flabbergasted when a SEAF trooper helps them take down a parked Illuminate warp ship. Given how your average Helldivers 2 game can devolve into absolute chaos at the drop of a grenade pin, even a token gesture of assistance from AI troopers is enough to punch them into your heart. Let alone the fact that saluting them will have them follow you around like a group of over-excited kids on a school trip, or how they'll fawn themselves silly to see a real helldiver in action. Luckily the propaganda machine is operating well so they don't know how many times I've died from accidentally firing a WASP launcher next to a wall. I also can't help but wonder if this is just conditioning at play. For so long, the Helldivers 2 experience has been four lone mavericks dropped deep behind enemy lines, fighting hordes of unspoken horrors with their only backup coming from orbit. Now we suddenly have foot soldiers with us, it feels like we're actually fighting a war—and they're just little guys. They're just little guys with little guns and they love you.

    "title": "'It's not just a gimmick': Noctua is working with Pulsar on a gaming mouse that has a fan in it to cool your sweaty palm",
    "article_text": "Cool. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's something to be said for a company that knows its lane, stays in it, and seriously dominates it. That describes Noctua in the fan lane: Big fans, small fans, quiet fans, brown fans, cream fans, more brown fans, you name it. So it both is and isn't a surprise that Noctua is working on a mouse with a fan inside—a surprise because it'sa mouse with a fan inside, and not a surprise because if anyone would do such a thing, it's Noctua. Noctua isn't working on this on its own, of course. The company tells us that Pulsar approached it to ask \"if we would be interested in supplying a fan to integrate into their flagship-level gaming mouse.\" Noctua said yes. And admittedly, the concept of a mouse with a fan inside isn't new—check out theZephyr Pro—but it's done so little that it'sbasicallynew, and if anyone can do it really well, my money would be on Noctua. That \"flagship-level gaming mouse\" that's housing the fan is thePulsar Feinmann, an incredibly holey and also very expensive gaming mouse that Pulsar calls the \"perfect tool for elite gamers.\" We've not got our hands on the Feinmann for extended testing, so we can't give our take on that, but we can say it makes a reasonable choice for a Noctua fan given the amount of the shell that's, well, missing—more scaffolding than honeycomb, if you ask me. It shares many of the specs and benefits of the Feinmann mouse itself, such as 32,000 DPI, 8 kHz polling, and an included USB-C charging dock. It's just that, in addition, a Noctua NF-A4x10 fan is crammed inside. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. Anyway, the big idea with the new Noctua version is to have a mouse that cools your sweaty palms, something that Noctua assures us is \"not just a gimmick.\" Our Jacob Ridley got his own sweaty palm on it on the Computex show floor and told me the cool air on the palm is \"surprisingly nice\", so there might be something to that claim from Noctua, though of course we can't say anything for certain yet. I can see something like this making sense for competitive gamers who want to reduce the chance of sweat getting in the way of the perfect headshot during that 6-hour CS2 binge. This would make sense of the Pulsar mouse being the choice here, too, given its light weight and competitive target market. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This is very much a prototype, and we can't put a marker on any specs for a final product, but right now it weighs in at just 65 g. Noctua says that although this is \"preliminary,\" battery life \"should be around 10 to 11 hours\" with this prototype. Of course, that's nothing compared to the 100+ hours we get with wireless gaming mice these days, but for such a new and different kind of product, it's not too bad—that's about what you get from some earphones, for example, after all. Noctua's been busy all-round lately, it seems. From itsfirst liquid coolerpenned for a 2026 release to agorgeous RTX 5080 collab, there's plenty to keep our eyes on—and presumably our palms, too. Jacob got his hands on a gaming PC for the first time when he was about 12 years old. He swiftly realised the local PC repair store had ripped him off with his build and vowed never to let another soul build his rig again. With this vow, Jacob the hardware junkie was born. Since then, Jacob's led a double-life as part-hardware geek, part-philosophy nerd, first working as a Hardware Writer for PCGamesN in 2020, then working towards a PhD in Philosophy for a few years (result pending a patiently awaited viva exam) while freelancing on the side for sites such as TechRadar, Pocket-lint, and yours truly, PC Gamer.

    "title": "Noctua aims to release its first liquid CPU cooler in 2026, working with Asetek to make the quietest water pump around, though it's not the thermosiphon project",
    "article_text": "But as with all of Noctua's projects, it won't really be released until it's perfect. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Noctua, purveyor of ultra-quiet brown/beige fans and massive CPU coolers for twenty long years, has resolutely stayed away from one specific medium, when it comes to keeping chips cool:water. However, at this year's Computex 2025, Noctua showed the progress it's making with itsliquid thermosiphon system, but that won't be the first to market: instead, it's going to be a collaboration with Asetek, and possibly be the quietest AIO liquid cooler you can buy. The nameless-so-far product will be based around Asetek's best liquid cooler platform, the G8 V2, so it will be offered in 420, 360, and 240 mm radiator formats, all using the industry-standard 30 mm thickness. Naturally, the flow of air through said radiators will be handled by Noctua, with NF-A14x25 G2 140 mm or NF-A12x25 G2 120 mm fans being the specific models chosen for the cooling duties. While these aren't even remotely cheap ($45 for the 140 mm version), they are exceptionally good, arguably more than their predecessors, theAF-A12/A14x25, shifting plenty of air, all while creating very little noise. Things really get interesting at the other end of the cooling loop: the pump head. While that's still an Asetek design, Noctua has applied its engineering skills to tackle the amount of noise the unit creates, and it's done this by designing a shroud for the pump that houses a wedge of noise-absorbing material. The absorber you can see in the pictures is just a dummy, though, as Noctua didn't want anyone's prying eyes getting the jump on its work before the product hits the shelves. It reckons its design is almost 6 decibels quieter than a standard arrangement, and considerably more than anything sporting an LCD display (of which we sawlotsof at Computex). Another recent trend in AIO liquid cooler designs is adding an additional fan at the pump head to drive air across the nearby power delivery components for the CPU and RAM, as well as helping out the primary SSD (which always gets pretty toasty due to being stuffed next to a graphics card). Noctua's solution is an optional 80 mm fan, where its position and airflow take advantage of the Coandă effect—this is where an air stream tends to cling to a surface and flow across it, rather than bouncing off in all directions. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. You might think the fan looks somewhat ridiculous, precariously perched on top of the pump head, but as with everything else, this is a work in progress, and Noctua told us that the final design will involve a snugger fit between the fan and pump shroud. Then again, Noctua's well known for putting performance well ahead of aesthetics, so you never know. At the moment, Noctua is tentatively targeting a launch date of early 2026, but as with all of its projects, this one won't see the light of day on any retailer's shelves until Noctua is 100% happy with it. But given what we saw at Computex, I'd say there's a very good chance you'll be able to buy one next year. But what of the pumpless thermosiphon cooler? Well, Noctua had a demonstration of it in action and were happy to talk about how it all works, what's going well, and what isn't. Let me disappoint you now: it's far from ready, and even if everything suddenly falls into place, it won't look like it currently does. As to why it's not ready yet, well, there are still some big challenges to circumnavigate. Noctua's thermosiphon system doesn't use a pump to push the coolant around the loop. Instead, it relies on a liquid undergoing a phase change (i.e., turning into a vapour) at the CPU, which rises into the radiator due to a drop in density. It then cools back into a liquid and naturally flows into the CPU block. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. Without pumps, the flow rate is quite slow—too slow, in fact, for the heatplace that mounts on the CPU to have microfins, to improve the surface area for greater nucleation (points on a surface where a liquid turns into a gas, as it boils). Noctua's current solution is to make the plate 'bumpy' where colder regions of the plate have a thinner layer of copper, compared to parts situated over the CPU's hotspots. There are stillsomefins on the plate, as you can see in the picture, but these are more for improving the return of the coolant. I doubt we'll see the thermosiphon cooler in any of our PC Gamer test rigs anytime soon, but hopefully, we'll be able to try out its Asetek collab next year. If it works as good as Noctua's best air coolers, we may well have a new champion for thebest AIO liquid cooler. Just don't expect it to be as low in price as our current recommendation, theArctic Liquid Freezer III. Nobody ever says that perfection comes cheap.

    "title": "Turns out asking AI chatbots for answers in a specific way can be like leaving them with the key to Trippy McHigh's magic mushroom farm",
    "article_text": "Chatbot, are you high right now? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's a known issue right now that Large Language Model-poweredAI chatbotsdo not always deliver factually correct answers to posed questions. In fact, not only do AI chatbots sometimes not deliver factually correct information, but they have a nasty habit ofconfidentlypresenting factually incorrect information, with answers to questions that are just fabricated, hallucinated hokum. So why are AI chatbots currently prone to hallucinations when delivering answers, and what are the triggers for it? That's what anew study published this monthhas aimed to delve into, with its methodology designed to evaluate AI chatbot models 'across multiple task categories designed to capture different ways models may generate misleading or false information.' A discovery in the study is that how an AI chatbot has a question framed to it can have a huge impact on the answer it gives, and especially so when being asked about controversial claims. So, if a user begins a question with a highly confident phrase such as, 'I'm 100% sure that …', rather than a more neutral, 'I've heard that', then that can lead to the AI chatbot not debunking that claim, if false, to a higher degree. Interestingly, the study postulates that one of the reasons for this sycophancy could be LLM 'training processes that encourage models to be agreeable and helpful to users', with the result a creation of 'tension between accuracy and alignment with user expectations, particularly when those expectations include false premises.' Most interesting, though, is the study's finding that AI chatbots' resistance to hallucination and inaccuracy dramatically drops when it is asked by a user to provide a short, concise answer to a question. As you can see in the chart above, the majority of AI models right now all suffer from an increased chance of hallucinating and providing nonsense answers when asked to provide an answer in a concise way. For example, when Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model was prompted with neutral instructions, it delivered a resistance to hallucination score of 84%. However, when prompted with instructions to answer in a short, concise manner, that score drops markedly to 64%. Simply put, asking AI chatbots to provide short, concise answers increases the chance of them hallucinating a fabricated, nonsense answer that is not factually correct. The reason why AI chatbots can be prone to tripping out more when prompted in this way? The study's creator suggests that 'When forced to keep [answers] short, models consistently choose brevity over accuracy—they simply don't have the space to acknowledge the false premise, explain the error, and provide accurate information.' Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. To me, the results of the study are fascinating, and show just how much of a Wild West AI and LLM-powered chatbots are right now. There's no doubt AI has plenty of potentially game-changing applications but, equally, it also feels like many of AI's potential benefits and pitfalls are still very much unknown, with inaccurate and far-out answers by chatbots to questions a clear symptom of that.

You can always count on InWin to bring its most head-turning A-game to every Computex. To celebrate its 40th birthday this year, the company presented a commemorative blue PC chassis that certainly has my attention—though I don't think I quite share InWin's creative vision. The special edition case in question has been dubbed ChronoMancy, and sports a shapeInWin describesas \"trophy-inspired.\" Perhaps it's the sleep-deprivation talking, but all I see is a funky coffee cup. Let me knock back this latte and see if I can't get some neurons to fire for the next paragraph. Capped with frosted blue plastic, it's definitely got that \"Time-honored\" throwback flair. The blue 'lid' of the chassis is engraved with the outlines of a number of InWin's previous special edition chassis—though few of these sport a silhouette quite as standout as the ChronoMancy. The case's central cylinder is supported by five pillars which the company explains represent \"the five continents, symbolizing InWin’s global presence and future growth.\" Not only that, but the ChronoMancy also looks to the future with support for Nvidia's fullsize RTX 50-series graphics cards (as opposed tothis itty bitty one Andy also sawat Computex). Interestingly, the chassis also features an internal speaker—which it turns out is pivotal to its main party trick. This is an all-singing, all-dancing case in more literal a sense than I may have first thought, as the Chronomancy offers \"a synchronized light and music show that can be activated using a specially designed wand-shaped controller.\" I immediately went on the hunt for video evidence and found this enlightening demonstration byFrench-language hardware channel Cowcotland(getting jumpscared byYouTube'snew-ishAI-powered autodubbing featurein the process). This video also highlights just how chunky the ChronoMancy is, really driving home the fact this case will be the towering focal point of any room as it stands alittle over one metre tall. As mentioned up top, InWin is no stranger to cool-but-decidedly-impractical PC cases. Way back in 2019, the company showed off a selection of$4,000 3D printed, open air PC cases. More recently in 2023, InWin exhibited amodular PC case systemalongside afoldable chassis for Mini-ITX PCsthat I'm still dreaming about two years later.

    "article_text": "\"There were some who would have preferred him to have sort of a Texan accent.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It seems hard to conceive now, given we've had three games (and some assorted DLC) with Doug Cockle's dulcet tones behind the deadpan features of Geralt of Rivia, but there was a time where CDPR was struggling to find out what everyone's favourite witcher would sound like in The Witcher trilogy. To celebrate its 10th anniversary, all this week we're looking back on The Witcher 3—and looking ahead to its upcoming sequel, too.Keep checking backfor more features and retrospectives, as well as in-depth interviews with the developers who brought the game to life. Speaking to English adaptation director Borys Pugacz-Muraszkiewicz, PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens assumed that Cockle might've been the obvious choice—a notion Pugacz-Muraszkiewicz was quick to dispel: \"Not by any means was he the obvious choice, no. \"I don't know if you know how Geralt of Rivia's voice is described by Sapkowski in the books, but it's essentially described as something along the lines of 'harsh, metallic, almost inhuman' and so on … To try to find somebody with a vocal quality that would answer all of those qualities, wasn't really our thing from the outset.\" Turns out, while adjectives like harsh, metallic, and almost inhuman make for an evocative description when your imagination's doing all the work, it's a bloomin' hard thing to base a voice casting off: \"It's not something that you can do if you want gamers to identify with a character.\" So what did the studio want for Geralt? \"A badass voice.\" That's a little easier to narrow down, though \"There were some negotiations between us and the marketing department of our North American publisher as to what the nature of the voice should be, what the accent of the voice should be.\" After whittling down a list of around two-dozen voices from the studio they were working with, Pugacz-Muraszkiewicz says they'd narrowed it to five candidates. \"We went through that short list of five on a conference call,\" he adds, before revealing that: \"There were some who would have preferred him to have sort of a Texan accent, because that was what they thought of as 'badass'.\" While I openly and dearly grieve for an alternate universe in which Geralt was a rootin' tootin' wild west ranger (thus making Henry Cavil do a similar twang in the live-action adaptation) I can't say CDPR made the wrong choice. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"In the studio we were of the opinion that what we wanted was, yes, a badass, but something of an everyman. Which, to me, meant (and because of the importance of the North American market) we would go with an American accent, but a standard American. \"Geralt is the straight everyman to everybody else around him … What Doug did in reading the casting sign for the voice was [just that]. He was a badass everyman who would be a foil to all of the emoting going on around him in that world. There is an underlying warmth to his timbre and his tone, which is a little bit counter to the idea of a hard-boiled hero, or anti-hero, in this case, but yeah—Doug was the best at being normal.\" Pugacz-Muraszkiewicz explains, though, that Cockle's voice acting wasn't locked in fully until the second game, where they were able to gain a \"more established\" studio. \"I remember actually having a couple of conversations with Doug over the phone between the Witcher 1 and Witcher 2, and he was kind of surprised that he was going to have to audition for it again.\" Still, \"they had their own casting department, and they had their own casting ideas. The recasting that we did for the Witcher 2, it wasn't a thing where we just wanted to cast off the past … It was just a new opening for us.\" Despite all that, though, Pugacz-Muraszkiewicz notes that \"Once again, for very similar reasons, Doug won out.\" And the rest is gravelly, deliciously-textured history—well, not quitehistory,since we'llbe seeing Geralt again in The Witcher 4.

    "article_text": "A case with a screen for just $109. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I keep tellin' ya screens with everything is the thing atComputex this year. And the good news is that doesn't have to mean crazy money.Lian Li's new Vector V200 case comes with an 8.8-inch built into the bottom of its side glass panel. And the whole shebang is yours for just $109. The Vector V200 isn't just about that LCD panel, however. It has dual tempered glass panels on the front and side, offering a \"panoramic view\" of your PC's internals. There's also a touch-sensitive control panel for power on/off and lighting functionality, which is another very neat little, well, touch. What's more, Lian Li says, \"the bottom of the side panel is slanted to allow the GPU to have a more direct cold air intake.\" So, there's that. As for the specs and capability of the 8.8-inch screen, Lian Li isn't quoting a resolution or panel type, just saying it's an LCD with 60 Hz refresh that functions as a secondary screen via a USB interface. It's controlled via Lian Li's L-Connect 3 software, which we haven't always gotten on with all that well. That said, we understand it's now being integrated with OpenRGB, so that should give you more options for control. The panel is also surrounded by an ARGB lighting frame for what Lian Li calls \"dynamic visuals\". Oh, and if all you're interested in is the screen, you can grab that separately for $85. That means you're getting the rest of the case for just $25, which seems like great value considering the glass panels and touch-sensitive controls. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. For the record, Lian Li says the stand-alone screen, known as the 8.8-inch Universal Screen, goes on sale in August, while the Vector V200 case with screen and all will be available in September. Of course, if you're absolutely screen mad—and who isn't,—you could also throw inLian Li's new Hydroshift II LCD Curve. That's an AIO CPU water cooler with its own 2K curved screen. Indeed, it doesn't just have a screen, but that screen is attached to the water cooling block with motors, allowing it to be articulated with a remote or via an app. At which point, you'd be well on your way to setting some kind of record for supplementary screens built into a PC and you'd still have barely spent as much as an entry-level GPU from Nvidia costs these days. Which does rather put things into context. Oh well!

Obviously, these are all just jokey comments that poke fun at a mistake in what is a very detailed and precise trailer, but given how many times Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick has said thatRockstar's goal is to reach perfection, I think a couple of nudges and jokes are ok. But I think we can forgive them for this, considering how good the rest of the trailer is. I, for one, had only just convinced myself that the delay wasn't a big deal and I wasn't too excited for GTA 6, so I could wait another six months. After watching the trailer, though, I lost all my chill andwanted to play it that very second. The second trailer also showed off more ofJason and Lucia's relationshipand what the story will look like. They're GTA's version of Bonnie and Clyde, and we got to see what an average day in their life looks like: Swamp chases, helicopter fights, and some heavy petting. It was enough to make me actually invested in the new protagonists, so much so that I really hope they don't follow in the footsteps of the real Bonnie and Clyde, I like them too much now.

    "title": "Marvel Rivals' new Chrono Shield Cards item has divided players and reminded me that some people should just stay in Bronze",
    "article_text": "A 'fun-first' design policy is ruining the competitive scene. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. To mark the anniversary ofMarvel Rivals'first release into Early Access, the devs cooked up a couple of prizes and events for players. Most are just harmless trinkets, but there's one new item that is wreaking havoc in the low-ranked elos. Chrono Shield cardsare a new item introduced in Galacta's Gift, a challenge board that gives you rewards in exchange for playing games. Activating these cards protects players in Gold rank and below from losing ranked points after a defeat. So your competitive rank won't be affected no matter how badly you (or your team) play. Marvel Rivals tier list: Best characters for each roleMarvel Rivals characters: Current and confirmed rosterMarvel Rivals ranks: How to climb in competitiveMarvel Rivals codes: Grab free gear and moreMarvel Rivals crosshairs: The best custom reticles This isn't a new concept as Chrono Shields have been used in ranked play before. The first time you lose in a competitive match, you'll be protected from deranking by a Chrono Shield. After this, the shield resets and then recharges a quarter for every loss, so after four defeats, you get your shield back, and the process goes on from there. But now there are also two sets of four Chrono Shield cards available in Galacta's Gift, and as far as most players are concerned, that's eight too many. \"So, in short, the devs saw all the hard stuck Bronze and Silver players and elected to throw them a crutch?\" oneplayer says, with others who are self-admitted hard-stuck bronze players actually agreeing that these cards make it too easy for low rank players to fudge results and inflate their rank. Others point out how incentivising players is already difficult in competitive play. I've come across more throwers in Marvel Rivals than in any other competitive shooter. It's painfully common to get someone on your team or the opposing team who gives up before the outcome is decided, and writes the match off as a loss, dragging you down with them. I can only imagine that this will get worse when players have Chrono Shield cards to fall back on; some players are even planning to do so as we speak. \"I can see myself doing that, there've been tons of matches I've been upset or annoyed, but I keep playing and trying cause I don't want to lose points, now what's the point?\"KeyAcid says. \"I'll just coast, ignore chat, and gg go next.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It may be frustrating, but you can't blame players for taking advantage of existing features for their own benefit. But you can blame the developers for adding said features, and not actually addressing the real issues at hand. From the beginning, Marvel Rivals' defining feature, and what set it apart from other team shooters, was its ability to be chaotic and fun. Thisblissful chaosseemed to ignore balancing issues in favour of creating overpowered, creative, and fun heroes that would all merge together in team fights to create some truly memorable superhero moments. While this was great fun at the beginning, the joy began to seep out as the seasons progressed and players found new ways to break characters and take full advantage of some unfairly strong abilities. This may not be an issue in casual play, where most players are just trying out new heroes and messing around, but it's a serious problem in ranked. We balance for fun, first and foremost. Storm terrorised competitive play in Season 1 after the devs created atornado-yeeting monsterjust to improve her pick rate, instead of tweaking her design and, perhaps, buffing and nerfing some of her counters to create a better and balanced hero ecosystem. So Storm became part of the meta of Marvel Rivals, and there wasn't much players could do about it. But instead of learning from this mistake, the devs doubled down andexacerbated the problem when they added Human Torch. On top of this, Marvel Rivals' ranked play is already quite forgiving. Yes, you can encounter some pretty horrendous loss streaks as the matchmaking isn't all there, but if you play enough games, you will rank up as you always gain more points than you lose. Thisrank inflation issuesaw players who shouldn't have left Plat rank all the way up to Grand Master in Season 0. It's not like the developers aren't aware of the chaotic mess that is competitive, but by their own admission, it just isn't a priority. \"We balance for fun, first and foremost,\" Marvel Games' executive producer Danny Kootold us at GDCa couple of months ago. Koo then followed up by explaining how balancing is essential, but creating a fun and casual environment for players trumps everything else. At the end of the day, losing in ranked isn't fun, so creating a feature that somewhat negates this is very much in keeping with Marvel Rivals' outlook. Having some kind of safety net in competitive play is pretty normal, and in its original form, Chrono Shields would protect players from unlucky losing streaks while not preventing people who aren't that good at the game from ranking down. But, and I'm sorry I have to say this, some players just shouldn't rank up. That's not an issue, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. I've spent plenty of time down in bronze, and I've been down there for a reason, only ranking up when I began improving faster than others in my elo. Preventing players from deranking or even helping boost them above their skill level may be fun for a short while, but it won't last. It'll just suck even more when they inevitably can't keep up with team fights in higher ranks, and it'll be incredibly frustrating for their teammates who will have to carry someone who is out of their depth. Coddling people in ranked play won't help anyone get better, and it won't make it any more fun. If the developers want to improve things in competitive play, then they should take a serious approach to improving matchmaking and hero balance.

    "title": "'We want to be as aggressive as possible, right?' says AMD GPU boss of the Nvidia-baiting pricing of the RX 9060 XT, calling it 'a tremendous value proposition to all our fellow gamers'",
    "article_text": "\"I think building scale is the number one priority.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I got the chance to sit down at a roundtable discussion with AMD's senior vice president and general manager of the computing and graphics group, Jack Huynh, not long after he spoke on stage atComputex 2025. I asked him about AMD's competitive pricing for the RX 9000-series, in particular the newly-announcedRX 9060 XT: \"It's part of strategy, building scale. We want to be as aggressive as possible, right? And offer a tremendous value proposition to all our fellow gamers. \"I think building scale is the number one priority, and it was [about] launching the product when it's ready. Don't rush. My philosophy is, when you launch a product, it's forever... so I think we just want to provide the best experience, as aggressive as possible.\" It's an interesting mix of strategic thinking. On the one hand, aggressive pricing—on the other, a launch of a product that Huyhn and the rest of the AMD folk I chatted to seem immensely proud of, and which seems to have been under development for some time. \"For this generation, we want to bring this experience to everyone, and we'll go from there,\" says Huyhn. At $299 for the 8 GB model and $349 for the 16 GB version, and with AMD's figures suggesting the latter is 6% faster than the $379RTX 5060 Tiat 1440p, the RX 9060 XT certainly looks on paper like a very attractive card. Whether that leads to a successful AMD GPU launch? Time will tell. However, AMD's aggressive pricing strategy, combined with a determination to focus on the budget to mid-range GPU market, certainly seems to be building goodwill with many gamers who feel priced out by many of the current cards on the market—especially with retailers putting significant markups on the MSRPs amid ongoing availability constraints. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. So, could said availability issues plague the RX 9060 XT, too? Perhaps not. I was told that AMD has been working hard with its board partners to ramp up volume ready for launch day, and that having lots of availability on day one is regarded as key. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. We'll see in practice whether this holds out come June 5, of course, but AMD seems to be taking this launch particularly seriously. After all, if scale is the goal, then the number of budget cards available for hungry, price-conscious buyers may well make or break its success. The RX 9060 XT, then. An aggressively-priced, performant little GPU for the every-gamer? We'll see for ourselves when we get hold of one for testing. One thing's for sure, though: AMD seems to have a spring in its step at the moment, from the bottom all the way to the very top.

    "article_text": "Well you're nothing special. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Overwatch 2's Street Fighter 6 collaborationhas been officially announced, and the eight new skins are ready to appear on the in-game shop today, and just on cue, some players are already finding issues with the skins. \"They won't be able to dethrone Marvel Rivals by having a half-assed Cammy skin,\" oneplayer says. \"Pun intended, if you know you know.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together You bolt awake in your bed. It's May 24, 2016. Today's the day thatOverwatchreleases—the future cannot come to pass. Overwatch must burn. I jest, but seeing players complain about the size of Widowmaker's butt in the new Cammy skin has dragged me back to 2016 when all the controversy about Blizzard shrinking Tracer's rear was all anyone could talk about. Just a couple of days after Overwatch first released back in 2016, the devs had to cut a victory pose after fan backlash, saying it wasover-sexualising the character. This then triggered a whole new wave of complaints about censorship which then resulted ina new victory pose being addedwhich still showed her butt, because that's what really matters. New #Overwatch2 x Street Fighter 6 Skin: Cammy Widowmaker 🐝💥 Enter the fight TOMORROW! pic.twitter.com/TgG3xd3LQeMay 19, 2025 I thought we'd moved on from breaking out the compass and ruler every time a hero gets released or has a new skin, but apparently not. I suppose Marvel Rivals has been feeding the gooners as of late, so maybe we can point the blame over there. The arrival of Emma Frost in NetEase's shooter brought whole new levels of revealing skins. Her default skin is already scantily clad, but her X-Revolution skin is prettyoutrageous for a game that's 12-rated. But these kinds of skins aren't restricted to Frost: Invisible Woman and Namor also have some tiny outfits that definitely cater to a certain section of the audience.

In response tosomeone complainingabout how Blizzard ruined the Cammy skin, oneplayer jokes, \"Why won't Blizzard think of the gooners?!?\" as others jump in saying thatnone of this is a big dealand it's pretty commonplace when it comes to games collabing with other brands: \"Fortnite did the same thing, it's fine. You won't die because you can't see a video game character's ass fully.\" Very true, no matter how disappointed you may be to see a bit of mesh on Cammy's legs, nothing bad will happen and no one will get hurt, promise.

    "title": "Wooting is adding knobs to its gaming keyboards and the good news is existing Wooting owners can knob themselves too",
    "article_text": "These new knobs actually replace a switch (or four) on existing Wooting keyboards. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A gaming keyboard with a multi-function knob or volume wheel is nothing new, though Wooting believes it has a twist that makes its version pretty special. The so-called 'Wooting Knobs' work as a drop-in accessory for most of its gaming keyboards. You simple remove a switch, or four, and replace it with either a single-key dial or a larger dial with a button in the middle. These can then be programmed to do whatever you like, within reason, within the Wootility software. \"You can put it anywhere you want, have as many as you want,\" says Simon Whyte, lead software engineer at Wooting. \"We have this small one, which is just a single key, and I can go anywhere. \"And then the big one, which is designed specifically for the… well, the 80HE was designed for this originally, but it took us a while to get it right.\" There is a conspicuous spot for the larger knob on theWooting 80HE, right above the light bar. The design of this keyboard makes a lot more sense in light of the Wooting Knobs. The function of the knobs can be adjusted within the Wootility software, but Whyte notes that the company is looking into making more of the knobs with further integrations with third-party software. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. A prime spot for the smaller knob is between the two halves of the spacebar on the newly-announced Wooting 60HE v2. This compact keyboard, a sturdier, better-looking version of the60HEwe've reviewed, comes with a spacebar that's split in two, with a new customisable key right in the middle. Remove that key and you can add a dial there instead, if you so wish. Though the dual spacebar and extra button is a pretty neat solution in itself. I tried typing on it today, and it was surprisingly easy to get used to, with my thumbs naturally resting on the left and right-side spacebars rather than over the new middle key. But back to knobs, these aren't coming out for a little while yet. I'm told around Q1, 2026. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. There's also a compatibility issue with older Wooting keyboards using the company's older AVR chip, used in some of its first products, rather than the modern ARM-based chip. Whyte says the knobs are unlikely to support those older chips, but threw out a ballpark estimate of around 98% of its keyboards use ARM anyways. That backwards compatibility is a pretty big deal, anyways. Whyte says the company wants to keep long-term support in mind with all upgrades, and this is one reason (of many) why it's sticking with Hall effect Lekker switches that work across most of its boards for the foreseeable future. That's particularly noteworthy in light ofCherry's recent IK switch announcement, which puts induction switches at the heart of Cherry's plan from here on out.

    "article_text": "Choo choo choose who you want to spend your Stellar Jade on next. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Just like our beloved Trailblazer's bizarre personality, thebannersinHonkai: Star Railare constantly changing, so it's a good idea to keep track of what thecurrent bannersandnext bannersare. Limited-time rotating banners are called 'Event Warps' in Star Rail, and they usually run for three weeks. Whether it's a new banner or a rerun, once those three weeks are up, it's time to say goodbye and greet the new banners with your stack of Special Pass tickets. Or in my case, a stack of three tickets, because it's hard to save when you want every dang character in the game. It's best to convert your Stellar Jade into these Special Pass tickets, not the regular Pass tickets used on the standard and Departure Warp banners, because you get plenty of the regular variety by just playing the game. It's much harder to get characters only available for a limited-time—as demonstrated by my pitiful Special Pass ticket reserves—so you'll want all the help you can get when the character you like is available. CipherandAglaeaare the next banners in Honkai: Star Rail. They will replace the current limited-time character banners on Wednesday, June 11 in Phase 2 of version 3.3. Following Star Rail's reliable banner schedule, Cipher and Aglaea's banners will then end on Tuesday, July 1—the day before the expected release of version 3.4. Cipher is a new five-star Quantum-attacker of the Nihility path on her Slick and Speedy Steals the Sky Banner, and Aglaea is a returning five-star Lightning-attacker of the Remembrance path on her Tailored Fate Banner. The boosted four-star characters on Cipher and Aglaea's next banners are: Phainon,Saber, andArcherare on the version 3.4 banners in Honkai: Star Rail. This was confirmed throughPhainon's drip marketing, and theFate/stay night collaboration detailsshared on Star Rail's official social media channels. Phainon is a new five-star Physical-attacker of the Destruction path, Saber is new five-star Wind-attacker of the Destruction path, and Archer is a new five-star Quantum-attacker of the Hunt path. A pricey sounding line-up for sure, but keep in mind that we allget one copy of Archer for free! You have until the end of version 3.6 to claim him, so make sure you don't miss out. Phainon's exact banner run dates haven't been revealed yet, but it has been officially confirmed that Saber and Archer will debut on Friday, July 11 at the same time the 'Sweet Dreams and the Holy Grail' Fate/stay night event starts. So if you've no idea what a Saber or an Archer is, this is your deadline to get clued-in. Although, maybe you want to steer clear of the game and the anime altogether, like me, to resist the urge to get more characters. I'm sorry Saber, you look cool, but I have a Sunday rerun to save for. HyacineandThe Hertaare the current banners in Honkai: Star Rail, both of which end on Wednesday, June 11. Hyacine is a new five-star Wind-attacker of the Remembrance path on her A Rainbow Onto Twilight Banner, and The Herta is a returning five-star Ice-attacker of the Erudition path on her Message from Beyond Banner. The boosted four-star characters on Hyacine and The Herta's current banners are: Yes, this is a very early rerun for The Herta! She only debuted in version 3.0, so this is a great opportunity to pull for her if you missed out the first time. However, as somebody who skipped Sunday to get The Herta, the regret is sinking in. I'm not mad, miHoYo, I'm just disappointed. The next Light Cone banners start on Wednesday, June 11, and the five-star Light Cones on these next banners in Honkai: Star Rail areLies Dance on the Breeze (Brilliant Fixation Banner), andTime Woven Into Gold (Bygone Reminiscence Banner). These are Cipher and Aglaea's signature five-star Light Cones, respectively. All of the four-star boosted Light Cones on both of the next Light Cone banners are: The current Light Cone banners run until Wednesday, June 11, and the five-star Light Cones on the current banners in Honkai: Star Rail areLong May Rainbows Adorn the Sky (Brilliant Fixation Banner), andInto the Unreachable Veil (Bygone Reminiscence Banner). These are Hyacine and The Herta's signature five-star Light Cones, respectively.

    "article_text": "It won't make your PC any faster, but it is a lot of fun. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We predicted that screens on everything was likely to besomething of a trend at Computex this year. So, an AIO cooler with a screen on the water block isn't exactly radical. So, to give it an extra twist,Lian Limade their water cooler screen curved. Oh and stuck some motors on it and made it controllable both wireless and through a Windows app. Why, you ask? Why not, Lian Li replies. We give you Lian Li Hydroshift II LCD Curve. It's still in prototype form and won't be available until later this year, and not before October, so the details are a little sparse. However, the screen is 1440p / 2K resolution, so the pixel density will be very sweet indeed. The screen can be moved both with a remote control and via an app. It both pivots and can be moved up and down, so there's a remarkable amount of articulation on offer. What you do with that functionality, well, that's up to you. Typically your choices are system info like operating temps and CPU frequencies. Or you can just set up some jazzy graphics to keep you entertained. It's not clear if you could, for instance, set the thing up to move around according to some predetermined pattern. Heck, it might be cool for it to move based on CPU load. Maybe the screen could turn red and move around manically when the cores are being loaded up, then turn blue and move gently during idle. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. The possibilities are kind of endless, albeit few if any of them will make your PC any faster. That said, the cooling block does have a fan to help keep the nearby VRMs and RAM cool. So, it's a highly specified AIO in cooling terms, and not just a pretty motorised face. As for pricing, you're looking at $269. As your typical AIO water cooler for CPUs goes, that obviously isn't exactly cheap. Arguably, you'd be better off putting the price premium into a faster GPU. But PC gaming isn't always about maximising your frame rates to the nth degree and it's not as ridiculously expensive as we might have expected. So, we're not going to harsh on this Lian Li cooler for being tangential to your PC's outright performance. It's a little bit of fun and if you're trying to build the ultimate whizz-bang rig in terms of visual impact, you're probably going to want to put the Hydroshift II LCD Curve on your shopping list.

In ourEnvision Pro reviewlast year, we noted that although we liked the controller a lot, one of the main things we didn't like was its lack of HE sticks. That's primarily because it's not a cheap controller, with a launch MSRP of $180, currently going forabout $150. For that price, we'd kind of want the latest and greatest tech. The main benefit to HE, for those who don't know, is that it eliminates stick drift. That's because it uses magnets, which don't require physical contact for the measurements in themselves, compared to more traditional mechanical means, ie, a potentiometer, which do. HE sticks can also be more accurate than traditional mechanical analog ones, which is another reason why competitive players like them. Though Corsair is quick to remind us that there is stillsomemechanical stuff going on with Hall effect, saying there are \"mechanicalcenteringissues on all of [the stick technologies].\" And that's apparently why it took a while to get HE on the Valor Pro. Despite acknowledging that some might think the company has been \"taking our sweet time with it,\" Corsair defends taking that time: \"Effectively, we spent the last two years really digging into this technology\" and now it's at a \"maturity level where we feel like it's in a stable place.\" Corsair first told us this was coming at Computexlast year, so it's definitely been meticulous at the least. It'll be great to see Scuf's main PC-oriented controller featuring the tech and going some way to better justifying that high price tag. In addition to great build quality and feel, you're also getting a ton of buttons, including some macro keys on the front, these being part of what distinguishes the company's PC-oriented controller from its other ones. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. One final thing to note is that if you already have an Envision or Envision Pro controller, you're not left entirely out of the performance party. Scuf's clearly been spending some time working on its calibration and so on, and it tells us that some of these calibration benefits should be coming to the non-HE controllers that are already out there: \"We've spent a lot of the investigation and all the stuff that we've learned doing the calibration for the Hall effect, we've applied now to the standard analog states. So we can extend the life of your current controller with all the new calibration functions and the dead zone controls in the controller. So that should help a lot—at least extend the life of those who have the current version.\" It's not quite the same as having Hall effect tech under thumbs, of course, but it's certainly better than nothing.

    "article_text": "Discover the leviathan's weakness and blast it out of Super Earth's skies. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you've dropped into Super Earth's harder difficulty defence maps inHelldivers 2, you'll likely have encountered the leviathan, a gigantic flying Illuminate battleship that smashes through skyscrapers and barrages you with cannons whenever you get close. It's a real nuisance when you're trying to complete objectives, but the good news is that you cankill a leviathandespite its seeming invulnerability. There are a few different methods, but provided you've got a teammate to assist with reloading your support weapon, it won't take too long. It's worth noting that destroying leviathans isn't currently an objective, so you won't get a bonus—it's easier to duck in cover or avoid them than it is to blast them out of the sky. Still, if you want to kill a leviathan in Helldivers 2, here's how. There are a few different ways to kill a leviathan in Helldivers 2, but the best are generally support weapon stratagems like theRecoilless Rifleor theSpear. You could also use the Anti-Tank Emplacement, but this requires you to have the Urban Legends Warbond and to have unlocked it on the final page—it's also tricky to place, since leviathans move quite a bit, making it hard to aim effectively without having your line of sight blocked by skyscrapers. When it comes to weak spots on the leviathan, you have a few choices: Sadly, stratagems likeOrbital Railcannon Strike and Orbital Laser don't lock onto the leviathan,so are kind of useless against it, though you can still land certain barrage-based stratagems if you place the beacon between the leviathan and the sky, though this is tricky considering how fast they move. Overall, your best bet is simply taking a Recoilless Rifle or a Spear, getting a team-reload, and having some supplies nearby so you can grab extra shots. Blow off a wing and damage it that way, or simply keep shooting it until it falls. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Asus and Noctua team up once more, this time creating a hulking three-fan, four-slot RTX 5080 chonk of a graphics card",
    "article_text": "Their previous collabs look feeble in comparison, but I reckon they're better-looking. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Almost every graphics card vendor makes an all bells and whistles version of a particular GPU. It might be one that's heavily overclocked or one that follows a particular theme, but nearly all of them have a decent enough cooler to keep things well under control.Asus, on the other hand, might reckon it has them all beat because it's teamed up with Noctua once more to create what possibly might be the coolest and quietestRTX 5080you can buy. Previous collaborations between the two companies created the likes of theGeForce RTX 3070 Noctua OC Edition, and for Nvidia's last generation of GPUs, Asus and Noctua produced a very similar-lookingRTX 4080 Noctua Edition. Sporting just two of the famous brown-and-beige fans, the cards were known for being very cool and quiet, albeit being seriously thick. At this year's Computex event, Asus proudly displayed its newest Noctua collab: aGeForce RTX 5080with what must be one of the chonkiest coolers I've seen in a long time. That's because it's host to three Noctua fans, rather than the usual two. Given that a normal RTX 5080 has a TGP (total graphics power) of 360 W, all those fans might seem sensible, but RTX 4080 isn't that far behind, at 320 W. Asus' RTX 5080 Noctua Edition does have a higher boost clock than the Founders Edition, though, running up to 2,730 MHz compared to the standard 2,617 MHz. But that's a mere 4% overclock, so perhaps it's possible to squeeze even more out of the RTX 5080 Noctua Edition. After all, Dave, our hardware head honcho, managed to get over 500 MHz more out of an RTX 5080—an overclock of 40%! I have to say that while I'm a fan (pun sort of intended) of Noctua's classic colour scheme, and I really liked the chunky look to the RTX 3070 Noctua card, I feel a bit disappointed with the new RTX 5080 Noctua Edition. Sure, it's about as thick a graphics card as you could ever want, requiring four slots in your chassis, but that brown shroud hides too much of Noctua's lovely fans. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. The original Noctua Editions all have a gloriously cobbled-together affair to them, as if you'd strapped the luxury fans to the heatsink yourself. This new one just seems like any other Asus RTX 5080, just brown in colour, and that's a real shame. I reckon Asus and Noctua should make something truly spectacular, no matter how ridiculous or expensive it turns out to be. High-end graphics cards are already priced into the realms of ridiculousness, so a quadruple or quintuple Noctua-equippedRTX 5090would sell just as well as any other 5090. Mind you, it might besochonky that you'd never fit one inside your PC without doing some serious metal work.But that's fine by me. Ultra-chunky, ultra-brown, ultra-beige. The perfect Noctua collab.

    "title": "Cherry debuts new mechanical, magnetic, and inductive switches with a whole new naming scheme to match",
    "article_text": "The Honey, Blossom, and Falcon are the new mechanical switches in Cherry's arsenal. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When we talk about mechanical keyboard switches, everything refers back to Cherry. Even if you're using a different brand's switches, often you'll end up explaining them in terms of Cherry's naming scheme; \"These feel like low profile reds\" or similar is often pretty common jargon when describing how a board might feel. This is all about to receive a refresh as Cherry debuts its new switches, complete with some new naming schemes at this year's Computex. Now when you're looking at Cherry's keyboards there's three distinct sets you want to keep your eyes out for. First up, you have the MK Series which feature magnetic switches for that slick feel and price action. These are touted as being super precise for gamers, giving us a different option over the standard mechanical switch that has a frictionless feel. Then there's the new IK series, for those who prefer the contactless feel of inductive switches with electromagnetic sensors. Cherry has booked these as the most energy efficient switch of its kind using 50% less power than regular magnetic switches and 5% less than hall effect. Thanks to that contactless nature, these shouldn't ever really wear out and that power consumption makes them a great partner for a wireless keyboard travel setup. Last but never least, there's the familiar MX. These are the mechanical switches Cherry is known for that feature in recent boards like theMX 8.2 TKL Xaga, which is quite the fancy board, indeed. The MX range is still getting a shake up though, with Cherry introducing a few new switches under the banner – The MX Honey, Blossom, and Falcon. Honeys are set to be the quiet kid in the new MX lineup featuring Cherry's first tactile MX switch that's also silent. Despite the silent nature these are said to still give a great tactile feel so this is a great choice for office goers, streamers, or just people who like quiet keyboards that still feel satisfying to use. It's me, I'm people. The MX Blossom is set to be the ultra light feel switch. There's some nice evocative imagery there of cherry blossom petals floating down, so I'm guessing that's the feel Cherry is going for here. These are going to be ultra light, easy to press, and quick to respond, so are probably aiming to be the preference for typists, and gamers who like a softer touch. Meanwhile the Falcon is the community-inspired switch, a bit like that beautifulnorthern lights set. This one is for gamers and keyboard users of all stripes who really want to know when that key has been pressed. I'm guessing rather like how a fish knows it's done for when a peregrine swoops in. These are snappy and crisp, these are bound to be a clacky retro switch. This is the keyboard you bring into the office when you just don't like your coworkers. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. All these switches are set to come out in June this year. If we don't get our hot little fingers on these bad bois at Computex, we'll be sure to let you know how they feel as soon as we do.

    "article_text": "I love a surprise. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AMD just gave us our first look at a significant update to FSR 4, codenamed \"Redstone.\" The new update is due to arrive in the second half of this year, and looks like something of a catch-up phase to counter Nvidia's recent efforts with DLSS. Top of the list is Neural Radiance Caching, which AMD says \"continually learns how light bounces in a scene to predict and store indirect lighting\". FS4 Redstone will also feature machine learning-enhanced ray regeneration, which it says is capable of regenerating inaccurate ray traced pixels. Oh, and a new ML model will be added to its Frame Generation tech, which apparently uses temporal and spatial awareness to generate frames. Phew. And a very shiny AMD-red car, to demonstrate it, of course. The news comes as a bit of a last-minute surprise, but yours truly has been typing furiously on his laptop at the press conference to catch you up. Technical details are still thin on the ground, but it all sounds good on paper, at least. In my opinion, it seems to show that AMD is all-in on machine learning-enhanced upscaling and image-improving tech, and is hopefully taking some big leaps forward in its efforts to catch up to Nvidia's DLSS. FSR has seemed a little behind the curve in the long-running battle for upscaling and AI-image enhancement domination, but AMD seems determined to speed up at this point. Perhaps the popularity of theRX 9070and theRX 9070 XTprovided a bit of motivation, or perhaps AMD are enacting a grand plan to close the gap to team green. Whatever. Improvements are improvements, and I'll be anxious to see them for myself. Things have really hotted up in the GPU announcement department recently, haven't they? Exciting times, no doubt.

    "article_text": "The little AMD card is certainly a cutie. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AMD has taken the wraps off the RX 9060 XT atComputex 2025. Some of the technical info is still a little thin on the ground—but we've now got some benchmark numbers, pricing, and a clearer idea of what to expect from the new card versus the RTX 5060 Ti, at least. Featuring 32 RDNA 4 Compute Units, 32 RT Accelerators, 64 AI Accelerators, and a 3.13 GHz boost clock, the RX 9060 XT looks, as our Nick aptly put it when summarising the earlier leaks, a bit likean RX 9070 XT chopped in two. Pricing has been confirmed starting at $299 for the 8 GB model, and $349 for the 16 GB version. Many will be hoping that it does for the RTX 5060 Ti what theRX 9070 XTdid for theRTX 5070 Ti—give it a darn good run for its money, and even the odd thrashing. Here are AMD's figures for the RX 9060 XT versus the RTX 5060 Ti at 1440p. Of course, these are not our independent benchmarks, but it looks like a promising start, at least. 6% faster, for cheaper? That'd be grand. Hot off the presses, this one: It looks fairly power efficient, too, with a 150-182 W TGP in comparison to the RTX 5060 Ti's similarly power-sipping 180 W max figure. Being an RX 9000-series card, buyers will also be able to take advantage ofFSR 4to boost frame rates—although it won't have theMulti Frame Generationadvantage the new RTX 50-series cards lean on for surprising AI-enhanced frame rate figures. However, AMD has also announced anFSR 4 update, codenamed \"Redstone\", that might even the odds somewhat. We'll have to wait and see when it releases in the second half of this year. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. While the RTX 5060 Ti has an MSRP of $379 for the 8 GB model and $429 for the 16 GB variant, the latter is often found for much more, and availability still seems to be somewhat patchy. Starting at $299 for the 8 GB version, the little RX 9060 XT might be able to pull off AMD's party trick once more and significantly undercut the RTX 5060 Ti if stocks are plentiful and that pricing holds out in reality. That's a big set of ifs, buts, and maybes, though. Still, it's a bit of a cutie with that little twin-fan reference design, isn't it? Mind you, being a reference card it won't be the one you actually buy, so I hope the AIB partners create designs of similar size. Anyway, here's hoping it's more of a Jack Russell terrier than a handbag pooch, come the independent benchmarks. Fingers crossed, yes?

Now you're here, your WednesdayWordle's sorted. Save yourself some head scratches with our May 21 (1432) hint, here to get rid of those grey letters and point you towards your latest win. Save yourself from everything if you like—we've got today's answer all typed up and ready to go. A really awkward yellow letter in my opening row was the surprise key to a lightning fast win today. If it didn't go where it appeared, but it had to fit aroundthatgreen, then…? I'll be honest with you; my brain panicked at first and tried to invent all sorts of nonsense words in a desperate attempt to make it fit in somewhere, but after a quick break I got it. Valuable items—even homes—can be fitted with these to ward off would-be thieves. Also the state you'd be in if you were in danger—if someone was stealing your valuables, for example. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. Playing Wordle well is like achieving a small victory every day—who doesn't like a well-earned winning streak in a game you enjoy? If you're new to the daily word game, or just want a refresher, I'm going to share a few quick tips to help set you on the path to success: There's no time pressure beyond making sure it's done by the end of the day. If you're struggling to find the answer or a tactical word for your next guess, there's no harm in coming back to it later on. A little help. The answer to the May 21 (1432) Wordle isALARM. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Knowing previous Wordle solutions can be helpful in eliminating current possibilities. It's unlikely a word will be repeated and you can find inspiration for guesses or starting words that may be eluding you. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and it's your job to work out which five-letter word is hiding by eliminating or confirming the letters it contains. Starting with a strong wordlike LEASH—something containing multiple vowels, common consonants, and no repeat letters—is a good place to start. Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second go should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" guess to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty.

    "article_text": "Coming June 2025. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Workstations get all the fun stuff. First, there was Maxsun's dual-GPU graphics card, now we're eyeing up 96 cores of Zen 5 from AMD. To be fair to the red team, it also announced the RX 9060 XT over at Computex, so us gamers got a little love too, but I remain a little envious of how much power is on offer for professionals. TheRyzenThreadripper 9000 Series and Pro 9000 WX-Series marks AMD's latest in its chunky workstation-grade chips. Codename 'Shimada Peak', the line-up is led by the AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX. It has 96 cores, 192 threads, and boosts up to 5.4 GHz. It also has 384 MB of L3 cache, which is the same as the previous generation. The cache size is an important figure to note. There have been rumours floating around that AMD might import 3D V-cache technology, available on both desktop Ryzen and server Epyc chips to massively boost L3 cache, to its Threadripper lineup. There's no evidence of that here, at least not for this first batch. The top chip uses 12 CCDs (chiplets containing eight cores each) and each CCD has 32 MB of cache. That's the standard amount for Zen 5. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. These chips aren't short of much, however. A 5.4 GHz boost isn't bad for a chip of this size and only on the very tippy top chips do you see a considerable drop-off in base clock. The 9995WX runs at 2.5 GHz base clock, which is to be expected with 96 cores firing on all cylinders with a 350 W TDP. There are some 'HEDT', or high-end desktop, chips that are aimed less at the pro crowd. These are led by the Ryzen Threadripper 9980X, with 64 cores, 128 threads, and 256 MB of L3 cache.

The new 9000 Series uses the same sTR5 socket as its predecessor, 'Storm Peak', otherwise known as the 7000 Series. These new chips are expected to arrive in June this year. If you're interested, I'd start saving now. Threadripper has been a rags to riches story: starting out as a dream of a few engineers and becoming a chip lineup that can cost as much as $10,000 per chip. Ouch.

    "article_text": "These are looking like a great overclocking card, if the rumours are true. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's been a hefty year for graphics card launches with both Nvidia and AMD releasing their heavy hitters upon the market. That is if you can get your hands on one. To offer some respite to this, we've been looking forward to the upcomingrumoured launch of Nvidia's RTX 5080 Super. Given Nvidia's previous release tendencies, we expected to see this card launch before the years' end. This is looking increasingly likely, as a prominent tech leaker has posted the likely specs of the upcoming card. Over on the social media formerly known as Twitter, or X, kopite7kimi has once again looked into their crystal ball to reveal the specs of an unreleased card. In what is certainly not a tweet, the famed leaker posted \"GeForceRTX 5080Super, PG147-SKU35, GB203-450-A1, 10752FP32, 256-bit GDDR7 24G 32Gbps, 400+W\" giving us a little taste at what we can expect when the card launches. GeForce RTX 5080 SuperPG147-SKU35GB203-450-A110752FP32256-bit GDDR7 24G 32Gbps400+WMay 20, 2025 What we're seeing here points at an overclocked RTX 5080 which is about what we expected. We see a slight upgrade with theBlackwellarchitecture with the 450 likely being a newer iteration over the normal card. The Cuda core is looking the same but the big upgrade here is looking to be the VRAM. Your standard RTX 5080 sports 16 GB of 30 Gbps VRAM while this new card is boasting 24G at 32Gps, which should be a nice upgrade. Of course, all this has also bumped the wattage up from 360 to a 400 W power supply.This is all about inline with what we expected, but it's worth remembering that this isn't an official source, so take it with as many grains of salt as you please. It does put more weight behind the idea that we'll definitely be seeing some sort of upgrade on the 5080 which features the 24 GB of VRAM. Given how wellthese Blackwell cards overlock, this little upgrade makes a lot of sense. It'll be interesting to see how these cards perform with the additional heft. That is of course, if you can get your hands on them in the first place. It can behard going out there to nab a new GPU, let alone at the appropriate MSRP. Having the Supers join the market will hopefully add to overall supply and give people a few more options, but there's still a lot up in the air. Between general shortage andTrump's Tariff'sthere's a lot that remains to be seen about pricing and availability of these upcoming cards, but we'll be sure to keep our eyes out and let you know.

    "title": "1741 days after being kicked off iPhones, Fortnite is back on the US App Store",
    "article_text": "Tim Sweeney makes his (partially) triumphant return after a long fight with Apple. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In August 2020, Apple kicked Fortnite off of the iOS App Store for violating its terms after Epic Games bypassed Apple's 30% transaction fee by adding its own payment processor to the battle royale game. Almost five years later, Fortnite is finally available on the US App Store again. The return isn't entirely triumphant for Epic, but at this point Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is ready for a truce. After the 2020 stunt that saw Fortnite get the boot, Sweeney took Apple to court over its insistence that iOS app developers use only Apple's payment processor—and pay its fee—and emerged with a partial victory. The court did not give Epic what it really wanted, which was to make Apple let iOS app developers include their own in-app payment options, but it did say that Apple couldn't stop them from directing users to external websites to make purchases. Apple wasn't willing to cede even that much ground, though. It 'complied' with the order by implementing a new fee that applies to out-of-app purchases and finding new ways to warn users against using third-party payment options. Epic protested, and in April of this year Apple was seriouslyreprimanded by the court, which said that the iPhone maker's compliance \"strains credulity\" and insisted that it immediately stop interfering with out-of-app purchases. That was good enough for Sweeney, who called for peace. \"If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic,\" said the CEO. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Despite insistence from the court that it \"will not tolerate further delays,\" Apple still withheld approval of Epic's Fortnite resubmission, leading to more protestation from Epic until today, when Sweeney finally announced that the game has returned to iOS devices,tweeting\"we back fam.\" Apple and Epic have told the court that they've resolved their differences (for now at least), and Fortnite is once againavailable in the US App Store. It is also available in Europe on the mobile version of the Epic Games Store, which Epic can operate on iOS in Europe and not the US due to EU regulations. (It's also on another third-party iOS app store called AltStore.) As Epic prepared for its return to the App Store after the court's ruling,it offered players a 20% bonusfor making purchases through its payment system rather than Apple's.

    "title": "I tried Google's new AI try-on feature, and it's given me some new fashion ideas",
    "article_text": "But I'll still need to try clothes on in real life When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google has rolled out a new AI-powered shopping feature to help you figure out what the clothes you are interested in buying might look like when you wear them. It's dubbed \"try it on\" and it's available right now in the US through Google Search Labs. To get started, you just need to switch it on in the lab. Then, you upload a full-length photo of yourself and start looking for clothes in the Google Shopping tab. When you click on an image of some outfit from the search results, you'll see a little \"try it on\" button in the middle of the enlarged version of the outfit in the right-hand panel. One click and about ten seconds later, you'll see yourself wearing the outfit. It may not always be a perfect illusion, but you'll at least get a sense of what it would look like on you. Google claims the whole thing runs on a model trained to see the relationship between your body and clothing. The AI can, therefore, realistically drape, stretch, and bunch material across a variety of body types. The feature doesn't work with every piece of clothing you might see, or even every type of outfit. The clothing retailer has to opt into the program, and Google said it only works for shirts, pants, dresses, and skirts. I did notice that costumes and swimwear both had no usable images, but I could put shorts on myself, and costumes that looked enough like regular clothes were usable. The AI also didn't seem to have an issue with jackets and coats as categories. For instance, on Google Shopping, I found replicas of the outfits Elvis wore for his 1966 comeback and one of his jumpsuits from the 1970s. With a couple of clicks, I could imagine myself dressed as the King in different eras. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It even changed my shoes in the all-black suit. I'd always wondered if I could pull off either look. The images are shareable, and you can save or send them to others from the Google mobile app and see how much of an Elvis your friends think you are. The details that the AI changes to make the photos work are impressive. I used the AI to try on a fun summer look and the closest to a superhero costume I could try. The original photo is me in a suit and jacket with a bowtie and black dress shoes. But the shoes and socks on both AI-generated images not only match what was in the search result, but they're shaped to my stance and size. Plus, despite wearing long sleeves and pants, the AI found a way to show some of my arms and legs. The color matches reality, but its imperfections are noticeable to me. My legs look too skinny in both, like the AI thinks I skipped leg day, and my legs in the shorts have not been that hairless since I turned 13. Imperfections aside, it does feel like this will be a major part of the next era of e-commerce. The awkward guessing of whether a color or cut works for your skin tone and build might be easier to resolve. I wouldn't say it can make up for trying them on in real life, especially when it comes to sizing and comfort, but as a digital version of holding an outfit up against you while you look in a mirror, it's pretty good. Uncanny as some of the resulting images are, I think this will be a popular feature for Google Shopping. I'd expect it to be heavily imitated by rivals in AI development and online retail, where it isn't already. I particularly like how the AI lets you see how you'd look in more outlandish or bold looks you might hesitate to try on at a store. For example, the paisley jacket and striped pants on the left or the swallowtail jacket and waistcoat with Victorian trousers on the right. I'd hesitate to order either look and would almost certainly plan on returning one or both of them even before they arrive. Returns are a plague on online retailers and waste tons of packaging and other resources. But if Google shows us how we’d look in clothes before we buy them, it could chip away at return rates; retailers will race to sign up for the program. It could also open the door to more personalized style advice from AI. You could soon have an AI personal dresser, ready to give you a virtual fit check and suggest your next look, even if it isn't something Elvis would have worn.

    "title": "\"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity\" - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says it's time to get on board with AI now, or be left behind",
    "article_text": "Nvidia and Dell reveal latest AI Factory updates When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. NvidiaCEO Jensen Huang has once again looked to highlight the huge potential AI can offer companies of all sizes in the coming months and years. Speaking at the recentDell Technologies World 2025event, Huang noted “AI is here - this is unquestionably the single biggest platform shift.” In conversation withDellTechnologies CEO Michael Dell, Huang added how, “from a technology perspective…we’re now in perception to generative to now reasoning AI models, and that’s at the raw technology level.” Huang highlighted how Nvidia and Dell are teaming for enterprise AI, which he called, “one of the largest opportunities ahead of us”. “These are companies that are essentially building a digital workforce of AI agents, which can be working in cybersecurity, software engineering, marketing and sales operations, and forecasting, and supply chain management - all these different AI agents are being created now, that can augment our human workforce with a digital workforce.” One of the biggest announcements at Dell Technologies World 2025 concerned the expansion of Dell’s AI Factory platform, which has received some significant updates thanks to Nvidia. Initially launched at DTW 2024, the next iteration of the Dell AI Factory, unsurprisingly called Dell AI Factory with Nvidia 2.0, encompasses client devices, servers, storage, data protection and networking Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The new iteration includes six new servers, including the air-cooled PowerEdge XE9780 and XE9785, and the liquid-cooled XE9780L and XE9785L, all of which support up to 192 Nvidia Blackwell Ultra GPUs with direct to chip cooling. These new releases can also be customized with up to 256 Nvidia Blackwell Ultra GPUs per Dell IR7000 rack, which Dell claims can deliver up to four-times faster large language model training than its predecessor. The two companies also announced Dell Managed Services for the Dell AI Factory with Nvidia, which looks to simplify AI operations with the management of the full Nvidia AI stack, and 100-times faster token generation per second for distributed AI inferencing, with more than 80% reduction in latency, to help support the growth of agentic AI. Noting that he and Huang had known each other “for some 30 plus years”, Dell asked the Nvidia CEO if he wanted to give any advice to the Dell Technologies World audience. \"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity - in the last 60 years, this is the biggest reinvention that you and I have seen,” Huang noted. “This is incredibly exciting technology - you want to engage it. The impact to your company is incredible. And you want to be an early adopter.” “This is the beginning of a decade of transformation. But you don't want to be second - this is the time, and you want to be first.” Mike Moore is Deputy Editor at TechRadar Pro.

    "title": "iPhone designer Jony Ive joins OpenAI, but don't expect a new ChatGPT smartphone",
    "article_text": "OpenAI is buying Ive's company, io, and they're working on something When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Jony Ive, who famously designed the iPhone (among other iconicAppledevices), is about to become the design lead forOpenAI, the chatCPT AI giant that, for now, does not make a single hardware device. The Wall Street Journalon Wednesday reported the impending deal, which sees OpenAI acquire Ive's io company in a deal valued at $6.5 billion. As part of that, Ive becomes the design lead for OpenAI, a role he's beenslowly-stepping into for some time. Ive, who famously led Apple's design for decades,left the company in 2019and, in recent months, has expressed some misgivings about the possible negative impact of the previous products he's worked on (which might include the iPhone). \"I think when you’re innovating, of course, there will be unintended consequences, You hope that the majority will be pleasant surprises. Certain products that I’ve been very, very involved with, I think there were some unintended consequences that were far from pleasant,” said Ive earlier this month,according to the Verge. While reports indicate that Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are interested in building AI-capable consumer hardware, a smartphone is probably not on that menu. Instead, most expect the duo to focus on wearables like earbuds and smartwatches that could be enhanced with, for instance, cameras that could see your surroundings and use onboard AI to help you act on and react to them. Ive's focus will also apparently be on upgrading OpenAI software's visual appeal. So expect an infusion of Ive-ness onChatGPTon mobile and the desktop (where it has a particularly techy or dev-friendly look), as well as onSoraandDall-Einterfaces. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. In the latter part of his career at Apple, Ive was most responsible for stripping away skeuomorphism – making digital icons look like their real-world counterparts – across Apple's platforms. OpenAI's software doesn't suffer from the skeuomorphic scourge, but some could argue its overall look is less than elegant. If you're curious if Ive's design skills are still up to snuff, just take a look at theupdated Airbnb, which Ive's Loveform firm redesigned. Loveform, by the way, is set to remain a stand-alone company and will, according toThe Wall Street Journal,work with OpenAI as a client. The news must sting Apple a little bit. The company, which partnered with OpenAI to include ChatGPT access inApple Intelligence, has not onlyfailed to deliverits own generative AI, but is falling behind the industry in delivering a true, combined hardware/software AI experience. It'll be fascinating to see what Altman and Ive cook up, and we already have some hints. Altman announced the deal by tweeting that he's \"excited to try to create a new generation of AI-powered computers.\" Taken literally, we might expect an AI PC from the team, but I think here Altman means \"computers writ large\" in that most intelligent consumer electronics could be considered computing devices. The tweet was accompanied by a video featuring a conversation between Ive and Altman, in which Altman described developing \"a family of devices that would let people use AI to create all sorts of different things.\" Without disclosing the product, Ive revealed that \"the first one we've been working on has almost completely captured our imagination.\" Further, Altman added that Ive handed him the device to take home. \"I've been able to live with it and I think it's the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.\" No matter what they're building, it's worth remembering that the road to AI hardware success is already littered with the rotting carcasses of failed ventures likeHuman AI. Regular people have not shown great interest in wearing AI hardware that doesn't align with their current fashion choices. thrilled to be partnering with jony, imo the greatest designer in the world.excited to try to create a new generation of AI-powered computers. pic.twitter.com/IPZBNrz1jQMay 21, 2025 That said, there may be an opportunity for OpenAI, Ive, and Altman in the smart glasses space. It's the one AI-connected device area that appears to be showing some real signs of life. That's mostly down to Meta's efforts withRay Ban Meta Smart Glasses,but also evidenced by the upcoming influx ofAndroid XRcompetitors from Google partnersSamsung, Warby Parker, and others. Some were announced this week atGoogle I/O 2025, and all of them will featureGeminiat their core. OpenAI and ChatGPT may be leading in the generative AI space, but Google Gemini is close behind. And if Android XR partners can deliver stylish Gemini Smart Glasses this year, it could quickly vault Gemini into the lead. At the very least, this puts pressure on OpenAI to deliver something. Is Jony Ive the secret sauce that will make ChatGPT AI glasses, earbuds, smart watches, and other consumer hardware possible and desirable? Maybe. OpenAI says we'll see their work next year.

The Bearseason 4has an intense trailer ahead of itsHulu(US) andDisney+(international) release on June 25. Maybe I'm reading too much into things, but deciding to include the ever-stressful clock could indicate we're counting down to the finale. There are also moments of Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) trying to remember why he loves what he does and approaching a meeting with his mother (Jamie Lee Curtis), so even if it isn't the final season, there's still plenty of drama ahead, and it seems to be building to something big. Previously, I noted thatThe Bear made Emmys history for most comedy wins, but it's still the most stressful Hulu show on TV,and I'm sure season 4 will be no different.

    "article_text": "Chrome's password manager is getting new bells and whistles When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Users can now change compromised passwords directly in their Chrome browser, in just a few clicks. This is the promise given in a new Google blog discussing the extensive changes the company is bringing to user authentication and identity verification. Most browsers already come with a (rudimentary form of)password manager, allowing users to generate strong passwords, store their credentials, and auto-fill them for speed and convenience. Now, Google’s Chrome devs, Ashima Arora, Chirag Desai, and Eiji Kitamura, said the company is building on that foundation to “fix compromised passwords in one click”. TechRadar Pro readers can get 60% off Premium Plans at RoboForm now! New users can take advantage of RoboForm’s exclusive deal and get 60% off the Premium Plan. With this deal, you can get unlimited password storage, one-click login & autofill, password sharing, two-factor authentication for added protection, cloud backup, and emergency access for trusted contacts. To claim this deal, visit this link and sign up for the Premium Plan to lock in this huge discount. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) “Automated password change makes it easier for users to respond when their credentials are at risk,” the blog reads. “When Chrome detects a compromised password during sign in, Google Password Manager prompts the user with an option to fix it automatically. On supported websites, Chrome can generate a strong replacement and update the password for the user automatically. This reduces friction and helps users to keep their account secure, without hunting through account settings or abandoning the process partway.” Passwords are still, by far, the most common and popular form of authentication. They are also the least secure form, as people tend to create weak, easy-to-guess passwords, tend to share them with friends, family and coworkers, or store them in insecure locations that hackers can easily access. The community has rallied behind alternatives such as passkeys, biometric authentication, or physical security keys. Google is also working on all of these (and then some), but stressed that passwords were “still the world’s most common authentication method,” suggesting that it’s not abandoning the practice any time soon. The full blog is a rather interesting read, discussing a unified sign-in experience, improved identity verification, and enhanced session security. You can read it in more detail onthis link.

    "title": "3D X-DRAM technology will bring bigger, faster memory by 2026, but there's no way these 512GB modules will sell to consumers",
    "article_text": "A new direction in DRAM design, but for whom? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. NEO Semiconductor’s push into 3D X-DRAM memory marks an ambitious attempt to rethink DRAM design for the AI and high-performance computing era. While the promises - stacked layers, enhanced bandwidth, and reduced power consumption - are impressive, the practicality and consumer accessibility of these technologies remain open to scrutiny. With the company projecting that its most advanced modules could reach densities of up to 512GB, it’s hard not to ask: who is this memory really for? At the core of NEO’s approach is a vertically stacked architecture that mimics the structure of 3D NAND. In NEO’s own words, the array is “segmented into multiple sectors by vertical slits,” with “word line layers connected through staircase structures.” The company compares its 3D X-DRAM density to the current 0a-node planar DRAM’s 48GB and claims to reach 512GB, but the implication that such capacities will trickle down into mainstream consumer products seems tenuous at best. The proof-of-concept chips are still in the early stages. NEO is currently developing a test version of the simpler 1T0C architecture, with the more complex, and more promising, 1T1C version planned for 2026. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The 1T1C variant utilizes IGZO transistors paired with a cylindrical high-k dielectric capacitor. It promises improved retention time, reportedly beyond 450 seconds, and supports stacking up to 128 layers. With further refinements, including the addition of 5nm-thick spacers to reduce parasitic capacitance, NEO claims stacking could exceed 512 layers. The 3T0C design, which incorporates dual IGZO layers, is geared toward in-memory computing and AI applications. Still, NEO’s statements about eliminating the need for TSV and enabling up to 32K-bit bus widths raise eyebrows. Such bandwidth sounds transformative, especially compared to the projected 2K-bit bus width of HBM4, but scaling this level of performance in real-world systems is a non-trivial task. From a broader perspective, the DRAM market hasn’t shifted significantly in terms of cost-per-GB over the past decade. Despite some fluctuations, the downward trend slowed considerably after 2012. One might expect the MacBook Pro, for instance, to ship with far more RAM by default today than it did a decade ago, but that hasn’t happened. Even with some price drops - DDR3 vs. DDR5 comparisons show modest improvement - the advances haven’t been revolutionary. Commodity pricing may fluctuate, but the overall curve has flattened. Forecasts suggest we may be near a low point before another upswing. So while 3D X-DRAM may indeed deliver bigger, faster memory by 2026, it’s unlikely these 512GB modules will be available to consumers anytime soon. More likely, such capacity and speed will be reserved for AI servers and enterprise systems, rather than everyday desktops or laptops.

Working with Kioxia, LMG officially set a newGuinness World Recordfor the \"Most Accurate Value of Pi\", reaching an incredible 300 trillion digits. This milestone was achieved using a high-performance storage setup featuring 2.2PB of Kioxia’s CM Series 30.72TB and CD Series 15.36TB PCIe NVMe SSDs. The drives were organized in a NAS system connected to a dual-CPU compute server. The entire operation ran continuously for nearly seven and a half months. “We knew breaking the Pi record with distributed network storage was going to be difficult - no one had really done it before due to the performance challenges associated with remote storage,\" said Jake Tivy, Writer & Host, Linus Media Group. \"Fortunately for us, the reliability and performance of Kioxia's NVMe SSDs enabled us to run continuous, intensive compute operations at speeds up to 100+ GB/s for nearly seven months straight, without a single SSD failure.\" The project not only broke the previous record but did so by a wide margin.StorageReview’s 202 trillion digit milestone was huge, but it wasn’t officially verified byGuinness World Records.

    "title": "iPhones just got Google’s best AI feature for free – and it could genuinely make me switch back from Android",
    "article_text": "The best AI tool I've ever used is now free on iOS When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've never owned another smartphone apart from an iPhone up until this year. However, as AI makes its way onto every tech product on the planet, I needed to try Android to understand the differences between artificial intelligence in the two ecosystems. After using aSamsung Galaxy S25for a few weeks, I returned to my iPhone 16 Pro Max. Not because it was better, but because the ecosystem you've built your life in equates to the deciding factor when it comes to choosing between flagship smartphones. Once back on iOS, I found myself missing one specific AI feature more than others, and without access on iPhone, I quickly defaulted back to living with an Android device. That AI feature I'm talking about isGemini Live, and while you could access it on iOS, the experience was dumbed down. That was untilyesterday, at Google I/O 2025, when Google announced that all of Gemini Live's capabilities are rolling out on iPhone, and at no cost. Here's why Gemini Live is the best AI tool I've ever used, and how adding all of its capabilities to iPhone means I'm ready to jump back toApple. Gemini Live already existed in the Gemini app on iOS, but it lacked two crucial elements that make the Android version that much better. Firstly, Gemini Live on iOS was unable to access your iPhone's camera, and secondly, it couldn't see what you were doing on your screen. I/O 2025 changed all that. Now, iPhone users can give Gemini Live access to their camera and screen, allowing for new ways to interact with AI that we've not really seen on iOS before. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Gemini's camera ability is single-handedly one of, if not the, best AI tool I've used to date, and I'm thrilled iPhone users can now experience it. What is Gemini Live's camera feature? Well, imagine a better version of what Apple wantedVisual Intelligenceto be. You can simply show Gemini whatever you're looking at and ask questions without needing to describe the subject. I've found Gemini Live's camera functionality thrives in situations like cooking. I used it last week to make Birria Tacos, and not only was I given advice every step of the way, but it was also able to see everything I was doing and help direct me towards a delicious dinner. Not only did propping my S25 on a stand give Gemini Live the perfect angle, but because it can connect to Google apps, I could ask it to get information on a recipe directly from the content creator's video. No need to constantly touch your phone with dirty hands in the kitchen, and no need to even check a recipe anymore. Gemini Live can do it all. Screen sharing allows Gemini Live to see what's on your display at any time, allowing you to ask questions related to imagery, something you're working on, or even how to complete a puzzle in a game. It's seriously cool, similar to Apple Intelligence-powered Siri we were promised but never received back atWWDC2024. Gemini Live's full free rollout has just started, so we're yet to see how this functionality will work on iOS. That said, if it works half as well as it does on Android, this will be a feature I could see a lot of people falling in love with. Gemini Live and its multiple ways of interacting with the world completely unlock AI on a smartphone, and now that iPhone users can access it too, I have no reason not to return to the Apple ecosystem.

Google has announced a series of updates to its AI agents in the hope that they become more streamlined as efficient colleagues, rather than tools that colleagues use. \"We envision a future where intelligent agents are not just tools, but collaborative partners in solving complex challenges, streamlining workflows, and unlocking new possibilities,\" Product Manager Polong Lin and Developer Advocate for Cloud AI Holt Skinner said in ablog post. The latest updates focus on enhanced agent management and improved agent-to-agent communication – a sign of AI becoming even more autonomous. The tech giant has enhanced its Agent Development Kit (ADK) to include a new production-ready and stable v.1.0.0 release of its Python ADK, which it says is already used by Renault Group, Box and Revionics. To coincide with this stable release, Google has also confirmed its first release of the Java ADK v0.1.0. In terms of management, acknowledging that the Vertex AI Agent Engine already helps developers deploy, manage and scale agents in production, Google has also launched its Agent Engine UI for better agent lifecycle management. Key features of the new Google Cloud console UI include a dashboard for managing deployed agents, metrics such as requests and CPU usage, session management and tracing, and deployment details with debugging tools. Further improvements to the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol have also been confirmed, including v0.2 which brings stateless interaction support for lightweight communications and standardized authentication using OpenAPI-like schema. A Python SDK for A2A has also been released to make it easier for developers to integration agent-to-agent communication within Python-based agents.

Recently,I raved about the Netflix show's confirmed all-star cast, many of whom will be joining the family. Season one put a lot of focus on Wednesday Addams' time at Nevermore Academy, and while we will be returning there, we're also going to see more of Wednesday’s family and the dynamics between its various oddball members. This is excellent news if, like me, you’ve been dying to see more from Morticia and Gomez especially, as their relationship is one of the most iconic on-screen partnerships out there. Take a look at Netflix's latest teaser below for a fun, behind-the-scenes look at what's coming up inWednesdayseason 2. Wednesdayseason 2 is the highly anticipated follow-up to one of thebest Netflix shows, and the second installment will be split into two parts – an approach Netflix has taken with other shows recently, includingCobra Kaiseason 6, which was split into three parts. The first four episodes will be released on August 6, followed by part two on September 3, when the remaining four will premier. That means there isn't too much of a wait between each edition, thankfully, but this won’t be a series you can binge-watch in a whole weekend unless you wait patiently until September.

    "article_text": "The X-E5 has a point to prove When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. With retro looks and tactile controls,Fujifilm’s early X-E cameras gained an enthusiastic following. But when theX-E4 launched in 2021, it split opinion. Praised for its compact style, fans of the series felt that Fujifilm had stripped away too many features. Now, fresh rumors suggest its successor is set to land next month. Many will be hoping it rights those minimalist wrongs. According toFuji Rumors– a reliable industry source – the Fujifilm X-E5 is due to make its debut in June. While Fujifilm hasn’t officially confirmed the model’s existence, news of a summer launch doesn’t come as a huge surprise. Talk of the new model’s imminent arrival has been circulating sincelate last year. The big question is what approach Fujifilm will take with the X-E5. Back in December, we touted it asone of the most exciting cameras of 2025. Since then, we’ve learnt nothing substantive about its specs. There have been no major online leaks, which is unusual for a camera that’s deep into development. In the absence of anything concrete, we can only speculate about what the X-E5 will look like – and what we want to see from Fujifilm’s comeback camera. On paper, the X-E4 had the makings of a winner: it inherited the 26MP X-Trans sensor and X-Processor 4 from Fujifilm’s more expensive X-mount cameras. It also retained the compact proportions and attractive rangefinder styling of previous versions. But the physical execution proved divisive. In pursuit of minimalism, Fujifilm removed a lot of the physical controls found on theX-E3. Gone were the rear control dial, AF lever and flash, plus a few buttons. Fujifilm ditched the grip, too. With no in-body image stabilization or weather-sealing either, many felt that the X-E4 prioritized style over substance. Critics pointed to the lack of dual SD card slots as evidence that the X-E4 wasn’t a tool for serious photographers. All of which was harder to justify with a body-only launch price of $850 / £799 / AU$1,399. When theX-T30 IIlaunched in November 2021, it looked like much better value. In a telling indictment of the X-E4’s shortcomings, Fujifilm stopped X-E4 production after just a couple of years. Ironically, the resulting rarity of the model actually drove its price up. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Against that background, the X-E5 has two jobs to do: win back favor among Fujifilm enthusiasts and re-establish the position of X-E series in the maker’s mirrorless line-up. The former doesn’t have to be difficult. Looking at online comments, the formula for success needs to include the reintroduction of certain physical controls, including the rear dial and a built-in grip. Other common wishlist items are a high-res EVF, a bigger battery and a 40MP APS-C sensor. In-body image stabilization would really sweeten the deal. That spec sheet would signal a clear shift back towards the enthusiast roots of the X-E series. In reality, it’s unlikely that we’ll see all of those features on the new camera, but it’s not a fools bet to suggest that Fujifilm will pitch the X-E5 as a proper photographer’s camera. Especially with theX-M5now catering for videographers. If Fujiiflm can inject the X-E5 with enough substance while keeping its analog charisma intact, it could be one of the sleeper hits of the year. Then it simply needs to make enough units to meet the inevitable demand. Rest assured, we’ll be keeping a close eye on Fujifilm announcements and rumors over the next few weeks.

The update is bringing two new difficulty modes to the game. These are Butterfly's Guidance and Awakened Puppet, both of which provide a more story-focused, easier difficulty for those not used to the intensity of soulslikes. The default difficulty that's in the game right now is being renamed 'Legendary Stalker.' There's no word yet on exactly what effects these difficulty modes will have onLies of P.But it's easy to imagine reduced damage scaling for enemies and perhaps a decrease in enemy density depending on which difficulty you select. The update is also bringing a dedicated boss rush mode to the game. Named Battle Memories, you'll be able to access this mode at the Hotel Krat Stargazer after clearing the game at least once. Battle Memories will let you challenge previously defeated bosses from both the base game and theOvertureDLC (downloadable content). Each boss has five difficulty tiers, with the harder Tiers 4 and 5 locked until you've cleared the previous ones (you'll get access to Tier 4 after beating Tier 3, for example). Publisher Neowiz has also teased additional unlockables for those willing to brave the harder tiers: \"Who knows what rewards await those who overcome these hardening challenges?\" But that's not all, as Battle Memories is being paired with another mode called Death March.

Originally created in the 1950s and covertly financed by the CIA to disseminate pro-Western narratives into the Soviet bloc, RFE/RL has more recently operated under the oversight of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM). In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order eliminating most of the agency’s funding as part of a sweeping cost-cutting agenda. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas announced the bloc’s financial lifeline on Tuesday, describing it as“short-term emergency funding”to support what she called a“vital”mission. The €5.5 million package will act as a“safety net”to help RFE/RL maintain operations in countries within Brussels’s sphere of interest, including Russia, Belarus, Iran, and several Central Asian states. “In a time of growing unfiltered content, independent journalism is more important than ever,”Kallas said following a meeting of EU foreign ministers. She acknowledged that the EU could not fully replace the lost American funding but emphasized the symbolic value of the move, urging individual member states to offer further support. Since Trump’s defunding order, RFE/RL has furloughed staff, suspended programming, and launched legal challenges. Although a Washington judge temporarily halted the administration’s decision in April, a federal appeals court later blocked the release of funds pending further litigation. The broadcaster has warned that it faces permanent shutdown in multiple regions if its financial crisis is not resolved. The Trump administration framed the defunding as part of a broader campaign to dismantle bureaucratic institutions that no longer align with US strategic interests. RFE/RL’s leadership has disputed that rationale, with its president, Stephen Capus, calling the funding cuts a“massive gift to America’s enemies.” Administration officials and critics have argued that RFE/RL and its sister outlet, Voice of America (VOA), have lost their relevance and veered toward partisan editorializing. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has publicly called for both outlets to be“shut down,”writing on X:“Nobody listens to them anymore.”",

    "title": "Russian tycoon reinstated as European Jewish Congress president",
    "article_text": "Russian entrepreneur and philanthropist Moshe (Vyacheslav) Kantor has been overwhelmingly re-elected as president of the European Jewish Congress (EJC), securing nearly two-thirds of the vote in a general assembly held Wednesday in Jerusalem. Kantor, who previously served as EJC president from 2007 until 2022, was forced to step down during his fourth term after being placed on multiple international sanctions lists in the wake of the Ukraine conflict. With the European Union and Switzerland removing Kantor from their respective sanctions earlier this year, he returned to the race and defeated interim president Ariel Muzicant of Austria. Kantor, who also holds British and Israeli citizenship, emphasized the urgency of his return in light of growing antisemitism and increasing polarization in Europe. We are proud to introduce the newly elected Executive of the European Jewish Congress, elected today in Jerusalem.pic.twitter.com/YXrewPtjfF “What we are witnessing is not only a threat to Jewish communities, it is a threat to the very foundations of European democracies,”Kantor told delegates.“If left unchecked, this growing hatred will erode the social fabric of our societies. We are already seeing increased polarization as the extremes gain strength and moderation is pushed aside.” The EJC represents over 40 Jewish national organizations and more than two million Jews across Europe. Headquartered in Brussels, the organization engages in advocacy on issues ranging from antisemitism and Holocaust memory to interfaith dialogue and minority rights. Kantor pledged to expand the EJC’s work, stressing the importance of unity with Israel and noting that the October 7 terrorist attack had reshaped how European Jews view their place in the world. “After October 7, every Jew in Europe knows that his or her destiny is absolutely tied to the destiny of the Jewish state,”Kantor said. He reaffirmed that the EJC would remain fully supportive of Israel, stating:“We will never criticize Israel in international media. We may have concerns, like any true friend. But we express them respectfully, privately and always with care.” Kantor also thanked his opponent Muzicant for“his devoted leadership in these recent difficult years,”and called for renewed unity across the Jewish diaspora. Muzicant had urged Kantor not to run again due to his ongoing presence on certain national sanctions lists, such as those maintained by the UK, Poland, and Estonia. However, Kantor’s supporters insisted he was the most experienced and impactful candidate to lead the organization. Kantor’s net worth is estimated at $9.5 billion by Forbes, largely stemming from his leadership of Acron, a major Russian fertilizer producer. Beyond his EJC role, Kantor is known for decades of philanthropic and civic work. He founded the World Holocaust Forum and previously served on the boards of Yad Vashem and Tel Aviv University. He also led the Russian Jewish Congress from 2005 to 2009 and established the European Jewish Fund.",

    "title": "Rubio accuses Biden of being ‘irresponsible’ on Russia",
    "article_text": "The administration of the previous US president, Joe Biden, acted irresponsibly by effectively shutting off communication with Russia, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said. Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday, the diplomat said that Russia possesses the“largest strategic weapon stockpile in the world and one of the largest [in] tactical nuclear weapons.” With this in mind,“there has to be some level of communication between the United States and Moscow,”irrespective of Ukraine, he insisted. According to Rubio,“it’s frankly irresponsible to not have the two biggest nuclear powers on the planet communicating, which was the case for three years”under the Biden administration. He added that the mere fact that Washington and Moscow talk to each other does not automatically mean that the two are“going to be allies or friendly.” However, communication between major players in the international arena is key in order to“prevent miscalculation and war,”the US secretary of state concluded. Despite being repeatedly pressed by Democratic representative Bill Keating to call Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal, Rubio refused to do so, explaining that“we can’t end the war [in Ukraine] without talking to Mr Putin.” In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity in early March, the top diplomat acknowledged that the Ukraine conflict is a“proxy war between nuclear powers – the United States, helping Ukraine – and Russia.”The Kremlin has long described the conflict in similar terms. In another interview the previous month, Rubio pointed out that“even in the worst days of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union maintained communication.” “Whether we like it or not, Russia is a power, a global power,”he stated, emphasizing that dialogue is absolutely necessary to prevent“dangerous confrontations.” Around the same time, US President Donald Trump claimed that“if we would have had [the Biden] administration for another year, you would have been in World War III, and now it’s not going to happen.”",

    "title": "Trump responds to Zelensky’s call for tougher Russia sanctions",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has pushed back on calls by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky for tougher sanctions on Russia, saying the decision is his alone. Zelensky has continued to press for additional restrictions, accusing the Kremlin of failing to follow through on peace overtures. Western nations have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022 – measures Moscow has repeatedly condemned as illegal and ineffective. Asked by reporters on Wednesday whether he was considering new measures, Trump said it would be“my determination”and“nobody else’s.” He recalled a two-and-a-half-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week, followed by a conversation with EU leaders.“We’ll see how Russia behaves. We’ll see what’s going to happen,”Trump said, adding,“We have a pretty critical time right now.” Both Putin and Trump described Monday’s call as productive. Trump said he believed Putin was interested in ending the conflict and warned that additional economic pressure could hinder Washington’s mediation efforts. Putin has said Moscow and Kiev should negotiate a formal memorandum outlining a detailed path to a broader peace agreement, and that a ceasefire could be part of the proposed road map. Trump said he expects progress within two weeks but acknowledged that reaching a deal would be difficult. On Tuesday, the EU and UK introduced new rounds of sanctions targeting Russia. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, a vocal critic of Moscow, said further measures were“in the works.” In a series of posts on X on Tuesday and Wednesday, Zelensky welcomed the move by Kiev’s European supporters, calling it“a step in the right direction.”He also emphasized the need to work closely with the US so that“at some point,”it will impose appropriate sanctions as well. Last week, delegations from Russia and Ukraine met in Istanbul for their first direct talks since Kiev unilaterally withdrew from the peace process in 2022. Russia’s top negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, later said that both sides had agreed to conduct a prisoner exchange involving 1,000 POWs each and to continue contacts once both had prepared detailed ceasefire proposals. Kiev previously demanded an unconditional 30-day ceasefire from Russia before entering direct negotiations – an idea that Moscow said amounts to asking for time for the Ukrainian military to regroup. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that Moscow and Kiev would each draft their own version of the proposed memorandum, after which“difficult”negotiations would follow to agree on a single text.",

    "title": "Netanyahu’s forever war is killing Israel faster than its enemies",
    "article_text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has trapped himself in a predicament that requires him to either bow out of power or drag his whole state down with him. In over 18 months, Israel has failed to defeat any of its enemies and escalation in Gaza could be the most dangerous decision he has taken yet. While the Israeli prime minister insists on continuing the war on Gaza, holding to his pledge to“crush and destroy”Hamas, he has failed to do so and according to his own nation’s intelligence estimates, the victory he speaks of is nowhere in sight. Now, Netanyahu has declared a new military operation in the Gaza Strip, labelling it“Gideon’s Chariots,”allegedly seeking the re-occupation of the entirety of the besieged coastal territory. Just prior to this, the US brokered a historic direct deal with Hamas to release an Israeli-American dual national, Idan Alexander; a soldier who had been taken as a prisoner of war on October 7, 2023. In return, Hamas say they were informed that the US was going to pressure Israel to allow in humanitarian aid to Gaza after an eight-week total blockade. Instead of permitting the entrance of humanitarian aid, Israel decided to ramp up its bombing campaign, displacing over 300,000 Palestinians and killing around 300 in only 48 hours. Afterwards, Israeli PM Netanyahu stated publicly that even in the event that all the captives held in Gaza are returned,he will not end the war. However, prior to US President Donald Trump’s trip to the Arabian Peninsula last week, a series of stories were published in the Israeli and international press, claiming that a major feud was brewing between Netanyahu and the American leader. So the narrative went, anonymous sources claimed that Trump had cut off direct communication with his Israeli counterpart, and that he was snubbing Netanyahu by not visiting Israel during his trip to the region and even that he was going to recognize a Palestinian State. Not only did Trump deny a schism between himself and Netanyahu in a recent Fox News interview, he even claimed that October 7, 2023, was one of the most violent days in history, which is, to say the least, a ridiculous assertion by any standard. Then came Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s interview with CBS News this Saturday, where he stated thatthe US supports the destruction of Hamas, while also saying the US seeks a deal to allow the release of more Israeli captives. It is clear from his language that Rubio has adopted the same stance as Israel, and that the war won’t stop until Hamas is defeated; in other words, the Israeli soldiers being held captive in Gaza are not the reason for the war. Anonymous claims of the US president standing up to Israel are not new. In December of 2023, former American President Joe Biden allegedlyshouted at Netanyahu and hung up the phone, according to unnamed sources. Month after month, reports emerged about the so-calledthreats that Biden was issuingto the Israeli government. In October of 2024, headlines were even made of claims by Bob Woodward, in his book ‘War’, where he wrote that Biden called Netanyahu a“bad f***ing guy”and a“f***ing liar”. In April, it emerged through an Israeli Channel 13 investigative report that the Biden administration, which US media reported was“working tirelessly”for a ceasefire in Gaza, hadnever once pressured Israel to do so. The truth is, if the US was to tell Israel to stop its war on Gaza, it would end tomorrow. It won’t. Every senior official in the Trump administration is a diehard supporter of Israel that has taken money from pro-Israel groups, while the Republican President’s campaign was bankrolled by Israel’s richest billionaire, Miriam Adelson. Donald Trump speaks a big game when it comes to negotiating settlements to conflicts. One day he takes a breakthrough stance on an issue, before reverting back to the same exact positions the Biden administration held only a day later. On the other hand, the Israeli prime minister appears to have shot himself in the foot after deciding to violate the US-fostered ceasefire agreement in Gaza. He did this by choosing the issue of blocking humanitarian aid as his hill to die on. Although the Israeli military and coalition speak a big game when it comes to their options in Gaza, the reality is that their ground force is fatigued and ill-trained, having long lost motivation for the fight, and is not drawing enough men to carry out major operations without leaving Israel vulnerable on other fronts. Therefore, the Israeli army has remained in the buffer zone areas in Gaza, as the political leadership took the decision to apply pressure through collectively punishing some 2 million civilians. Netanyahu pledged to prohibit all food, water, fuel and medical supplies from entering Gaza. It has now been over 80 days since that decision was made. This blatant war crime, however, has provoked a significant international backlash and even forced the US to comment publicly that it is working on getting aid into Gaza. But there is one issue: Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition allies, belonging to the Religious Zionism Bloc, have begun threatening to leave the government if he lets food reach Palestinian civilians. This meant that a show had to be put on, one in which the likes of Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have been made to believe that their prime minister has lost favour with Donald Trump; the most loved political figure amongst Israelis. In this theater, the Israeli public were convinced that significant pressure had been applied on Netanyahu to reach a ceasefire agreement. So what does Netanyahu do now? He launches a new military operation against Gaza, knowing it will have no teeth and will simply target civilians and the territory’s remaining infrastructure, while limited incursions will also take place. Meanwhile, the Israeli leader will also appear to be standing up to the US in rejecting a ceasefire, while trickles of aid trucks slowly enter Gaza in a way that won’t trigger a major backlash. But Benjamin Netanyahu won’t finish there, he wants to show that he has taken on all of Israel’s enemies on every single front, and so Iran is at the top of his list of priorities. Finally, after 18 months of one of the most appalling civilian bloodbaths in modern history, the European nations are beginning to change their tone regarding the starvation policy being inflicted on Gaza, now combined with a renewed ground offensive. When we look at the predicament of Gaza, it cannot be separated from the other fronts. The war with Hezbollah in Lebanon is far from over, although it is only Israel that is bombing Lebanese territory for now. While Western officials and think-tanks claim that Hezbollah has been defeated and crushed, the reality is that it is nowhere near over. In fact, the events that have taken place since last September have only been used by the group to energize its base in a way we haven’t seen since the early 2000s. As for Yemen, the US was defeated by Ansarallah (the Houthis), despite the disparity between the sides. Ultimately, Washington was forced to concede that anything short of a ground invasion would fail to deter the Yemeni Armed Forces (YAF) from fighting Israel. The only way this war ends is with a showdown between Iran and Israel. It is unlikely that the US will seek to engage in an all-out war with the Islamic Republic, understanding well that this will come at an enormous cost to its troops, bases and allies in the region. Therefore, it is much more conceivable that this conflict will be controlled to one extent or another. After all, the massive investments pledged by Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, didn’t come for free; they all seek security in return. Staring directly at a dead end in Gaza, the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has only one way out if it seeks to escalate further: a series of strikes targeting the Iranian nuclear program. The Iranian air defences have not been degraded, as Washington-based think tanks and the Israeli leadership claim was the result of their last attack on the country. This does not mean, however, that the Israelis don’t have the capabilities to strike nuclear sites, they clearly do. Assuming they use conventional weapons to do so, it could potentially set the program back a few years. If the Israeli attack is limited and the US only plays a support role, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) will most likely limit its strikes to military sites and perhaps infrastructure like the power grid and/or ports. This would effectively ground, or at least degrade the capabilities of the Israeli air force, leaving an opening for Hezbollah to liberate the south of their country from occupation and restore their prestige following the tactical losses inflicted upon them. The big question mark here are the dozen or so armed groups based in the Gaza Strip. If Israel is having to concentrate its ground forces in the north and its air force is not operating at full capacity, there is the potential for a Hamas move that no other regional player would dare take. Considering the aforementioned scenario, it is conceivable that there is a way for Israel and the US to launch a battle against Iran which could close every front of the war, but there are two major issues that even get in the way of this: Netanyahu’s personal calculations for remaining in power and the predicament of Gaza. Israel is seeking to implement a plan to militarize and privatize the distribution of aid to Gaza’s civilian population, an initiative that the United Nations and rights groups have strongly opposed. Perhaps they believe that this will help facilitate their push towards ethnically cleansing the Palestinians from the besieged coastal territory, yet Egypt and other surrounding nations still refuse this as an option. Then comes the idea of Israeli forces occupying Gaza internally, which would be so incredible even if they could, that discussing the ins and outs of it would be a worthless endeavour. Israel has refused to actually fight the dozen or so Palestinian armed factions, which is why it has managed to keep its soldier casualties low and also explains why not a single one of the groups has been defeated. Even smaller groups like the Salah al-Deen Brigades, Mujahideen Brigades and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades are still standing. “Total victory”, as the Israeli prime minister claims is his goal, is not possible. If he chooses to continue carrying on in the way he is today, he could end up provoking an escalation on one of the fronts that suddenly results in total defeat. Traumatized, frustrated and longing for revenge, these are the attitudes felt by millions across the region. An unexpected development in the West Bank, Syria, East Jerusalem or even on the domestic front from within the deeply divided Israeli society, all could spell disaster for Netanyahu. Despite all of the countless vulnerabilities, which extend beyond what is mentioned here, the US continues to give its Israeli allies carte blanche to commit whatever aggression they choose. At this stage, Washington is not a friend of Israel’s, it is its official hype man, supplying an endless stream of bombs and failing to consider how quickly the situation could explode. This was the exact same thinking that caught the US and Israel with their pants down on October 7, 2023, except the stakes are now much higher.",

    "title": "Ukraine wants Putin-Zelensky meeting – foreign minister",
    "article_text": "Ukraine is interested in Russian President Vladimir Putin having face-to-face talks with Vladimir Zelensky, according to the country’s foreign minister, Andrey Sibiga. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov pointed out this past weekend that such a meeting is“possible,”but only after the negotiators from Moscow and Kiev reach“certain agreements”regarding the settlement of the Ukraine conflict. Sibiga was asked by Euronews on Tuesday about Kiev’s reaction to Pope Leo XIV’s offer to host the continuation of talks between Russia and Ukraine at the Vatican. The dialogue restarted after a three-year break in Istanbul, Türkiye last week. “I can confirm to you that proposals to organize possible contacts, including at the level of leaders, were made by the Vatican,”he replied. Kiev is ready to“consider potential venues for such a meeting,”the foreign minister said, referring to the possible Putin-Zelensky talks. The Ukrainian leader would also like to get together with US President Donald Trump, Sibiga added. After Putin offered for the sides to engage in unconditional direct talks in Istanbul on May 15, Zelensky said that he would arrive in Türkiye, but insisted that he would only talk with the Russian president, who never voiced an intention to take part in the meeting personally. Zelensky eventually changed his stance on the issue and the talks taking proceeded with a one-day delay, involving a Russian delegation headed by presidential adviser Vladimir Medinsky and a Ukrainian team led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. According to Medinsky, the Ukrainians have also asked for a meeting between Putin and Zelensky during the negotiations in Istanbul, with their request being“taken into account”by Moscow. Following the phone call between Putin and Trump on Monday, the US president claimed that Moscow and Kiev would immediately begin direct negotiations on introducing a ceasefire. Putin, on his part, said that Russia would work with the Ukrainian side to draft a memorandum on a potential future peace treaty that would outline a“range of provisions,”including the timeline for a potential temporary truce“should the necessary agreements be reached.”",

    "title": "Second Ukrainian national charged in UK PM arson probe",
    "article_text": "A Ukrainian national has been charged in connection with arson attacks in London targeting a“high-profile public figure,”the Metropolitan Police announced on Wednesday. Several media outlets earlier reported that the arsonists had set fire to properties that belonged or used to belong to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. According to the police,“Petro Pochynok, 34… has been charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life.”The man was apprehended on Monday and became a third suspect. The arson attacks at the center of the investigation are said to have taken place in rapid succession earlier this month: a vehicle was set ablaze on May 8, a fire was lit at the entrance of a property on May 11, and one more similar incident happened at a residential address on May 12. The authorities stopped short of naming the supposed target, noting, however, that all three cases“have connections with a high-profile public figure, and therefore officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command led the investigation.” According to The Telegraph newspaper, the first incident saw a Toyota Rav4 set ablaze in Kentish Town, a neighborhood of London. The vehicle had reportedly previously belonged to Starmer but was later sold to a neighbor. Media reports have further claimed that on May 11, a fire broke out at the entrance of a flat in Islington that Starmer is said to have owned in the 1990s. The last of the three suspected arson attacks reportedly targeted the prime minister’s current family home in Tufnell Park, which is being rented out to his sister-in-law. No injuries were reported in any of the incidents. Addressing the UK Parliament last week, Starmer described the alleged arsons as an“attack on all of us, on democracy and the values that we stand for.” As part of the same investigation, another Ukrainian national, Roman Lavrynovych, 21 years of age, was charged with three counts of arson with intent to endanger life and was remanded in custody by Westminster Magistrates’ Court last Friday. On Tuesday, 26-year-old Stanislav Carpiuc, who holds Romanian citizenship, was charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life, and similarly remanded in custody until a further hearing alongside Lavrynovych, slated for June 6. The Telegraph reported that investigators are looking into a number of potential motives, including the involvement of a hostile state.",

Hours before India and Pakistan agreed to the ceasefire, Wang called Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and expressed hope that New Delhi and Islamabad“would remain calm and restrained, properly handle differences through dialogue and consultation and avoid escalating the situation.” On Monday, an official from a think tank affiliated with the Indian Defense Ministry told Bloomberg that China hadprovided Pakistanwith air defense and satellite support during the recent military standoff in South Asia.",

    "title": "Syria facing collapse – Rubio",
    "article_text": "Syria could face a surge of violence and total collapse within weeks, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has told lawmakers in Washington. The top US diplomat has defended President Donald Trump’s approach to Syria, including the decision to lift unilateral sanctions and meet in person with the new Syrian president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, despite his jihadist background. ”The transitional authority, given the challenges they’re facing, are maybe weeks – not many months – away from potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions,”Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday.“Basically, the country is splitting up.” The secretary blamed former President Bashar Assad for the continued violence since 2011, when a US-backed effort to remove him from power led to a prolonged and bloody conflict. Rubio said Syria had become“a playground for jihadist groups, including ISIS and others.”Al-Sharaa, who once led the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) under the name Abu Mohammad al-Julani, rose to power after deposing Assad last year. Although the new Syrian leadership“didn’t pass their background check with the FBI,”Rubio said the US must support them to prevent wider regional instability. He argued that pragmatic foreign policy means that the US human rights agenda is“different in certain parts of the world”than in others. Lifting sanctions would allow foreign aid into Syria, potentially stabilizing the economy and encouraging millions of displaced Syrians to return, Rubio said. The White House, however, remains uncertain whether its approach will succeed. ”If we engage [the al-Sharaa government], it may work out, it may not work out,” Rubio stated.“If we did not engage them, it was guaranteed to not work out.” US sanctions had aimed to stymie Assad’s efforts to rebuild the country after he regained control of most of Syria by 2015. Persistent issues had eroded the morale of the Syrian military, which largely refused to defend Damascus when HTS launched its offensive last November. Al-Sharaa has pledged to uphold Syria’s ethnic and religious diversity as he courts Western backing. However, his rule has been marked by reported massacres of Alawites, Christians, and Assad supporters. Israel has carried out multiple airstrikes in Syria in recent months, claiming the attacks were intended to defend Druze militias from fighters aligned with the new government.",

    "article_text": "Former Ukrainian lawmaker and presidential adviser Andrey Portnov was fatally shot in a suburb of the Spanish capital, Madrid, on Wednesday, local media has reported. The circumstances of the murder suggest it may have been an“extrajudicial execution,”as Portnov may have had access to information that could threaten figures in Vladimir Zelensky’s administration, Rodion Miroshnik, Russia’s ambassador-at-large overseeing a special mission on alleged Ukrainian war crimes, has said. The killing occurred in Pozuelo de Alarcon, according to the newspaper El Pais. Portnov, 51, was reportedly approached by two or three assailants and shot at least five times, including three times in the head, while inspecting the trunk of his Mercedes car, near a private school attended by his children. Spanish authorities have confirmed a homicide took place in the area but are yet to formally identify the victim. #SUMMA112confirma el fallecimiento de un varón con heridas por arma de fuego en#PozueloDeAlarcón.Colabora@SEAPAPozueloy#PolicíaLocal.@policiase encarga de la investigación.pic.twitter.com/yJJnoCcval Portnov, a lawyer by training, served in the Ukrainian parliament from 2006 to 2010. He later joined President Viktor Yanukovich’s administration, overseeing judicial reform as deputy chief of staff and helping draft a new criminal code that was adopted in 2012. In 2014, Portnov fled Ukraine following the Western-backed armed coup in Kiev that ousted Yanukovich’s government. Despite going into exile, he remained active in Ukrainian political discourse, frequently appearing on national television. Portnov returned to the country in 2019 to support presidential candidate Vladimir Zelensky. After Zelensky won the election, Portnov filed several legal complaints against outgoing President Pyotr Poroshenko, alleging various offenses committed during his time in office. None of those cases resulted in convictions. He reportedly left Ukraine again in June 2022. At the time, Ukrainian media described him as being aligned with“pro-Russian media”outlets that had been shut down by the Zelensky administration and he was accused of making disparaging remarks about the nature of the 2014 coup. Portnov has been listed since at least 2015 by Mirotvorets, a controversial semi-official public database that catalogs individuals deemed enemies of Ukraine. Several people listed by the site have been murdered over its decade of operation. Ukrainian intelligence services have previously claimed or implied involvement in a number of targeted killings of individuals labeled as enemies by Kiev. Some of those assassinations have occurred outside Ukraine, including the December 2023 shooting of former Ukrainian lawmaker Ilya Kiva near Moscow.",

    "title": "US confirms South Africa G20 boycott",
    "article_text": "The US will not participate in upcoming G20 events hosted by South Africa, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on Tuesday. The decision, firstreportedby the media last week, comes amid growing tensions between the two nations. The administration of US President Donald Trump has accused South Africa of enabling what it called a racially motivated“genocide,”a claim President Cyril Ramaphosa has dismissed as a“completely false narrative.” Speaking before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio cited several reasons for the boycott, including that the agenda of the events fails to“reflect the priorities of this administration.”He added that South Africa broadly aligns itself with countries such as Iran and China, which the US views as strategic rivals. ”When one country is consistently unaligned with the United States on issue after issue after issue after issue – now you have to make conclusions about it,”the secretary of state said. Rubio also criticized Pretoria’s stance on Israel, describing it as“not just off balance but completely geared towards one side.” In 2023, South Africa filed a case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide over its military actions in Gaza. The court issued an injunction against Israel in January 2024, which the Israeli government has ignored. The hostilities were triggered by a deadly October 2023 incursion led by the Palestinian militant group Hamas and has since escalated into a broader regional crisis. Israeli officials have described their recently relaunched military campaign as an effort to“conquer”Gaza. Rubio’s remarks came as Ramaphosa arrived in Washington in an effort to“reset and revitalize bilateral relations,”according to a statement from his office. The South African leader is expected to meet President Trump on Wednesday to discuss trade proposals put forward by his government.",

    "title": "Trump issues ‘Golden Dome’ promise",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has announced the formal launch of a new nationwide missile defense initiative dubbed the“Golden Dome,”pledging to build a space-integrated shield capable of intercepting missiles from anywhere in the world. Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump described the“cutting-edge”project, with an estimated cost of $175 billion, as a historic leap forward in American homeland defense. “This design for the Golden Dome will integrate with our existing defense capabilities and should be fully operational before the end of my term,”Trump said.“Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles, even if they are launched from other sides of the world – and even if they are launched from space.” The missile shield will combine current defense assets with next-generation technologies deployed across land, sea, and space – including orbital sensors and interceptors, Trump said. Moscow has previously criticized the initiative as a destabilizing step toward the weaponization of space. “We’re the only ones that have this – we call it ‘super technology.’ Nobody else has it, and nobody else has anything close to what we have,”Trump claimed, while offering few technical details on how the Golden Dome will actually operate. The initiative will be led by General Michael Guetlein, Vice Chief of Space Operations at the US Space Force, who previously described the effort as being“on the magnitude of the Manhattan Project.” The Golden Dome evolved from the administration’s initial“Iron Dome for America”concept, and was renamed earlier this year. Unlike Israel’s Iron Dome, which is designed to intercept short-range rockets, the US version is intended to counter a broader range of aerial threats, including hypersonic and orbital systems. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized that new technological advancements now make the decades-old vision of comprehensive missile defense more feasible.“The technology wasn’t there. Now it is,”he said, apparently referencing President Ronald Reagan’s abandoned“Star Wars”program from the Cold War era. An initial $25 billion has already been earmarked in Trump’s proposed defense budget, with bipartisan support expected on Capitol Hill. However, some lawmakers have raised concerns about long-term costs and technical feasibility. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that the total cost of such a system could range from $161 billion to $542 billion over two decades. Despite skepticism in some quarters, the administration has framed the Golden Dome as essential to defending the US against evolving missile threats from rivals like Russia and China, as well as rogue actors. A recent Defense Intelligence Agency briefing warned that adversaries are actively developing systems designed to exploit vulnerabilities in American defenses. The US move is“openly aimed”at undermining the strategic deterrents of Russia and China, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said after Trump signed a corresponding executive order in January, arguing that it“will not contribute to reducing tensions or improving the situation in the strategic sphere.”",

    "title": "Ukraine distracting West from ‘more serious’ issues – Rubio",
    "article_text": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has defended President Donald Trump’s foreign policies and priorities, including his reluctance to join the EU and UK in imposing further sanctions on Russia or increasing arms supplies to Ukraine. Following his lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, Trump told journalists that Washington does not want to impose additional sanctions on Moscow“because there’s a chance”of progress toward a settlement of the Ukraine conflict. Secretary Rubio was grilled on this and other issues during a three-hour-long appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday. Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, claimed that“whatever happens in Ukraine sets the table for what happens in the Indo-Pacific,”suggesting that an outright Russian victory could embolden China to make more assertive moves. “But by the same token, I would say there’s a flip side to that, and that is every minute we spend, every dollar we spend on this conflict in Europe is distracting both our focus and our resources away from the potential for a much more serious, much more cataclysmic confrontation in the Indo-Pacific,”Rubio replied. Rubio has previously stated that countering China will be central to US foreign policy during Trump’s second term. He reiterated on Tuesday that“every minute that we spend on this conflict – that cannot be won by military means – every resource that’s expended into it is money and time that’s not being spent on preventing a much more serious confrontation from a global perspective in the Indo-Pacific.” The rivalry between Washington and Beijing has intensified since Trump’s return to office, with both nations expanding their military and economic influence in the region and beyond. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth declared in February that China was America’s top defense priority, citing“stark strategic realities.”Speaking in Brussels at a gathering of Ukraine’s supporters, he described Beijing as a“peer competitor”with both the capability and intent to threaten US interests in the Indo-Pacific. Washington has previously signaled that it plans to shift its military focus to Asia, while Trump has repeatedly urged the EU to take the lead in its own defense and bear the primary responsibility for future security guarantees to Kiev. The US president argued that Washington should never have intervened in Ukraine, suggesting that Kiev would be“better off”if the conflict with Moscow had remained a“European situation.” “This is not our war… I mean, we got ourselves entangled in something that we shouldn’t have been involved in… The financial amount that was put up is just crazy,”the US president said on Monday. The Putin-Trump call was characterized asproductiveby both leaders. Trump said he believes Putin is interested in ending the conflict and warned that additional economic pressure couldobstructUS mediation efforts. However, theEU and UK imposed new sanctionson Russia on Tuesday, escalating their campaign to pressure Moscow while ramping up support for Kiev.",

    "title": "Israel could strike Iranian nuclear facilities – CNN",
    "article_text": "The chance of an Israeli military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities“has gone up significantly”in recent months, CNN reported on Tuesday, citing multiple US officials familiar with new intelligence assessments. While Israeli leadership has not made a final decision, recently intercepted communications suggest that planning is actively underway, unnamed sources have told the network. US intelligence has also noted Israeli military activities, including the movement of air munitions and the completion of air exercises, which could indicate preparations for an“imminent strike.” Several officials acknowledged that these actions might serve as a strategic signal to Iran, aiming to pressure Tehran into concessions during ongoing negotiations with Washington. However, one source cited by CNN warned that“the prospect of a Trump-negotiated US-Iran deal that doesn’t remove all of Iran’s uranium makes the chance of a strike more likely.” US President Donald Trump tore up the 2015 UN-backed agreement on Iran’s nuclear program during his first term in office. He accused Tehran of secretly violating the deal and reimposed sanctions. Iran responded by rolling back its own compliance with the accord and accelerated its enrichment of uranium. Since returning to the White House, Trump has been pressuring Tehran into a new agreement and has even threatened to bomb the country if a deal isn’t reached. Iran and Israel exchanged strikes in April and October of last year, marking the most dramatic escalation between the regional rivals. Earlier this year, Israel reportedly proposed“anextensive bombing campaign”to knock out Iranian nuclear facilities, according to the New York Times, but Trump refused to back it, opting instead to pursue diplomacy. Since then, according to Reuters, West Jerusalem has been considering a more“limited strike”that would require minimal US support. Despite the belligerent rhetoric, the US and Iran have held several rounds of talks in Oman in recent months, which have been described by both sides as constructive and productive. However, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, stated last week that while Washington wants to resolve the standoff with Tehran diplomatically, it has“one very, very clear red line… We cannot allow even 1% of an enrichment capability.” Iran currently enriches uranium to 60% purity, far above the 3.67% cap set under the now-defunct nuclear deal and close to the 90% needed for weapons-grade material. While US and Israeli officials have for years warned that Tehran is just weeks away from a nuclear breakthrough, the Islamic Republic insists that its nuclear program is peaceful and not aimed at producing a bomb. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi dismissed the US demand to fully dismantle its nuclear facilities as“unrealistic,”saying Tehran would continue enriching uranium with or without a deal. He also suggested that some statements by US officials are“completely detached from the reality of negotiations.”",

    "title": "15 Best Summer Colognes 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The warm weather is here, fellas, which means it’s time to reach for the best summercolognesthat vibe with longer days and golden rays. I’ve been coveringfragrancesfor over a decade, and while I’ll always say wear what you prefer year round, some notes just hit differently this time of year. Fall and winter lean into rich woods, spices, ouds, and gourmands, but summer is all about lighter, brighter tones—think citrus, florals, aquatics, and lush greenery. And it’s not just seasonal mood—it’s science: Heat accelerates the evaporation of lighter notes, making these fresher compositions feel more alive and in tune with the sun-soaked rhythm of the season. Today's top perfumers prove that summerscentscan be just as nuanced and intoxicating as their cold-weather counterparts—and the best warm-weathercolognescapture the season's spirit without sacrificing depth or personality. Whether you’re drawn to bright citrus, solar warmth, or airy florals, there's no shortage of standout fragrances. Below, you'll find 15 of the best summer colognes from top luxury houses to indie niche gems. Some are fresh launches, while others are OGs that have earned a permanent spot in any warm-weather rotation; a few are perfect for beach days, others refined for evening soirées, and some are reliable daily spritzers. The one thing they have in common? They all shine when the temperature rises. Trudon Trudon Key notes:Mandarin, Orange Blossom, Saffron, Incense, Guaiac Wood Iconic Parisian fragrance house Trudon has been crafting candles for French cathedrals and royalty since 1643—and they make some of my all-time favorite home aromas. But Trudon isn't just about wondrous scented wax—they've brought their storied expertise in crafting ethereal personal fragrances. Their latest, Absolu, is a citrus stunner with the same richness and depth as one of their signature candles. Inspired by Louis XIV's love of orange blossom, it opens with a burst of mandarin and orange before evolving into something woodier and headier. Guaiac wood, frankincense, and cedar lend a subtle, church-like gravitas, while saffron and cardamom add a gourmand warmth, rounding out a complex composition. And like all Trudon creations, there's a signature incense-laced undercurrent—an element that makes Absolu a unique, almost spiritual take on the classic citrus accord. The Maker Bluemercury Key notes:Lychee, Grapefruit, Rosewater, Pineapple, Frangipani, Sandalwood, Musk. The Maker Hotel is more than an immersive, bohemian-chic escape in upstate New York—the brand has also earned serious praise for a niche fragrance line that’s quickly becoming a modern classic. One of my all-time favorites, the rich and woodsy Stag, is an indie fragrance award winner. But their freshly unveiled fume, Revel, is what I’d label a solar fragrance—bright, warm, uplifting, led by citrus, and rounded out with florals, aquatics, and the carefree mood of fresh summer air. It bursts with sparkling energy: pineapple, rosewater, frangipani, and gardenia, all anchored by a base of sandalwood and velvet musk. It’s what you wear when celebrating—or want to be the best-smelling guy at the cabana. Pure solar joy—citrus, aquatic, and fruity freshness—bottled in The Maker’s chic signature ribbed vessel. Profumum Roma Osswald Key notes:Amalfi lemon, cedar, volcano broom The Italian fragrance house Profumum Roma still feels like an insider secret—at least here in the States. I was introduced to the brand atOsswald NYC,one of the best luxury perfumeries in NYC and one of the only places to acquire it. Profumum Roma doesn't chase trends or clout—they let their fragrances speak for themselves. These rich, elegant compositions usually spotlight a few key notes, each distinct yet luxuriously harmonized. Their catalog contains many hits, but I love Acqua Viva for summer. Amalfi lemon, volcano broom (a mineral-forward aroma), and cedar are the aromatic embodiment of quiet luxury: citrusy, aquatic, subtly regal, and deeply transportive. It's a scent for the confident guy unwinding somewhere chic and off the grid and not posting about it. Even if you're not making it to the Amalfi Coast this summer, one spritz of this scent will transport you there. Creed Neiman Marcus Key notes:Tuberose, Jasmine, Rose, Eucalyptus, Bergamot, Cedarwood, Vetiver 19th-century French aristocrats wore floral colognes as status symbols, while the dapper gents of early 20th-century America made florals all the rage. Maybe it’s the winter-woods fanatic in me, but I’ve just never quite vibed with floral colognes. That is until I tried Royal Mayfair—an under-the-radar gem inCreed’siconic catalog. It’s the most luxurious, gentlemanly, and beautifully complex take on gardenia I’ve ever worn. Lush, refined floral notes of tuberose, jasmine, and rose form the heart, while eucalyptus and bergamot lend a green-citrus tone before it all dries down into an earthy base of cedarwood and vetiver. It’s the olfactory equivalent of strolling through a fragrant royal garden in full bloom on a summer’s day, with layers of herbs, citrus, and woods unfolding along the stroll. Royal Mayfair is a regal homage to the classic floral colognes of a bygone era—but reimagined with a fragrance pyramid for today. Yes, it’s a splurge—but this exquisite floral rewards you with every wear. Amouage Osswald Key notes:Bergamot, Cardamom, Frankincense, Juniper, Patchouli, Vanilla I love seeing the rise of Amouage. (On a recent trip to Milan, I saw just how packed one of their boutiques was—on aTuesday.) Founded in Oman, the brand has gained serious traction Stateside due to its regal, ultra-lux compositions. I recently attended the launch of their new summer scent, Decision, where I met with the brand and got to experience the fragrance firsthand—and after one spritz, I understood the hype. It opens with a bright mix of bergamot, cardamom, and juniper berries before settling into a warm heart of vanilla and patchouli with a woodsy depth from frankincense and myrrh. It’s a complex scent that evolves as you wear it—sweet, woodsy, bright—and always chic and elegant. Wear this for special occasions, and you’ll easily be one of the best-smelling guys at the soirée. Loewe Harrods Key notes:Pear, Mango, Coconut, Sandalwood, Amber, Rockrose Wildflower Loewe has so many distinct and eclectic fragrance lines that it can be hard to keep track, but for summer,Paula’s Ibizais an OG—and its newer iteration,Ibiza Cosmic, brings those sun-kissed vibes straight into the golden hour. It opens with juicy mango and coconut for an unmistakably tropical feel but then deepens into something more intriguing with warm sandalwood, amber, pear, and cypress. It’s fruity and woody, creamy and heady, but never immature or cloyingly sweet like some tropical scents can be. Instead, it smells like you’ve just had a fantastic beach day and are now strolling the boardwalk—skin still warm from the sun, with hints of salt, sunscreen, and maybe a fruity cocktail riding the breeze. And the tie-dye packaging is one of the coolest out there, even if you’re not a Deadhead. Yves Saint Laurent Yves Saint Laurent Key notes:Bergamot, Fig, Iris, Neroli, Cedar, Musk YSLhas been on a roll lately, dropping rich and effortlessly wearable colognes—some more accessible, others more elevated from the Le Vestiaire Des Parfums Collection—all infused with that unmistakable YSL aura. Trench isn’t your typical citrus-floral; it’s laced with soft, almost sweet undertones that make it feel powdery, woodsy, airy, and bright. It opens with tangerine and bergamot, layered over iris (powdery and floral) and neroli (for a burst of fresh citrus) before settling into a warm base of musk and cedar. A fig note threads through it all, adding a subtly sweet, creamy edge. It’s citrusy and floral but also musky, spicy, and quietly complex—an easygoing cologne you can wear from sun-soaked afternoons in the park straight into date night. Imaginary Authors Imaginary Authors Key notes:Eucalyptus, Vetiver, Spruce Oil, Ambergris I’ve long been intrigued by indie fragrance house Imaginary Authors, with each scent reading like a novel or the lyrics to a bittersweet song. I’m usually drawn to straightforward aquatics as, too often, they veer into nauseatingly generic territory.Every Storm a Serenadeis refreshingly different: an aquatic with depth and none of the mass-produced blandness. Inspired by a forlorn lover writing a novel on the Danish coast, you can almost smell the nostalgia—the olfactory equivalent of a melancholic melody you can’t stop humming. Think waves crashing at night, grass swaying in the breeze, a forest looming in the distance, and a lighthouse casting a reflective glow. Green notes of vetiver and eucalyptus blend with crisp spruce and a salty-smooth base of ambergris and Baltic Sea mist. If, like me, you gravitate toward aquatics that feel personal, a little wistful, and quietly intoxicating, this one’s worth getting lost in. Les Eaux Primordiales Nordstrom Key notes:Berries, Thyme, Plum, Rose, Saffron, Sandalwood, Vanilla I’d heard so much hype about Les Eaux Primordiales that I was excited to finally try a few of their fragrances—and they didn’t disappoint. Beloved by fragrance insiders, this French house is luxe and artisanal with an elevated apothecary vibe that makes perfect sense once you realize everything—from design to bottling—is done in-house at their La Manufacture. Cèdre Superfluide was the immediate standout and is a must-try if you want to sneak a bit of fall and winter’s woodsy depth into your summer rotation. Red berries and thyme mingle with plum, all grounded by a base of sandalwood, saffron, and vanilla. It’s warm and spicy, yet sweet, with a prominently featured rose that pulls everything together into a rich, elegant composition. Cèdre Superfluide is juxtaposition at its finest and the cologne to reach for on a summer night when you want to imbue a magnetic and mysterious aroma. Maison Francis Kurkdjian Bloomingdale's Key notes:Raspberry, Peach, Vanilla, Sandalwood Kurky is the latest from one of the greatest perfumers of all time, Francis Kurkdjian, and it feels like a passion project from the maestro of meticulous fragrance pyramids. Kurkdjian named it after his childhood nickname—a moniker that sounds a little quirky, much like the scent itself. It’s a joyful composition that channels a sense of nostalgia—albeit in a luxurious, aromatic way. And if you dig sweet, fruit-centric fragrances, this might be the most elevated take on the genre you’ll experience. Raspberry and peach sparkle alongside gummy-like notes before melting into a white musk and vanilla base. It’s playful, bold, and unabashedly sweet—an upscale candy-in-a-bottle aroma for summer days when the heat and humidity let this cologne sing. Boss Boss Key notes:Lemon, Bergamot, Geranium, Patchouli, Vetiver Sometimes, you want an easygoing and effortless summer cologne—bright, subtle, and darn good-smelling—and Boss Green by Hugo Boss understood the assignment. It opens with a citrus duo of lemon and bergamot, then softens into a minty, slightly spicy heart of geranium. The base keeps it from feeling too simple: a grounding blend of patchouli and vetiver that adds smoky, earthy depth. The brightness mellows and mingles with the woodsy and floral notes during the dry down, making for a clean, green, and vibrant scent. Low-fuss and very approachable, it’s a cologne that wears well for workday commuting and weekend strolling alike. Aedes Aedes Key notes:Bergamot, Peruvian pink pepper, Fig, Suede musk, Guaiac wood, Amber Aedes De Venustas has long been a trailblazer in the world of niche fragrance, earning a loyal following among discerning scent obsessives. Beyond their expertly curated boutique, the brand also boasts an award-winning in-house fragrance line—and their latest release, Sueño Latino, is a brand new lush, sultry summer stunner. My first reaction? This is sexy. It's not your typical beach-day scent, but more of a sun-drenched tropical fever dream. Resinous woods swirl with bergamot, ripe mango, and fig, but the soft suede accord adds a smoldering velvety edge. Slightly spicy, slightly sweet, woodsy, and resinous—I couldn't stop smelling my arm after testing it. Wear it with achic linen suitand an elevated tee on humid summer nights. Parfums de Marly Parfums de Marly Key notes:Petitgrain Citronnier, Timut Pepper, Neroli, Akigalawood, Labdanum. When Parfums de Marly drops a new scent, the olfactory world pays attention. The Parisian house already boasts icons like Haltane, with its regal oud, and the citrus-woodsy brilliance of Perseus—and its latest release, Castley, maintains the momentum. Launched just a few weeks ago, this aromatic, citrusy, and spicy cologne exudes sophistication. It opens with a mix of ginger, black pepper, and bergamot and unfolds into layers of spice before settling over labdanum and woods, adding a patchouli-like earthiness. The citrus is apparent on the first spritz, but the dry-down softens into a spicy, warm blend of amber and ginger. Castley smells like a (modern) nod to classic cologne—fresh, spicy, and refined, whether wafting through humid days or cruising into breezy nights. Ranger Station Ranger Station Key notes:Citrus, Patchouli, Musk, Cedarwood When I met the founders of Ranger Station at their NYC store opening recently, it was clear how passionate they are about fragrance—and how refreshingly unpretentious they are about it. The success speaks for itself: What started as a niche Nashville fragrance house has grown into a buzzy and accessible (read: easy on the wallet) brand for guys who don’t want to overthink smelling great. I’m a patchouli fanatic, and while it may carry outdated hippy connotations, the fragrance community knows better—it’s earthy, aromatic, and downright intoxicating when blended well. High Horse opens with bright citrus that mixes beautifully with the patchouli for a fresh-meets-earthy, indie vibe. Cedarwood and musk round it out into a smooth, effortlessly wearable cologne. Rock it as your daily driver all summer—no spurs required. Fischersund Fischersund Key notes:Black Currant, Cumin, Lily, Musk, Vanilla I discovered Fischerund on a trip to Iceland, and it instantly struck a chord. The house has an atmospheric, indie spirit—slightly edgy and unconventional, yet approachable. That tracks, considering one of the brand's founders is from Sigur Rós, and music runs in the brand's DNA. I adore No. 101, a cologne inspired by the wild backyards of Reykjavík during its short, luminous summers. This verdant, herbaceous scent paints the picture with notes of black currants, cumin, lily, limbwood, musk, and vanilla. It's green, dewy, and sweet, grounded by heady woods and delicate florals. No. 101 is for niche fragrance fans, with each note unfolding like a summertime sensory journey through Iceland's unruly, beautiful wilderness. Bonus points for the presentation: It comes wrapped in a graphic bandana—a fitting touch for a unique aromatic gem.",

    "title": "The Best Signature Sneakers of the 2025 NBA Playoffs (So Far)",
    "article_text": "The NBA playoffs have not gone according to plan. After racking up the best record in the East, the Cleveland Cavaliers got walloped by the Indiana Pacers in the second round. The defending championBoston Celtics, meanwhile, crashed out against theNew York Knicks. LeBron James,Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Ja Morant, and many others all went home earlier than expected, too. One element of the postseason thathasn’tbeen all that surprising, though? There’s been no shortage of sneaker heat on the hardwood, from brand-new signature models to wild new spins on classic silhouettes. And with the Oklahoma City Thunder now taking on the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals, we’re about to witness two of the league’s brightest stars—Anthony Edwards and Shai Gilgeous Alexander—face off in two of the sport’s sickest shoes: Ant’s belovedAdidas AE1and Shai’s much-hyped ConverseShai 001. That’s just the kind of high-stakes footwear drama we’ve come to expect from the NBA. Here are the best sneakers of the 2025 NBA playoffs—so far. MVP frontrunner Shai Gilgeous-Alexander premiered his debut Converse signatures at All-Star Weekend in February—a sci-fi silhouette in a butter yellow colorway that looked particularly great off the court with baggy denim. During the playoffs, however, Gilgeous-Alexander’s favored the Shai 001 in mean black and gray makeups that have felt more in line with his serious, locked-in performances against the Grizzlies and Nuggets. Adidas recently teasedthe highly anticipated AE2, the sequel to one of the best signature basketball sneakers in recent memory. But for the time being, Ant-man is still finding new ways to impress with the original. This playoff run, it’s been the AE1 Low in the eye-catching ‘Metallic Grey’ colorway, which takes the streamlined low-top silhouette and makes it look as if it’s been dipped in mercury, shining every time it catches the light. The 22nd edition of LeBron’s Nike signature line is one of his best silhouettes ever, beefing up the technical specs and adding an exaggerated wraparound Swoosh for dramatic effect. For the playoffs, Bron brought back a colorway first seen last summer during the Paris Olympics: the ‘Gold Medal’ 22s, wrapped in a shimmering metallic leather that produces a vivid array of blues, pinks, and yellows. This cherry blossom-inspired version of the Curry 12 wasn’t actually designed for its namesake player; instead, it debuted last summer as a player exclusive for Japanese point guard Kesei Tominaga, a Curry Brand signee who plays for the G League’s Noblesville Boom. The vibrant pink kicks looked plenty righteous on Steph himself, though—a highlight from the two-time MVP’s unexpectedly short and injury-ridden playoff run. Indiana has been having an incredible run in these playoffs, beating every comer and defying every expectation, thanks in no small part to the heroic efforts ofTyrese Haliburton. Fittingly, Hali’s been seen wearing this player exclusive version of the Puma All-Pro Nitro, dubbed the “Pinstripes,” which pays homage to the classic 1990s Pacers uniforms—exactly the era of Pacers basketball that Hali’s been channeling with his recent postseason triumphs. Though Luka Doncic’s first playoff series as a Laker didn’t go quite the way he’d hoped, he did take the floor against the Timberwolves in one of the best iterations of his Jordan Brand signature sneaker yet: the Luka 4 “Quai 54,” a yellow-and-black colorway named for the famed Jordan-sponsored streetball tournament held in Paris every July. Like severalfamous Kobe models before it, the shoe borrows stylistic cues fromBruce Lee’s iconic yellow jumpsuit fromGame of Death. Ja Morant’s first two Nike signature models were both fine enough, but the third iteration has really taken a leap forward in terms of style and storytelling. The new ‘Max Volume’ colorway, which Morant debuted during the Grizzlies’s first-round matchup against the Thunder, shows off the silhouette at its boldest and most unique, with furious streaks of pink and fuchsia running across the full length of the shoe. Despite their outsized fan base, the Knicks are sorely underrepresented on the signature sneaker market. (Karl-Anthony Towns wears the Nike GT Jump and Mikal Bridges wears the PG 6, in case you were wondering.) Jalen Brunson can reliably be found wearing Kobe 5s, but this playoff run, he’s been rocking a brand new P.E. version that comes color-blocked in a wild array of hues. Dubbed the ‘WTR,’ the shoe is an homage to Brunson’s father, Rick Brunson, and hopefully represents the first step toward Brunson receiving his own signature line at some point in the future.",

    "title": "Six Exercises to Pump Up Your Legs for Shorts Season",
    "article_text": "Shorts season is upon us, which means you’re running out of time to make it look like you’ve been paying as much attention to your legs as you have yourbiceps. Lucky for you, it’s not too late. \"There's more muscle tissue in the legs than there is in the upper body, so we can generally expect faster results with the legs than with the upper body,” says Luke Carlson, founder and CEO ofDiscover Strength. Just one thing. While kickstarting your leg development can be relatively straightforward, it shouldn’t be too easy. “The legs are not going to develop unless you put a lot of effort and intensity into it,” says Eddie Baruta, global head of gym floor personal training atUltimate Performancein Los Angeles. “The good news is, most guys haven't trained their legs very intensely, so there's a wonderful opportunity to really, really add some muscle to the legs,\" says Carlson. “The delta between where you currently are and your potential is huge.\" Here, Carlson and Baruta break down their favorite leg exercises topack on musclein a hurry. Make the leg press your first stop, says Carlson. The exercise targets the quads and hamstrings—two of the biggest muscles in your legs—as well as the glutes. There are two reasons why Carlson recommends the leg press over the barbell squat, despite the two movements hitting similar muscles. First, the leg press removes your lower back from the equation, allowing you to zero in on your legs. “When you barbell squat, your lower back is always going to be weaker than your powerful quads and glutes,” he says. “So, when you reach fatigue, you're really fatiguing because your lower back is the weak link.” The leg press also sidesteps spinal compression, a necessary evil inherent to traditional squat variations. “If you put a barbell on your back, you are vertically compressing the spinal column. It's not a matter of having good form, it's just what it is; it's the nature of the exercise, and that can be dangerous long term,” he says. “The beauty of the leg press is that we don't have to vertically compress the spine.” How to do it: Trainer tip: If your gym doesn’t have a leg press, see if there’s a hack squat machine. Like the leg press, the hack squat supports your lower back, allowing you to place all of your focus on your legs. “A hack squat is going to have a little bit more compression on the spine, but I think it's a decent substitution,” says Carlson. If your gym doesn’t have a leg press or a hack squat, don’t worry. The humble walking lunge is one of the best exercises you can do to make your legs pop in shorts, says Carlson. “When we're looking at the recruitment of motor units and muscle fibers, the lunge is a great way to recruit the quads, the hamstrings, and the glutes,” he says. “You might not have a leg press in your gym, but everybody can do a lunge.” In fact, even if you do have access to a leg press, Carlson recommends doing lunges anyway, alternating between the two exercises weekly. In addition to helping you bulk up your legs, walking lunges are also great for buildingfunctional fitness, evening out imbalances in your legs, and shoring up your lower-body strength and stability. How to do it: Trainer tip: Carlson recommends making sure you have around 10–30 yards of distance to work with. If limited space makes that a challenge, or impossible, you can adjust your weights to compensate. “There’s nothing wrong with using lighter weights and covering a longer distance, or using much heavier weights and covering a shorter distance,” he says. Now we’ll move on to some isolation work to really sharpen things up, starting with the exercise most likely to help you turn heads this summer. “I would say the leg extension is the most underrated exercise for the lower body,” says Carlson. “We're working the entire quad, but what we're also hitting that we don't hit with a leg press or a squat is the vastus medialis oblique.” Also known as the VMO, that’s the coveted teardrop-shaped muscle that sits on your lower inner thigh, just above the knee. In terms of enviable muscle definition, well-developed VMOs are right up there with chiseled six-pack abs, and they’re the leg muscles most likely to jump out in your photos this summer. “It’s going to beveryvisible in shorts,” says Carlson. How to do it: Trainer tip: “As you move toward extension, you want to have your toes pointing away from you,” says Carlson. “The hamstring is a biarticular muscle, meaning it crosses the knee joint, but it also crosses the hip joint. So if you have your toes pulled back, you're putting a stretch on the hamstring, which prevents the quadriceps from fully contracting. It doesn't change what the quadriceps is doing, but the hamstring just says, ‘We can't be lengthened in two positions.’ So you have to point the toes forward so you can essentially, for lack of a better term, relax the hamstring so the quadriceps can do what it really needs to do.” The leg curl is a very similar setup to the leg extension, except now you’re curling your legs beneath you instead of extending them out ahead. (Some machines will even allow you to do both.) As a result of this flip, you’re now activating the muscles on the back of the leg. In a way, the leg curl is like a biceps curl for your hamstrings—and you wouldn’t skip curls right before summer, would you? The hamstrings, of course, are one of the largest and most consequential muscle groups in your lower body, and, beyond offering huge potential for muscle growth and strength gains, they can also play an enormous role in athletic performance, balance, and injury prevention. “The leg curl is just a can’t-miss exercise,” says Carlson. “It's a critical, critical exercise for developing and isolating the hamstrings.” How to do it: Trainer tip: If you don’t have access to a leg curl machine, opt for a stiff-leg deadlift instead. “A stiff-leg deadlift works really well for the hamstrings, and you can do it with dumbbells, a straight bar, a trap bar—whatever's available,” says Baruta. Just make sure you’re sending your hips backwards on the way down, and then focusing on contracting your hamstrings to drive your hips forward when you’re coming back up, he says. And keep the weight as close to your shins as possible throughout. Moving below the knee, Carlson and Baruta both agree that cultivating impressive calves is all about a one-two combo of the straight-leg and seated calf raise. The former targets the medial and lateral heads of the prominent gastrocnemius muscle. “It’s the huge calf muscle that we think about. It's what's most visible,” says Carlson. You can do this one on a standing or other straight-leg calf raise machine—probably the simplest option—but you can also do it just standing on a step (on either one leg or two) while holding a dumbbell or wearing a weighted vest. You can even do a straight-leg calf raise on a leg press machine, says Carlson. “The key is that you're doing astraight-legcalf exercise. And when I say ‘straight leg,’ there should actually be a tiny bend in your knee.\" How to do it: Trainer tip: If you’re using a dumbbell to do your straight-leg calf raises, Baruta has a handy tip to help you squeeze out a few more reps. “As you move to the top position [of the rep] where you're weaker, you can actually move the dumbbell forward, which changes the resistance and makes it slightly easier,” he says. “It’s like putting more weight at the bottom, less weight at the top.” The straight-leg and seated calf raise machines might seem to do the same thing, but these exercises target entirely different muscles almost exclusively. The seated calf raise is designed to engage the soleus—the deeper of the two calf muscles, located right behind the gastrocnemius. “The soleus is still visible when you're wearing a pair of shorts, so it's worth it to develop both muscles,” says Carlson. “By doing both of these, we're maximizing the aesthetic appearance of the calf.” The soleus only activates with a bent knee, hence the need for a separate piece of equipment. “You can't hit the soleus if your legs are straight,” says Carlson How to do it: Trainer tip: For the seated calf raise—and most of the exercises on this list—Baruta and Carlson prefer machines over free weights, which allow you to “focus more on the effort,” per Baruta. While you could do seated calf raises with a pair of dumbbells, a step, and a bench, the machine version is going to give you greater stability and less to worry about in terms of technique.",

    "title": "14 Best Men's Linen Shirts 2025, Tested and Reviewed by GQ",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The best men's linen shirts are a refreshing summer treat, like an Aperol Spritz you can store in your closet. Here atGQ, we’ve long maintained that linen shirts aren’texclusivelyseasonal—their texture-heavy vibe and breezy feel come in handy year-round in our age of terrifying, topsy-turvy weather turbulence—but when the mercury soars and layering opportunities are negligible, they’re no longer nice-to-haves: they’re essentials. It’s not just linen’s physical properties that excel in the summer, either. The fabric’s preternaturally relaxed appearance—those telltale wrinkles very much included—compliments the season’s laid-back energy like a fresh orange wedge in your wine glass. Nowadays, brands are rolling out entire collections focused on linen (why stop at shirts when there are alsolinen pantsandlinen suits?) and hardly a day goes by that wedon’tspot a nubby linen shirt we’d do unspeakable things to get our hands on. So to help you flex your flax this season, we aggregated the very best of them below, each vetted, tested, and (barely) sweated in by us. Banana Republic Banana Republic Shot in the GQ Studios Materials:100% European linen |Sizes:XS - XXL |Fit:Standard; tall sizes available What we want out of a linen shirt isn’t crazy, yet it feels so difficult to find. We want a shirt that fits well, roomy enough to let a breeze blow through (not to mention a sultry billow), made in a quality linen. Banana Republic checks all the boxes and for a price we can really get behind. The fit is a classic, slightly roomy fit that looks great untucked. It’s got a great collar that’s not dinky like so many other shirts and the buttons feel and look premium. Despite all the positives, we do have one gripe and that’s that Banana’s shirt doesn’t come in multiple silhouettes. Uniqlo Uniqlo Shot in the GQ Studios Materials:100% linen |Sizes:XS - XXXL |Fit:Classic, slightly tailored If you’re on a budget, you’d do well to roll up to Uniqlo, the Japanese megabrand that’s made its bag on affordable and timeless basics. Its linen shirts are not an exception. They’re made of European linen, feature a nice spread collar, and are cut with a slightly tailored but classic silhouette. The length is great for tucking into some dress pants for the office or a wedding, but short enough to leave untucked without looking sloppy. Though Uniqlo’s linen does have a nice luster, it doesn’t feel nearly as nice as the other shirts we tested. But for less than fifty bucks, who’s complaining? J.Crew J.Crew Shot in the GQ Studios Materials:100% Irish linen |Sizes:XS - XXL |Fit:Classic; available in slim, slim untucked, relaxed, and tall sizes The best linen shirts should be as easy to wear as an oxford—and about twice as comfortable when the temps turn sinister. This one from J.Crew doesn’t just check every box, it adds a few more to the list. For starters, it’s made with an Irish linen fabric—said to be the finest linen in the world—sourced from the Baird McNutt mill, one the finest linen mills in Ireland. Easy math there. It also has a Goldilocks fit—not too boxy, not too slim—that’s amenable to any breeze, big or small. It looks great rumpled or crisp, can deftly slide in under a suit and also plays well with some jeans or shorts. Oh, and it’s under $100. I probably should've led with that. “J.Crew’s linen shirts return every spring and summer for a reason,” saysGQstyle commerce writer Gerald Ortiz. “The fabric is top-notch, they come in a variety of silhouettes that fit just about everyone, and they're available in a gang of great colors and patterns.” Ortiz says that the linen fabric feels especially cool to the touch and silky smooth. “For the price, quality, and variety, why would you go anywhere else?” Drake's Drake's Shot in the GQ Studios Materials:100% linen |Sizes:XS - XXL |Fit:Tailored Drake’s remains a stalwart in the sartorial field. We love the British label’s sharp suits, shaggy sweaters, and meticulously crafted button-ups. Naturally, its linen shirts are top tier, as well. Unlike many cheaper linens, they’re made with a thicker, more substantial linen that achieves that elusive rumple—not wrinkle—that’s indicative of a higher-quality linen. With an impeccably clean, yet still airy, fit, mother of pearl buttons, and flawless single-needle construction, the quality is, unsurprisingly, very impressive. What sets the Drake’s shirt apart is something you won’t even see and that’s with the collar. It’s constructed with a floating interlining which give the collar structure and prevents it from going unattractively limp. Because, while the charm of a linen shirt is its wrinkles, nobody likes a wimpy, shriveled up collar. Bather Bather Shot in the GQ Studios Materials:100% cotton | |Sizes:XS - XXL |Fit:Boxy Sometimes, a style of shirt works well in linen. And sometimes, it absolutelythrivesin linen.Camp shirts are the latter—and Bather's riff is one of our favorites, period. It starts with an assertive, unambiguous camp collar before moving into three (3!) pockets at the front—including two at the hem that offer more utility than you might imagine—and ends with an easy-going flat hem that works well buttoned or open. The linen fabric is robust, which lends it just a bit of structure, but because it’s linen, it stays airy regardless of the thermometer reading. Just because it’scalledthe Traveler shirt doesn’t mean you won’t love it at home. This isn't the first time we've waxed eloquent on Bather's signature button-up: way back in 2022,GQcontributor Eugene Lardy pennedthe definitive odeto the style, which ended his quest to find the platonic summer shirt. Lardy praised the shirt for how cool it looked, sure, but also how cool hefeltwearing it, “like a welcome midday breeze” was gently buffeting his torso. “What I initially thought was going to be a fairly straightforward camp shirt,” Lardy wrote, “ended up revolutionizing my summer fits. I can’t take it off. Its breathable construction makes it ideal forwarm weather layering, and those nifty trio of pockets offer a level of functionality I never knew I was missing.” Alex Crane Alex Crane Shot in the GQ Studios Materials:100% French Linen |Sizes:XS - XXXL |Fit:Relaxed We're not going pretend like there’s anything wrong with wearing a plain-Jane cotton T-shirt in the summer—the more threadbare the better. Compared to linen, though, cotton isn’t actually all that breathable, and it dries like paint. Which is precisely where Alex Crane's perfectly nubby pure linen joint comes in. It’s made with 100% sustainably-grown linen, which adapts to rising temperatures faster than you ever will, and washed with biodegradable softeners to help it feel like a beat-up tee you already know and love. Just, y'know, better. “To keep it a buck, I never though I'd recommend a linentee,” Grossman confesses. “But enough of my buddies keep asking about ‘em, so I did my due diligence.” T-shirts arenotoriously difficult to perfect, but Alex Crane nails the details; Grossman has yet to hear from a friend who regrets the purchase. “Nine months of the year, I prefer a slimmer cut and a tighter neckline,” he says, “but this is exactly how a tee should fit when you're sweating through your fifth park hang in as many weeks.” Alex Mill Alex Mill Buck Mason Buck Mason Madewell Madewell Brioni Mr Porter Portugese Flannel Mr Porter Evan Kinori Evan Kinori Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Kartik Research Mr Porter We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.) Why is linen better for hotter weather? Both the weave and the physical properties of the fibers: when individual linen fibers get hot, they expand and allow more airflow. They also have a slightly rougher texture and a dryer hand, which keeps it from clinging to sweaty skin like cotton does—a combination also makes for a fabric that dries much faster. And if that’s not enough, know that humans have been relying on linen to beat the heat for thousands of years, and haven’t found many replacements. Is linen a year-round fabric? Absolutely. Long-sleeve linen shirts will keep you sufficiently warm through light jacket weather so long as it's not too blustery. And just as a linen shirt will get more airy the warmer it gets, it also contracts in the cold, which means that the same properties that keep you cool in the summer will also help you when it cools down. From a dress code perspective, linen shirts are on the more casual end of the business casual spectrum unless they're teamed up with a suit or blazer, or you're living in a humidity hotspot like Miami or New Orleans. Linen-blend shirts, which weave in cotton, trade a little breathability for added crispness and breeze-blocking. Though in chillier weather, the best linen shirts can turn into underrated layering heroes, too, under a thick sweater or cardigan. If you run hot even in colder months, swapping a linen shirt for a denser, less-breathable cotton shirt might make life more bearable. Does linen shrink? The short answer: yes, at least a little bit. Or it will, if you treat it like a t-shirt. But that being said, if you wash it on cold and line-dry your shirts, they should maintain their original dimensions for as long as you do (and remember, it does air-dry more quickly than most clothing will). If you accidentally put it in the dryer, linen tends to shrink slightly both horizontally and vertically, depending on weave, but a bit less than cotton will, due to fibers with less natural elasticity. Can you iron linen? Again, the short answer is yes. BUT, be super careful if you feel like rejecting the natural wrinkles—again, we do recommend leaning into those. Anyways, if you’re ironing a linen shirt, make sure it’s damp, for starters. Linen is very sturdy and the moisture will soften the fibers a bit. Also make sure you have a pressing cloth between the iron and the fabric, and a solid ironing board underneath. But, one more time, rumpled linen looks good. More From GQ Connect ©2025Condé Nast.

    "title": "Some Friendly Advice for Knicks Fans Entering the Eastern Conference Finals",
    "article_text": "As asports fan, the only thing scarier than realizing your team is going to suck for the foreseeable future is realizing that they actually have a chance towin the whole thing. The stakes get raised to queasy heights, literally every single game matters, and as the playoff field dwindles down, the walls can feel like they’re collapsing around your beloved team. This is reality for the New York Knicks and theirloony tunespassionate fanbasenow. For anyone 25 and under, these are uncharted waters, as the Knicks have not ventured this deep into the NBA postseason since 2000. Their opponent in those Eastern Conference Finals 25 years ago? None other than the Indiana Pacers, their dance partner for a whoppingeightplayoff series since 1993. Whether you’re old enough to have burned a Reggie Miler effigy, or young enough thatTyrese Haliburtonis the only Pacers villain you’ve ever known, these next few weeks are going to be a powder keg of emotion. The spirit of the '90s is alive in New York and Indiana. To help guide New Yorkers through the tumult, we’re offering up seven pieces of advice, one for every potential game of this evenly-matched series. This isn’t quite an apocalypse situation, one where you’ll have to stock a bunker full of chopped cheeses to survive—though that may happen if the Knicks can find eight more wins and bring home theLarry O’Brien trophy—but everyone from Williamsburg to Westchester should be prepared nonetheless. This is the city thatkilled King Kong, after all. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. This isn’t advice, per se, just a helpful fact to file away. During these playoffs, Knick games have started at 1:00, 3:30, 6:00, 7:00, 7:30, and 8:00. Frankly, it’s been hard to keep track of. Thankfully, theNBAhas made it simple for the Eastern Conference Finals. Every game is scheduled for 8 p.m. Don’t be confused by Indiana’s Midwestern geography. They’re in the eastern time zone, too. Get everything done by 7:45 or so, settle in, and clear the rest of the night to watch the best Knicks team in a generation. Whether you’re a drinker or not, it’s always good to hydrate! If you are the type to watch sports with an alcoholic beverage by your side, though, something tells us that’s going to ramp up for a Knicks-Pacers bloodbath. Something about seeing those two uniforms share a court brings out a real intensity, both for the players and the spectators. You’ll thank yourself in the morning if you mix in a water or two during the games, and it might not be a bad idea to see what kind of Gatoradeyour bodegahas in stock. Plus, win or lose, nothing’s worse than being hungover at work the next day. Speaking of the morning after, that’s often the hyperbole zone. Let’s say the Knicks wipe the floor with the Pacers in Game 1. Does that mean they’re going to coast the rest of the way? Certainly not. These things are best-of-seven for a reason, and no matter how overlooked they puzzlingly remain, the Pacers are quite good. Yes, theCleveland Cavaliers, the Pacers’ opponent in the last round, were not totally healthy for the first two games of their showdown. But even in the games where the Cavs had their full roster, they still offered very little resistance. And Cleveland was the number one seed! They won 64 games! Blowouts are always fun, and down-to-the-wire wins probably say more about a team’s overall mettle, but flush each win and move on to the next game. On the reverse, if the Knicks come out flat and get worked at home—think Game 3 of the Celtics series—they’ve shown an ability to recover. In fact, the Knickerbockers have lost three of their six games atMadison Square Gardenduring this playoff run, which isn’t ideal, but they’re still here! If they go down 2-0, it’s reasonable to react, but avoid a full-blown panic spree. Run it back. In my opinion, there is no bigger loser sports fan behavior than blaming the officials. Your guys didn’t lose because of the referee, they lost because they didn’t play well enough. While it’s true that, at one point, the NBA did employ acrooked refereewho was betting on games and went to federal prison for it, that guy can’t hurt you anymore. He did his time, he’s banned from the NBA, it’s fine. Look, Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns aren’t going to get every call, no matter how hard they jerk their head back while driving to the rim. That doesn’t mean anything is rigged. If anything, wouldn’t the leaguewantthe Knicks to win, so the NBA Finals could happen in New York rather thanIndiana? (Sorry, Indiana.) So rather than throwing something at the TV when Haliburton gets a whistle that was silent on the other end, remember that refereeing is basically an impossible job, and the Knicks are guaranteed to get some questionable calls of their own. That’s just how basketball works. You can basically hear them now. Any game in which the Knicks fail to crack 100 points will trigger theBrunson can’t be the whole offense by himselfchatter. A stinker byKATand we’ll have to endure the discussion about how he can’t handle big moments. As the Pacers utilize more of their bench than the Knicks—which they should, and will, because they have a better bench than the Knicks—batten down the hatch for all the takes about Tom Thibodeau grinding his players to dust. Role players aren’t immune to discourse, either. Should Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby, or Deuce McBride have an 0-for shooting night, people will be big mad. Listen to me closely: that does not mean you have to watch the ESPN morning shows or listen to the inflammatory podcasts! Form your own opinions, practice patience and restraint, and maybe go for a walk while listening to your favorite springtime album. Feeding the take inferno, debating whether Haliburton is a top-ten player, or giving into whatever other topic is leading the A-segment ofSports Shoutingwill not enrich your life. In other words, keep that copium on deck. The East is already wide open, as evidenced by the three and four seeds meeting in the Conference Finals, but think about what it’ll look like next year. Jayson Tatum might miss the whole season with his Achilles injury. There’s no guarantee Giannis Antetokounmpo will still be in the conference. Free agency could put a dent in the Cavs’ depth chart. Barring any major injuries of their own, theKnickswill begin the 2025-2026 campaign with undoubtedly better championship odds than they had at the start of this season. Of course, that doesn’t mean they should just fold up the tent and focus on the future. But we’re here to offer advice, and if the Pacers do knock them out for the second straight year, it’s not like the Knicks’ window is closed. And Haliburton’s dad is not afraid to run up on you.

    "title": "Joey Bada$$ Can't Stop Battling West Coast Rappers—And Winning",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the weekly newsletter Tap In, GQ senior associate editor Frazier Tharpe’s final word on the most heated online discourse about music, movies, and TV.Sign up here to get it free. There’s a war going on outside no B-list (or lower) rapper is safe from. Almost a year to the day from the May weekend that sawKendrick Lamar and Drakesend approximately five songs at each other, resulting in one ofthe most commercially successful diss tracksin history and one of its most decisive losses (sorry, owl-in-bio readers), we are once again witnessing a spring surge of rappers from opposing coasts having words with each other. Is it in any way close to the mass cultural event that Kenny versus Drizzy was? Obviously not—the sad truth is we may never see a conflict of that magnitude again. But what initially felt like a somewhat forced attempt to stir up contact-sport raps for the love of the game has morphed into something mildly entertaining, even if the stakes are lower and the lights aren’t as bright. But isn’t the love of the game enough? A brief recap, for the uninitiated: Brooklyn rapper Joey Bada$$ set the tone for his 2025 with a New Year’s Day music video announcing“The Ruler’s Back”; despite being a Blog Era darling for some time, Joey’s recent pop-cultural output has been on the small screen, as he built off of his solid recurring guest spot onMr. Robotwith lead roles in Hulu’sWu-Tang: An American Sagaand the hitPowerspin-offRaising Kanan. “The Ruler’s Back” is a laid-back statement track, emphasizing his renewed focus on music and underscoring his seriousness with a couple of loaded lines about “too much West Coast dick lickin’.” ThatJay-Z quoteand some other choice lines implied Joey was calling Kendrick to the podium, throwing stones at the highest rapper on the mountain for attention and definitively punching well above his weight class in the process. But in the months that followed, a funny thing happened. Kendrick is probably never going to respond to Joey, nor does he need to—he gains nothing from defeating Joey Bada$$, and Joey’s initial lines were more in the spirit of a“Control”-esque, I’m-on-your-head-to-be-the-best than real disrespect. But in that same spirit of sport, a bevy of LA rappers loosely associated with him did respond—most notably TDE signee Ray Vaughn, Reason,GNXscene-stealer AZ Chike, and the battle rapper Daylyt—and so far Joey has more than handled his own. In fact, in my humble opinion Joey’s actually up, firing off increasingly direct tracks over very solid beat selection at an increasingly breakneck pace. Daylyt’s songs are loose, overlong and rambling (and at press time, his most recent release seems to be raising the white flag, via a tribute to Joey’s late ProEra comrade Capital Steez) while Ray Vaughn’s try-hard energy quickly gave way to an onslaught of random, sophomoric bars about Diddy parties, freakoffs, and calling out Joey’s partner. Reason’sthree-in-one attackwas solid, and I will never say no tonew AZ Chike, who currently boasts one of the most mesmerizing flows in the game. But no one’s packing more punch or showing up to the moment like Joey—he’s got the sharpest bars and the sharpest strategy, up to and including his latest release “Crash Dummy,” which actually sees him hitting an LA flow over a West Coast beat, yielding the most replayable song of the whole back-and-forth so far. It’s been something of a recurring joke that Joey’s getting jumped by all of California while no other notable New York rapper has stepped in to rep East Coast pride, a narrative that’s been ongoing since “Ruler’s Back.” But at this stage, it’s only made the effort look more impressive, and more respectable, to be honest—as some on Twitter have put it, more of an actual 20-v-1 than what a certain woe-is-me Toronto rapper faced last year. In handling all comers with aplomb—tagging in Battle Rapper Rushmore candidate Loaded Lux on“Finals”was more of a cherry-on-top flex than a desperate assist—Joey’s actually living up to the stripes he boasted about on “The Ruler’s Back.” Was Joey looking for attention, and perhaps some promo, in calling Kendrick out? Sure, but he’s not shying away from the rappers stepping up in Kendrick’s stead either. And in the process, he Ray, Reason, Daylyt and the rest are restoring a competitive feeling harkening back to the energy of say Joe Budden versus Ransom (or Joe Budden versus Saigon, or Joe Budden versus…). Quiet as kept, Joey’s proving his point and living up to the effort, and who knows? Maybe he'll earn himself half a bar on the next verse Kendrick writes in the same vein that Jay-Z gave an ascendant 50 Cent back in '99. How’s that one line in “Control” go? “This is hip-hop, and them n-ggas should know what time it is.”",

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If it seems like a whole lot of folks are talking about FrizmWorks right now, you’re hanging out with our kind of people. For 15 years, the buzzy South Korean label has been laser-focused on crafting the type of meticulously-detailed,vintage-inspired menswearthat usually hurts your wallet through sheer proximity. (For anyone wondering,Frizmis a portmanteau of “freeze” and “prism,” which also happens to be ridiculously fun to say out loud.) Here’s the thing, though: despite its insider-darling status, the brand’s cropped wading jackets, breezy poplin shirts, and relaxed fatigue pants rarely cross the $500 threshold, which makes it a genuine anomaly among some of therecentnamesspotlightedhere. FrizmWorks Mr Porter FrizmWorks Mr Porter Here’s theotherthing: much like those names, FrizmWorks has never been especially easy to find, let alone actually buy, given its tendency to fly off the shelves. Funnily enough, those shelves are unusually well-stocked these days, thanks to a sudden influx of the brand’s product at the likes ofMr Porter,Huckberry, andBespoke Post, among others—which is great news for anyone into pitch-perfect vintage repros at prices far lower than they usually clock in at. Primary among that product range? Light jackets, because 1)‘tis the season, and 2) FrizmWorks makes some of the best on the market. The heritage hunting jacket, for instance, is the white tee force-multiplier of your mild-weather dreams, a cropped-length, corduroy-collared spin on a classic British MK3 rendered in a weather-dampening cotton-blend. FrizmWorks Mr Porter FrizmWorks Huckberry FrizmWorks Huckberry FrizmWorks Mr Porter Or take the buddy Harrington jacket, which clocks in at under $250 and also happens to be one of the most perfectly-proportionedG9 riffsI’ve ever seen. On that note, I’ll admit that when I first saw the Barstow jacket, I wasn’t all the way sold on the idea of a cowboy-coach mashup, but now the anachronism of that western yoke seems both inspired and integral to the genre at large. If the FrizmWorks team limited themselves to outerwear, they’d still warrant your praise. Thankfully, they don’t, and the preposterous value carries over between categories. The $155 jungle cloth fatigue pants are the kind of roomy, easygoing trousers you’ll start wearing on the daily as soon as they arrive—a process only expedited by a specialty bio-wash that lends them a lived-in feel out of the box. FrizmWorks Huckberry FrizmWORKS Huckberry And while button-ups aren’t exactly the brand’s bread-and-butter, I’d be remiss not to mention the OG dobby weave seersucker shirt, which is $125 but punches in the same weight class as shirts triple that, all while emitting the kind of rakish insouciance the bestsummer outfitsare built upon. None of this stuff is “cheap” in any sense of the word, of course, but when it comes to exceedingly good value propositions, it’s hard to beat a single one of ‘em. Sure, the brand's name might be a little funny, but we never kid when a deal’s on the line. FrizmWorks Mr Porter FrizmWorks Huckberry",

    "title": "Jon Hamm Gets Back in the Driver’s Seat",
    "article_text": "This story was featured in The Must Read, a newsletter in which our editors recommend one can’t-miss story every weekday.Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Jon Hammknows you’ve been looking for him. It’s a sunny spring morning and he’s seated outside for breakfast at his favorite Los Feliz restaurant—LA familiars, you know the one—where he’s seemingly on a first-name basis with every server and busboy who attends to us. Dad hat pulled low. Inconspicuous, but in plain sight. Talking, as it happens, about the notion that he’s been to the left of the spotlight for the last few years. Jacket by Saman Amel. Shirt by Sunspel. Jeans and tie by Drake's. Belt by Brunello Cucinelli. Rings (throughout), his own. “It’s funny, [people are] like,Where you been?” Hamm says with a chuckle. “I’ve been around. I’ve beenworking,man. You should see my calendar.” If the notion of Hamm’s disappearance was greatly exaggerated before, it’s been finally, fully, officially invalidated this spring. His face adorns at least two different billboards within a two-mile radius of where he’s currently sitting; you can’t miss him. Ten years after Don Draper meditated his way to corporate synergy, Hamm is once again number one on the call sheet, in Apple TV+’sYour Friends & Neighbors, playing a character with familiar demons, but in a drastically different context. For anyone tempted to call it a comeback—and a long-overdue one at that—the actor just has one question: Comeback from where? Landing a truly iconic role, especially on television, is a blessing that—between typecasting and overinflated expectations for future projects—can become a prison. Hamm saw this coming, and afterMad Menhe took the necessary steps to defuse it—and protect his sanity in the process. Now the fruits of those efforts on his career and his mental health are coming to bloom. Yes, Jon Hamm is “back.” But also, he never left. “I’m notan overthinker,” Hamm says with a shrug, slicing up Italian sausages and tossing some to his dog Murphy. “I generally, and genuinely, have the capacity to make a decision, feel good about the decision, and not stress. I feel comfortable when I finally come to the decision, I’m like, ‘All right, let’s do it. Let’s go.’ Full speed ahead, you know what I mean?” When we meet, the premiere ofYour Friends & Neighborsis still two weeks out. But in conversation Hamm is notably unbothered and unburdened about how his first serialized-TV lead sinceMad Menwill be received; he’s more stressed about hosting his first episode ofSNLin years. (“I checked in with Tina Fey, [Colin] Jost, [John] Mulaney, and a couple of the other guys, like, ‘Anybody have any ideas? What are we going to do here?’” he says, casually flexing the murderers’ row of funny people on his phone he can hit for an assist.) Either this new show will do well, and perhaps shape the next five or so years of his career. Or it won’t. He understands that the outcome is beyond his control; there’s peace in that. Watch by Cartier. Sunglasses by Oliver Peoples. “You mitigate all the risk you can by surrounding yourself with great people. And then, let them do their work. Get out of the way. I know I’m good. I know Amanda Peet’s really good. I know Olivia Munn’s really good,” he says of his costars. “Now, I’ve had this experience, I’m sure you have too: You sit there and you stare at the fucking screen, and you go,I can watch literally anything right now on demand whenever I want and I can’t come up with something I want to watch.It’s overwhelming, right? So that’s out of your control. Marketing, will people be able to find it? Do enough people have AppleTV+? Who knows.” As its first season draws to a close—a second season, announced before the first one even premiered, is in production now—it’s safe to sayYour Friends & Neighborshas piqued a healthy amount of cultural interest. The series finds Hamm in a gear audiences are used to seeing him in: a prestige-television drama, playing a middle-aged businessman seemingly at the height of his powers and the dead center of the American Dream who suddenly comes to realize his success is an illusion and his material wins are made of smoke. Sound familiar? The crucial twist, then, is that unlike some of Hamm’s past characters, often larger-than-life,YFAN’s Andrew Cooper is strikingly small, and drowning under a tidal wave of life changes cucking him from all sides. His wife (Peet) has taken up with one of his close friends and kicked him out of their eight-figure home, and he’s been unceremoniously fired from his high-end hedge-fund job, two circumstances that threaten to leave him cash poor, which is the very last thing you want to be in the fictional upstate New York one-percenter hamlet of Westport. Coop’s decision to start stealing from his materialistic neighbors, who are rich enough they barely notice their valuables’ absence, is less of a badass bucking of the system than a desperate attempt to reclaim some agency (and liquidity.) It’s the kind of series where Coop can believably face mortal harm from a shady black-market art dealer in one scene, then walk in on a seemingly loving wife and mother having sex with her daughter’s college-age boyfriend in another. There are dead bodies, and also full-on interludes glorifying the luxuriousness of an Audemars Piguet watch or a $750,000 Rolls. It would’ve been a smash six-season hit on Showtime in the previous decade: a prestige production, yes, but one that’s not above shamelessly indulging in broad melodrama and all the sex, violence, and black comedy that comes with that. On paper at least, it felt like a layup, a show custom-built to cut through the peak-TV streaming glut Hamm pointed out earlier. “It feels like we’re kind of having a moment in time where ‘rich people behaving badly’ is a bit of a genre,” Hamm says, when asked what attracted him to the series. “It’s a bedroom drama. It’s got funny elements to it. It’s dark, with a criminal element to it. It’s a little bit scary, a little bit sexy. But at the end of the day, it’s an hour-long drama about a guy whose life went sideways. Okay, that’sBreaking Bad.That’s kind of likeMad Men.You don’t have to reinvent the wheel.” Sweater and shirt by Merz b. Schwanen. Shorts by Brunello Cucinelli. Watch by Jaeger-LeCoultre. Sunglasses by Tom Ford. Socks, his own. It’s sound business reasoning. But what about the love of the game? Why, after a decade ofnotchasing another TV lead role, was now the right time to lock in again? Hamm’s career afterMad Menhas been a colorful one. He flexed his considerable comedy chops (proof that sometimes God does indeed give with both hands) in some exceedingly silly roles—as the goofy cult-leader antagonist onUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,as an assassin known as The Falcon inWet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp,and as “Jon Hamm,” asshole Method actor, onCurb Your Enthusiasm.He played heavies with varying charm-to-menace ratios in high-profile films likeBaby Driver,Bad Times at the El Royale,andNo Sudden Move.It was consistent, albeit a tad directionless. “I just wanted to work,” Hamm reflects. “I knew it would be unlikely to have another experience likeMad Men.Because it was culturally defining, it was a moment in time. Everything kind of lined up for that show to be what it was at the time it was. And I was okay with that. Some people don’t even get the one. So I got one. I got all the awards I needed. [After it ended] I was like, ‘I’m good.’ I just want to work with people I find compelling. And I hope that I get to do stuff that other people like. But the only real barometer is that I like it. People were like,You should do this. You should do that. Why don’t you do this one?Because it doesn’t do it for me. I’ll go do a dumb comedy, or I’ll do three episodes of this show, or that show, or whatever.” Still, the idea that a man of Hamm’s immense talent—who’d led what is arguably (read: unquestionably) the greatest show of all time—was seemingly so unconcerned about chasing another championship ring started to become a bit distracting. For example: As great a look as it was for Hamm to be inTop Gun: Maverick,the second-highest-grossing movie of 2022, was it also a waste, or at least a misuse, of the Hamm Effect to cast him as the joyless, authoritative boss? “Well, that was an interesting one, because there’s no mistaking who’s the star of that movie,” Hamm says with a laugh. “I saw the original film when I was 14 years old. So I would’ve fucking made coffee on that set. My agents were like, ‘I don’t know—it’s not a very big part. Do you really want to do this?’ And I go, ‘Dude, it’sTop Gun 2.Like, what?’ That movie meant a lot to me personally. I told them,If you guys fuck this deal, you’re all fired.” There were higher-profile roles that got away; one of the few that really stings isGone Girl,and that wasMad Men’s fault. Hamm confirms that David Fincher reached out to him to play the part that eventually went to Ben Affleck. “I had gone in and met with Fox,” Hamm says, “and they said ‘We really want you for this. But David won’t engage unless he knows that you’re available.’ And I said, ‘Okay, let me work on that.’ Called Lionsgate, said,Hey, can we move some things around? I have this opportunity.They’re like,Absolutely. It sounds amazing. Called AMC: Yeah, for sure.Then I called the guy that ran the show, Matthew [Weiner], and he said, ‘We can’t really shoot around you.’ I was like,Yeah, I know. I’m aware. But can we maybe.…And for whatever reason, they couldn’t make it work. So it was a missed opportunity. I was very happy for [Ben]. He was amazing in the film. But yeah, that was one of those things where I’m like, I wish that would’ve worked out.” Clothing and bow tie by Tom Ford. Shoes by Morjas. Watch by Piaget. Socks by Falke. A younger Hamm famously put himself on a do-or-die clock to make it or give up by 30; he was 35 when he shot theMad Menpilot. He didn’t set a similar goal afterMad Men.In true Jon Hamm fashion, he chose to just lean in to the narrative, eventually taking the piss out of the where-has-Jon-Hamm-been storyline in 2022, with a viral AppleTV+ ad that found him bored on his couch, looking at all the great TV shows existing without him. “But now I feel like I played the long game,” he says, “and I got to this place. It’s like, now, my phone doesn’t stop ringing. It’s good.” The winds started to change in the fall of 2023, which found Hamm dead center in the new seasons of two decidedly very mainstream series:The Morning Show,which paired him off in a steamy romantic subplot with Jennifer Aniston, andFargo,where he notably went full villain mode, showing off a new weapon in his arsenal. Both roles netted him his first Emmy nominations sinceMad Men,and, Hamm concedes, created the momentum to form the second wind narrative going intoYFAN. But Hamm also says this return to prominence had as much if not more to do with the energy he’s putting out in his personal life; interestingly, he framed the idea of leading another series as something he had to mentally be ready and willing to do again above all else. “I’m much better at taking care of myself,” Hamm says, admitting that this was not the case during the Draper years. (In 2015, Hamm completed in-patient rehab treatment for alcohol abuse.) “What happens is you get pulled in 52 different directions,” he says, “especially doing something likeMad Men,which was such a big moment culturally. ‘You gotta doJimmy Fallon.You got to do this one, you got to do that one.’ There was a three-week stretch where I shot Monday through Friday onMad Men.The weekend wasBridesmaids.Then Monday through Friday onMad Men.The next weekend was reshoots onThe TownandBridesmaids.And then the following week was Monday through Friday onMad Men.It was 22 days in a row, no day off, not a weekend off, nothing. And I remember going,I don’t know how I’m going to do this. And just remember saying to myself,Just concentrate on today. Look down, look up, okay, Monday’s over. Now that one’s done. Cross it off. Ten pages of dialogue in my head every day. Coming intoBridesmaids,where they’ve [already] been going for two months. Reshoots onThe Town,talking with Ben, going back in time to be like,Okay, what was I doing?” Just reflecting on that period seemed to give Hamm a shudder. “It’s like when you’re going through college, you’ve got all that work at the end of the semester. Then you get sick. Then you go home for Christmas and you want to sleep for two weeks.” Hamm says these days he prioritizes the mental reset more than he did before, looking to physical exercise between shooting days and getaways after he wraps. “Definitely, my wife and I now, whenever we finish a project, it’s like, let’s take the time. It doesn’t have to be lavish, or expensive, or three-weeks long. Let’s just go somewhere and chill and check in with each other, make sure that we’re still on the same page. That’s the kind of stuff that I’m talking about learning and doing better.” Hamm, who turned 53 this past March, sat back pensively when asked if and how crossing fully into midlife had recontextualized things for him. “Part of 50 is, it’s a good time to check in with [yourself]. I’m a big believer in therapy. I’m in therapy right after this, in fact,” he says. “But there is something about that, contextualizing your life, because if you’re doing it right, you should be in a pretty good place by 50. It’s supercomfortable, confident. That all comes out in my work too. I mean, I think that’s a big reason why I’m having this kind of moment now, too, is whatever I’m putting out is coming from a place of feeling very good about myself and feeling very good about what I do. Not trying to be thirsty, or like,I got to do this, then I can do this, and I can do that.” You see it a lot of [actors] being like,I need to get my version of whatever the fuck.No you don’t. Just do your thing. That’s how some people’s brains work. Mine doesn’t. I mean, I’ve been doing this job for a long time, and if I look back, I don’t have regrets.” Hamm met his wife, Anna Osceola, on the set ofMad Men—the set of the series finale, to be exact, which aired 10 years ago this month. (She’s the counselor at the New Age retreat who convinces Don to give therapy a try.) This June will make two years since their wedding. “It’s been great,” Hamm says of married life. “We were together for a few years before we got married, so we’re comfortable with each other. But getting married is a big step. It’s like anything else—if you’re in it to win it, if you want it, which I do, then that makes it easier.” The wedding took place at the same Big Sur location where they met on the series, the same resort where Don achieves his epiphany. It’s just one of many big life moments that make it so Hamm never resents having to talk aboutMad Men,even as time moves on and he promotes other projects. “I love that people still find it relevant in some way,” Hamm says. “I love that people are still entertained by it. It’s a time capsule for me, obviously. I look back and I’m like,I’m not that young anymore. Holy shit.But I do like talking about it, because I think one of the things that sets the show apart in many ways, is that it’s like a river, you can never enter the same river twice, because everything changes. And as you grow older and you watch the show, you get different things from it too.” Still, he’s not looking back on it wistfully. “I love thinking about that time of my life. I’m glad that it’s over. Very much glad that I’ve grown up, and aged. And I love being 50. I love everything aboutright now. But it’s nice to have that as a time capsule because, man, that was a fun decade. I worked my ass off. I’mproudof that work.” Shirt by Loro Piana. Boxers by Sunspel. Watch by Jaeger-LeCoultre. Pressed, in honor of the anniversary, about his specific memories around making the end of the show, Hamm recalls how strange and isolating it felt, because of Don’s narrative arc, to end it alone away from the cast he’d gone through this whole experience with. “A lot of that stuff from the last season I remember was very difficult to do, for many reasons. My character was going out on his kind of vision quest. And I realized, oh, shit, there’s probably going to be three or four episodes of the show that I’m not going to be working with the main cast of the show.” He recalls shooting a scene with John Slattery, as normal as any of the duets they’d filmed together for the last 10 years, only for Weiner to announce to the set, upon wrapping, that Jon Hamm and John Slattery had just filmed their last scene together. “I’m like,What?That was it?And we both got a little emotional. And it’s a great scene, but it’s not an iconic scene—it’s just it’s the last time.” As he reflects on the colossal legacy of past work, he’s facing the idea of trying to do it all again. But instead of feeling pressed to match the acclaim and success, he’s confident in his abilities, self-aware about his star power, and at peace with the things he can’t control. “It has been 10 years sinceMad Menwent off the air. And then you go,Shit,”he says. “First of all, it’s hard to get a TV show made. It really is. So many things have to come together at the right time. It’s even harder to make it a hit. It’s even harder to get the second season. It’s even harder to get the traction, and the nominations, and the awards, and all the things that come with it. So you’ve got to really love what you’re doing—I do. But also, I’ve certainly been around long enough that my presence is value added for a lot of that. Not just from the studio or the network or whatever, to make it, but to actually draw an audience. People are like,I like that dude.I look good on a billboard, man.” PRODUCTION CREDITS:Photographed byMorgan MaherStyled byKarolyn PhoGrooming byKim Verbeckat The Wall GroupTailored byYelena TravkinaProduced byJohn MorrowSpecial thanks toMulholland Tennis Club",

    "title": "Gorgeous, Gripping ‘Sentimental Value’ Tackles Trauma with a Light Touch",
    "article_text": "Four years ago, the Norwegian directorJoachim Trierdebuted his filmThe Worst Person in the Worldhere in Cannes. Afunny, sad, gregariousdramedy about the dawning of adulthood,Worst Personis one of the best films I’ve seen at this festival in a long time. So Trier’s followup,Sentimental Value, was easily mymost anticipated Cannes filmthis year. I put a lot of expectation on Trier’s shoulders—and those of the actorRenate Reinsve, who stars in both films. That’s a dangerous thing to do. In this case, though, it was rewarded. Trier has once againcrafted a filmthat is graceful and limber, thoughtful and surprising. But he’s quieted down the tone, shifting his gaze to the interior of one family as they try to reconcile with the pains of the past. Sentimental Value doesn’t land with the same wallop asWorst Person, but it is plenty affecting in its own insightful, poignant way. Reinsve plays Nora, a successful Oslo actor—she does big productions at the National Theater, and was on a hit TV series—who is dealing with a potent case of stage fright. It may be explained by the recent illness and death of her mother, but we get the sense that something else is at play, there’s a perhaps more innate dread and anxiety plaguing Nora. Her nerves are not helped by the reemergence of her father, Gustav (Stellan Skarsgård), a famous film director who was an unreliable presence in the lives of Nora and her historian sister, Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter). Nora, the eldest, is angrier at her dad than is Agnes—partly because Agnes played a large role in one of Gustav’s films when she was a child, and is thus more tightly bonded to him. And partly because Agnes was better shielded from the upheaval in her parents’ marriage and Gustav’s eventual estrangement. Many times, that is the blessing of the younger child. Gustav has his own issues to contend with: an over-reliance on alcohol and the lingering heartbreak of losing his own mother, who hanged herself in the family home when Gustav was seven years old. He’s written a script seemingly inspired by those events, and he asks Nora to star in the film, his first in 15 years. Nora is appalled and bluntly rejects him, leading to Gustav finding a famous American actress, Rachel (Elle Fanning), to step in as his leading lady—and, in some senses, surrogate daughter. Trier gently establishes all of these connections, tracing the family’s emotional journey in gorgeously staged vignettes. Some are buoyantly funny, others are prickly and sad. We learn more of the family’s history, particularly that of Gustav’s mother, who was part of the Norwegian resistance during WWII and was detained and tortured by the Nazis for two years. That may makeSentimental Valuesound like a heavy film about hereditary trauma. But Trier, as he often does, instead uses a deft and gentle hand to tease out his themes, wistfully examining how psychic wounds pass down through generations, fractures echoing and mutating. Reinsve, such a burst of luminous life inWorst Person, is equally successful in this more pensive, downbeat vein, palpably illustrating Nora’s wary resistance to interpersonal connection. We gradually learn of an incident in Nora’s past, a grim fact of her life that tethers her to the grandmother she never knew. Reinsve plays these beats with grounded restraint, keeping Nora’s behavior firmly in the realm of the real. In some senses, Skarsgård has the showier role, what with the drinking and the auteur vanity. But he and Trier keep Gustav carefully modulated, never turning him into too obvious a cad or a monster. We come to compassionately understand the pain he’s inflicted and the pain he’s had to endure. Similarly, Fanning’s character does not fall into noxious cliché; Trier lets her presence rattle Nora without turning Rachel into a clueless invader-antagonist. The Worst Person in the Worldwas a riot of flashy style, whereasSentimental Value–true to its title—goes a bit softer. But Trier’s steady command of framing, of camera movement, of music and setting are nonetheless on stunning display. He has a very sophisticated touch, polished but not preening. He stages one elegant set piece after another—theater productions, film shoots, an all-nighter on a vast beach. His summery depictions of Oslo are alluring as ever. But he lets that beauty be compromised, or at least complicated, by struggle, by all of life’s commingling and contradictory emotion. Sentimental Valueis also a heartening and complex look at art’s capacity for catharsis, how processing trauma through creativity can be at once healing and damaging. Filmmaking and theater are viewed through Trier’s lens as a kind of family endeavor, often of the found variety. But in this movie’s case, there’s a real family circling an idea and wondering what, if anything, they can make of it. Those deep thoughts are interrupted on occasion by bright pops of humor (there are some great inside-baseball film industry jokes), reminders that merriment is possible even in difficult days.Sentimental Valueis yet another rich and humane look at existence from a filmmaker wise to the endless nuance of being a person in the world, for better or worst.

    "title": "Kate Middleton Returns With an Accessory She Wore to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s Wedding",
    "article_text": "On Tuesday,Kate Middletonmade her first appearance at a Buckingham Palace garden party since 2023. Even though the day’s events were celebratingsome of the UK’s most charitable citizens, the Princess of Wales chose an outfit that makes it clear she had weddings on her mind. She wore a pale yellow Emilia Wickstead dress, which she accessorized with a pair of Robinson Pelham earrings that made their initial debut at her own wedding toPrince Williamback in 2011. Kate completed the outfit with a matching Philip Treacy hat that she wore duringPrince HarryandMeghan Markle’s Windsor wedding ceremony in May 2018. Kate has attended at least one garden party most years since she joined the royal family, but in 2024,her cancer treatmentmeant that she attended no public engagements during the spring. During Tuesday’s party Kate and Williamreunitedwith the family of Liz Hatton, a young photographer who visited the princess at Windsor Castlein October 2024. Hatton died of a rare and aggressive form of cancerin November 2024, nearly a year after she was diagnosed. Her earrings were a gift from Kate’s parents,MichaelandCarole Middleton,and London-based jeweler Robinson Pelham designed them especially for the occasion. Each earring features a pavé diamond oak leaf inset with a diamond acorn, finished with a pear-shaped drop, and the motif wasinspired by the Middleton family coat-of-armsthat was designed shortly before the wedding. When Kate’sAlexander McQueen wedding dresswent on display at the palace shortly after the wedding, the earrings were featured beside them, along withthe Cartier Halo TiaraKate wore for her big day. Though Kate’s pastel dress seems like she pulled it right off the runway, the Emilia Wickstead number has been in her wardrobe for a few years. She last wore it at the St. Paul Cathedral service of thanksgiving during the late Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June 2022. The Phillip Treacy hat that Meghan wore to the Sussexes’ wedding in 2018 is another popular choice from her closet, and she was last spotted in during Trooping the Colour back in 2019. Still, it’s a telling choice only one day after Harry and Meghan celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary witha public post full of memories from their relationship. It might be impossible to tell if Kate was sending a message to her estranged brother- and sister-in-law with her choice of headwear, but Harry and William are reportedly still not on speaking terms. The August 2024 funeral of their uncle Lord Robert Fellows was the last time the brothers were spotted in the same room, and fellow attendees said that the brotherskept their distance.

    "title": "Zohran Mamdani, New York’s Socialist Mayoral Striver, Says Andrew Cuomo Is Running “Scared”",
    "article_text": "Zohran Mamdanisits alone in a small holding room, the pages of his speech spread out on a low table. Mamdani seems, surprisingly, on edge. Maybe it’s because an at-capacity audience of some 2,000 people, the biggest crowd Mamdani has drawn during his mayoral campaign, is on the other side of the wall inside Brooklyn Steel, a venue where the headliners are usually acts like LCD Soundsystem andSamia.Maybe it’s because his mother, directorMira Nair,is circulating among the backstage throng. Most likely, though, it’s because Election Day is rapidly closing in. In the six months since declaring his candidacy, Mamdani has gone from obscure 33-year-old socialist state assemblyman to the biggest story in the battle for City Hall—and a threat to universally known former governor and front-runnerAndrew Cuomo.“Zohran is far and away the most talented candidate in the race,” a veteran New York political strategist says. ComedianJaboukie Young-Whiteand actorKal Penndo their best to keep the crowd—which includesElla Emhoff,stepdaughter of former vice presidentKamala Harris—energized during the wait for Mamdani. The mood is festive but wonky: People wearing “Eric Adams Raised My Rent” T-shirts discuss housing development tax policy and read novels to kill time. Finally, after a series of windy politicians and union leaders speak, Mamdani takes the stage, wearing a dark suit and tie set off by a white shirt. Wisely, he keeps his speech to a tight 11 minutes, hopping from signature proposals (“I believe we can freeze the rent for more than 2 million tenants!”) to red meat, like calling PresidentDonald Trump“a wannabe king,” and building to an adrenalized finish. “What we have dreamt in the night, we will build in the dawn,” Mamdani shouts. “The sun is starting to rise, and together, New York, on June 24, we are going to win!” The crowd roars and chants “Zoh-ran! Zoh-ran!” Yet in the background, if you listen hard enough, you can almost hear the calamitous thresher that is tabloid-stoked city politics whirring to life. This morning, after Mamdani exited a breakfast hosted by a Jewish organization in Brooklyn, a fellow state assemblyman,Kalman Yeger,went to the podium and denounced Mamdani as “one of the most vile antisemites” holding elected office in New York. Just less than two weeks later,Politicowill runa storyhighlighting how Mamdani declined to cosponsor two ceremonial legislative resolutions, one celebrating the anniversary of Israel’s founding and another condemning the Holocaust, though Mamdanisays he votedfor the second edict. This is the flip side of Mamdani’s unexpected success: The political press and his opponents are now taking him seriously and inspecting his record. Cuomo, early in his run,declaredantisemitism to be “the most serious and the most important issue” in the campaign—a dubious assessment considering the issues facing New York as a whole, but an astute calculation in a Democratic primary. Jewish voters are one of the city’s most reliable voting demographics. Orthodox Jewish voters are an even more prized bloc, and many in that community were unhappy with Cuomo’s quarantine orders during the pandemic. The ex-governor is finding Mamdani’s history a highly useful foil: Mamdani has long been a vocal advocate for Palestinians; he has called Israel’s military campaign in Gaza a “genocide”; and he has backed the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement. One week after the Brooklyn Steel rally, sitting at a table inside Ricky’s Café in polyglot Jackson Heights, Mamdani rejects being labeled antisemitic. “What underpins my politics is a universalism, a belief in human rights that have to be applicable to all people, and that is why I extend these notions of freedom and justice and safety to also apply to Palestinians,” he tells me. “A very real crisis of antisemitism is occurring within our city, and we do it a disservice by allowing politicians like Andrew Cuomo to weaponize it for their own ends.” Mamdani says that, if elected, he would propose creating a department of community safety and increasing funding for hate-violence prevention programs by 800%. The recent attacks, while based in Albany arcana, have nonetheless put Mamdani on the defensive. His campaign’s initial responses to the stories about the Israel and Holocaust resolutions were clumsy, allowing the controversy to fester. “Well, he’s a two-term assemblyman. It’s not like he has some massive operation in place to help handle these things,” a Mamdani ally says. “The infrastructure is, I think, being built as they go.” Mamdani’s rise has indeed been rapid. An only child, he was born in Kampala, Uganda, where his father, a professor and expert on colonialism, taught. The family moved to Cape Town, South Africa, when Mamdani was five, and to Manhattan when he was seven. “When I was younger, I tended to be consumed by this frustration of what it meant to be a minority wherever I was from,” Mamdani says. “That in Uganda, I was Indian; in India, I was Muslim; in New York City, I was all of these things, and it felt as if I was living in the second half of a commercial about a new medicine, with all of the terms and conditions applying to the life that I was seeking to live.” His father, Mamdani adds, once told him that the beauty of being a minority is seeing the truth of a place, not just its promise. “It helped me move beyond this chip-on-my-shoulder mentality about the world and instead see the responsibility I had to help create a new one.” After graduating from Bowdoin College in Maine, Mamdani worked as a housing-foreclosure prevention counselor in Queens while also trying to sell mixtapes of himself as the rapper Mr. Cardamom. A career in public policy soon seemed the wiser choice. In 2018, Mamdani became an American citizen; two years later, running as a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, he achieved an upset victory in a primary race for a New York State Assembly seat, defeating an incumbent Democrat by riding the local Queens progressive wave that had sentAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezto Congress. Mamdani has scored some modest wins during his two terms in Albany, including the implementation of a pilot program for free city buses. But he has also honed his ability to draw attention, as seen when he went ona 15-day hunger striketo push for better working conditions for city taxi drivers. “I don’t agree with him on everything, but he’s been a straight shooter and has been an effective partner when we work together on issues,” saysMike Gianaris,the State Senate’s deputy Democratic leader and a fellow Queens politician. “What he brings to the table is the ability to galvanize public opinion from people who are not normally involved in politics.” That is essentially the organizing principle of Mamdani’s mayoral campaign. Last fall he looked at the field and saw a lane open to the left. The incumbent mayor,Eric Adams,was increasingly mired in corruption scandals. The likely challengers were mostly familiar mainstream New York Democrats, including city comptrollerBrad Landerand former city comptrollerScott Stringer. And also, eventually, the 67-year-old Cuomo, who officially joined the field in March, following Adams’s September indictment on bribery and campaign finance charges (to which he pleaded not guilty, with the charges later controversially dismissed after Trump won the presidency). Cuomo, a blunt force in New York politics since the late 1970s, was elected governor three times, only to infamously resign in August 2021 under a black cloud of sexual harassment allegations (he has denied them all) and bitterness over his handling of nursing homes during the COVID pandemic. Mamdani has been a stark contrast to the somber, gray-haired political lifers, offering a fresh voice packaged in clever Instagram, X, and TikTok posts and touting populist ideas such as low-cost city-owned grocery stores, free buses, and rent freezes for some tenants. He believes he can build a base from younger, Muslim, and South Asian voters and has repeatedly created viral moments—none bigger than when he screamed in the face ofTom Homan,the Trump administration’s executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations, about deportation policy. “Sometimes the only options we’re left with are the ones where you have to shout at the so-called border czar of the United States as he smirks while eating an apple walking across the state capitol,” Mamdani says. The strategy has thus far been successful: Mamdanimaxed outon legal campaign donations in March at more than $8 million—collected from more than 19,000individual donors—and assembled a volunteer force of 20,000-plus that his campaign claims has knocked on more than 500,000 doors. All impressive yet inconclusive.Andrew Yangracked up similarly promising numbers in his bid for mayor four years ago, and was leading in some polls, but finished a distant fourth in the primary. This time around, polling has shown Mamdani as a consistent second to Cuomo, though by a wide margin: AMarist surveyreleased last week had him losing by 24 points. Mamdani’s advisers think they can expand his support to include older, white, conventionally liberal voters in brownstone Brooklyn and on the Upper West Side, particularly as a second or third choice in New York’s ranked-choice voting system, by emphasizing his ideas to lower the cost of living. Cuomo is, of course, intent on blocking that crossover. He’s portraying himself as the experienced manager who can save the city from the crazy left-wing radicals. TheNew York Post,meanwhile, is gleefully painting Mamdani as a hypocritical poseur. Mamdani very much wants to be seen as more than just the hipster candidate whoattractedR.E.M. frontmanMichael Stipeto one of his fundraisers, and he welcomes the skirmishing to an extent. “The record that Cuomo touts, we are seeing each and every day that it is built on a very flimsy set of facts,” he says. “He is scared of having to actually answer questions from New Yorkers that are not scripted….because to expose himself to the world that he wants to run is to admit to the fact that he spent the last few decades in suburbia and his connection to New York City is more on cable news than actually out on the street…and I think he’s also scared of our campaign.” Cuomo spokesmanRich Azzoparditicks off a list of the former governor’s accomplishments, including raising the state’s minimum wage and rebuilding LaGuardia Airport. “He’s got the experience and the record to put this city back on track,” Azzopardi says. “The stakes are too high to entrust this job to a 33-year-old silver spoon socialist whose short political career has been as a legislative backbencher who has no record or management experience whatsoever.” With his raft of major endorsements, tough-guy image, and millions of dollars in ads launched by a supportive super PAC, Cuomo remains the favorite. “Progressives are not connecting with blue-collar voters, whether you measure that along racial and ethnic lines or income and education,” an analyst not affiliated with any of the campaigns says. “For Mamdani to make an upset, he would need to build some bridges beyond just the left, and the overall turnout would have to be under 600,000 voters. In 2021 the turnout was just under 1 million.” The math is indeed very difficult. An estimated 50% of the electorate still doesn’t know who Mamdani is, something he will try to remedy with millions in ad spending down the stretch. Still, putting Mamdani in charge of New York’s $112 billion city budget and its larger-than-many-national-armies police department would require an enormous leap of faith by city voters, driven by something beyond the policy particulars he’s pushing. “I decided to run as a response to the ways in which the Adams administration had made life that much more expensive in a city that was already suffocating,” he says, “and the feeling that when the political class looked at this city after Trump won more votes in November, they were misreading despair as instead being a rightward shift.” Whether Mamdani wins or not, his rise is significant—for what it says about the tensions between social and traditional media; as a measure of the role of progressives in the Democratic Party; as a test of whether New York’s tribal fault lines are shifting; and as an expression of the generational hunger for change. “These other people have had their chances,” saysAlanna Saunders,a 33-year-old actor in the Brooklyn Steel crowd listening to Mamdani. “The only way the city gets out of its problems is by putting younger blood in charge.” That’s an admirably hopeful view. The immediate political question, though, is whether Mamdani bumps up against the limits of both charisma and left-wing politics, even in New York City. Nimble and confident, as always, Mamdani quickly shrugs off skepticism around buzz translating into enough ballots. “This is a campaign,” he says, “that continues to eclipse every ceiling that’s been imposed upon it.”",

    "title": "“This Is a Developing Story”: ‘Original Sin’ Authors Aren’t Done Probing the Biden 2024 Debacle",
    "article_text": "WhenAxiosreporterAlex Thompsonaccepted an award last month at theWhite House Correspondents’ Association’s annual dinner, he saluted his colleagues in the press—and took them to task. Former presidentJoe Biden’s “decline, and its cover-up by the people around him,” was a story that “we, myself included, missed a lot of,” and, as a result, “some people trust us less.” Thompson admits on this week’sInside the Hivethat he “felt a little odd to win an award for something I felt that we fell short on,” especially knowing “all the stuff we had in our book.” Though Thompson believes he was “aggressive” in covering Biden’s fitness during the 2024 election cycle, “we all could have done better.” Looking back, he says, “people were too trusting of people in power, and I think there should have been a lot more skepticism.” There is no shortage of skepticism, and reporting, in the explosive new page-turner he wrote with CNN anchorJake Tapper:Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.Tapper and Thompson interviewed more than 200 sources, most of whom would only speak after November’s election, in exploring Biden’s cognitive decline and how top advisers, likeMike DonilonandSteve Ricchetti,along with first ladyJill Bidenand sonHunter Biden,kept the president in a bubble and helped conceal the extent of his decline, which ultimately led to the collapse of his reelection campaign in the summer of 2024. Executive editorClaire Howorthand I spoke to Tapper and Thompson about their book, which haskickstarted a conversationaround the former president, his party, and the press. We had this interview booked before Sunday’s shocking and tragic news that Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer. Tapper says the authors have not recently spoken to the Bidens, noting that “you might be surprised to hear that they are not fans of the book.” “We are obviously sending our prayers and our thoughts and well-wishes to President Biden and his family with this difficult news of this diagnosis. I think what this news does is illustrate a couple things,” he says, which “is the difficulty when it comes to reporting sensitive health matters having to do with politicians, and also the need for transparency, the need for politicians to be transparent, especially presidents when it comes to their health.” “But you know, our book is about a larger, separate issue than the battle he’s facing right now,” Tapper continues, adding: “Our book is about what the American people have a right to know, and what they were told during the last several years that was not accurate.” “We build this book as a tragedy for a reason,” says Thompson, and “that’s partly because, you know, Joe Biden’s greatest virtue is that he never gives up. And it became a tragic flaw in the end. And I think it also speaks to the risks of running for a second term at his age. If he had won reelection, this would be happening while he was in the Oval Office right now.” On the episode, Tapper recalls his experience comoderating Biden’scalamitous June 2024 debatewithDonald Trump(“It was very upsetting to watch in person”) and explains why this moment “calls for reflection by the press,” similar to events such as theIraq warand Trump’s shocking 2016 victory. “Alex and I are not here to point out the people we thought especially screwed the pooch. But I will say, this has, without question, caused me to go back and look at my coverage with humility.” Though Tapper notes he covered issues around Biden’s age in the run-up to the 2024 race, he admits, “It’s impossible for me, knowing now what I know, to go back and think that I covered this adequately, or enough.” “I think it’s healthy for every human being, but especially journalists, to reflect on what we missed and why we missed it, and the reasons why we did,” he adds. “I do think much of it is the degree to which the White House was lying—to not just us and the American people, but also to their own cabinet, their own staff, to themselves.” It’s not only journalists who Tapper believes need to come to terms with the last election, as the “Democratic Party needs a reckoning with this.” “People should not make any bones about this. It was a bad decision. It should never have happened,” Tapper says. “And as his condition got worse, somebody should have said something to him to say, ‘You can’t do this. You’re not able to do this.’” He adds, “We can’t have this kind of secrecy about a president’s health. There’s just too much on the line. Congress and the political parties are just too weak and too deferential. We, the American people, deserve to know everything about their health. Everything.” Thompson says the pair are still investigating what happened in 2024, as sources who declined to speak to him in the past are now doing so. Tapper says he expects to “have more information” in the paperback edition as they continue getting insider anecdotes. “I think this is a developing story,” says Thompson. “We did our very best at the very first draft of it.” Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

Nearly two years after thecatastrophic 2023 voyage of the Titan submersible, whose implosion killed all five of its passengers, a documentary examining the voyage is headed to Netflix on June 11. The film will recount thedisastrous wreckageof the submarine mission and inspect the motives of the man behind the journey, OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush. AsSusan Caseypreviously reported forVanity Fair,there were troubling signs about the trek. “Titancould not get classed because it was built of the wrong material and it was built the wrong way,”Rob McCallum,cofounder of Eyos Expeditions who Rush tried to hire for OceanGate’sTitanicoperations, told her. “So once Stockton made up his mind, he was on a path from which there was no return.

    "title": "Inside Tom Cruise’s Brief (but Intense) First Marriage, to Mimi Rogers",
    "article_text": "Tom Cruise,star ofMission Impossible: The Final Reckoning,is about to celebrate a whopping 45 years in Hollywood. Over the years, his off-screen life has captured nearly as much attention as his onscreen performances—particularly his marriage toNicole Kidman,which began in 1990 and ended 11 years later. Before then, though, Cruise had relationships with several other actresses and artists—includingCher.In 2018, the Oscar winner dished about their fling in theDaily Mail.She and Cruise bonded, Cher said, in 1985, at a White House event organized by Nancy Reagan. “The White House invited a group of dyslexic people to an event to talk about this learning disorder that, oddly enough, both Tom and I suffer from,” explained the singer and actor, who is 15 years older than Cruise. “Of course, nothing happened there. In fact, we didn’t start dating until later. But the connection between us started that particular night.” When they were both teenagers, Tom Cruise had abrief relationshipwith fellow actorMelissa Gilbert. He reportedly datedRebecca De Mornay,his costar in 1983’sRisky Business: “It’s no secret that Tom engaged in an intense affair during the shooting with De Mornay,” their costarCurtis Armstrongwrote in his memoir.He also datedsingerPatti Scialfabefore she marriedBruce Springsteen. But the woman who most shaped Tom Cruise in this era was actressMimi Rogers,who is six years his senior. Rogers’s father, civil engineer Philip C. Spickler, was a very prominent member of the Church of Scientology, andvery closeto its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. At the time, Rogers was also a Scientologist. (She has sinceleft the church.) According toreporterKim Masters,Rogers was the one who introduced Cruise to Scientology. It took her a while to get into acting. Initially, Rogers was a social worker; she did not move to Los Angeles until she divorced her first husband,Jim Rogers,in 1980. After her move, she shared an apartment with fellow Scientologist Kirstie Alley and began her career as a performer on television, in episodes of series of the time likeHill Street BluesandMagnum, P. I. When she met Cruise in 1985, he was already a superstar—he was preparing to filmTop Gun—and she was still waiting for her big break. (Her first starring film role didn’t come until 1987, when she headlinedRidley Scott’sSomeone to Watch Over Me.) A year later, Cruise confirmed ina cover interview forRolling Stonethat he was with Rogers, whom he had met at a party and found to be an “extremely brilliant” woman. At the time, he was 23, and she was 29. In 1987, they became husband and wife at an intimate ceremony in upstate New York, with a few witnesses as guests—including Cruise’s close friendEmilio Estevez,whose engagement toDemi Moorehad recently ended. The marriage had a positive influence on both of them. “I have a lot of happiness and security. I recommend it [getting married],” Rogers told theChicago Tribunein 1988. Cruise, for his part, toldRolling Stonein January 1990 that being married helped him “become a better actor. We live a lot of things together, we share everything... My wife is the most important thing in the world to me. She’s my best friend. I love being with her. I love her.” But a few days after these words were published, the couple announced through a joint statement that they were separating. “While there have been very positive aspects to our marriage, there were some issues which could not be resolved even after working on them for a period of time,”they said. “Anyone who has been through this type of situation will understand that it is a complicated and difficult decision.” The world later learned Tom had initiated the divorce shortly before he began filmingDays of Thunder.There, he quickly fell in love with Nicole Kidman. “Instant lust, that’s what I felt,” CruisetoldVFin 1995.“I thought she was amazingly sexy and stunning. It grew into love and respect.” In 1993, Rogers posed nude for an issue ofPlayboyand gave an interview in which she opened up about her marriage to Cruise. “Tom was seriously thinking of becoming a monk,” she said. “At least for that period of time, it looked as though marriage wouldn’t fit into his overall spiritual need. And he thought he had to be celibate to maintain the purity of his instrument.” She laterretractedthese comments. In another interview withThe Telegraphin 2001, Rogers spoke again about Cruise, saying that, while his enormous fame did not hurt their marriage, she did feel frustrated with the press always bringing up the age difference between them. “The age thing really got on my nerves,” she said. “Every six months, they’d add another year. If we were still together now, I’d get 60.” In April 1990, Rogers also moved on from her marriage to Cruise: She met producerChris Ciaffa,with whom she has two children—Lucy Rogers-CiaffaandCharles Ciaffa—and whom she married in 2003 in Beverly Hills. She, too, has continued acting, mostly on television in series includingX-Files, Mad Men, Two and a Half Men,and, most recently, as a series regular onBosch.Rogers is also an accomplished poker player: She has played in several professional tournaments, and even served on the board of the World Poker Tour. Cruise, meanwhile, married Kidman,divorced her in 2001,and then entered a relationship withKatie Holmes—but that’s another story. Original story inVF Spain.",

    "article_text": "King Charles IIIshowed his support forJoe Bidenin his fightagainst prostate cancer. Buckingham Palace has confirmed that the sovereign, who himself has been undergoing treatmentsince February 2024 for an unspecified form of cancer, wrote a personal letter to the former US president,following the public announcement of his diagnosison Sunday, May 18. The contents of the missive have been kept confidential, according toPeople. The 82-year-old politician and his family are “reviewing treatment options with doctors” to combat his \"aggressive\" form of cancer coupled with “bone metastases” his personal office said. The disease “appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management,” the statement details. Plenty of political figures have mobilized to send the 46th President their best wishes for a speedy recovery in the days since the news became public. \"Joe is a fighter—and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,\" assured Biden's former Vice President,Kamala Harris, onX. “No one has done more than Joe to find innovative treatments for cancer in all its forms,” former PresidentBarack Obamadeclared on X, “and I am certain he will meet this challenge with the determination and grace that characterize him.” Trump also took to hisTruth Socialaccount to wish Biden “a speedy and successful recovery” on behalf of himself and his wifeMelania. Though the next day,Trump was already expressing doubts.\"It takes a long time to get to stage 9,\" he said to reporters at a press conference, confusing the diagnosis—Biden's cancer is stage 4 with a Gleason score of 9, an index corresponding to the degree of aggressiveness. “There are things going on that the public hasn't been told about, and I think someone's going to have to talk to their doctor,” Trump said. Trump hasn't shied away fromutilizing Biden's perceived healthfor his own political efforts: backed by supporters he was among those toclaim Biden's declining mental acuityas acampaign argument during his run, deeming the former Presidentdangerous for considering a second termin the White House. Biden did not respond to Trump's statement, instead thanking his supporters for their “love and support.” \"Cancer touches us all,\" he wrote on his X (formerly Twitter) account, along with a photo with his wife,Jilland their cat Willow. \"Like many of you, Jill and I have learned that it's in the broken places that we are strongest.\" This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.

    "article_text": "Alexander Skarsgårddidn't just walk up the steps at theCannes Film Festival on Sunday evening. He stomped them, in Saint Laurent thigh-highs no less, for thepremiere ofThe Phoenician Scheme,directorWes Anderson's new film. Under the flashing lights of photographers, the streamlined yet subversive silhouette—a double-breasted jacket with satin lapels and prominent shoulders, a black tie and, above, or below, all, leather thigh-high boots—was inspired by fetishwear. The same leggy footwearcaused a stir at the fashion house's last Fall 2025 show, and was recentlyseen onPedro Pascallast month. Though the majority of men invited to the festival stick to a timeless bow-tie tuxedo, the actor refused to submit to expectations. Halfway between the rigor of Yves Saint Laurent and the aesthetics of Robert Mapplethorpe (the '80s photographer known for his provocative black-and-white work and a major inspiration for creative directorAnthony Vaccarello's Fall show), the look was conceived by stylistHarry Lambert. The ensemble attempts to kickthe established codes of the red carpetmaking it not just a fashion moment, but a demonstration of style as an extension of Skarsgård's on-screen persona. Saint Laurent thigh-high boots from the Fall 2025 collection worn by Alexander Skarsgard on the Cannes Film Festival catwalk. InPillion, directed byHarry Lightonand presented in the festival's Un Certain Regard selection, the Swedish actor plays Ray, the leader of a queer biker gang. He initiates a reserved young man, played byHarry Melling, ofHarry PotterandThe Lady's Gamefame, to an extreme BDSM relationship. Adapted from the novelBox HillbyAdam Mars-Jones, the film explores the power dynamics within a marginalized fetish community. For the screening, the aesthetic tone was already set with Skarsgård's wardrobe choice. Black leather pants, a vintage T-shirt showing a boot crushing a man's face, all complimented by a pair of Loewe motorcycle boots—a silhouette straight out of a '90s cruising bar, and tailored to emulate the sultry protagonist ofPillion(which earned a seven-minute standing ovation). Alexander Skarsgard poses during the photocall forPillionat the 78th Cannes Film Festival at the Palais des Festivals on May 18, 2025 in Cannes, France. While method acting is nothing at Cannes, theBig Little Liesactor seems to be on board with the method dressing trend. This approach turns film promotion into a stylistic performance in its own right.

    "title": "Lady Gabriella Windsor On Kate Middleton's “Very Thoughtful” Gesture After Her Husband's Death",
    "article_text": "Lady Gabriella Windsorhas given a rare interview, revealing howKate Middletoninvited her to work on her carol concert followingthe death of her husband, Thomas Kingston. The daughter ofPrinceandPrincess Michael of Kent, Lady Windsor, also known as Ella, is the second cousin ofKing Charles III. Shemarried Kingston in 2019at St George’s Chapel in Windsor with the royal family in attendance, including the late Queen Elizabeth II, and wrote and performed a song for her own wedding reception. Tragedy struck the royal family in February of last year, whenKingston was found at his parents' home in the Cotswoldswith a gunshot wound to the head. He had suffered adverse side-effects from prescribed anti-depressants and following an investigation into his death in December, was found that he'd taken his own life. Kate Middleton is said to have asked Lady Gabriella to be involved during the summer last year, in the months following her husband's death Lady Gabriella and her late husband Thomas Kingston Windsor has now spoken of how months later, Middleton invited her to take on an advisory role when it came to her carol concert,Together at Christmas. According toHello!,Windsor was asked to tasked with suggesting music for the service, as well as “putting forward artists and ideas.” Speaking to the publication, she revealed, “It was such an honor to be involved, and very thoughtful and kind-hearted of the Princess to include me. I was very touched.” She went on to say how much she had enjoyed working with the Middleton, adding, “She was so lovely to work with, always gracious, very creative and with so much vision and passion for the many charities and causes she supports.\" Lady Helen Taylor and Lady Gabriella Windsor arrive for the Together At Christmas carol service at Westminster Abbey on December 6, 2024 Both Windsor and Middleton are around the same age, and both have endured a challenging year apiece in their own rights. Middleton,who was diagnosed with cancer in early 2024, said in a video introduction to the televised service: “This carol service is a heartfelt celebration of every one of you, and a reminder that at Christmas, and throughout the year, we must all shine for each other. Because in times of joy and sadness, we are all each other’s light.” She continued stating, “The Christmas story encourages us to consider the experiences and feelings of others. It also reflects our own vulnerabilities and reminds us of the importance of giving and receiving empathy, as well as just how much we need each other in spite of our differences. Above all else, it encourages us to turn to love, not fear. “The love that we show ourselves and the love we show others. Love that listens with empathy, love that is kind and understanding, love that is forgiving, and love that brings joy and hope. It is love which is the greatest gift we can receive, not just at Christmas but every day of our lives.” Prince William, Prince of Wales, Prince George of Wales, Princess Charlotte of Wales, Prince Louis of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales attend the Together At Christmas Carol Service Meanwhile, Lady Windsor's loss of her husband last year heightened the importance of her inclusion in the programing. At an inquest into his death, a statement by Windsor was read aloud byKaty Skerrett, senior coroner for Gloucestershire. “If anything had been troubling him, I’m positive that he would have shared that he was struggling severely. The fact that he took his life at the home of his beloved parents suggests the decision was the result of a sudden impulse,” the statement said. In her statement, Windsor described their marriage as “deeply loving and trusting” and said that her husband had never expressed any suicidal thoughts to her or others. “I believe anyone taking pills such as these need to be made more aware of the side effects to prevent any future deaths. If this could happen to Tom, this could happen to anyone,” the statement continued. Originally published in Vanity Fair Spain Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Paul Mescal and Josh O’Connor Tell a Heartbreaking Love Story in ‘The History of Sound’",
    "article_text": "How much stifled yearning can one gay period drama take? That’s a question confronted byOliver Hermanus’snew filmThe History of Sound, which premiered here in Cannes on May 21. The film, based on a short story byBen Shattuck, is about two young men who first meet in 1917, just before America heads to war. Those were certainly repressive times for queer people—yet music conservatory students Lionel (Paul Mescal) and David (Josh O’Connor) fall into bed together rather easily, bonding over their shared love of American folk music and no doubt drawn to each other’s considerable good looks. Hermanus doesn’t show us anything particularly steamy, but he does successfully create an air of quiet ardency, especially coming from Lionel. David, the orphan of a wealthy Newport family, is a bit more coy in his affections, while Lionel—who grew up in rural Kentucky before a singing scholarship brought him to study in Boston—looks at David with bedazzled wonderment. But Lionel is a quiet fellow, and the wealth of affection he feels for his friend and lover is never spoken aloud. Soon, the two are separated by war. When a haunted David returns from the trenches, he invites Lionel on a trip around rural Maine, where they will spend their days recording local singers and their nights rolling around together in a tent. The tent stuff does, inevitably, bring to mindBrokeback Mountain, anotherrestrained, handsomely staged dramaof gay men in harsh times. ButHistory of Soundsis on an even lower simmer than that film, asking its audience to sustain themselves mostly on loaded looks and hushed subtext. At times, Hermanus’s style is effective, selling us on the film’s lonely, years-spanning heartsickness. But too often the film’s muted emotion feels more gimmicky than credible to Lionel and David’s circumstances, particularly because Hermanus is so demure about sex; we barely even see the men kissing. Maybe Hermanus is harkening back to a storytelling era when homoeroticism did have to exist as mere suggestion, butHistory of Soundplays more as overly mannered pastiche than worthy contributor to that tradition. Which isn’t to say that the film is without power. As it glides toward its bittersweet conclusion, andChris Cooperenters the picture as an elderly Lionel, the movie’s air of impossible ache becomes potent. It successfully connects romance and music, arguing that Lionel and David’s love was its own kind of eternal folk song—that the small clamor and motion of all of our lives is part of some grander human symphony. Throughout the film, Mescal sturdily embodies Lionel’s restlessness and longing, convincingly portraying a dedicated loner who will never quite stop mourning a life that war, repression, and time denied him. His Kentucky twang may be a bit strained, but otherwise Mescal is a fine vessel for the film’s mood—though I do think I’d like to see him play something other than a laconic tender-heart with watery eyes before too long. (Gladiatordoesn’t count.) It’s O’Connor who makes the strongest impression. Though he has the smaller role, he does a lot with less. He pitches David as wistful, witty, and slightly effete, a child of tragic privilege who may have become some gregarious dandy had his time in France not shell-shocked him so violently. O’Connor makes Lionel’s love for David wholly understandable: who wouldn’t fall for this alluring spirit, with his wry smile that hints at a sad, secret knowledge of the world? O’Connor is so good in the film that, much like Lionel, one hungers for ever more of him. And one pines for the rare drama of this kind which recognizes that, despite the prejudices of the past, there have been gay people in almost every era who enjoyed lasting, wholly requited relationships. Yes, many have been barred—or have barred themselves—from realizing their desire over the centuries. But others did find a way. I would love to see O’Connor in an adaptation of, say,Alan Hollinghurst’sThe Sparsholt Affair, which breathtakingly chronicles a lineage of gay men across the latter half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st. Hollinghurst acknowledges what constrained these men while allowing the reader to marvel at the ways they thrived anyway—loved, lost, communed. Of course, stories likeThe History of Soundhave their place too. Hermanus’s film is respectable and frequently poignant. That I wanted to yell at the screen “just tell him you love him and kiss already!” may be owed more to my modern impatience than to any failure of the film. And perhapsHistory of Sounddoes actually have some relevance to today. After all, some of us will never be with Josh O’Connor even when we so desperately want to be. We’re all a little star-crossed, I suppose. This story is part ofAwards Insider’s in-depthCannes coverage, including first looks and exclusive interviews with some of the event’s biggest names.

    "article_text": "Few people were more surprised to seeHailey Bieber’snewVoguecoverthanher husbandJustin,who commemorated the milestone by revealing that he apparently didn’t believe Hailey had this in her. In a May 20Instagrampost sharing the cover imagery, Justin wrote that he once told Hailey during “a huge fight” that she would “never be on the cover ofVogue.” Evidently, he knew this was harsh: “Yikes, I know, so mean,” he added. But the 31-year-old musician concluded his strange remarks by apologizing to his wife, writing, “So baby u already know but forgive me for saying u wouldn’t get a vogue cover cuz clearly i was sadly mistaken.” Bieber’s unprompted admission of doubt raised so many eyebrows that he laterdeletedthe caption, replacing it with a series of emojis reading, “🤷🫵🏻🫶🏼🥹.” In theVoguearticle itself, Bieber praised his wife, writing to the outlet via email, “I’ve done a lot of dumb things in my life, but the smartest thing I’ve ever done was marry Hailey.” Hailey, meanwhile, told the magazine that she follows Justin’s advice when it comes to dealing with the spotlight. “I’ve learned so much from Justin, really,” she said. “He’s been doing this literally since he was a child and he has had to face the most scrutiny of any person that I know. He was, like, ‘Baby, trust me, I’ve been here before many, many times. You’re not going to win. There is no winning.’” The coupletied the knotwith a civil ceremony in 2018, then threw a star-studded2019 weddingin South Carolina. On August 23, 2024, the pairannounced the birth of their son,Jack Blues. Speaking withVogue, Hailey also shared the difficulties of postpartum life, as well as her “scary” labor experience. “Being postpartum is the most sensitive time I’ve ever gone through in my life, and learning a new version of myself is very difficult,” she told the publication. “And to be doing that all the while going on the internet every day and people being, like, ‘They’re getting divorced,’ and ‘They’re this,’ and ‘They’re not happy’—it is such a mindfuck.” As speculation about the state of their marriage ramped up on Wednesday, a source close to the couple spoke out toUs Weekly—telling the tabloid that Hailey “is the most supportive wife” to Justin, who “feels grateful to have her.” The source continued, “They have been through a lot, but have been in a good place these last few months.” That same insider also addressed Justin’s recent trips to Finland and Iceland, telling the outlet, “Justin needed a change of pace in order to feel inspired creatively again. Justin has had dark days recently and is going through a lot of changes in his life.” A second source described this time in Justin’s life as a “self-reflection and healing period.” In recent months, Bieber’sseemingly erratic behaviorandvulnerable postson social media have fueled rumors about his home life with Hailey. At the start of the year, he unfollowed Hailey on Instagram, thenrefollowed herthat same morning, writing on his Instagram story, “Someone went on my account and unfollowed my wife.” On March 30, it was Hailey’s turn to unfollow her husband for about two days. But in a TikTok comment, she claimed that this too was an accident: “It’s a glitch,” she wrote, as reported byPage Six.“Didn’t unfollow him. Hope this helps!” Last month, fans expressed concern over a video of Justin partying at Coachella and posting photos of himself with a bong. “Justin is having fun, vibing out and, yes, he smokes weed like everyone else,” a source toldPeople.“But everything he does is being weaponized against him.” That same source refuted any divorce rumors. “Hailey is not on the verge of wanting a divorce or leaving him. It’s just completely untrue,” the source said. “If anything, she’s sad about how hard everyone is being on him now that he finally is coming back out of his shell.” A second source close to Justin reiterated this sentiment toPeople. “Hailey’s very loyal to him. She’s not walking away, but she knows something has to change,” said the source. “Her focus is raising [their son] Jack in a stable environment. She’s drawn a line around what she’s willing to tolerate. She means the world to Justin. They have quietly weathered more than most couples ever do.” That same month, one of Justin’s former team members toldThe Hollywood Reporterthat the singer was “lost” with “no one protecting him,” alleging that he was also millions of dollars in debt aftercancelinghisJusticetour in 2022. A rep for Justin lambasted theTHRreport. “This is just clickbait stupidity based on unnamed—and clearly ill-informed —‘sources,’ disappointed that they no longer work with Justin,” the rep toldPeoplein April. “As Justin forges his own way forward, these unnecessary stories and inaccurate assumptions will continue. But, they won’t deter him from staying committed to following the right path.” The couple was last spotted in public together at a hockey game on May 18, where they cuddled while watching the Toronto Maple Leafs play the Florida Panthers.Vanity Fairhas reached out to reps for both Hailey and Justin for comment.

    "title": "Dior Spas Are Redesigning Wellness",
    "article_text": "For more than a century, theHôtel Plaza Athénéein Paris, located at 25 Avenue Montaigne, has offered its guests a luxurious respite amid the bustling city streets and the chance to indulge in l’art de vivre, the art of living well. Just a few doors down, at 30 Avenue Montaigne, fashiondesigner Christian Diordid the same when establishing his couture house in 1946. It was there that he would eventually create the iconic Bar suit, his new look, a style he dreamed up for the women who dined at Le Relais Plaza, the hotel’s Michelin-starred restaurant. Many of its star-studded clientele—Marlene Dietrich,Rita Hayworth,Ava Gardner,Lauren Bacall,Jackie Kennedy,Elizabeth Taylor, andSophia Lorenamong them—morphed from muses to devotees, often making their way across the avenue to shop at Dior. In 2008 the hotel and the fashion house made the relationship official with the completion of the Dior Spa Plaza Athénée. Today, the synergy has been renewed with a fresh renovation of the tranquil space well-known for its high-tech treatments accented by sumptuous details characteristic of the French fashion house. Here, warm lighting sets a gentle mood as a marble pool engraved with the brand’s signature rose des vents invites guests to explore a range of sophisticated treatments from light therapy to massage to facials to cryotherapy. Five single-occupancy treatment rooms are reflective of significant themes in Dior’s life— Constellation, for his love of astrology; Miss Dior, for the first fragrance made in honor of his sister Catherine; Montaigne, for the Plaza Athénée and Dior studios; Granville, for the designer’s birthplace; New Look, for his 1947 collection launch—and one additional room is dedicated solely to light therapy. Dior Prestige La Micro-Huile de Rose Activated Serum Dior Dior Prestige La Crème Texture Essentielle Dior Inside the Dior Light Suite, created in partnership with the innovative French lighting company Lucibel·le Paris, an LED-studded ceiling mimics the incandescence of the sun, delivering a doctor-approved dose of sunlight to help rebalance energy levels, encourage healthy sleep, and erase signs of fatigue. The “sky” diffuses a natural light, with three levels of intensity: energizing, relaxing, and regenerating. For those plagued by jet lag or those struggling with daily stressors, three new 105-minute treatments inspired by the sun claim to aid in resetting circadian and chronobiological rhythms, each coupling light therapy with a complementary massage. “Recover” cloaks the body in amber-hued half-light during a stimulating massage. “Rest” offers a mix of sensorial stimulation through light that channels the sunset and massage. This weary traveler opted for the D-Tissue massage to release tension and reoxygenate muscles, essentially reharmonizing one’s internal clock for restoration and rejuvenation. Elsewhere, this month, Dior is continuing its commitment to wellness with a new location at theSplendido, a Belmond Hotel,in Portofino. Set between the gardens and the ocean, Spa Splendido is the first permanent Dior spa in Italy, with a focus on well-being. The signature service there, Splendidior, is a holistic treatment for both face and body, promising to offer full relaxation, with guided energizing power utilizing semiprecious stones.

    "title": "The Elon Musk Rebrand Is in Full Swing. But Will Anyone Buy It?",
    "article_text": "Gone was the black MAGA hat. So too, thechainsaw. LittleX AE A-12? Perched presumably somewhere other than his father’s shoulders in the Oval Office. Instead, asElon Musksat down for an interviewTuesday inside Tesla’s gigafactory, a sleek fleet of electric vehicles parked just behind him, he seemed determined to send a clear message: That he was getting back to the serious business of being a CEO. Well, serious except for the fact that he was wearing a Tesla-branded jacket with the word “S3XY” embroidered on it. This is still the same guy who loves apot jokeandpoop emoji, after all. The CNBC interview appeared tailor-made to facilitate Musk’s reentry to the corporate world, as he eases his way out of hismuch reviled government roleat the Department of Government Efficiency. The post-DOGE media tour also included a stop at the Qatar Economic Forum, whereMusk declaredthat his days ofdoling out hundreds of millions of dollarsto Republicans may be over. “In terms of political spending, I’m going to do a lot less in the future,” Musk said at the forum. “I think I’ve done enough.”Asked whether this change has anything to do with the blowback his businesses have faced, Musk dodged the question saying simply, that he doesn’t “currently see a reason” to continue pouring money into politics. It was a remarkable admission for a man who warned last year that “the fate of western civilization” was at stake in the 2024 election and who said that the country was teetering onthe edge of bankruptcywhenPresident Trumptook office. Yet now—as DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts continue tofall far short of the $2 trillionin cuts Musk promised, and as the president pushes House Republicans to pass a spending package that wouldincrease the deficit by nearly $4 trillion—Musk suddenly believes his work here is done? The truth is, regardless of what Musk does in the future, it’s clearly in his best interest—and the best interest of his businesses—to look like he’s bowing out of politics. Musk’s unparalleled support for the Trump campaign and intensely public work for the administration have torpedoed his companies’ reputations. According toa new Harris poll, which measured the reputation of the 100 most visible brands in America, both X and Tesla ranked in the bottom 10. When it comes to corporate “character,” Tesla was last. In 2021, before Musk took over Twitter,Tesla scoredthe 8th best reputation in the same poll, according to Axios. SpaceX scored equally poorly this year, ranking in the bottom 10 companies for “character,” “trust,” and “citizenship.” This reputational damage has had a huge financial impact, withTesla’s first quarter profits dropping71% since the same time last year. Musk, of course, is loathe to admit the connection. He insisted during the Qatar forum that while Tesla has “lost some sales, perhaps on the left, we've gained them on the right.” He also said that Tesla’s prospects have “already turned around,” citing the recent uptick in the company’s stock price. But that uptick is inextricably tied to Musk’s public announcement that he would soon be spending less time at DOGE and his marked shift away from posting about politics on X over the last two months.One analysis byThe Washington Postthis week found that more than half of Musk’s posts on X were about politics in February, while less than 10% of them mentioned his companies. Now, the balance has flipped. The question now is whether people will actually buy Musk’s attempted rebrand. On one hand, memories can be short, as evidenced by the fact thatDonald Trumpwon a second term in office, after being effectively run out of Washington after the January 6 insurrection. On the other, political moneymen tend to have a hard time shaking that reputation. Just look atGeorge Soros, a wildly successful businessman, who, at least on the right, will never be regarded as anything other than a left-wing boogeyman. Musk is no Soros. He's something more. In a short mount of time, the role he has played in American politics is singular. Combining the force of his unrivaled wealth, his global fame, his online platform, and his virtually unfettered (thoughpotentially unlawful) authority to reshape government agencies, he has gleefully wielded unprecedented power. And his media tour has not been an apology tour. In both the CNBC interview and his appearance at the Qatar forum, Musk brazenly defended DOGE's work and threatened his critics. Did he regret any of his political endeavors, the interviewer in Qatar asked? Musk thought for a moment, before replying, “I did what needed to be done.” Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "How TheSkimm, Once Deemed “the Ivanka Trump of Newsletters,” Grew Into a Must-Read for Political Leaders on the Left—and Right",
    "article_text": "WhenDanielle WeisbergandCarly Zakinfirst launchedTheSkimm,a daily news-digest email aimed at busy young women, back in2012,media critics dismissed the conversational tone, mix of low and highbrow content, and use of memes. In 2017,Slatedubbed it“theIvanka Trumpof newsletters” that “treats its readers like they’ve never read an article, looked at a map, or accidentally seen a CNN segment in their dentists’ waiting rooms.” How times have changed: With more than 5 million active subscribers across its email products, according toAxios, TheSkimmhas earned its reputation as a crucial media resource for female readers who are interested in the world. AndTheSkimmitself is doing important things for that world. When, by the end of thefirst dayofDonald Trump’s second term, a government-run website with reproductive health information, ReproductiveRights.gov, abruptly vanished,TheSkimmabsorbed the content and republished it.The Skimmplans to host the resurrected page in perpetuity. The move wasn’t about partisanship for Weisberg and Zakin, who, in a wide-ranging interview withVanity Fair,say they have no plans to endorse candidates in the future. The person whose team they’re on hasn’t changed since they launched the business from their shared couch: It’s \u0000“her,” their one-word shorthand for their readership. “What our audience realized, probably even before we realized, is there was no knight in shining armor from the government—no matter what government was in power—that was coming to save her,” Zakin said. “When I say ‘save her,’ I mean give her the support that she needs and the economic policies that she needs to continue to be a contributor to the economy, to be able to have a family so that we don’t have a dwindling population rate. I think it is made very clear to our audience, millions of her across this country who all represent different political arms, that nobody is ever coming to help. And that’s a really bitter pill to swallow.” TheSkimmis still as likely to give Kardashian shenanigans top billing in a newsletter as it is to spotlight the latest in ceasefire talks. Now, though, instead of deliriously refreshing the wires themselves all night before the morning send, Weisberg and Zakin head an operation made up of more than 75 full-time employees, according toAxios.Digital media giant Ziff Davis, which ownsWhat to Expect, Mashable, BabyCenter,and more,recently bought the companyfor an undisclosed amount. (Weisberg and Zakin declined to discuss specifics of the deal.) For this conversation, we sat down at Cafe Cluny in New York City’s West Village, right around the corner from the walk-up they used to share when they launchedTheSkimm. “It’s actually how we got the earliest celebrity fans,” Zakin said of the restaurant that once served as their de facto office, which a friend sent a sketch of as a gift celebrating the acquisition. “Julianne Moorewas there all the time.” The roommates turned cofounders are clearly still close: They still order fries (Weisberg checks that Zakin is getting fries as a side before she opts for greens as her own, then the two align on their dip choices) and nudge each other as multiple celebrities walk in, and they—no joke—finish each other’s sentences several times throughout the conversation. Read on to find out which politicos readTheSkimm,what the algorithm dishes out to Weisberg and Zakin, and how the founders plan to help women be their own heroes. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Vanity Fair:The voice ofTheSkimmhas changed a lot over the years. Can you talk about finding the balance for a conversational tone about serious topics? Carly Zakin:Back when we started, we called it news, but it was zeitgeist. Danielle Weisberg:It was inclusive of the news, but also what was happening in our generation and being talked about. Zakin:Our ethos was like, it doesn’t matter who you are, what your job is, if you are at a work-networking thing, or a wedding, or whatever, and somebody is talking about something happening in the world, you should know what they’re talking about. We never wanted anybody to have a deer-in-headlights moment. The algorithm seems to be everywhere these days. You spend a lot of time together and have a lot of the same interests—are you two on the same internet? Zakin:Danielle and I are on the same internet. Weisberg:Yes. Zakin:Our spouses are not. Weisberg:Definitely not. How would you describe your internet? Weisberg:We were on the way here together sitting next to each other in an Uber. And I texted my sister, who works in art, something from theDaily Mailabout a gallery, and seconds later Carly texted my sister and me the exact same thing. And my sister was like, “Aren’t you guys next to each other?” How would you characterize your readership, and has it changed over the years? Weisberg:We talk about “her” or “she”—that is who we have obsessed over. She’s so educated. She has been told growing up that she could do anything. And then the expectation was, “You can have it all.” But do youwantit all? What does that mean and how do you actually keep that up without losing yourself or your mind? We really saw, especially in the pandemic, was no one’s coming to save her. There’s no secret solution for all of this. What we’ve experienced, and I think what our audience has also shown us, is she’s helping herself. Whether that’s through creating a sense of community, whether it is through looking for practical ways to make your life easier or better. Part of that is information to make those decisions. That’s always what we’ve thought about with who she is, what she’s doing, what she’s going to trust, and how much time is she going to give us. Zakin:When I look back to what this journey has been, there’s the before and after of 2020, and we’ve seen the business through so many different global challenges and industry challenges, and it’s part of why we’re very proud of how we exited, and continuing to meet our audience where she is. Your company explicitly says it’sforwomen. How do you keep that focus without tipping over into gimmick? Weisberg:It’s evolved over time, as it should and as our audience has, and we’ve all grown up. I always think back to some of the earliest criticism that we got, which was, “How is it okay to write about things that are serious in a truncated way? How is it okay to give weight to both what’s going on with the Kardashians and what’s going on in Egypt in the same short amount of space?” People were very serious about this criticism. And this is in the age ofBuzzFeedand listicles and it always felt to me like such a hallmark of this self-importance that I think can be found in coastal media. It’s not at all indicative of how people speak or how they live their lives, which is not in silos: “This is when I’m going to think about politics; this is when I’m going to think about things I’m interested in.” It is all of those things at probably the same time and in the same conversation, when you need to know it. And you probably only have a certain amount of time to actually consume information. Forever, our number one hallmark or touchstone with our voice was, “It needs to be authentic to who she is and what’s on her mind. What are the stressors?” And those two things, while patterns of speech and colloquialisms have changed and should continue to change over time, those two things have always been the most important. Is the reader growing with you? Does she also include a 21-year-old? Your mom’s friend? Weisberg:The best way that I describe who she is, is she’s someone that’sin it. “In it” could mean someone who is watching, or experiencing, or will soon be on the path to taking care of your kids and your parents at the same life stage. Recognizing that thesandwich generationis coming for you or being part of it is something that completely changes the way that you approach so many things. But someone that’s in it could also be someone who just graduated from college and is thinking about how they’re going to support themselves and what that might look like in the future. It’s someone who is just trying to make really good decisions in the midst of a really turbulent time. I want to talk about the Reproductive Rights page that you republished after it was removed from government websites. I know thatTheSkimmis adamantly nonpartisan. What was the thought process behind this move? Weisberg:Just by doing something around reproductive rights, you are labeled as partisan in some way. And how we looked at it is, women’s health is not political. It has beenpoliticized. Access to information around it should be a fundamental, easily accessed right. Zakin:I think also, it’s so funny, I go back to, “Okay, when we started what was the environment?” And we were like, “It was the heyday of cable news. It was the heyday of Twitter.” And it was still called Twitter. Everything felt so partisan [then] and it’s cute that we thought that. I think to where things are today and there is no shortage of finding people’s opinions and even debating what is fact, what is not fact. What we always were intentional about was not to build a brand based out of New York and alike audiences. We live in New York, and started this in New York, and we could never have built what we builtnotbeing in New York, honestly, but our audience has always been spread across the country. Our audience is also, they don’t all look the same way. When you look at how this last election went, overwhelmingly, especially if you look at white women, over 60% supported Trump. The mistake that we’ve seen so many media outlets make is thinking they know how an audience feels. Have you gotten pushback or heard from the current administration on anything? Weisberg:No. But I’ll also say there were oftentimes in previous administrations where we got pushback too. Zakin:Absolutely. Weisberg:Very direct. Can you say more about that? Weisberg:No. Zakin:I will say that leadership on both sides of the aisle are avid Skimmers. Can you tell me about any issues or upcoming focuses on your mind? Zakin:We are obsessed with the fact that this generation is facing, no matter who she is or where she is in life, having dependents on both sides. And especially when you think about taking care of parents and—not even taking care of them, but actually having the tough conversations with them and knowing everything from where their medical records are to is their money saved to get them care? What’s their insurance? All of that. The two of you have been at this together for 13 years and are clearly still so close. Does the enormity of that journey ever just hit you? Weisberg:Celebrating things has been a big part of our journey. The story could have gone in so many different ways. I think about it as someone else’s story, looking back. It is wild that we’ve done it and we’ve done it together and had some really weird times. Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Michelle Williams Remembers Heath Ledger: He Was “So Special”",
    "article_text": "Many years after the passing of Heath Ledger, who died in 2008 of anaccidental drug overdose, his ex-girlfriendMichelle Williamsopened up about their bond during an episode of theArmchair Expertpodcast, hosted byDax Shepard. Shepard, too, knew Ledger a bit, he told his guest. “I feel obligated to say that I knew him a little bit when he was getting sober,” Shepard said. “And I don’t know that I’ve ever fallen in love with someone so quickly. This is one of the most special boys I’ve ever met. And I can feel the weight of the world on him in a very special way that kind of broke my heart.” Williams replied, in a whisper, that Ledger was “so special,” repeating it a few times. “Thank God there’sMatilda,” she added, referring to her and Ledger’s now 19-year-old daughter. Williams and Ledger met on the set ofBrokeback Mountain, where they played a married couple grappling with an enormous secret: Ledger’s character, Ennis, was hiding his homosexuality, and his relationship withJake Gyllenhaal’s Jack, who in turn was married toAnne Hathaway’sLureen. Matilda Rose Ledger was born during the film’s promotional tour, in October 2005. As Shepard pointed out, everyone inBrokeback’s cast went on to enormous fame and accolades. “How was the life-altering shift of, you’re going to be at the Academy Awards?” he asked Williams “Was that a natural transition?” “No,” replied Williams. “We had a baby. But I suppose maybe it’s a good thing about being young, is that you don’t have so much life experience that you can contextualize things. So you’re really just going with the flow.” Williams and Ledger broke up 12 months before Ledger’s death. Williams raised Matilda on her own for several years. She’s now a parent to three more kids with her husband, directorThomas Kail: Hart,born in 2020; a second child, born in 2022; and a third born in the spring of 2025. As such, Williams has gradually become more confident in her abilities as a mother. “When I make mistakes in front of my daughter, and own up to them and apologize, it teaches her to make mistakes and say, ‘Oopsie, Mommy, I’m sorry.’ And it’s not a big deal,” she told Shepard. “It’s a part of life, and we move on. No shame, no blame. Just, ‘You made a mistake? Beautiful. I made five already today.’” Back in 2016, in aninterviewwithPortermagazine, Williams talked about her experience as a single mother after Ledger’s death. “In all honesty, for pretty much everything else, I feel like I’m a believer in not fighting circumstances, accepting where you are and where you’ve been,” she said then. “In pretty much all senses but one, I would be able to go totally down that line of thinking were it not for Matilda not having her dad. You know, that’s just something that doesn’t…I mean, it just won’t ever be right.” Original story inVFItaly. Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Give the Real Housewives an Emmy, You Cowards",
    "article_text": "God blessJean Smart, but I don’t know if I can watch her winanother Emmy. She’s already collected three for her delicious work onHacks—she’s never been nominated for the series without winning—and this September she will likely be called to the stage for her fourth. John Oliver’sLast Week Tonight,meanwhile, has won30 awards in 11 years, and I can recite from memory his perennial speech thanking staff members in Brooklyn. Some 140 years ago, when Nietzsche advanced the concept of eternal return, he was talking about how boring the Emmys are. All this is not entirely the voters’ fault—television is built on multiseason series—but they’ll clearly vote for the same people over and over until they get carpal tunnel. The result is that the industry’s most respected awards show has been stagnant and zeitgeist-adjacent a long time. Even as a teen, I remember watchingFrasierwin best comedy series five years in a row and thinking, Is that all there is? The Emmys need more electricity and drama, by which I mean they need reality stars. Yes, the Television Academy rewards reality TV, but mostly at the Creative Arts Emmys a week earlier, which has all the glitz and buzz of Air Force Two. The prime-time Emmys can start reinventing itself by adding two new categories to the broadcast—one for best performance in a reality program and another for best performance in a reality competition. The former would bring stars likeThe Real Housewives of Potomac’s Gizelle Bryant,Salt Lake CityHousewife Mary Cosby, andLove Is Blind’s Hannah Jiles into the drowsy theater. These are not women who are going to give polite speeches thanking their agents. These are women who know how to deliver. They will be a renewable resource of theatrics and priceless sound bites. Reality competition, meanwhile, would recognize contestants from beloved series likeSurvivor,The Traitors,The Bachelor,andRuPaul’s Drag Race.Contestants fromSurvivorcan be weird, funny, savvy, and fiercely intelligent:Mike Whitewas on the show long before he createdThe White Lotusand made brotherly incest a subplot of prestige TV. Reality series have given us charming, ruthless pop-culture icons like Parvati Shallow and Boston Rob, not to mention Gabby Windey, who’s a mixture of Luanne fromKing of the Hilland Elle Woods fromLegally Blonde.Windey was put on this earth to be quoted and memed. I’m suggesting these new categories primarily to bringfunback to the Emmys, but let’s not forget that reality TV helps power every successful network and streamer. Last November, Comcast announced that it would spin off most of its linear cable networks into a separate company while retaining Bravo. If the Television Academy is concerned about the ratings of its awards show, it should let some of the most passionate fandoms into the tent. To treat a whole sector of programming as “less than” is to turn your back on relevance at a time when every pair of eyeballs matters. And if you’re not convinced that a reality TV performance could be worth honoring, direct your own eyeballs to Bob the Drag Queen’s speech at that memorableTraitorsroundtable—it was a wig-snatching Shakespearean tour de force. By the way, reality stars will make for great TV even when they lose because they won’t go quietly into the night. We know this from experience: Donald Trump has whined about losing out on an Emmy forThe Apprenticefor years and called the show “dishonest,” “a con game,” and “sooooo boring.” The first two criticisms are absurd. The third one’s worth thinking about. Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "article_text": "‘Negative vetting’ process will see licensing regime gazetted on Friday, following earlier moves targeting hospitals and day procedure centres The Health Bureau said on Wednesday that the new rules would be gazetted on Friday. The changes fall under the Private Healthcare Facilities Ordinance, which was passed in 2018 but enacted in phases, starting with hospitals in 2019 and day procedure centres in 2020. A licence will be required to operate a clinic under the ordinance, which stipulates specific requirements for areas such as staffing and equipment. Codes of practice related to clinic operations will also be gazetted on Friday and come into effect on October 13. Clinics that opened on or before November 30, 2018, can apply for a licence between October and April 13 next year.",

    "article_text": "Haemoglobin threshold increased after number of blood donors rejected fell from nearly 40,000 in 2015 to 10,000 last year The Hong Kong Red Cross has tightened the haemoglobin requirement for female blood donors for the first time in 30 years, as the number who failed to meet the threshold and were turned away dropped nearly 75 per cent in a decade. Dr Lee Cheuk-kwong, chief executive and medical director of the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, said on Tuesday that, effective from May 27, the haemoglobin threshold for female blood donors would be raised from a range of 11.5-12 grams per decilitre, to between 12g/dl and 16.5g/dl. The requirement for male donors will remain unchanged. The decision was made after a considerable reduction in the number of blood donors rejected for insufficient haemoglobin, from nearly 40,000 in 2015 to 10,000 last year. “We notice that there is a significant improvement in haemoglobin levels among the regular donor population. Part of that is related to our education and awareness programmes, which have been impactful for more than 10 years,” Lee said. While about 10 out of 70 people are currently rejected every day due to insufficient haemoglobin, Lee estimated that around 10 more would be turned away daily for the same reason under the raised threshold. He also noted that other reasons for rejection included overseas travel, taking prescribed medication, and having the flu.",

    "article_text": "The European Union has pledged €5.5 million in emergency funding to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) to prop up the Cold War-era broadcaster, which is widely regarded as a Western propaganda outlet. Originally created in the 1950s and covertly financed by the CIA to disseminate pro-Western narratives into the Soviet bloc, RFE/RL has more recently operated under the oversight of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM). In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order eliminating most of the agency’s funding as part of a sweeping cost-cutting agenda. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas announced the bloc’s financial lifeline on Tuesday, describing it as“short-term emergency funding”to support what she called a“vital”mission. The €5.5 million package will act as a“safety net”to help RFE/RL maintain operations in countries within Brussels’s sphere of interest, including Russia, Belarus, Iran, and several Central Asian states. “In a time of growing unfiltered content, independent journalism is more important than ever,”Kallas said following a meeting of EU foreign ministers. She acknowledged that Brusssels could not fully replace the lost American funding but emphasized the symbolic value of the move, urging individual member states to offer further support. Since Trump’s defunding order, RFE/RL has furloughed staff, suspended programming, and launched legal challenges. Although a Washington judge temporarily halted the administration’s decision in April, a federal appeals court later blocked the release of funds pending further litigation. The broadcaster has warned that it faces permanent shutdown in multiple regions if its financial crisis is not resolved. The Trump administration framed the defunding as part of a broader campaign to dismantle bureaucratic institutions that no longer align with US strategic interests. RFE/RL’s leadership has disputed that rationale, with its president, Stephen Capus, calling the funding cuts a“massive gift to America’s enemies.” Administration officials and critics have argued that RFE/RL and its sister outlet, Voice of America (VOA), have lost their relevance and veered toward partisan editorializing. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has publicly called for both outlets to be“shut down,”writing on X:“Nobody listens to them anymore.”",
