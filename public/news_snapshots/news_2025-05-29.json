President Donald Trumpon Wednesday commuted the 12-year sentence of a major political donor who was serving time for a number of offenses, including obstructing an investigation into Trump’s 2017 inaugural committee, the White House confirmed with Fox News Digital. Imaad Zuberi, 54, was a major Democrat supporter before he backed Trump following his 2016 election victory,The New York Timesreported. Before pivoting to Trump on election night, he served as a bundler for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, including stints on both of their campaign finance committees. Zuberi donated more than $1.1 million to committees associated with Trump and the Republican Party months after the 2016 election, the Times reported.

In 2020, he pleaded guilty toobstructing a federal investigationinto the source of a $900,000 donation he made through his company to Trump’s inaugural committee in late December 2016, the report states. Zuberi also pleaded guilty to falsifying records filed with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act to conceal his lobbying work on behalf of Sri Lanka.

    "article_text": "Dr. Judson Welcher testified on cross-examination that his experiment using a Lexus SUV and blue paint to depict Karen Read's alleged collision with John O'Keefe was reputable after attorney Robert Alessi looked to poke holes in the claims. (Pool) Karen Read’s defense teamlooked to chip away at a crash expert’s credibility by pointing to eye-watering expenditures and alleged inconsistencies in experiments as the state enters the 11th hour of testimony in their case. Read isaccused of killingher then-boyfriend, Boston police officer John O’Keefe, by striking him with her Lexus SUV outside a house party at 34 Fairview Road and leaving him to die in frigid temperatures shortly after midnight on Jan. 29, 2022. The state’s expected final witness, Dr. Judson Welcher, a crash reconstructionist with Texas-based Aperture LLC, held firm on his findings that Read’s vehicle allegedly struck O’Keefe. KAREN READ'S SUV REACHED '74% THROTTLE' MOMENTS BEFORE JOHN O'KEEFE'S FINAL MOVEMENTS, CRASH EXPERT TESTIFIES Karen Read listens to the cross-examination by Robert Alessi of expert accident witness Dr. Judson Welcher during her retrial at Norfolk Superior Court, Wednesday, May 28, 2025, in Dedham, Massachusetts.(Greg Derr/The Patriot Ledger via AP, Pool) \"[O’Keefe’s injuries are] consistent with being struck by a Lexus and also contacting a hard surface, such as frozen ground,\" Welcher told special prosecutor Hank Brennan. In a sometimes-evasiveline of cross-examination, Welcher often provided non-answers to defense attorney Robert Alessi’s questions surrounding his modifications to a PowerPoint presentation used in Read’s trial to depict Aperture’s investigation. \"Assume the trial started approximately April 22, 2025,\" Alessi said. \"Did you create your updated presentation before or after [it began]?\" \"I don’t know,\" Welcher replied. KAREN READ TRIAL WITNESS FACES BRUTAL CROSS-EXAMINATION OVER VEHICLE DATA Dr. Judson Welcher, an accident reconstruction expert, speaks on the witness stand during the Karen Read retrial, Wednesday, May 28, 2025, in Dedham, Massachusetts.(Greg Derr/The Patriot Ledger via AP, Pool) Alessi looked to nail down a timeline of when Welcher may have made changes to the document and whether the prosecution communicated with him regarding the alterations. Welcher eventually relented before testifying that he altered the presentation for the first time on May 13, with the most recent change occurring \"like, 10 minutes ago.\" \"Half of that was in response to objections from the defense,\" Welcher said. \"I had to add all the parts to where everything was. Then, when I got out here, Mr. Brennan asked me to take out references to evidence about statements that I was not allowed to present. So that would have been within the last three days. Then I've modified it a couple of times today based on rulings from the judge.\" BRAIN SURGEON TESTIFIES JOHN O'KEEFE DIED FROM FALL ON FROZEN GROUND IN KAREN READ TRIAL Read lawyer Robert Alessi cross-examines Dr. Judson Welcher during the Karen Read retrial, Wednesday May 28, 2025.(Greg Derr/The Patriot Ledger via AP, Pool) However, Welcher testified on cross-examination that the amendments he made to the presentation did not alter the overall document. \"I changed one slide,\" Welcher said. \"There were 130 slides originally, or something like that. So half of the changes [were] on that day, which was one slide. I added one line to the bottom of the previous slide.\" \"Well then, why did you make it in the middle of trial if it wasn't significant?\" Alessi asked. \"Why didn't you just leave it off and then discuss it in terms of testimony?\" EXPERT WITNESS IN KAREN READ MURDER TRIAL CAUGHT WITH 'ERRORS' INFLATING HIS CREDENTIALS Karen Read, who works with her defense lawyers, attends a \"side bar\" conference with the prosecution and Judge Beverly Cannone at Norfolk Superior Court, Wednesday, May 28, 2025.(Greg Derr/The Patriot Ledger via AP, Pool) \"So it ultimately was left off because it was insignificant, and I didn't need to have it,\" Welcher said. \"The way it got presented was exactly the way it was before May 13. So it didn't change anything.\" On cross-examination, Welcher revealed the district attorney’s office previously agreed to pay Aperture at least $325,000 for the firm’s services, along with covering the cost of the Lexus SUV used in testing. \"We’re keeping [the vehicle] until the trial’s over,\" Welcher said. \"[Then] we’re selling it and charging the commonwealth the difference in the price exactly.\" KAREN READ SCORES MAJOR WIN AS JUDGE ALLOWS CRASH RECONSTRUCTION TESTIMONY Images presented of an accident reconstruction test by Dr. Judson Welcher show impact via paint transfer from an SUV similar to Karen Read's to a human subject at Norfolk Superior Court, Wednesday, May 28, 2025.(Greg Derr/The Patriot Ledger via AP, Pool) Aperture has been paid $44,510 for its services to date, with the state expected to pay upwards of $400,000 for around eight months of work, according to Alessi. \"Dr. Welcher was perfect on direction, but only a B- on cross-examination,\" retired Massachusetts Superior Court Judge and Boston College law professor Jack Lu told Fox News Digital. \"He is not answering the questions from Mr. Alessi directly. He may not be intentionally being evasive, but he’s no longer a near-perfect example of how an expert witness should testify.\" O’Keefe’s arm injuries were concurrent with being struck by the make and model of Read’s vehicle, Welcher testified on direct examination. The crash expert pointed to a video showing him painting the taillight of the car before brushing up against it to mimic a collision. FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X Prosecutor Hank Brennan questions Dr. Judson Welcher during the Karen Read retrial, Wednesday, May 28, 2025.(Greg Derr/The Patriot Ledger via AP, Pool) Alessi looked to create doubt surrounding Welcher’s findings, grilling the biomechanical engineer on the methodology behind his experiment surrounding the cause of the injury to O’Keefe’s eye. \"I’m trying to make it clear,\" Welcher said. \"We don’t know his exact body position at the point of impact, nor do we know the exact position on the ground. Which is part of the reason why I haven’t tried to exactly simulate this, because we don’t have enough parameters to do that. So I don’t have that information. I’m showing the geometry relative to someone of Mr. O’Keefe’s height.\" \"So you don’t have the information to do that properly,\" Alessi said. \"So therefore, you can’t preclude that he had a laceration to the eye from the spoiler by your own answer that you just gave, correct?\" Welcher doubled down on his investigation, asserting on the stand that Aperture’s experiment was correct based on the information the firm had at the time, despite Alessi revealing the vehicle in Welcher’s test was moving only two miles per hour — significantlyless than the speedof Read’s vehicle. SIGN UP TO GETTRUE-CRIME NEWSLETTER \"Would you agree that you did a blue paint test with the vehicle going at two miles per hour?\" Alessi asked. \"Of course,\" Welcher said. \"You didn’t do a blue paint test with the vehicle going at 20 miles per hour, correct?\" Alessi said. \"That is correct,\" Welcher said. \"I was not going to hit myself with the Lexus at 20 miles an hour.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Wednesday marked the second day of testimony from Welcher, as the state is expected to rest its case this week. Readpleaded not guiltyand is facing the possibility of life in prison if convicted of the top charge, second-degree murder. \"The model being followed here is very good and professional,\" Lu said. \"What you have here is a very nice judge meets a very nice lawyer,\" adding, \"This results in a looser, less-focused cross-examination. It’s working out fine here, partially because the witness is not being super evasive.\" Julia Bonavita is a U.S. Writer for Fox News Digital and a Fox Flight Team drone pilot.

Sawmills are working to recycle trees blown down by Hurricane Helene to assist wildland firefighters while boosting domestic timber production.

However, those trees can still hinder firefighting efforts by getting in the way of bulldozers used to create firelines. About 220 acres were burned in a January wildfire in Old Fort, North Carolina four months after Hurricane Helene ripped through the region.(Fox News) \"Those trees are there just blocking the dozers.

    "article_text": "Constitutional law attorney Jonathan Turley discusses the Trump administration stripping funding from Harvard and pausing student visa appointments on 'The Story.' SeniorState Departmentofficials tell Fox News all visa holders associated with Harvard University are being scrutinized, not just student visa holders. Along with student visas, the State Department will be conducting a substantive investigation into B-1, or business visas; B-2, or tourist visas; as well as others, officials said. The investigation is aimed at identifying potential security vulnerabilities or other abuses of the visa system. The probe could impact hundreds of people associated with the elite school and could reveal if people entering with claimed connections truly have real connections or more tenuous connections. TRUMP ADMIN ASKING FEDERAL AGENCIES TO CANCEL REMAINING HARVARD CONTRACTS The State Department will begin scrutinizing all visa holders associated with Harvard University, not just student visa holders.(Blake Nissen for The Boston Globe via Getty Images) Fox News Digital learned earlier in the day that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is eliminating the student visa program at Harvard University due to \"pro-terrorist conduct\" at campus protests. The move is a severe consequence in response to what the DHS claims is Harvard’s refusal to comply with its requests for behavioral records of student visa holders. \"This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,\" DHS SecretaryKristi Noemsaid. \"It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments. Harvard had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing. It refused. They have lost their Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification as a result of their failure to adhere to the law. Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country.\" TRUMP ACCUSES HARVARD OF BEING 'VERY SLOW' TO TURN OVER FOREIGN STUDENT INFO Demonstrators gather on Cambridge Common to protest Harvard's stance on the war in Gaza and show support for the Palestinian people, outside Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, April 25, 2025.(JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images) Harvard may no longer enroll foreign students in the 2025-2026 school year, and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status to reside in the U.S. before the next academic year begins. \"As a result of your brazen refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas rhetoric, and employs racist ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ policies, you have lost this privilege,\" Noem wrote in a letter to Maureen Martin, the university’s director of immigration services. Noem offered Harvard 72 hours to provide the information requested for an opportunity to regain its visa program for the next school year. HARVARD SUES TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OVER TERMINATION OF STUDENT VISA PROGRAM Hundreds of graduates walked out of the 2024 Commencement in Harvard Yard to call attention to the plight of Palestinians.(Craig F. Walker/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) She called the move the \"direct result of Harvard’s epic failure to comply with simple reporting requirements.\" Harvard, meanwhile, asserted the termination was \"unlawful.\" Last month, Harvard announced it would allow foreign students to accept admission to both Harvard and a foreign university as backup amid the Trump administration’s threats to move to block Harvard’s authorization to host them. Typically, students must accept enrollment at Harvard by May 1 and can’t commit to another university. At least a dozen Harvard students have had their authorization to study in the U.S. revoked over campus protest activity. The Trump administration has already frozen close to $3 billion in federal funding to the university, largely dedicated to research, and launched investigations across the departments of Justice, Education and Health and Human Services. They claim that Harvard has failed to address campus antisemitism and eradicate Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in its policies. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Secretary of StateMarco Rubioannounced Wednesday the U.S. will begin \"aggressively\" revoking visas of Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. He also told Congress this week that the State Department had probably revoked \"thousands\" of student visas by this point and would \"proudly\" revoke more. \"We're going to continue to revoke the visas of people who are here as guests and are disrupting our higher education facilities,\" he said Tuesday. \"A visa is a privilege, not a right.\" The crackdown on university policies comes after a wave of pro-Gaza student protests and encampments swept schools across the nation since the beginning of Israel’s offensive campaign to eradicate Hamas after the Oct. 7 attacks to pressure university administrations to divest from Israel.

    "article_text": "The 'Outnumbered' panel reacts to Musk's pledge, questioning how lawmakers in Washington, D.C. are able to amass millions in wealth while working on a government salary. Elon Muskis beginning the process of stepping down from his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The Tesla and SpaceX CEO posted on X on Wednesday night that his time as a special government employee is coming to an end and thankedPresident Donald Trumpfor the opportunity to cut down on wasteful spending. \"The ⁦‪@DOGE‬⁩ mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,\" Musk wrote in his post. The White House confirmed to FOX that Musk's post is accurate and offboarding will begin Wednesday night. Musk has been the public face of DOGE since Trump signed an executive order establishing the office on Jan. 20. DOGE has since ripped through federal government agencies in a quest to identify and end government overspending, corruption and fraud. ELON MUSK SAYS HE 'FULLY ENDORSES' TRUMP AFTER GUNFIRE AT PENNSYLVANIA RALLY Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has officially stepped down from his role helping lead DOGE, which had long been the plan as a special government employee.(Brandon Bell/Getty Images) He was officially hired as a \"special government employee,\" which is a role Congress created in 1962 that allows the executive or legislative branch to hire temporary employees for specific short-term initiatives. Special government employees are permitted to work for the federal government for \"no more than 130 days in a 365-day period,\" according to data from the Office of Government Ethics. Musk's 130-day timeframe, beginning on Inauguration Day, was set to run dry on May 30. DOGE is a temporary cross-departmental organization that was established to slim down and streamline the federal government. The group itself will be dissolved on July 4, 2026, according to Trump's executive order. Musk and Trump have both previously previewed that Musk's role was temporary and would end in the spring. \"You, technically, are a special government employee and you're supposed to be 130 days,\" Fox News' Bret Baier asked Musk during an exclusive interview with Musk andDOGE team membersin April. \"Are you going to continue past that or do you think that's what you're going to do?\" MUSK NOT LEAVING YET, WRAPPING UP WORK ON SCHEDULE ONCE 'INCREDIBLE WORK AT DOGE IS COMPLETE': WHITE HOUSE Elon Musk was hired as a special government employee, which only permits 130 days of employment, when he was chosen to lead DOGE.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) \"I think we will have accomplished most of the work required to reduce the deficit by a trillion dollars within that timeframe,\" Musk responded. Trump hinted at Musk's departure in comments to reporters on March 31 when he was asked if he wants Musk to remain in a government role for longer than the predetermined 130 days. \"I think he's amazing. But I also think he's got a big company to run,\" Trump said in March. \"And so at some point he's going to be going back.\" \"I'd keep him as long as I can keep him,\" Trump said. \"He's a very talented guy. You know, I love very smart people. He's very smart. And he's done a good job,\" the president added. \"DOGE is, we've found numbers that nobody can even believe.\" More recently, Musk said during a Tesla earnings call on April 22 that he will take a step back from his work as DOGE's leader. DOGE CHAIN OF COMMAND REVEALED IN COURT FILING, SHOWING MUSK IS NOT THE BOSS \"I think starting probably in next month, May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk said during Tesla’s earnings conference call. \"I’ll have to continue doing it for, I think, the remainder of the president’s term just to make sure the waste and fraud that we stopped does not come roaring back, which it will do if it has the chance. So I think I’ll continue to spend, you know, a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it is useful.\" Elon Musk jumps on state as he joins former president Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.(JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) \"But starting next month,\" he added, \"I’ll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is done.\" Amid Musk's work with DOGE, Democrats and activists have staged protests against the tech billionaire and his companies, including working to tank Tesla stocks. Musk has been the public face ofDOGE for months, but is not an employee of the United States DOGE Service and does not report to the acting DOGE chief, according to a court filing in March that shed additional light on the internal workings of the office. WHO IS DOGE'S NEWLY IDENTIFIED ADMINISTRATOR AMY GLEASON? 'WORLD-CLASS TALENT' \"Elon Musk does not work at USDS. I do not report to him, and he does not report to me. To my knowledge, he is a Senior Advisor to the White House,\" Amy Gleason, the acting administrator of DOGE, wrote in a declaration included in a court filing. President Trump has spoken highly of Elon Musk's work with DOGE since he was chosen to lead the new agency on Jan. 20.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Gleason previously worked for the United States Digital Service, which was founded in 2014 by former President Barack Obama as a technology office within the Executive Office of the President. Trump signed an executive order in January that renamed the office to the United States DOGE Service, establishing DOGE. Though Musk has been the public face of DOGE, he \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself\" and is working as a senior advisor to the president, a White House official said in a separate court filing back in February.

    "article_text": "FBI Director Kash Patel discusses stopping fentanyl, his new perspective in leading the FBI, the alleged presence of FBI sources around the Capitol on January 6, and the Epstein files on 'Special Report.' Various conspiracy theories continue to swirl aroundJanuary 6 Capitol Hill riotsmore than four years later, but FBI director Kash Patel promised a \"definitive answer\" to one of the most pressing questions about the nation-shattering event is \"coming.\" \"People have had questions about January 6th and whether or not there were FBI sources – not agents, sources – on the ground during January 6. And I told you I would get you the definitive answer to that. And we have, and we are in the process again of working with our partners to divulge that information, and it is coming,\" Patel said during a\"Special Report\"exclusive interview Wednesday. Patel added the answer may \"surprise and shock people because of what past FBI leaders have said about it.\" TOP FIVE TAKEDOWNS: KASH PATEL'S FBI HITS THE GROUND RUNNING WITH MAJOR EARLY VICTORIES Last year, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz released his highly anticipatedreport on the FBI’s Handlingof its Confidential Human Sources and Intelligence Collection Efforts in the Lead Up to the Jan. 6, 2021 Electoral Certification. According to the report, there were a total of 26 confidential human sources in the crowd outside theCapitol on Jan. 6, 2021,but only three of them were assigned by the FBI to be there. The report stressed that none of the sources were authorized or directed by the bureau to \"break the law\" or \"encourage others to commit illegal acts.\" One of the three confidential human sources tasked by the FBI to attend the rally entered the Capitol building, while the other two entered the restricted area around the Capitol. If a confidential human source is directed to be at a certain event, they are paid by the FBI for their time. FBI'S TOP BOSS KASH PATEL SAYS BUREAU RAN COVER FOR HILLARY BUT IT ALL ENDS UNDER TRUMP Patel told Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier the information from the DOJ IG report is \"definitely a piece of the truth.\" Former FBI Director Christopher Wrayhad testified before Congress prior to this report being released in December 2024, but Patel called out Wray for deflecting and giving a \"D.C. answer\" when pressed by lawmakers. \"Why it took a ton of time and questioning in Congress for the director to get that point is what I'm trying to eliminate from the FBI. If Congress asks you a question under oath, whether or not there were sources in [or] around January 6th at the Capitol, you as the director of the FBI need to know that and not deflect and give a D.C. answer. You have to be prepared for that,\" Patel said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP After taking the helm of the nation's top investigative agency, Patel has made transparency and restoring trust in the bureau a top priority. Part of achieving this goal, he said, is to give Americans the answers they \"deserve.\" Patel told Baier that there are \"answers coming\" in a number of other investigations, including the mystery surrounding pipe bombs placed outside the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee offices on the eve of the January 6 riot,the cocaine found in the White House during Biden's presidency, and the FBI’s investigation into alleged Trump-Russia connections in the aftermath of the 2016 election, best known as \"Crossfire Hurricane.\" Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman, Breanne Deppisch, Jake Gibson, David Spunt and BIll Mears contributed to this report.

Duffytold FOX 5 DCthat officials are implementing AI to \"identify and address potential air traffic risks nationwide,\" potentially aiding in preventing tragedies like the fatal Jan. 29 midair collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) that claimed the lives of 67 people. Following the Potomac River crash, which involved acommercial planeand an Army Black Hawk helicopter, Duffy announced a plan to build a new \"state-of-the-art\" traffic control system that will equip locations with better technology to reduce outages, improve efficiency and reinforce safety.

    "article_text": "Dr. Mahsa Tehrani unpacks the risk of COVID-19 in children and pregnant women on 'America Reports.' PresidentDonald Trump'sDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) is terminating awards totaling more than $750 million dollars that were provided to pharmaceutical manufacturer Moderna to help facilitate its production of mRNA-based bird flu vaccines. During President Joe Biden's final week in office, his administration awarded $590 million to Moderna to help speed up its production of mRNA-based vaccines. The $590 million award followed a separate $176 million award Biden gave to Moderna earlier last year for mRNAvaccine technology. Messenger RNA vaccines are a newer type of vaccine technology, which was utilized by companies like Moderna and Pfizer to develop their COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccine technology was at the center of a lot of criticism amid the coronavirus pandemic for potentially being associated with adverse side effects in some people who took them, such as myocarditis. MILITARY SPOUSE AND MOM OF 5 FIGHTS BACK AS VACCINE DISPUTE BLOCKS FAMILY'S PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION A man receives his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, Wednesday, Aug. 25, 2021, during a vaccination clinic at the Longs Peak Student Center at Front Range Community College in Fort Collins.(Jon Austria/The Coloradoan/USA TODAY NETWORK) Trump administration officials previously hinted at the potential that this funding could be terminated, citing a lack of oversight during the Biden administration pertaining to vaccine production. \"After a rigorous review, we concluded that continued investment in Moderna’s H5N1 mRNA vaccine was not scientifically or ethically justifiable,\" HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said. \"This is not simply about efficacy — it’s about safety, integrity, and trust. The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public.\" Protesters opposed to Covid-19 vaccine mandates and vaccine passports by the government rally at City Hall in New York City on August 25, 2021.(Angela Weiss/AFP) TRUMP FDA OVERHAULS COVID-19 VACCINE APPROVAL TO FOCUS ON OLDER POPULATIONS, HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS The announcement reflects a larger shift in federal vaccine priorities, after HHS SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.announced earlier this week that COVID-19 vaccineswould be removedfrom the federal government's list of recommended vaccines for children and pregnant women. Meanwhile,a report from Senate Republicansreleased earlier this month suggested the Biden administration withheld critical safety data and downplayed known risks tied to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. In particular, the Senate report focuses on HHS’ awareness of, and response to, cases of myocarditis — a type of heart inflammation — following COVID-19 vaccination. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced earlier this week that the federal government would be removing the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine from the list of federally recommended vaccines for kids and pregnant women.(Getty Images/Fox News) \"Rather than provide the public and health care providers with immediate and transparent information regarding the risk of myocarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, theBiden administrationwaited until late June 2021 to announce changes to the labels for the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines based on the ‘suggested increased risks’ of myocarditis and pericarditis,\" the Senate report states. \"Even though CDC and FDA officials were well aware of the risk of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination, the Biden administration opted to withhold issuing a formal warning to the public for months about the safety concerns, jeopardizing the health of young Americans.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In response to the Trump administration's funding termination,Moderna put outa press release acknowledging the move, but also touting the \"safety profile\" observed amid its work on a new mRNA bird flu vaccine. \"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program,\" said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. \"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats.\" Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman contributed to this report.",

    "article_text": "CNN host Abby Phillip spoke to a panel about the Democratic Party's efforts to regain working-class male voters, warning that mere changes in rhetoric to appear \"authentic\" are not enough, but must come with major change in policy. CNN host Abby Phillip warned that if Democrats want to win back voters, they will need to risk offending their consultant class base with concrete policy changes. Since their historic defeat in November, the Democratic Party remains divided about how to move forward. While some Democrats are doubling down on the far-left politics many argue alienated voters, others are calling to abandon so-called \"woke\" politics. But as the party remains in flux, a rising tide of commentators are challenging such Democrats to actually articulate which far-left policies they will kick to the curb in order toregain the working-class votersthey lost. On Tuesday evening, a panel on CNN discussed The New York Times’ report claiming that Democrats arespending $20 millionon a study called \"Speaking with American Men: A Strategic Plan.\" The study is purportedly a project to \"study the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality in these spaces\" of male voters. The panel spoke about how Democrats lack their ownequivalent of podcaster Joe Rogan,and how he gradually went from a nonpolitical figure to becoming prominent in the \"MAGA universe.\" CNN media correspondent Hadas Gold said one idea she has seen pitched is a \"sleeper\" podcast, \"where they just they help fund the podcasters, let them do whatever they want, really build up that base, it has nothing to do with politics, and then in a few years, sort of seep into politics,\" she said, \"just like Joe Rogan.\" CNN host Abby Phillip warned that Democrats need to actually take a position on how they will reform their party to regain the voters they alienated.(CNN) DEMOCRATIC PARTY SCRAMBLES TO FIX IMAGE AS MEMBERS ACKNOWLEDGE PARTY 'LOST CREDIBILITY' However, she argued, such an idea probably wouldn’t work. \"The only way that that works is through authenticity, and you‘re not going to make it work by building up these funds and, in any way, being connected to a political party, because the political parties, especially Democrats right now, don’t exactly have a good brand people want to be attached to,\" she said. When Gold praised Arizona DemocraticSen. Ruben Gallegofor appealing to authenticity in his rhetorical style, Phillip responded that Democrats need actual substance to their reform. \"Okay, but here‘s the thing. They‘re going to have to — you alluded to this,\" Phillip said as she pointed to former Biden White House official Dan Koh, who called to take positions that may offend parts of the party. \"They‘re going to have to get rid of some sacred cows. This is going to be the hard part. Everybody talks about authenticity until the rubber meets the road, and they have to actually take positions that the activist, you know, consultant class base does not want them to take.\" Podcaster and comedian Joe Rogan has frequently mocked Democrats for scrambling to try to create their own Joe Rogan, noting he himself was once on their side before they embraced so many far-left policies.((Photo by Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)) CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"I don‘t think they will,\" CNN commentator Shermichael Singleton said. \"I mean, for Democrats to effectively target men of every color, they are going to have to drastically change some of their positions, especially some of the cultural stuff. I don’t think that’s going to happen, Dan. I think you guys have moved so far to the left, many — I know you’re from the South, Dan, you seem to be more reasonable than most, but for the most part, a lot of you guys don‘t make room for guys to express their views in an open way about a lot of issues.\" When Koh was asked what he would do to change the party, he proposed doing a better job of enforcing the border and supporting upward mobility, saying, \"These positions aren‘t popular with a lot of the party, but it‘s what people are — to the point of putting people where they are, it‘s where people are, and it‘s where we need to be as well.\" Then-Arizona Democratic Senate candidate U.S. Rep.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on U.S. Senate efforts to pass President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' on 'Special Report.' The largest police union in the country has issued an endorsement of key provisions of the PresidentDonald Trump-backed \"big, beautiful\" budget bill. National Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) President Patrick Yoes announced strong support for the bill on Wednesday evening, saying \"the‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’is more than legislation—it is a promise kept to the public safety officers across the country and a bold step toward an economy that respects, rewards, and uplifts the people who keep it safe.\" Yoes expressed strong support for two provisions in the bill, a tax deduction for overtime pay and an increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deductions, which the FOP said are important to the rank-and-file members of the 377,000-member organization. The FOP president praised the leadership of Trump and House SpeakerMike Johnsonfor passing the bill in Congress. DUFFY URGES SENATE TO PASS BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL'S $12.5B AIR TRAFFIC SYSTEM FIX US President Donald Trump and National President of the Fraternal Order of Police Patrick Yoes speak during a \"Make America Great Again\" campaign rally at Harrisburg international airport in Middletown, Pensylvania on September 26, 2020. (Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)(Getty images) The billpassed the Houseafter an all-night debate last week in which Republicans squeezed out a victory in a 215-214 vote. The bill now faces significant opposition from Democrats and some Republicans in the Senate. \"President Trump first proposed the elimination of Federal income taxes on overtime while still a candidate, and we are very pleased that a similar provision is included in the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,’\" Yoes said. Regarding the bill’s increase in SALT deductions, the FOP praised portions of the big, beautiful bill that would create a tax deduction for income taxes on overtime earnings for those who earn less than $160,000 per year as well as increase the SALT deduction to $40,000 for all taxpayers earning less than $500,000 per year. SALT deduction caps primarily benefit people living in high-cost-of-living areas like New York City, Los Angeles, and their surrounding areas. Republicans representing those areas have framed raising the SALT deduction cap as an existential issue, arguing that a failure to address it could cost the GOP the House majority in the 2026 midterms. BLUE STATE REPUBLICANS THREATEN MUTINY OVER STATE AND LOCAL TAXES IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' Former Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Raymond Chan was convicted Wednesday of racketeering, bribery, fraud and giving false statements to investigators.(iStock) Meanwhile, Republicans representing lower-tax states are largely wary of raising the deduction cap, believing that it incentivizes blue states’high-tax policies. Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., told Fox News that he is hopeful the Senate would address the SALT deductions, positing that the provision would add $385 billion to U.S. deficit spending. Yoes, however, said \"the current cap on SALT deductions uniquely and unfairly penalizes law enforcement officers, who often are required to live within a certain distance of the jurisdictions they serve—removing a valuable mechanism that allowed for a reduction in their cost of living.\" SPEAKER JOHNSON REACHES TENTATIVE DEAL WITH BLUE STATE REPUBLICANS TO BOOST CAP ON ‘SALT’ DEDUCTION Patrick Yoes, National President of the Fraternal Order of Police, speaks to a crowd in Washington, D.C., on August 8, 2022(Fox News Digital/Stephanie Pagones) He said the SALT deduction is also \"a valuable way of supporting local budgets as law enforcement agencies are facing an array of financial challenges associated with inflated costs of equipment, vehicles, and personnel, especially with respect to the ongoing recruitment and retention crisis.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"These are critical provisions to ensure those in the law enforcement profession have a better quality of life,\" said Yoes. \"We appreciate that President Trump is always fighting for our nation’s law enforcement officers.\" Peter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.",

    "title": "Lightspeed backs Indian home services startup Snabbit as the next big consumer trend",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Home services in India — whether it is cleaning, dishwashing, or laundry — have traditionally been offline and informally run. This has often resulted in delays and uncertainties for consumers, as well as inconsistent pay and job insecurity for workers. Recently, however, startups havebegun viewing this area as ripe for transformation, leveraging technology to bring predictability, scalability, and structure to the space. Snabbit, founded last year, is one of the early movers in this arena, enabling customers to book high-frequency home services, including cleaning, dishwashing, laundry, and kitchen preparation, through its app, with delivery as fast as 10 minutes. The startup has now raised $19 million in a Series B round led by Lightspeed, with participation from its existing investors Elevation Capital and Nexus Venture Partners, at a post-money valuation of $80 million to expand its presence. The 15-month-old startup launched its quick-service platform in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the country’s financial capital, after founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal personally experienced the challenges of finding reliable home services. At one point, Agarwal told TechCrunch, the situation became so difficult that his mother had to fly in from the eastern Indian city of Kolkata to help him find a new domestic worker. “What stayed with me was that in a world of convenience where you can press a button, and you’ll get a cab, or you’ll get food or groceries, you can even get someone to go out on a date with, but finding someone for a simple service at home was excruciatingly difficult,” he said in an interview. The startup ran experiments early last year and remained in one micro market in Mumbai for the first 12 months before expanding to seven markets in the city and one in Bengaluru. Snabbit took a “full-stack approach” to sourcing, screening, training, onboarding, and managing workers, who the startup calls “experts.” Once Snabbit signs them, it has the workers move close to the startup’s demand centers so they can fulfill the company’s promise to provide service in 10 minutes. Snabbit is not alone in this race, as incumbentUrban Company(backed by storied investors, including Accel, Prosus, and Tiger Global)started a similar experienceon its app earlier this year. However, the company faced criticism due to the initial message it conveyed and the name Insta Maids, which it later corrected and renamed to Insta Help. This did not help convince many, including gig worker unions, though. Similarly, newer entrants, includingBroomeesandPronto, have also joined the arena recently. The latter even recently attracted Bain Capital Ventures for its seed funding. “We know that the market is heating up,” he said. “The category is getting exciting, new players are coming in and getting funded. And I think all of it is great for us as long as we keep executing relentlessly.” The startup charges customers between ₹169 (about $2) and ₹499 (nearly $6) to avail services of up to 240 minutes. The pricing is higher than that of Urban Company’s Insta Help, which starts at ₹49 (50 cents). However, Agarwal said the startup continued to grow and scale even after Urban Company’s foray into the market. Agarwal hopes to compete with a consistent customer experience using its in-house tech stack that includes an internal CRM tool, a sourcing and screening pipeline, and an eKYC process to better comply with local regulations. Snabbit currently has over 600 workers on its platform, and each of them covers a median walking distance of 300 meters between two jobs. It has also partnered with the mobility startup Yulu to train and provide e-bikes to its women workers, covering a larger median distance of 800 meters between their jobs. Moreover, Agarwal told TechCrunch that the startup will reduce the median distance for its workers as it scales. The average ticket size on Snabbit’s platform is between ₹250 and ₹270 (about $3), while its workers completing a 12-hour shift earn “upward” of ₹40,000 ($470) a month. For completing four hours a day on the platform, the workers get over ₹10,000 ($120) a month, Agarwal said, adding that workers are also eligible for bonuses. Agarwal contends that workers can earn more than the roughly ₹9,000 ($100) that domestic helpers in urban locations are typically paid in the country,per the International Domestic Workers Federation (PDF). Snabbit also provides personal life insurance, health insurance, and accidental insurance to all its workers, as well as family insurance to those who have been with the startup for some time. Workplace abuse has also beenquite prevalent for domestic workers in India, as the countrypredominantly lacks protective laws. For such cases, the startup provides an SOS feature on its app that workers can use to call a field operations team, which reaches the location within “five to seven minutes” to help workers in edge situations, the founder said. Over the last four months, Agarwal stated the startup grew 5x and is currently growing around 20% week-over-week. It plans to expand to over 200 micro markets across metro cities in India within the next nine months by utilizing the fresh capital and hire more employees in its workforce that has nearly 100 people. That said, several hyperlocal consumer apps have been tried and failed repeatedly. For instance, food deliveries imploded globally in 2023 after the pandemic-led lockdowns eased, but they started facing challenges in the last few months. Even in India, instant food delivery models introduced by quick commerce platforms, includingZeptoandZomato, have struggled. The formerpaused its 10-minute cafe services due to supply constraints, while the latterhalted its 15-minute food delivery servicejust four months after launch, citing “no incrementality in demand.” The cost of acquiring customers and providing suppliers in their location is expensive and often hard to pay over time. In Snabbit’s case, TechCrunch has learned that the customer acquisition cost is ₹700 ($8), while its average ticket size is about $3. The startup has onboarded over 25,000 customers so far, and an average customer transacts on the platform at least three times a month, per Agarwal. “Our retention rates are as good as any consumer internet company, say, a Zepto or Swiggy, would be having,” the executive said. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how the startup can retain its customers over time and beat the competition while continuing to scale and expand its market in India. “Snabbit is transforming home services in India by bringing speed, structure, and trust to a sector that has largely operated informally until now,” said Rahul Taneja, a partner at Lightspeed, in a prepared statement. “We are excited to join them on this journey and support their mission to transform and scale what was once considered a luxury into a day-to-day necessity.” Topics Reporter LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

    "title": "Elon Musk leaves White House but says Doge will continue",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk has said he is leaving the Trump administration after helping lead a tumultuous drive to shrink the size of US government that saw thousands of federal jobs axed. In a post on his social media platform X, the world's richest man thanked Trump for the opportunity to help run the Department of Government Efficiency, known as Doge. The White House began \"offboarding\" Musk as a special government employee on Wednesday night, the BBC understands. His role was temporary and his exit is not unexpected, but it comes a day after Musk criticised the legislative centrepiece of Trump's agenda. \"As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\" Musk wrote on X. \"The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\" The South African-born tech tycoon had been designated as a \"special government employee\" - allowing him to work a federal job for 130 days each year. Measured from Trump's inauguration on 20 January, he would hit that limit towards the end of May. But his departure comes a day after he said he was \"disappointed\" with Trump's budget bill, which proposes multi-trillion dollar tax breaks and a boost to defence spending. The SpaceX and Tesla boss said in an interview with BBC's US partner CBS that the \"big, beautiful bill\", as Trump calls it, would increase the federal deficit. Musk also said he thought it \"undermines the work\" of Doge. \"I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,\" Musk said. \"But I don't know if it could be both.\" Musk, who had clashed in private with some Trump cabinet-level officials, initially pledged to cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the federal government budget, before halving this target, then reducing it to $150bn. An estimated 260,000 out of the 2.3 million-strong federal civilian workforce have had their jobs cut or accepted redundancy deals as a result of Doge. In some cases, federal judges blocked the mass firings and ordered terminated employees to be reinstated. The rapid-fire approach to cutting the federal workforce occasionally led to some workers mistakenly being let go, including staff at the US nuclear programme. Musk announced in late April that he would step back to run his companies again after becoming a lightning rod for criticism of Trump's efforts to shake up Washington. \"Doge is just becoming the whipping boy for everything,\" Musk told the Washington Post in Texas on Tuesday ahead of a Space X launch. \"Something bad would happen anywhere, and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it.\" Musk's time in government overlapped with a significant decline in sales at his electric car company. Tesla sales dropped by 13% in the first three months of this year, the largest drop in deliveries in its history. The company's stock price also tumbled by as much as 45%, but has mostly rebounded and is only down 10%. Tesla recently warned investors that the financial pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying \"changing political sentiment\" could meaningfully hurt demand for the vehicles. Musk told investors on an earnings call last month that the time he allocates to Doge \"will drop significantly\" and that he would be \"allocating far more of my time to Tesla\". Activists have called for Tesla boycotts, staging protests outside Tesla dealerships, and vandalising the vehicles and charging stations. The Tesla blowback became so violent and widespread that US Attorney General Pam Bondi warned her office would treat acts of vandalism as \"domestic terrorism\". Speaking at an economic forum in Doha, Qatar, on Tuesday, Musk said he was committed to being the leader of Tesla for the next five years. He said earlier this month he would cut back his political donations after spending nearly $300m to back Trump's presidential campaign and other Republicans last year. Tariffs are a key part of the US president's political vision but economists fear a global trade war. Migrant Araceli and her family hoped Canada offered safety from President Trump's immigration crackdown, but claiming asylum proved a challenge. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the move will include \"those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields\". The US president's remarks on Wednesday come as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukraine. The BBC's Nomia Iqbal spoke to students at Harvard University, which is the target of funding cuts and a ban on international student enrollment.",

    "title": "Gaza warehouse broken into by 'hordes of hungry people', says WFP",
    "article_text": "The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) says that \"hordes of hungry people\" have broken into a food supply warehouse in central Gaza. Two people are reported to have died and several others injured in the incident, the programme said, adding that it was still confirming details. Video footage from AFP news agency showed crowds breaking into the Al-Ghafari warehouse in Deir Al-Balah and taking bags of flour and cartons of food as gunshots rang out. It was not immediately clear where the gunshots came from. In a statement, the WFP said humanitarian needs in Gaza had \"spiralled out of control\" after an almost three-month Israeli blockade that was eased last week. The WFP said that food supplies had been pre-positioned at the warehouse for distribution. The programme added: \"Gaza needs an immediate scale-up of food assistance. This is the only way to reassure people that they will not starve.\" The WFP said it had \"consistently warned of alarming and deteriorating conditions on the ground, and the risks imposed by limiting humanitarian aid to hungry people in desperate need of assistance\". Israeli authorities said on Wednesday that 121 trucks belonging to the UN and the international community carrying humanitarian aid including flour and food were transferred into Gaza. Israel began to allow a limited amount of aid into Gaza last week. However, UN Middle East envoy Sigrid Kaag told the UN Security Council this was \"comparable to a lifeboat after the ship has sunk\" when everyone in Gaza was facing the risk of famine. A controversial US and Israeli-backed group - the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) - was also established as a private aid distribution system. It uses US security contractors and bypasses the UN, which said it was unworkable and unethical. The US and Israeli governments say the GHF, which has set up four distribution centres in southern and central Gaza, is preventing aid from being stolen by Hamas, which the armed group denies doing. The UN Humans Right Office said 47 people were injured on Tuesday after people overran one of the GHF distribution sitesin the southern city of Rafah, a day after it began working there. Another senior UN official told journalists on Wednesday that desperate crowds were looting cargo off of UN aid trucks. Jonathan Whittall, the head of the UN's humanitarian office for the occupied Palestinian territories, also said there was no evidence that Hamas was diverting aid coordinated through credible humanitarian channels. He said the real theft of relief goods since the beginning of the war had been carried out by criminal gangs which the Israeli army \"allowed to operate in proximity to the Kerem Shalom crossing point in Gaza\". The UN has argued that a surge of aid like the one during the recent ceasefire between Israeli and Hamas would reduce the threat of looting by hungry people and allow it to make full use of its well-established network of distribution across the Gaza Strip.

    "title": "Starmer to liken Farage to Truss in policy attack",
    "article_text": "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has accused Nigel Farage of \"fantasy\" economics after the Reform UK leader set out a number of policies earlier this week. In a speech later this morning, Sir Keir is expected to liken Farage to former PM Liz Truss and say that Reform's policies would lead to an increase in mortgage costs. Reform made big gains in the English local elections earlier this month, cementing it as a prime challenger to Britain's traditional main parties. A spokesperson for Reform dismissed the prime minister's comments as a \"desperate attack\" from a party \"behind in the polls\". Speaking at a business in the north-west of England later, Sir Keir, 62, will accuse the Reform leader of pledging unfunded tax cuts which, he will warn, could spark an economic meltdown. \"In opposition we said Liz Truss would crash the economy and leave you to pick up the bill,\" he is expected to say. \"We were right. And we were elected to fix that mess. \"Now in government, we are once again fighting the same fantasy – this time from Nigel Farage. \"Farage is making the exact same bet Liz Truss did. That you can spend tens of billions on tax cuts without a proper way of paying for it. And just like Truss, he is using your family finances, your mortgage, your bills as a gambling chip on his mad experiment. The result will be the same.\" Thursday's speech is further evidence that right now the prime minister sees Farage as his principal political adversary. On Tuesday, Faragepledged more generous benefits for pensioners and parents– but it was a commitment to raising the threshold at which someone starts to pay income tax from £12,570 to £20,000 that had some economists questioning whether his sums added up. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the policy could cost between £50bn and £80bn a year – and that Reform had not spelled out how they would raise the cash. \"Of course they don't have to do that yet – we're not at a general election,\" said IFS economist Stuart Adam. \"But at some point, if they're going to be a party of government, they would have to make those numbers add up.\" In Farage's speech, the former Ukip leader, 61, said the Conservatives had become an \"irrelevance\", adding: \"They've had a good 200 years.\" The local elections saw Reform make big gains at the expense of both Labour and the Conservatives – winning one by-election and two mayoral races, as well as gaining 677 new councillors. The party won most votes, most seats and overall control of most councils. But,as politics professor Sir John Curtice highlighted,the party's share of the votes across all councils where elections took place was no more than 31% – so despite doing well, it secured far from a majority of those voting. A Reform spokesman said: \"We will take no economic lectures from Keir Starmer. \"Labour's manifesto promised £10bn per year of increased spending. \"Their first budget raised spending by £70bn and they have added another £30bn since then for Chagos.\" The prime minister faces pressure from his own MPs on government spending decisions, including cuts to disability benefits. Farage also said he would scrap the two-child benefit limit, which some Labour MPs also want to see abolished. The cap prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. The new mayor of Hull and East Yorkshire pledges to put the region ahead of party politics. Two by-elections will be held in July for wards on North Tyneside Council. The Bus Services Bill will give local areas more power to improve public transport, Labour says. Reform leader backs lifting the two-child benefit cap and introducing more generous tax breaks for married people. After Reform UK's council leadership scrapped the designated flooding committee, what will the impact be for Lincolnshire?",

    "title": "Tears and heartbreak over tragic story of South African girl sold by her mother",
    "article_text": "A video clip of a laughing Joshlin Smith, who was six years old when she went missing more than a year ago in South Africa, left most people in the courtroom sobbing. It was shown during a hearing in Saldanha Bay, near Cape Town, ahead of the sentencing of Joshlin's mother - a drug addict who is believed to have sold her for money. Racquel Smith, also known as Kelly Smith, was convicted of kidnapping and trafficking her daughter earlier this month. The 35-year-old mother of three was found guilty along with her boyfriend Jacquen Appollis and their friend Steveno van Rhyn. Even the court interpreter could not hold back her tears as she translated the victim impact statements into English. A court official read out those statements first in Afrikaans, the language spoken by those in the impoverished Middelpos informal settlement of Saldanha Bay, where Joshlin had lived. In their own words, Joshlin's grandmother, the family friend who had wanted to adopt Joshlin and her teacher spoke of their pain and bewilderment about how she could have been sold by her mother. One witness during the trial had alleged this was to a traditional healer, known in South Africa as a \"sangoma\", who wanted Joshlin for \"her eyes and skin\". A local pastor also testified that he had once heard Smith talk of selling her children for 20,000 rand ($1,100; £850) each, but would have been willing to accept a lower figure of $275. \"How do you sleep [and] live with yourself?\" a devastated Amanda Smith-Daniels, who is looking after her other two grandchildren, asked her daughter in her victim statement on Wednesday. Smith and her co-accused refused to take the stand during the six-week trial that began in March and was held at a community centre in Saldanha to allow the wider community to attend proceedings. But as Joshlin's mother heard the statements on Wednesday and saw the video clip, she sobbed uncontrollably. Joshlin's teacher, Edna Maart, described the little girl as a quiet pupil who was \"very tidy\". She said she struggled with daily questions from Joshlin's schoolmates about her whereabouts. Determined not to forget her, she said the class listened to her favourite gospel song God Will Work It Out at the start of every school day. It was also played to a teary courtroom on Wednesday. To this day no-one knows what has happened to Joshlin. Her disappearance on 19 February 2024 caused shockwaves across the country. Bianca van Aswegen, a criminologist and national co-ordinator at Missing Children South Africa, likened it to the case ofMadeleine McCann, a British girl who went missing in Portugal in 2007. Madeleine was aged three when she vanished from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve - and hers is one of the most high-profile, unsolved missing person cases in the world. Ms Van Aswegen told the BBC that while the trio's conviction in Joshlin's case had given people a sense of relief, \"the matter of fact is that nobody knows where Joshlin is and I think that's the big question that South Africa is still asking\". A picture of Joshlin's troubled life emerged during the trial - and a better sense of her personality during this week's hearings ahead of sentencing. She was born in October 2017, to Smith and her former partner Jose Emke, who broke down on Wednesday and had to be carried out of the courtroom. Their second child - she and her older brother, now 11, had both suffered from neglect, according to a social worker who testified during the trial. Growing up, Kelly Smith had lived with her maternal grandmother and had struggled with substance abuse since she was 15 - often becoming abusive towards her and her children when she was high, social workers said. A report prepared by a social worker for the sentencing hearing paints a stark picture of Smith's drug addiction at the time of Joshlin's birth. Her grandmother had kicked Smith out of the family home because of her drug use and she had threatened to stab her own son at that time. The judge noted that it took Smith five months to register Joshlin's birth - by law this must be done within 30 days - and had lived intermittently at a shelter for abused women. When she went into rehab later on, family friend Natasha Andrews stepped in to care for Joshlin - and she and her husband had wanted to adopt her. \"We could have provided for her better than her mother,\" Ms Andrews said during the trial, but the plans fell apart in 2018 as the parents \"wouldn't agree\" to it. Despite this, Joshlin often visited the Andrews family for weekends and school holidays and would go on trips with them. The clip shown in court on Wednesday of Joshlin laughing was from one of those holidays and formed part of Ms Andrews' victim statement. She shared this and other photos of Joshlin playing with her own daughter because \"so many people… don't know what Joshlin sounds like\", she said. It was this and her description of her family's pain that sparked the greatest outpouring of emotion in the courtroom. Joshlin grew up in a corrugated iron structure located in Middelpos informal settlement with her mother, her mother's partner, her brother and younger half-sister. The social workers' report described the shack as offering \"little in the way of privacy due to its highly restrictive living space\". Smith did odd jobs to support her family, including part-time domestic work for Kelly Zeegers, who lived with her family in a nearby neighbourhood and paid her with groceries instead of cash. \"This is to make sure that she and the children have a plate of food,\" Ms Zeegers said during her testimony. Some witnesses did describe Smith as a good mother; her sister told the court Joshlin was the spitting image of her mum when she was young. The little that is known of what happened to Joshlin on the day she disappeared is thanks to Laurentia Lombaard, who turned state witness. She had been at the shack smoking drugs with Appollis and Van Rhyn at the time. She explained that Joshlin, who had started school a few weeks before her disappearance, and her brother had stayed at home that day because they did not have clean uniforms. The children had been mainly left in the care of Appollis as Smith was in and out during course of the day, occasionally returning to smoke. It is not clear exactly how or when Joshlin went missing but the trial established it was some time during the afternoon - but the preoccupation of most of the adults meant the disappearance was only reported to the police at 21:00. The social worker appointed to compile the report on the trio ahead of their sentencing described Smith as \"manipulative\" and someone who told \"bald-faced lies\". \"It is therefore not a stretch to conclude that Smith is the mastermind behind the trafficking of her own daughter,\" he said. Ms Van Aswegen said she hoped the trio would be given \"a proper sentence\" that reflected a growing crisis in child trafficking. \"It is much more of a crisis than police stats actually show us due to the fact of many cases going unreported,\" she told the BBC. She said what was unusual in Joshlin's case was that it had captured the whole nation. \"I have never really seen a case blow up like this in South Africa before [and] neither have we seen such a big search for a missing child. I think social media played a big role [and] we had political parties get involved in the case.\" According to South African news site IOL, 632 children were reported missing last year and 8,743 over the past 10 years. Earlier this month, police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said many children were eventually reunited with their families. Ms Van Aswegen said this showed that one could never give up hope and the search for Joshlin would continue. This hope was reflected most by the Andrews family during the sentencing hearing. A poem written by Ms Andrews' 14-year-old daughter Tayla was also read out in court.  It described her pain of not knowing what had happened to Joshlin and her hope that she was safe. \"We just want to hug you again,\" Ms Andrews' said in her statement. \"You are our flower, our baby and our green-eyed child.\" Go toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.

    "article_text": "Police have been given extra time to question a man arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a car ploughed into football fans during Liverpool's Premier League victory parade on Monday. Speculation over the unnamed suspect's identity makes several front pages. The Guardian says football fans who were at the paradehave criticised the traffic control measuresin place at the time. Officials say procedures were in operation, including rolling road closures and hostile vehicle measures.

    "title": "Fleeing US deportations, it took this family three tries to enter Canada",
    "article_text": "The Rainbow Bridge, which crosses the Niagara River between the United States and Canada, has for decades been a symbol of peace connecting two countries. But for Araceli, a Salvadorian migrant, and her family, the bridge represented a seemingly insurmountable hurdle. Along with her partner and two daughters, aged four and 14, the family first attempted to cross the bridge on 17 March. They had arrived with a suitcase and documents that they believed assured them they would soon be reunited with Araceli's siblings on Canadian soil and escape the threat of US President Donald Trump's mass deportations. But the plan failed. Not just once, but twice. While a third attempt proved successful, immigration experts and official statistics point to a rise of asylum seekers at the border fleeing not just their homelands, but President Trump's immigration policies. Araceli and her family had been living illegally in the US for more than a decade – only her youngest daughter, who was born in New Jersey, has a US passport. In the US, Araceli built a life for herself and tried to initiate an asylum application process, but was unsuccessful. \"They charged me money and told me I would get a work permit. I paid that to a lawyer, but they never gave me an answer as to whether it was approved or not,\" she told BBC Mundo from a migrant shelter near the US-Canada border. Araceli has 12 siblings, and like her, several left El Salvador due to safety concerns in the rural community where they grew up. Two of them managed to start from scratch in Canada. After President Trump's inauguration, amid reports of mass raids and deportations, Araceli began to fear for her and her family's safety – especially after the administration began sending illegal migrants to a notorious Salvadorian prison. But because both Canada and the US have signed onto the \"safe third country agreement,\" migrants, like Araceli, who have been denied refuge in one country are not supposed to be granted asylum in the other. The agreement states that asylum seekers must apply for asylum in the first country where they land. There are exceptions. One of them is if the asylum seeker arriving from the US can prove they have a close relative in Canada who meets certain requirements, they can enter the country and begin their refugee claim again. So Araceli and her family said goodbye to the life they had built in the US to join her two brothers in Canada. After crossing the Rainbow Bridge, they arrived at the border check point to make their asylum claim. She said she had all the original documents proving her relationship to her brother. \"They took everything, even our backpack, and we were left with nothing,\" They spent the entire night in a waiting room, occasionally answering questions, until an agent found a problem with the application. \"They found a small detail: on my [birth] certificate, my father only had one last name, and on my brother's, he had two.\" And although the document had a clarification explaining that such inaccuracies are common in El Salvador, the agent denied them entry to Canada. The family returned, resigned and anguished, having to face their greatest fear: being separated and deported. At the US checkpoint, they were put in a room with no windows. \"The four of us spent 14 days in that cell,\" Araceli said, clarifying that they could go out to use the bathroom, but were barely allowed outside. Her brother reached out to an organisation that works with migrants, who helped them hire an attorney, Heather Neufeld. While she was preparing their documentation, and without any explanation, the family was given an apparent second chance. \"Two agents arrived at the cell and said: 'Congratulations, you're going to Canada',\" Araceli recalled. But their hopes were short-lived. \"We've been too generous in welcoming you back here,\" she recalled the agent saying after the family applied for asylum in Canada a second time. \"The United States will see what it does with you.\" A spokesperson declined to comment on Araceli's case in particular, citing the country's privacy laws. One thing is for sure - more families like Araceli's are seeking exceptions to come to Canada. While the number of people attempting to cross into the United States from Canada has decreased significantly, the number of asylum seekers being denied entry into Canada from the US has increased. According to official figures from the United States government,13,547 apprehensions were reported along the entire northern border as of March 2025 – a 70% decrease compared to the number recorded in the first quarter of 2024. Conversely, the number of migrants seeking asylum in Canada and being returned to the US has increased this year, according to data from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). In April of this year, 359 people, including adults and children, were found ineligible for asylum in Canada, compared to 180 people in April 2024. Ms Neufeld believes the increase in the number of people turned away is due to \"stricter\" border policy at the Canadian side. In December 2024, Canada announced an investment of C$1.3bn ($950m; £705m) to \"strengthen border security and strengthen the immigration system\". The move was largely seen as an attempt to placate Trump, who has justified widespread tariffs against Canada by blaming the country for illegal immigration into the US. In February, amid a brewing trade war, the Canadian government announced it would further expand this programme. The CBSA has also committed to increasing the number of removals from 16,000 to 20,000 (a 25% increase) for fiscal years 2025-2027. Still, a spokesperson for CBSA told BBC Mundo that they have not changed how they do things: \"We have made no changes to policies or processes\". Denied entry to Canada for the second time, Araceli and her family had to cross the border back into the US, which scared them. \"In this day and age, it's not just about being sent to the United States. There's an immediate risk of detention and deportation,\" Ms Neufeld said. The problem now was that this second trip to Canada was counted as a reconsideration of the case, the only one the family is entitled to under that country's regulations. Ms Neufeld said that Canadian border agents made a mistake. \"They didn't act like they had in the past with other clients, nor did they agree to an interview with the brother when they normally do,\" she stated. According to Ms Neufeld, the family didn't return to Canada of their own free will, but because the US authorities told them to, and so their second attempt should not have been considered an official reconsideration. To get a third opportunity to cross the border and make an asylum claim, Araceli would need a Canadian court to intervene. When they returned to America, her partner was sent to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centre, while Araceli was made to wear an ankle monitor and she and her children went to a migrant shelter. \"They came to tell us they were giving us three minutes to say goodbye because my husband was going to be taken to a detention center,\" Araceli recalls, her voice breaking. A week later, following complex negotiations between the lawyers, a Canadian federal court agreed to allow the family to return to the border to be re-evaluated. On 5 May, seven weeks after the first attempt, Araceli crossed the bridge once again. This time, she had her lawyer with her. After 12 hours, a border agent opened the doors and said \"welcome to Canada and good luck with your new life\", she recalled. \"I felt immense joy, it's indescribable,\" Araceli told Canadian public broadcaster CBC earlier in May, adding: \"My daughters gave me so much strength.\" But it was a bittersweet celebration, as her partner remained in the US for two more weeks, caught up in ongoing legal proceedings. The family hired a lawyer to take on his case. \"They managed to get him out on bail, and that's something not all detention centres allow. The whole family had to make a huge effort; they had to sell things to be able to pay for it,\" Ms Neufeld said. According to her, this family's case reflects the changes that have recently occurred on the northern border. \"There are many more Aracelis, but we can't know where they are or what situation they are facing. Most people lack the capacity to fight to have their rights respected.\" Musk's exit comes after he criticised the legislative centrepiece of the president's agenda. Tariffs are a key part of the US president's political vision but economists fear a global trade war. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the move will include \"those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields\". The US president's remarks on Wednesday come as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukraine. The BBC's Nomia Iqbal spoke to students at Harvard University, which is the target of funding cuts and a ban on international student enrollment.",

    "title": "Golden eagles soaring south back to English skies",
    "article_text": "After years of absence, golden eagles are beginning to venture back into England from the south of Scotland, leading to hopes they might nest. Among those crossing the border in 2025 was a young male called Talla. Wildlife enthusiast Ian Glendinning has seen the UK's second biggest bird of prey many times in the Scottish Highlands, but he never expected to encounter one in his home county of Northumberland. \"It was the end of March and I was driving in a remote corner of the national park with a couple of friends and the rear passenger suddenly shouted out 'what on earth is that?',\" he says. \"I looked over to my right and about 30 metres away there he was, sitting on a rocky outcrop. \"Before I could get my phone out for a photo it glided away, but it was absolutely colossal, there was just no doubting what it was. \"I would defy anyone not to be impressed seeing such a huge bird at close range.\" Talla is one of around 50 golden eagles living in the Scottish Borders and Dumfries and Galloway. Their resurgence is thanks to the work of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), set up when the population in the region had dropped to a mere handful. Since 2018, SSGEP has successfully translocated 28 juveniles, collected at six to eight weeks of age, and 15 sub-adult golden eagles between four months and three years from the Scottish Highlands. SSGEP chair Michael Clarke said: \"Thanks to our satellite tagging, we can confirm that some are beginning to venture into Northumberland and further afield and these sightings reaffirm the importance of us extending our groundbreaking work.\" The birds have also visited the North Pennines and the Lake District, even travelling as far as the Forest of Boland in Lancashire and Nidderdale in Yorkshire. \"While it is too early to say if they are settling in these areas, it is a potentially exciting and significant milestone,\" Mr Clarke said. Golden eagles were wiped out in England and Wales by the mid-19th Century, mainly due to persecution by those who saw them as a threat to livestock or game birds. Despite a brief return following the two world wars, when driven shoots largely ceased, numbers gradually declined again with the last resident golden eagle in Englanddisappearing from the Lake District in 2015. The UK's remaining population was then largely confined to the Scottish Highlands and Islands, particularly in remote, mountainous regions. Dr Cat Barlow, CEO of the charity Restoring Upland Nature, which has taken SSGEP under its wing, said it is not surprising to the birds \"exploring in England\". \"In the first few years of life, the birds will go looking for new territory, looking for a mate, looking for new feeding grounds,\" she said. \"They'll get up high in the sky and head for the areas that look interesting to them, usually those remote upland areas. \"They create a visual map of where they've been and when they find what they think is a good place, they'll settle there and try and attract a mate.\" Welcoming a possible move south, she said: \"I'm from County Durham myself and I'd love to see them back for good there.\" It is not yet clear whether a golden eagle population in areas like the Lake District, or the Northumberland Uplands will establish itself without birds being brought from Scotland. \"In theory, as available territories fill up in the south of Scotland, eagles will begin to move into England and they have been visiting old nest sites,\" Dr Barlow said. Northumberland Wildlife Trust CEO Mike Pratt said: \"They don't see a border and the landscape either side of the borders of England and Scotland is so similar it's not a surprise they're coming south. \"The sightings are almost like the golden eagles giving their blessing and saying that the landscape can take them.\" The charity has recently acquired the Rothbury Estate in Northumberland; 9,500 acres of land which include the Simonside Hills. Mr Pratt hopes one day golden eagles will be present there. \"It won't be a rushed process and we'll be consulting carefully, but the project in the south of Scotland has been such a success, people really love them. \"I would like to think the same could happen here.\" Mr Glendinning has seen golden eagles three more times since that first shock sighting in March and feels a sense of \"wonderment\" each time. \"They just fit in perfectly with the landscape, I just felt a real sense of amazement that they are there and I can see them,\" he said. \"It just feels like they belong here.\" Follow BBC North East onXandFacebookand BBC Cumbria onXandFacebookand both onNextdoorandInstagram.",

    "title": "Government fast-tracks two new reservoirs to shore up water supply",
    "article_text": "Two major new reservoir projects have been fast-tracked in a bid to shore up England's water supplies, the government has announced. The projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire have been declared \"nationally significant\", allowing them to speed through the planning process. But overriding local objections can be unpopular and the reservoirs could still be more than a decade away from opening. Household consumption of water may also need to fall to secure supplies amid rising temperatures and a growing population, scientists warn. The announcement means that final decisions about theFens Reservoir in Cambridgeshireand theLincolnshire Reservoirwill be taken by Environment Secretary Steve Reed, rather than at a local level. This change amounts to \"slashing red tape to make the planning process faster\" to \"secure our water supply for future generations\", according to Water Minister Emma Hardy. The two reservoirs are currently pencilled for completion in 2036 and 2040 respectively. They \"would provide more resilience to future droughts in a part of the country that is already dry and where there is high demand for water,\" said Dr Glenn Watts, water science director at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology. Reservoirs can help protect against the impacts of drought by collecting excess rainfall during wet periods. With climate change likely to bring hotter, drier summers, the chances of drought could increase in the decades ahead, the Met Office says. These preparations have been brought into sharp focus bythis year's exceptionally dry spring. Extra demand from new houses, data centres and other sectors could further squeeze supplies, but no major reservoirs have been completed in England since 1992, shortly after the water sector was privatised. Last year the government and water companies announced proposals to build nine new reservoirs by 2050. Together they have the potential to provide 670 million litres of extra water per day, they say. That's in addition to the Havant Thicket reservoir project in Hampshire, which is already under way and is expected to be completed by 2031. The government also says that it intends to pass legislation to automatically make the other seven proposed reservoirs \"nationally significant\" too. \"Reservoir projects are very complex infrastructure projects that are slow to take forward, and so anything that can be done to streamline that process can be a positive thing,\" said David Porter, senior vice president of the Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE). The water industry has also welcomed the announcement. \"It's absolutely critical that we build these reservoirs now,\" David Henderson, chief executive of Water UK, told BBC News. \"If we don't build them now, we wait another 10 years, it's going to cost even more, so we can't keep kicking the can down the road any longer.\" But building reservoirs doesn't come cheaply, even with accelerated planning processes. That could ultimately filter down to people's bills. Nor does it come quickly. No new major reservoirs are due to be completed this decade. Some experts warn that managing how we use water needs to take greater precedence in a warming climate. \"We need a complete overhaul of the way we use water, to plug leaks, cut down on waste and store water where it falls as rain,\" said Prof Hannah Cloke of the University of Reading. \"It would be better to make more difficult decisions around regulation of new building, as well as retrofitting older homes and businesses, to cut waste and recycle water where it is used, rather than pumping water across huge distances,\" she added. And like any major project, the new reservoirs could prove unpopular with local communities, particularly those whose homes and farmland are cleared to make way for them. \"The decision by the government to fast-track through the 'national significant infrastructure' route is in my opinion very bad and will make the public very angry,\" argued Dr Kevin Grecksch of the University of Oxford. But David Porter of ICE stressed the need to take decisions \"for the greater good\". \"Now, that's not to say that we should ride roughshod over the views of local people, and that's not to say that every project is justifiable,\" he said. \"But if the decision maker is satisfied that on balance it is the right thing to do, you need to find a way through the objection in order to deliver these projects.\" In response to the government's announcement, shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins blamed Labour's farming and immigration policies for pressures on water supplies. \"The last Conservative government left behind a robust, coherent plan to safeguard food security and reduce net migration by more than half. Labour has chosen to abandon those plans and in doing so, it has surrendered control over both our rural community and our borders,\" she said.

    "title": "Deborra-Lee Furness describes 'betrayal' amid Hugh Jackman divorce",
    "article_text": "Australian actress Deborra-Lee Furness has said her \"compassion goes out to everyone who has traversed the traumatic journey of betrayal\", after filing for divorce from her husband Hugh Jackman. In a statement released to media, Furness, 69, said: \"It's a profound wound that cuts deep, however I believe in a higher power and that God/the universe... is always working FOR us.\" The couple filed for divorce in New York on 23 May. They announced their separation in September 2023 after 27 years of marriage. Hugh Jackman, best known for playing Wolverine in the X-men film series, has not responded directly to Furness's statement. Furness said that she had gained \"much knowledge and wisdom\" from the \"breakdown\" of her marriage to Jackman, 56. \"Sometimes the universe has to create arduous circumstances for us to walk through in order to find our way home, back to our true essence and the sovereignty of self love.\" \"It can hurt, but in the long run, returning to yourself and living within your own integrity, values and boundaries is liberation and freedom,\" she added, in the statement first issued to the Daily Mail. When Furness and Jackman announced their separation in 2023,the couple issued a joint statementwhich they said was \"the sole statement either of us will make\". \"Our journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth... We undertake this next chapter with gratitude, love and kindness,\" they said at the time. The pair met on the set of the Australian TV show Corelli in 1995, shortly after Jackman had left drama school. They married the following year and later adopted two children. Since Furness issued the statement, Jackman, currently performing in New York, posted a video to Instagram in which he is skipping to the NYSNC song Bye Bye Bye.",

    "title": "Canada wildfires: thousands in Manitoba ordered to evacuate as state of emergency declared",
    "article_text": "More than 17,000 people inCanada’swestern Manitoba province were being evacuated on Wednesday as the region experienced its worst start to the wildfire season in years. “The Manitoba government has declared a province-wide state of emergency due to the wildfire situation,” Manitoba’s premier, Wab Kinew, told a news conference. “This is the largest evacuation Manitoba will have seen in most people’s living memory.” Kinew said he had asked the prime minister, Mark Carney, to send in the Canadian military to help with the evacuations and firefighting. Military aircraft, Kinew said, would be deployed “imminently” to help move people out of endangered remote northern communities to safety, along with additional firefighting resources. Theclimate crisishas made wildfires in Canada more frequent and intense. The country has been hit with devastating fires in recent years, including in 2023, themost destructive on record. There are now 134 active fires acrossCanada, including in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. Half are considered out of control. The evacuations include the town of Flin Flon, where 5,000 residents were told earlier to get ready to flee on a moment’s notice as a major wildfire bore down on the mining town, which is named after a fictional character in a 1905 paperback novel. Residents of several other remote towns and Indigenous communities have also now been told to leave. Most of the evacuees are expected to be transported to the Manitoba capital of Winnipeg. Evacuee Sheryl Matheson said the wildfires had surrounded her small town of Sherridon, northeast of Flin Flon. “It’s been overwhelming,” said the owner of a fishing lodge. “It was very smokey. You could see the fires four or 5km away and moving fast.” She added, “The flames were shooting over 121ft high and firefighters couldn’t get close enough to the fire to do anything.” Elsaida Alerta told public broadcaster CBC she was having “major anxiety” as she and her family readied to leave Flin Flon, where she has lived for three years. “Especially for somebody that lived in a big city [previously], that never had to evacuate, this is definitely nerve-racking,” she said. The only highway out of Flin Flon still open was jammed with traffic and local stations had run out of petrol, she said. “We basically gathered all our essential things, important documents, medications and, you know, things that our animals will need,” she said. “We’re just gonna make our way and hope for the best.” Premier Kinew said the widespread nature of the fires was cause for alarm. “For the first time, it’s not a fire in one region, we have fires in every region. That is a sign of a changing climate that we are going to have to adapt to,” Kinew said. Twenty-two wildfires were active in the province. Nearly 200,000 hectares of forests have been scorched in just the past month, or triple the annual average over the previous five years, Kirstin Hayward of the Manitoba wildfire service said. “Manitoba has the highest fire activity in Canada so far this year, due in part to a prolonged period of warm and dry conditions,” she said. About 1,000 residents of Lynn Lake and Marcel Colomb First Nation in Manitoba and 4,000 people from the northern village of Pelican Narrows and other communities in neighboring Saskatchewan had already been evacuated earlier in the week. A firefighter was also severely injured when he was struck by a falling tree while battling blazes. He was being treated in hospital, Kinew said. The Manitoba premier said emergency shelters were being set up and companies and communities across the province were being asked to “open your doors” to displaced residents. Earlier this month, two residents of the small community of Lac du Bonnet died after being trapped in a major wildfire northeast of Winnipeg.",

    "title": "Chinese paraglider survives accidental 8,000-metre-high flight above the clouds",
    "article_text": "A Chinese paraglider who was accidentally propelled more than 8,000 metres high by an updraft has been banned from the activity for six months after a video of his ordeal went viral. Peng Yujiang began from an elevation of about 3,000m in the Qilian mountain range in northernChina, where he intended to test a new second-hand equipment purchase without making a proper flight, according to an investigative report by the Gansu Provincial Aviation Sports Association. However about 20 minutes into his practice he was caught in a strong updraft, which sent him soaring more than 5,000m high, in line with flight paths and nearly the height of Mount Everest. Video from Peng’s mounted camera showed him above the clouds and covered in icicles as the temperature dropped to a reported -35C, as he tried to control his equipment. In a video filmed shortly after landing, Peng recounted the experience. “My hands were frozen outside. I kept trying to talk on the radio,” he said. Authorities praised Peng’s survival, conceding it was an accident. A “normal person cannot be exposed at 8,000m without oxygen [so] this is not something that can be done voluntarily” said a sports bureau official, according toSixth Tone. But Peng, who has about five years’ experience paragliding, never intended to leave ground level and so had not registered any flight plans, meaning his ordeal was “not subject to relevant approvals”, the report said. In response he was banned from flying for six months. The bureaureport, based on an interview with Peng, said he was in the air for more than an hour, and had stayed in radio contact with his friend, Gu Zhimin, who was still on the ground. The report said he had attempted to descend but his efforts were “ineffective”, and as he flew higher he became confused and briefly lost consciousness. Peng was eventually able to land about 30km from the launch site, where he was met by Gu and another friend. Gu later posted a video of Peng’s flight and comments on the ground to Douyin, China’s domestic version of TikTok, where it soon went viral. The video sparked shock and admiration from viewers, some suggesting he had broken records, but it also drew the ire of authorities. “Gu Zhimin posted a flight video without permission, which had a bad impact,” the report said. “He was grounded for six months and asked to write a report to deeply reflect on the negative impact of his behaviour.” The bureau said any record broken by Peng’s flight would not be officially counted because his flight was not registered. His flight nears the world record of 9,946m set by German paraglider Ewa Wiśnierska in 2007, whenshe was caught in a similar updraftwhile paragliding in Australia. Wiśnierska was unconscious for about 40 minutes, only learning how high she had flown after safely landing and checking her flight data. Additional research by Lillian Yang",

    "article_text": "Patterson, 50, has pleaded not guilty to three charges of murder and one charge of attempted murder relating to a fatal mushroom lunch in 2023. Follow live updates Mandy says there were some devices police did not seize during the search of Patterson’s Leongatha house. He shows Eppingstall a photo from the search which shows a corner lounge in Patterson’s home. He says a black object is the mobile phone that Eppingstall said police never located. Eppingstall says he does not accept this. He says if it were a phone “I think we would have found it”. The jury heard yesterday that police never located a phone connected to Patterson, which the prosecution labelled “Phone A”. Patterson was ‘always accompanied’ during police search of her home, court hears Mandyturns to questionEppingstallabout the search police conducted ofPatterson’s Leongatha home on 5 August 2023. Eppingstall agrees Patterson was not warned about the visit. He says he was the officer with Patterson for the majority of the search. Eppingstall says when he needed to step away, another officer would be with Patterson. Eppingstall says Patterson was “always accompanied” but was able to walk around during the search. He says Patterson retained a mobile phone with her during the search and had arrangements to make for her children. Patterson was left alone in a room to call a lawyer, the court hears. The jury has returned to the courtroom in Morwell. The court has adjourned for a lunch break. The trial will resume from 2.15pm. iNaturalist webpage shown to jury in screenshots may have changed since 2022, court hears MandytakesEppingstallto a screenshot from December 2024 of the iNaturalist website that was shown to the jury on Wednesday. Under questioning by Mandy, Eppingstall agrees the website would have looked different in 2022. The court previously heard Eppingstall took screenshots of the webpages which originated from URLs from May 2022 found on a computer seized from Patterson’s house. Eppingstall agrees there is no evidence the landing page shown in the screenshot was the same in 2022. Detective asked about conversation with fungi expert Eppingstallrecalls the conversation with mycologistDr Thomas Maywho said he had posted the sighting of death cap mushrooms on the citizen science website iNaturalist.Eppingstall says May told him he had posted about spotting the fungi in Outtrim.Eppingstall says he then identified thatChristine McKenzie, a retired pharmacist, had made a post about death cap mushrooms. He then asked her to make a formal statement. Eppingstall cross-examined about phone records MandyasksEppingstallabout the call charge records, previously shown to the jury, and if the time reflected for a changed IMEI number [International Mobile Equipment Identity, used to identify phone handsets] is accurate. Eppingstall says he believed the time on the record is accurate. He agrees telecommunications expertDr Matthew Sorell, who gave evidence earlier in the trial, was not asked about this. Detective asked about travel times between Leongatha and locations where death cap mushrooms sighted MandysaysEppingstallgave evidence about travel distances and times between Leongatha and Outtrim, and Leongatha and Loch. The court previously heard that sightings of death cap mushrooms in Outtrim and Loch had been posted on the citizen science website iNaturalist in the months before the lunch. Mandy asks if travel time can vary depending on the route. Eppingstall agrees. Eppingstall tells court about data retrieved from phones Mandyshows the court a report of downloads extracted fromSimon’s phone. Mandy says the only thing extracted from the phone was messages. “That’s all I asked for,” saysEppingstall. The report was about 70 pages and contained 280 messages betweenErinand Simon Patterson, Mandy says. Eppingstall says he was also aware of messages on the app Signal that Erin and Simon used. Mandy then turns toGailandDon’s phones. Eppingstall says he believed police got a “full extraction” from Gail’s phone. He says Don’s phone was “fairly empty”, adding: I don’t think he used his phone much. EppingstallsaysPatterson’s estranged husband,Simon, providedGailandDon’s mobile phones to police on 6 August 2023. Simon also provided his own mobile phone on the same day. Mandy asks: Did he tell you at any stage that he had changed his phone? Eppingstall says Simon mentioned he had changed his handset. Eppingstall says Simon provided his handset to police again on 12 September 2023. Eppingstall asked about bank records MandyasksEppingstallaboutPatterson’s Bendigo Bank records he obtained during the investigation. He confirms no bank records were obtained for the time period prior to 1 July 2023. He says he does not recall seeing records from other banks. Mandy asks Eppingstall about online bookstore purchases Mandyasks ifEppingstallobtained a “large number of receipts” from Booktopia as part of the investigation. Eppingstall agrees he did find a large number of books related to diets. Mandy turns to the “significant media interest” in the case. He says from 1 August 2023, the police media unit were “briefed and holding lines were prepared”. Eppingstall says holding lines are “short blurbs that go out to [the] media” to let the public know basic details of an incident. He says: It’s a very generic statement. The jurors have entered the courtroom in Morwell. Patterson’s lawyer,Colin Mandy SC, is continuing to cross-examineDetective Leading Senior Constable Stephen Eppingstall, the officer in charge of the investigation into the lethal lunch.

    "article_text": "Follow today’s news live Get ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcast Winter will be warmer and in some places wetter than average this year, the Bureau of Meteorology says. “While winter is a time for cooler weather, the winter long-range forecast shows day and night temperatures are likely to be above average across Australia for this time of the year,” BoM said in its forecast. Rainfall is also expected to be above average for interior and central parts of the country, while parts of the tropical north, south-east and south-west will see rainfall in the typical range. This includes in parts of South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania that have been affected by prolonged dry conditions as well as parts of New South Wales recently impacted by severe flooding, BoM said. This winter forecast follows an autumn which was much wetter than average in the north and east of Australia, and much drier than average in many southern parts. There is also an “unseasonal increased riskof fire this winter” across parts of South Australia and Victoria. Thank you for joining me on the live blog today. Handing over now toNick Visserwho will keep you posted with the afternoon’s news. More than 7,000 insurance claims from NSW regions affected by floods Insurers have received more than 7,000 claims from the mid north coast and Hunter regions affected by floods, the Insurance Council of Australia says. There were about 6,000 claimsyesterday. “Claims numbers have been steadily increasing over the past week as residents and business owners have been able to get back into properties to assess the damage and begin the clean-up,” ICA said in a statement. The Insurance Council and insurers are focused on assisting communities in the recovery and have prioritised making clean-up and claims guidance as accessible as possible. This includes direct text messages to policyholders, updates in insurer apps, and having representatives on the ground in centres across the region. There are now Insurance Hubs in Taree and Port Macquarie. Inside the Bradfield recount: painstaking and polite, but sometimes heartbreaking The Bradfield recount is being held in a warehouse in Asquith that appears to have been used for a number of northern Sydney electorates, but on my visit only Bradfield is being counted. A space is set aside as a break room for scrutineers, with large teams for the teal candidate,Nicolette Boele,and the Liberal,Gisele Kapterian,whofinished just eight votes aheadafter the first complete count. Given there weremore than 6,500 informal votes in Bradfield(5.51% of those cast), the potential for decisions over validity to settle the outcome are obvious. Each candidate has at least enough scrutineers to have one watching every person counting. The regular counting space is divided into a series of bays. Each bay is dealing with one polling place at a time. The first part of the process is to conduct a fresh first-preference count. Ballot papers are already in bundles of 50, in first preference order. Each counter takes one bundle at a time and removes the rubber band, then carefully checks each ballot to ensure it is formal and that the first preference is correct. It is then laid on a pile facing the scrutineers, who can observe it. This process happens more slowly and carefully than you would expect for an election night count.

Australia’s consumer watchdog says it is “concerned” about ensuring strong competition in the real estate sector after confirming it is in the early stages of investigating REA Group. REA Group, the News Corp-controlled real estate listing giant that runsrealestate.com.au, confirmed to the ASX this week that it is being investigated by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. That follows a Guardian Australia investigation last year that revealed a series of complaints about the way REA Group is using its market dominance, including to drive up real estate listing fees. The ACCC usually conducts its investigations on a confidential basis. But, following REA Group’s statement to the ASX, it said: Naturally, the ACCC is concerned to ensure there is strong competition in the important real estate sector. As the investigation is ongoing, the ACCC won’t comment further at this time. The investigation is at an early stage, and we’re yet to form a view. Magda Szubanskihas been diagnosed with stage 4 blood cancer and says she will be “lying very low” while she undertakes treatment. The Australian comedian and actor posted the health update to her Instagram, saying “it’s rough”: Lovelies. Well. Some not great news. I’ve been diagnosed with stage 4 Mantle Cell Lymphoma – a rare and fast-moving blood cancer.It’s serious, but I’ve started one of the best treatments available (the Nordic protocol), and I’m lucky to be getting absolutely world-class care here in Melbourne. I won’t sugar-coat it: it’s rough. But I’m hopeful. I’m being lovingly cared for by friends and family, my medical team is brilliant, and I’ve never felt more held by the people around me. I’ll be lying very low while my immune system takes a hammering, so if you see me out and about – don’t hug me, kiss me, or breathe anywhere near me! Wave enthusiastically from a safe distance and know I love you madly. Szubanski says the cancer is obscure and was only discovered incidentally by a breast screen, where they found her lymph nodes were up. Her caption continues: TBH, I’ve been feeling pretty ratshit for ages.So I asked for extra bloods and – voila! So the take away is – get tested and listen to your body!

Pace of productivity could lead to adjustment in RBA rates forecast Reserve Bank governorMichele Bullocksays Australia is no longer walking the “narrow path” to getting price growth under control, but a surprise rise in underlying inflation could be an indication of more obstacles along the road. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported trimmed mean inflation – which provides a less volatile read of prices than the headline figure – ticked up from 2.7% to 2.8% in the 12 months to April. While monthly figures tend to bounce around and the RBA places greater emphasis on quarterly data, a spike in dwelling costs could concern the central bank if replicated over the coming months. The rates market continued to price in a two-thirds chance the RBA would cut rates at its next meeting after the ABS release. The Reserve Bank forecasts the trimmed mean to fall to 2.6% by the middle of the year and stay there for the foreseeable future. That’s partly predicated on the RBA’s belief declining labour productivity will rebound into growth by the end of 2025, which would defy the experience of the past decade and more. Speaking to media following the bank’s board meeting last week, Bullock said the RBA would have to adjust its forecasts if the ambitious productivity prediction did not come to fruition. “There’s a great deal of uncertainty about productivity,” she said. “I can’t tell you what’s going to turn it around.” -Australian Associated Press Slate of Senate ‘button presses’ in WA, QLD and NSW coming soon Election-watcher Kevin Bonhamreportswe should have the results of several so-called “button presses” today and tomorrow, which will divvy out election preferences for the Senate. The button in question is actually a computer routine that will determine the Senate results. In WA, the button press is set for 3.00pm eastern (1.00pm local time) In QLD, the button press is set for 3.30pm today. In NSW, the button press is set for 9.30am tomorrow, 30 May. The buttons have already been pressed in the NT, ACT, TAS, SA and VIC. You can read about some of those results here: Court rejects application for cycling group protest on Brisbane’s Story Bridge An application by a cyclist advocacy group tohold a protest on Brisbane’s Story Bridgehas been shot down in court this morning. Magistrate Ross Mack ruled for the Queensland Police that the demonstration would risk community safety by blocking emergency vehicles. The Story Bridge has been closed to pedestrians and cyclists for months. The route isone of the few safe cycling routesin Brisbane. Protest organiser Kathryn Good said they wanted the Brisbane City council to designate one of the bridge’s six lanes of car traffic as a protected walking and cycling route until the bridge can be repaired. They had planned to hold an 8am protest on the bridge on Friday, but Magistrate Mack approved an application by the police blocking the plan. Good said: I think they’ve put the rights of motorists not to be inconvenienced for a single hour – what we were proposing – over the rights of people not to be inconvenienced for months on end. Brisbane City council designated a lane of Coronation Drive for active transport when its neighbouring cycleway was rendered unsafe by the 2022 floods. But Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner said designating part of the Story Bridge for cyclists and pedestrianswould inconvenience more motoristsbecause the bridge is busier. Schrinner said: The Story Bridge has city-wide implications. So there’s much wider implications in the traffic network. And certainly we did the modelling for Coronation Drive, we believed that that was OK to do then, in terms of the implications. The same modelling has been done for the Story Bridge, and the impacts are major. In all parts of the city there’s a flow-on effect. He said the bridge ordinarily accommodates about 100,000 people a day by car and bus and 4,000 by foot and bike. So we’re talking about 4% of people using those (transport modes) basically not being concerned about the 96% of people either using car or bus. And we are concerned about everyone who uses the bridge. But in the end, we need to support the movement system of the city. Brisbane City council plans to conduct footpath strengthening, likely to involve putting a second deck on the bridge. There is no estimate for the length of time the project will take. Ironically the bridge will be closed for several hours on Sunday for the Brisbane marathon. One-off payments available from tomorrow for those hit by floods People affected by the severe flooding on NSW’s mid-north coast canapply for financial assistance beginning tomorrowto help cover essential costs related to the declared natural disaster. Eligible individuals will receivea one-off payment of $180, or up to $900 per household, to help cover costs including food, clothing, medicine and emergency accommodation. Applications open at 9am on Friday 30 May, and people can apply via the Service NSW website or app, or in-person at recovery centres. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said: We know it’s going to take more than hardship grants for these towns to get back on their feet, but we are getting the ball rolling with essential support. CBA to reduce fixed mortgage rate as lenders price in more cuts Australia’s biggest lender, Commonwealth Bank, is cutting its one-year fixed rate home loan by 40 basis points, as banks start pricing in a string of anticipated cash rate cuts. The Reserve Bankcut the cash rateby a quarter percentage point last week to 3.85%, prompting financial markets to up their bets of further decreases this year that could take the rate towards 3.1%. Lenders adjust fixed rates according to market pricing and their assessment of future rate changes. All of Australia’s major bank lenders announced a 25 basis point cut for their variable home loans in response to the RBA decision. Sally Tindall,data insights director at financial comparison site Canstar, said: Fixed rates have been falling fairly consistently this year and we expect this activity will continue as banks price in the increasing likelihood of further cash rate cuts. CBA’s fixed rate cuts aren’t groundbreaking, but rather a bid to inch closer to its key competitors. CBA will be the sixth lender to cut its owner-occupier fixed rates since the RBA decision, according to Canstar. The margin is down now to just one vote between LiberalGisele Kapterianand independentNicolette Boelein the Bradfield recount, with Kapterian in the very slight lead. Don Farrell says Labor examining US court’s tariff injunction The trade minister,Don Farrell, says the Australian government is closely studying the ruling of an American court placing an injunction on some ofDonald Trump’stariffs, and says the trade barriers on Australia remain unjustified. A federal trade court on Wednesday (US time) blocked Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency powers law. The ruling from a three-judge panel at the New York-based court of international trade came after several lawsuits arguing Trump has exceeded his authority, left US trade policy dependent on his whims and unleashed economic chaos. In a statement, Farrell said the government was considering the issue. We will study this ruling of the US federal courts on reciprocal tariffs closely and note that they may be subject to further legal processes through the courts. The Albanese government has been consistent in the view that these tariffs on Australian imports into the US are unjustified. Farrell said the government would “continue to engage and strongly advocate for the removal of tariffs”. The Albanese government will always stand up for Australia’s national interests, including Australian jobs and Australian industries. The Queensland Fire Department rescued three tiny kittens from under a bridge in Gatton – and they have since been named Blaze, Asher and Smokey. “On Monday, three tiny kittens were found soaking wet and clinging to a concrete pier under Davies Bridge in Gatton,” QFD said in a post to social media. “After a member of the public called for help, Gatton auxiliaries responded and carefully rescued the scared trio. “They’ve since been named Blaze, Asher, and Smokey! A reminder that a small act, like making a phone call, can help save a life fluffy or otherwise.”",

    "title": "Australia will keep pushing US to drop Trump tariffs after court ruling, trade minister says",
    "article_text": "Australia will continue to push Donald Trump to abandon his administration’s tariff regime entirely, after aUS court blocked the president’s “liberation day” tariffsfrom coming into effect. The Manhattan-based court of international trade said the US constitution gives the Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other countries, and ruled that power was not superseded by the president’s self-declared “emergency” he cited to safeguard the US economy. The Trump White House filed an appeal against the judgment minutes after it was handed down. The regime imposed a10% across-the-board tariff on all Australian importsto the US. Several specific products, includingsteelandaluminium, are subject to higher tariff rates, up to 25%. The Australian trade minister, Don Farrell, said the Australian government would agitate for tariffs on Australian goods to be dumped entirely. “We will study this ruling of the US Federal Courts on reciprocal tariffs closely and note that they may be subject to further legal processes through the courts,” he said. “The Albanese Government has been consistent in the view that these tariffs on Australian imports into the US are unjustified,” Farrell said. “We will continue to engage and strongly advocate for the removal of tariffs.” “The Albanese Government will always stand up for Australia’s national interests, including Australian jobs and Australian industries.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The US court found Trump overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board tariffs on imports from countries all over the world.Trump called the tariffs, announced on 2 April,America’s “liberation day”. “The court does not pass upon the wisdom or likely effectiveness of the President’s use of tariffs as leverage. That use is impermissible not because it is unwise or ineffective, but because (federal law) does not allow it,” a three-judge panel said in the decision. The ruling came in a pair of lawsuits, one filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small US businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties and the other by 13 US states. The companies – which range from a New York wine and spirits importer to a Virginia-based maker of educational kits and musical instruments – have said the tariffs will hurt their ability to do business. The lawsuit argued that the statue invoked by the president – the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) – does not give him the authority to unilaterally issue across-the-board worldwide tariffs. “His claimed emergency is a figment of his own imagination: trade deficits, which have persisted for decades without causing economic harm, are not an emergency. Nor do these trade deficits constitute an ‘unusual and extraordinary threat’,” it argued. Court documents specifically cited thetariffs imposed on Australian territories where there are no people, and, hence, no commerce. “The Liberation Day Order imposed sweeping new tariffs at rates not seen since the Great Depression – including a global 10% tariffs on nearly all countries in the world – regardless of whether they impose tariffs on United States products, the rates at which they do so, or the existence of any trade agreements governing the relationship. “These tariffs even applied to places with no civilian population or international trade activity, such as [Australian territories] the Heard and McDonald Islands, which are inhabited only by penguins and seals.” Australian financial analysts have warned that significant uncertainty remained around the ultimate fate of Trump’s tariff regime. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst with Capital.com in Melbourne, said the court’s ruling was massive news. “It’s long been suggested that the emergency powers Trump has used to implement tariffs were unconstitutional and that the power to enact tariffs sits with Congress,” he said. “It sets up a battle that will likely end up in the supreme court now. It’s a situation fraught with danger because the administration may ignore the court’s ruling, potentially placing greater strain on US institutions at a time of increased stress.” Sean Callow, a senior analyst at ITC Markets in Sydney, said while there must be significant caution over the ruling being overturned by higher courts, “for now the weight of money is being placed on the possibility that US courts prevent the White House from self-imposed economic damage, brightening US growth prospects and the US dollar”. The White House and lawyers for groups that sued did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff and one of Trump’s lead policy advisers, rebuked the court in a brief social media post, writing: “The judicial coup is out of control.” At least five other legal challenges to the tariffs are pending. The attorney general of Oregon, Dan Rayfield, a Democrat whose office is leading the states’ lawsuit, called Trump’s tariffs unlawful, reckless and economically devastating. “This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can’t be made on the president’s whim,” Rayfield said in a statement. Under US law, tariffs must typically be approved by Congress. Trump has claimed broad authority to set tariffs under IEEPA, which is meant to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats during a national emergency. The law has historically been used to impose sanctions on enemies of the US or freeze their assets. Trump is the first US president to use it to impose tariffs.

    "title": "‘Treaty of Versailles’: angry Liberal MPs warn makeup of Coalition shadow ministry will make new enemies",
    "article_text": "A rump of Liberal MPs are fuming over the makeup of the new shadow ministry, warning the perceived rewarding of supporters and sidelining of factional rivals was a “Treaty of Versailles”-type peace deal that would cause long-term unrest. One Liberal MP said the appointments would “create enemies”, setting up an early challenge for new leaderSussan Leyas she attempts to rebuild the party. After striking a deal with the Nationals to reunite the Coalition, Ley is facing an internal backlash after dumping senior figures in favour of a new breed of MPs in amajor reshaping of the Peter Dutton-era frontbench. Liberal sources said the makeup of the frontbench could be viewed as a mix of moderates and people who were “very close” to Ley – such as Alex Hawke – and the “flag bearers” for the party’s right wing, who needed to be retained in senior roles to preserve a degree of factional balance. This group included Angus Taylor, James Paterson, Andrew Hastie and Michaelia Cash. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email While the most high-profile demotion, Jane Hume, is from the party’s moderate flank, arguably the biggest losers were the conservatives. Sarah Henderson was relegated to the backbench whileJacinta Nampijinpa Pricewas demoted to the outer shadow ministry. Claire Chandler will also sit on the backbench after being forced out of shadow cabinet. Price claimed some of the appointments were not based on “merit”as she expressed disappointment with her demotion on Sky News. A group of younger conservative MPs, including Henry Pike, Cameron Caldwell and Garth Hamilton, were all overlooked as Ley handed junior portfolios to moderates such as Maria Kovacic, Dave Sharma and Gisele Kapterian,subject to her winning Bradfield. Other ambitious backbenchers such as Aaron Violi and Simon Kennedy also missed out. Veteran rightwinger Tony Pasin – a key backroom player in Taylor’s failed leadership tilt – was demoted as expected. Moderates Tim Wilson, Andrew Bragg and Angie Bell were among the biggest winners after promotions to shadow cabinet. The reaction to the shadow ministry presents an immediate test for Ley as she tries to rebuild from the 3 May election disaster. One conservative MP said the shadow ministry was more “Treaty of Versailles than Marshall Plan” – a historical reference used to suggest the appointments would cause ongoing angst. The Treaty of Versailles was the peace deal between Germany and the allies that followed the first world war. The harsh conditions imposed on Germany were considered to have laid the foundations for the second world war. The Marshall Plan was the US-led initiative to help rebuild Europe after the second world war. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Asked for their view on the shadow ministry, another MP who missed out on a senior role referenced former Liberal prime minister’s Tony Abbott’s old saying about reshuffles. “The Abbott truism that reshuffles create enemies will live out this term,” they said. In a blitz of morning television and radio on Thursday, Ley defended her frontbench choices and decision to promote more moderate voices. Ley called Price “a real talent” and said she had “a new, expanded role” in a critical area. “I’m excited by the role Jacinta will play in that, and I’ve had a great chat with her about that role and as part of my team, she’s excited to go forward with it,” she told 4BC radio. Ley on Radio National dodged several questions about Price’s claims that “merit” was not rewarded in the reshuffle, repeatedly declining to address her claims directly. “She is part of that team. She’s an incredible Australian in terms of her ability to connect. But I’m very proud of my team,” Ley said in response. Senator James Paterson, the new shadow finance minister, conceded on Radio National that while merit was the most important issue in a frontbench reshuffle, “I’d be lying if I said merit is the only consideration” – calling it a “political process” where leaders had to balance geographical, gender and party room factors. “I’m disappointed on behalf of Sarah [Henderson], in particular, who did a great job in her portfolio and is a valued colleague as well, and Jacinta, understandably, would have preferred to be in shadow cabinet. We would all like to be in shadow cabinet,” he said. Asked about future unity in theCoalitionparty room, Paterson said ideas would have to be “robustly tested” inside the party. Arguably the biggest internal fight for the Coalition this term will be over whether to dump or retain the net zero by 2050 target. In his latest intervention in the debate, the Nationals senator, Matt Canavan, published a bizarre anime-style video with the tagline “dark Nats rise” and promising to “defeat net zero”. Accompanied by a song with some lyrics in Japanese, the translation on screen includes lines like “our nation needs a hero to defeat the net zero” and “We rise, we fight, dark Nats burning through the night”, with animation of men destroying wind turbines and solar panels.",

    "title": "Heartbroken mother tells inquest she’s ‘lost her way’ after ‘stuff of nightmares’ murders at Bondi Junction",
    "article_text": "The mother of Jade Young, a victim of theBondi Junction stabbings, has described her daughter’s murder as the “stuff of nightmares” and the result of “years of neglect” within the mental health system. Elizabeth Young told theNew South Walescoroner’s court on Thursday that her words were “both a distillation and a manifestation of anguish”. She said that it “hurt terribly” that her loving, clever, compassionate, thoughtful and “slightly goofy” daughter “no longer has a chance to exist – to be in the future”. “At 74, I have lost my way in life,” Young told the court. “The moment he casually plunged that knife into Jade, our ordinary lives were shattered.” Young was accompanied in court by her husband, Ivan, her son, Peter, and Jade’s husband, Noel. Elizabeth Young’s dog, Teddy, was also at the inquest. Family statements were given on the final day of the five-week coronial inquest. Schizophrenic manJoel Cauchi, 40, killed Ashlee Good, 38, Yixuan Cheng, 27, Pikria Darchia, 55, Dawn Singleton, 25, Faraz Tahir, 30, and Jade Young, 47. He injured 10 others at Westfield Bondi Junction on Saturday 13 April 2024 before he was shot and killedby police officer Amy Scott. Elizabeth Young remembered laughing with her daughter about washing a blanket, sending her a photo of a perfect fairy ring of mushrooms and her final emoji message in the days before she was murdered. Jade had been shopping with her daughter at the time of the attack. Elizabeth said her granddaughter later drew “a plan of where mummy fell” in blue crayon. “Pause and think on that,” she told the court. Young described the coronial inquest as “harrowing” and said “some people lost sight of the truly awful fact that six people are dead”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email She said an accumulation of failures over many years led to Cauchi’s murderous attack. Australia “doesn’t seem to want to acknowledge what happened was … categoric … years of neglect within our mental health system”, at state and federal levels, she said. “My daughter was murdered by an unmedicated chronic schizophrenic.” Referring to the senior counsel assisting the coroner, Peggy Dwyer SC, she said: “Dr Dwyer referred to individuals doing their best in fallible systems. “I’m sorry, but it seems to me that my daughter and five others were killed by the cumulative failures … [of a] whole series of systems,” she said. Young said if the inquest led to increased mental health funding and better security arrangements, “all that would be good, but my daughter, my lovely, gentle daughter, is no more”. “For me personally, no good will come from this inquest. She meant nothing to him, there is no comfort in closure, there is no way to make amends for what he took from me.” The coroner’s court heard Elizabeth Young couldn’t stand loud places, flinched at noise, startled easily, no longer listened to music or had flowers at home, slept badly, was anxious about social occasions and “dreads” Saturday afternoons. She also criticised how some members of the media had covered the attack and reported on a memorial event a fortnight later. Images of Jade’s body after the attack were widely shared, Young told the court. To think images of a woman lying dead were newsworthy “sickens me”, she said on Thursday. “I learned a new phrase in the days after April 13 – trauma porn.” Peter Young, who lives in Hobart, said his sister Jade was murdered by a man who was “fuelled by his frustration [of] not finding a nice girl to marry – what a coward”. Daniel Roff SC, the barrister for Jun Xing and Pengfei Cheng, read a statement on their behalf. Yixuan Cheng was their only child. She was “thriving” as a student in Sydney, the court heard on Thursday. “We would speak with her almost every day and were so proud,” the parents said. The last time they saw her was a month before her death. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion “She was the most perfect person and no parent could want or need more,” Roff said when reading their statement. On the day of the attack, Yixuan Cheng spoke to her mother on the phone. “I told her that her dad and I loved her [and] she told me that she loved us. “Yixuan was the treasure of our lives … we aged overnight, our hair turned grey,” the couple said in their statement. “We never had the chance to tell her that being her mother and father was the greatest gift.” Muzafar Ahmad Tahir, the brother of Pakistani national Faraz Tahir, said that moving to Australia had brought his brother a “sense of security”. “This country is very peaceful and provides many facilities for a better future,” he told the court. “None of us could have imagined that such a tragedy could have befallen him.” Faraz Tahir was on duty as a security guard inside Westfield Bondi Junction at the time of the attack. “His courage makes us immensely proud … he will always be remembered as a symbol of bravery,” his brother said, adding that it was a moment of immense pride when the prime minister called Faraz a “national hero”. George Darchia, the eldest son of Pikria Darchia, wrote a statement that was read in court. His mother was “quiet but full of depth, observant, kind, strong … the kind of person who made the world turn the way she wanted it to.” She had a dream that one day he and his brother would live with her in Sydney, the court heard. “She loved this city, she believed in it … but I didn’t come. Now I live with the pain of that choice.” “Maybe I could have helped her avoid going to Bondi Junction on that fateful day,” he said in the statement. “It’s not guilt in a logical way, it’s something deeper.” He described learning what happened on the day his mother died “as its own kind of trauma”. The inquest, which began just over a year after the attacks, is now adjourned. It has examined potential failings in Cauchi’s healthcare, the preparedness of the shopping centre for an active armed offender and the response of the police, ambulance service and media.

    "title": "Jobcentres will no longer force people into ‘any job’ available, minister says",
    "article_text": "Jobcentres will no longer force people into “any job” available, the employment minister has said, promising there will be long-term, personalised career support for those losing out due to welfare cuts. Alison McGovern said she was ending the Conservative policy under which jobseekers were obliged to take any low-paid, insecure work and that the service would now be focused on helping people to build rewarding careers. McGovern, who is tasked with a major overhaul to employment support as a result of significant cuts to disability benefits, said the department would use AI to free up the workloads of job coaches, giving them more time to provide “human” support to those with complex needs and long-term unemployment. The government is facing open revolt amongLabourMPs over the proposed cuts – which some in No 10 fear could mean losing the vote in parliament. McGovern said she wanted to acknowledge there were many disabled people who would feel “frightened” by the cuts to personal independence payments and incapacity benefits, with many losing support entirely. “I don’t blame anybody for being scared or worried about it because given what’s happened with changes to disability benefits before, I understand that,” she said. But she added she was deeply concerned about the numbers of young people out of work – with many needing specialist help to even engage with job support because of extreme social anxiety. McGovern said that people whose benefits were cut under Labour would receive radically different support. Work support will be offered by GPs and physiotherapists, in addition to the extended support in jobcentres. “One of the things that broke me was reading people say that they thought ‘no one would want them,’” she said. “I cannot live with the idea that there’s people in this country who think that no one wants them.” The government will eventually spend £1bn a year in additional support for those with long-term health problems to access work, though the funding will be less for the first few years, starting at about £300m next year as the changes begin to come into effect. But the Resolution Foundation thinktank has previously suggested that the support available would bring at most 105,000 people into work by 2030, and would push many more into poverty. McGovern said she hoped changes to the current system and the way the department relates to employers would make a significant difference to the numbers. She said the Conservatives had left a “black hole” in the service, where a top-down bureaucratic system was having no measurable impact on getting people into work. Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) staff in jobcentres will be asked to rely more on AI software called DWP Ask and to fill in forms in advance of work coach meetings so that time can be spent on longer support for clients. Trials have already been run in which work coaches are given more time with clients than the usual five minutes. “Nobody is ever going to make a film of I, Daniel Blake, but the reverse,” McGovern said. “But what I would like is a person comes into the jobcentre who has perhaps not worked for some years and … they are given the time so that they can tell their whole story. Jobcentres will then be able to pick up the phone to tailored specific support for that person’s barriers, then support once they are in work as well. We’ve got to see the whole person.” McGovern said she would like to radically improve the number of employers engaging directly with the DWP – currently just one in six. She said that would help jobcentres match people with the right skills and prepare them better for interviews or placements. “The Tories used to talk about ABC: ‘Any job, Better job, Career’. I think that if you think about the career [first] … If we can get people into an NHS job where they’re more likely to move on and move up, then that is far better for them.” McGovern said she was particularly troubled by the plight of younger people, many of whom had been scarred by Covid. She said in some areas work coaches were having to accompany young people even to public places such as job fairs to help them overcome their anxieties. “Now, that tells me that there’s an issue,” she said. “We have to pay our debt to the Covid generation … I worry particularly about young people, and I think there has not been enough discussion or understanding of what Covid took from young people.” Ministers are anticipating a significant rebellion and potential defeat when the welfare changes come before parliament, with up to 170 MPs suggesting publicly or privately that they could vote against or abstain on the changes. “I don’t blame colleagues for listening to their constituents who are fearful,” McGovern said. She said that people would have those fears alleviated only if they could see the system had truly changed. “I also look at the reality of our economy,” she said. “And I know that the social security system is designed as a kind of bulwark against poverty and to help us smooth life events over time. That only works well when you’ve got an economy that supports people’s living standards. “[The] social security system can never overcome the sort of deep inadequacies that there are in our economy. What we need is to change our economy, make sure that people have got chances and choices and opportunity ... So I think these changes are necessary. I know that the job is much bigger than that.”",

    "title": "Elon Musk announces exit from US government role after breaking with Trump on tax bill",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk has announced on social media that he is leaving his role in theTrump administration, a departure the White House confirmed was in process on Wednesday evening. “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” the billionairewrote on X, his social media platform. “The DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,” he said, referring to his “department of government efficiency.” A White House official told Reuters it was accurate Musk is leaving the administration and his “off-boarding will begin tonight.” The departure of a man who once appointed himself Trump’s “first buddy” was quick and unceremonious. Musk did not have a formal conversation with Trump before announcing he was leaving the administration, according to a source with knowledge of the matter, who added that his exit was decided “at a senior staff level.” Musk, the world’s richest person, has defended his role as an unelected official who was granted unprecedented authority by Trump to dismantle parts of the US government. His 130-day mandate as a special government employee in the Trump administration was set to expire about 30 May. Both Musk and the administration has said DOGE’s efforts to restructure and shrink the federal government will continue. Musk has beensignalling his departurefrom Washington, and his commitment to return his business ventures, all week. He sharply criticised Trump’s spending plan, and expressed frustration with the response to the efforts of his signature “department of government efficiency.” He criticised the president’s marquee tax bill, calling it too expensive and a measure that would undermine his work to make the government more “efficient.” “The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realised,” Musk told the Washington Post on Tuesday. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.” He also told the Post that Doge had been turned into a “whipping boy” that was criticised for anything that went wrong in the Trump White House. Musk had butted heads in private with some cabinet-level officials, and publicly attacked White House trade adviser Peter Navarro as a “moron” for dismissing Musk’s push for “zero tariffs” between the US and Europe. Musk had also recentlyexpressed frustration to White House officialsover a deal between Abu Dhabi and OpenAI, the Sam Altman-led rival to Musk’s own AI company, the New York Times reported. Musk had previously tried to derail the deal unless his company was included in it, theWall Street Journal reported. The billionaire’s recent “disillusionment” with politics was also influenced by thefailure of his Wisconsin judicial candidate, despite Musk spending $25m on the race, theNew York Times reported. Trump and DOGE have managed to cut nearly 12%, or 260,000, of the 2.3 million-strong federal civilian workforce largely through threats of firings, buyouts and early retirement offers, a Reuters review of agency departures found. Musk’s political activities have drawn protests and some investors have called for Musk to leave his work as Trump’s adviser and manage Tesla more closely. Having spent nearly $300m to back Trump’s presidential campaign and other Republicans last year, he said earlier this month he would substantially cut his political spending. “I think I’ve done enough,” Musk said at an economic forum in Qatar. While Musk had told Trump’s advisers this year thathe would give $100m to groupscontrolled by the president’s team before the 2026 midterms, theNew York Times reported, the money had not yet come in as of this week.

    "title": "Trump given 10 days to rescind all tariffs after block by US federal trade court - as it happened",
    "article_text": "Three-judge panel rules president exceeded authority granted to him by 1977 emergency powers law. This blog is now closed. A federal trade court on Wednesday blockedDonald Trumpfrom imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law. The ruling from a three-judge panel at the New York-based court of international trade came after several lawsuits arguing Trump had exceeded his authority, left US trade policy dependent on his whims, and unleashed economic chaos. “The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs,”the court ruled, referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. “The challenged Tariff Orders will be vacated and their operation permanently enjoined.” The panel, composed of judges appointed by Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama and Trump, questioned the US president’s use of the law, which does not mention tariffs. The ruling was per curiam, meaning that it was written on behalf of the full court. Trump is the only president who has claimed the authority to impose import taxes based on the statute. Tariffs must be approved by Congress, but Trump has asserted he has the power to act unilaterally because the country’s trade deficits amount to what he calls a national emergency. The lawsuit was filed by a group of small businesses, including a wine importer, VOS Selections, whose owner has said the tariffs are having a major impact and his company may not survive. Trump imposed tariffs on most of the countries in the world in an effort to reverse the US’s massive and longstanding trade deficits. He earlier put import taxes on goods from Canada,Chinaand Mexico, claiming that it was necessary to combat the illegal trafficking of fentanyl into the United States. The court also blocked what it called the “trafficking tariffs” “because they do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders”. The court also noted the wild swings in tariff levels, as Trump has announced and then backed down from high tariffs on specific countries or trading blocs over the past two months. The president was asked by a CNBC correspondent on Wednesday to respond to the fact that Wall Street analysts had started to refer to certain trades made in the expectation that he would impose and then back down from tariffs as “Taco trades”, an acronym for “Trump Always Chickens Out”. He was not happy to hear the phrase. This brings our live coverage of the second Trump administration to a close for the day, but we will resume the work of chronicling it all in real time on Thursday. In the meantime, here are the day’s top developments: All ofDonald Trump’s tariffs are illegal and must be removed, a three-judge panel at the US court of international traderuled unanimously. The court found that the president simply does not have the sweeping power to impose tariffs he claimed and gave the administration 10 days to reverse all of his executive orders doing so. Sorry, Wall Street traders, no moreTacos. “The US State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,”Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, said ina statement. TrumpnominatedEmil Bove, his former personal attorney who previously defended him in the hush-money case and now holds a senior position in the justice department,to serve as a federal appeals judge. Elon Musk’s work here is done, he said in a post on his social media platform, but the work of his so-called “department of government efficiency” will continue, despite its reputation for making headline-grabbing claims about supposedly wasteful spending it had discovered, almost all of which have proved to be eitherwildly exaggeratedorsimply untrue. Trump’s pardon spree continued, with clemency granted to more political supporters convicted of financial fraud, including two of the president’s fellow reality TV stars and a former New York representative who once threatened a reporter with physical violence. Ina poston his social media platform,Elon Musksuggested on Wednesday that his formal role in the Trump administration is ending. “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” Musk wrote. “The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government”, referring to the budget-cutting and downsizing team he called the “department of government efficiency”, which earned a reputation for making headline-grabbing claims about supposedly wasteful spending it had discovered, almost all of which proved to be eitherwildly exaggeratedorsimply untrue. Health secretaryRobert F Kennedy Jrsaid recentlythat no one should be taking medical advice from him, but, according to the health news website Stat, Kennedy’s deep suspicion of the messenger RNA platform has led his department to cancel a nearly $600m contract with Moderna “to develop, test, and license vaccines for flu strains that could trigger future pandemics, including the dangerous H5N1 bird flu virus”. The cancellation was not unexpected, but it follows Kennedy’s decision to remove the federal recommendation for pregnant people and children to be vaccinated against Covid-19, suggesting that he is personally limiting the options for Americans who want to get vaccinated but rely on health insurance that will not pay for shots the government does not recommend. For decades, since the 1918 flu pandemic killed millions of people, scientists have been preparing for the possibility that another pandemic strain of influenza could emerge. The order for Moderna to stop preparing to make mRNA vaccines for strains of the flu with pandemic potential will likely be seen as a setback for the nation’s pandemic preparedness. In 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic struck the United States, Trumpinsistedthat he had no idea that his own White House had eliminated a team responsible for global health security, which was created by his predecessor, Barack Obama, to coordinate the response to pandemic threats. The Washington Postreportsthat, despite what the Pentagon has said, “legal teams representing the US and Qatari governments have not finalized an agreement for transferring the luxury Boeing 747-8 jetliner that President Donald Trump wants for Air Force One amid outstanding requests by Qatar for Washington to clarify the transaction’s terms”. According to the Post’s unnamed official sources, the issue is that “Qatar is insisting that a memorandum of understanding between Washington and Doha specify that the aircraft’s transfer was initiated by the Trump administration and that Qatar is not responsible for any future transfers of the plane’s ownership, these people said”. Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School, is one of the lawyers who filed the successful suit against Trump’s tariffs on behalf of five US businesses that import goods. In a response to the sweeping victory on Wednesday in the US court of international trade, which ruled thatall of Trump’s tariffs are illegal and must be removed, Somin wrote ina poston the legal blogThe Volokh Conspiracythat the three-judge panel had agreed with him that the president simply does not have the authority to impose tariffs without the consent of Congress. Somin drew attention to this part of the court’s unanimous opinion: The Constitution assigns Congress the exclusive powers to ‘lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises,’ and to ‘regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.’ U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cls. 1, 3. The question in the two cases before the court is whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (‘IEEPA’) delegates these powers to the President in the form of authority to impose unlimited tariffs on goods from nearly every country the court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder. “Fromthe very beginning,” Somin wrote, “I have contended that the virtually limitless nature of the authority claimed by Trump is a key reason why courts must strike down the tariffs.” The US court of international trade judgment that all ofDonald Trump’s executive orders imposing tariffs are “invalid as contrary to law”ordersthe administration to issue the necessary administrative orders to remove the tariffs “within 10 calendar days”. The three-judge panel includedJane Restani, a Ronald Reagan appointee;Gary Katzmann, a Barack Obamaappointee; andTimothy Reif, who was nominated by Trump in 2018 while serving as a senior advisor to Trump’s US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. A federal trade court on Wednesday blockedDonald Trumpfrom imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law. The ruling from a three-judge panel at the New York-based court of international trade came after several lawsuits arguing Trump had exceeded his authority, left US trade policy dependent on his whims, and unleashed economic chaos. “The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs,”the court ruled, referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. “The challenged Tariff Orders will be vacated and their operation permanently enjoined.” The panel, composed of judges appointed by Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama and Trump, questioned the US president’s use of the law, which does not mention tariffs. The ruling was per curiam, meaning that it was written on behalf of the full court. Trump is the only president who has claimed the authority to impose import taxes based on the statute. Tariffs must be approved by Congress, but Trump has asserted he has the power to act unilaterally because the country’s trade deficits amount to what he calls a national emergency. The lawsuit was filed by a group of small businesses, including a wine importer, VOS Selections, whose owner has said the tariffs are having a major impact and his company may not survive. Trump imposed tariffs on most of the countries in the world in an effort to reverse the US’s massive and longstanding trade deficits. He earlier put import taxes on goods from Canada,Chinaand Mexico, claiming that it was necessary to combat the illegal trafficking of fentanyl into the United States. The court also blocked what it called the “trafficking tariffs” “because they do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders”. The court also noted the wild swings in tariff levels, as Trump has announced and then backed down from high tariffs on specific countries or trading blocs over the past two months. The president was asked by a CNBC correspondent on Wednesday to respond to the fact that Wall Street analysts had started to refer to certain trades made in the expectation that he would impose and then back down from tariffs as “Taco trades”, an acronym for “Trump Always Chickens Out”. He was not happy to hear the phrase. Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on theFederal Communications Commission, warned on Wednesday of the growing threat to press freedom by what she described as the Trump administration’s “campaign of censorship and control”. Speaking in Los Angeles as part of her First Amendment tour, the commissioner said the agency had veered from its responsibility as an independent regulator, accusing it of using its authority to intimidate journalists and punish news outletsDonald Trumpdisapproves of. “We’ve seen the FCC launch investigations into broadcasters because of their editorial decisions in their newsrooms,” she said at the event, organized by the media advocacy organization Free Press. “The point of all of these actions is to chill speech, to stop people from speaking out.” Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed FCC chair, has opened investigations into PBS and NPR, ramped up the investigation into CBS for alleged “news distortion” of its 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris andreinstated complaintsagainst ABC News over the way it moderated the pre-election TV debate between Trump and Joe Biden. The FCC also opened an investigation into ABC’s parent company, NBCUniversal, and Disney, saying that the companies’ diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts may violate equal employment opportunity regulations. “The point of all of these actions is to chill speech, to stop people from speaking out,” Gomez said, imploring the agency to “pivot away from these sham investigations” and return to its mission that initially drew her to the commission: helping broaden and improve internet and communication access for Americans. Gomez said the pressure was having an effect. “I have broadcasters that tell me they tell the reporters to please be careful about how they report news about this administration,” she said. “That is exactly what I don’t want to hear.” Commissioners are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. Gomez, who was appointed by Biden and confirmed by the Senate in 2023, may be risking her job by speaking out against an administration that has fired independent regulators and dissenting voices across the government. But she argued that it was her job to use her platform for as long as she had it. “I like to say that if I get fired, it isn’t because I didn’t do my job,” Gomez said. “It’s because I insisted on doing it.” Gomez said attacks on the press and free speech were far-reaching, pointing to the shuttering of outlets like Voice of America, attacks on unions and protesters, and investigations into law firms based on who they represent. She acknowledged the widening fear of dissent in government and civil society. But, she said, there was a reason to be hopeful. “This administration has so much power right now – and yet this censorship and control comes from a position of fear,” Gomez said, after hearing from several attendees who raised a broad set of concerns that ranged from alarm over the crackdown on protesters to the democracy-eroding damage caused by the spread of misinformation online. “Dissent should actually make us stronger as a country.” “Under President Trump’s leadership, the US State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,”Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, said ina statementon Wednesday. “We will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People’s Republic ofChinaand Hong Kong,” Rubio added. Rubio’s announcement thrilled at least one influential Trump supporter, the far-right activistLaura Loomer, who posted in response: “LET’S GO! DEPORT XI JINPING’S DAUGHTER!” It is unclear if Loomer’s claim that the Chinese leader’s daughter,Xi Mingze, currently lives in Massachusetts is true – and given her history of spreading baseless conspiracy theories, it could well be false – but the she did graduate from Harvard in 2014. “She had studied psychology and English and lived under an assumed name, her identity known only to a limited number of faculty and close friends—’less than ten,’ according to Kenji Minemura, a correspondent for theAsahi Shimbun, who attended the commencement and wrote about Xi’s experience in America”,Evan Osnos reportedon The New Yorker’s website in 2015. Although Xi Mingze reportedly returned to Beijing after graduation, Osnos noted that a study of foreign students by the National Science Foundation found that 92% of Chinese graduates with American PhDs still lived in the US five years after graduation. For Indians, the figure was 81%, for South Koreans 41% and for Mexicans 32%. Donald Trump’s justice department announced on Wednesday that it is opening an investigation into allegations that the state of California, local education officials and a school district “are engaging in a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of sex” by allowing transgender girls to compete in high school sports. The department said ina press releasethat a state law allowing transgender athletes to compete might violate Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination at schools. California’s attorney general,Rob Bonta; the state’s superintendent of public instruction,Tony Thurmond; the Jurupa unified school district; and the California Interscholastic Federation, which governs high school sports, were all sent letters of legal notice about the investigation. The announcement came one day after the president, reacting toa trans athlete’s success in a high school meet,postedon his social media platform that California “continues to ILLEGALLY allow” trans girls to compete in high school tournaments. “Please be hereby advised that large scale Federal Funding will be held back, maybe permanently, if the Executive Order on this subject matter is not adhered to,” the president added. This was not the first time that Trump had mistakenly referred to his own executive orders as if they have the force of federal law, which they do not. The justice department does, however, have the ability to charge states with violations of laws previously passed by Congress. “Title IX exists to protect women and girls in education,”Harmeet Dhillon, the new assistant attorney general for civil rights, said in a statement. “It is perverse to allow males to compete against girls, invade their private spaces, and take their trophies,” added Dhillon, a Republican operative from California who finished second in the race to be chair of the Republican National Committee in 2023. The department also said that it had “filed a statement of interest in federal court in support of a lawsuit filed by and on behalf of girls’ athletes to advance the appropriate interpretation of Title IX to ensure equal educational opportunities and prevent discrimination based on sex in federally funded schools and athletic programs”. That lawsuit, on behalf of two members of a girls’ cross-country team at a Riverside high school, was filed after a 16-year-old runner, identified as TS, was dropped to the junior varsity team after a transgender athlete the same age ran 52 seconds faster than she did the first time they competed. TS and a younger teammate, identified as KS, reportedly got in trouble with the school for protesting the inclusion of their trans classmate by wearing shirts with the phrases “Save Girls’ Sports” and “It’s Common Sense. XX ≠ XY”. The school’s athletic department forced the students to conceal or remove the shirts, likening them to swastikas. “Every day, my child has to go to school and see kids in shirts in stanch opposition of who she is,” the parents of the trans athlete said ina statementto Spectrum News in December, when the suit was filed. “She began to see people she thought were her friends supporting a movement that rejected her.” Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, a former Chicago gang leader who had been serving multiple life sentences for more than five decades. Hoover, 74, is the co-founder of Gangster Disciples, a gang described in court documents as “large and vicious” that sold “great quantities of cocaine, heroin, and other drugs in Chicago”. He was convicted in 1973 for ordering the killing of a 19-year-old neighborhood drug dealer and given a sentence of 150 to 200 years. In 1997, he was given six life sentences after being found guilty of federal drug conspiracy, extortion, money laundering and continuing to engage in a criminal enterprise. He has been serving out his sentence at ADX Florence prison facility in Fremont county, Colorado. The commutation, firstreportedby Notus, was confirmed by a White House official. Read more: Although the White House has yet to release the details, multiple reports say thatDonald Trump’s pardon spreefor political supporters has accelerated on Wednesday. Asfirst reported by NY1, the New York cable news channel, Trump has pardonedMichael Grimm, a Republican who represented Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn in Congress from 2011 to 2015. Grimm, a former Marine and FBI agent, resigned from Congress after a tax fraud conviction. He went on to work as a commentator on the pro-Trump cable news outlet Newsmax, and has recently dedicated his social media feed to praising Trump and his aides. “Who else thinks Stephen Miller is awesome!!? Reply with a [heart]!!” Grimmwrote on Xabove a portrait of Miller earlier this month. During his stint in Congress, Grimm was perhaps best known for threatening to throw an NY1 reporter off a balcony in the Capitol after the reporter asked him to address an investigation into his campaign finances. “Let me be clear to you. If you ever do that to me again, I’ll throw you off this fucking balcony,” he told the reporter, Michael Scotto, during the exchange, which was captured on video. When the reporter pushed back, telling the then representative that it was a valid question, Grimm responded: “No. No. You’re not man enough. You’re not man enough. I’ll break you in half. Like a boy.” Last year,Grimmwas paralyzed from the chest down after being thrown from a horse during a polo tournament. Donald Trumpsigned pardons for reality TV stars Julie and Todd Chrisley, who have been serving federal prison sentences since being convicted three years ago of bank fraud and tax evasion. Savannah Chrisley, the couple’s daughter, postedan imageon Instagram of what appeared to be Trump displaying the two signed pardons in the Oval Office. A vocal Trump supporter, she endorsed Trump in a speech at the Republican national convention last year. Although she has called the case against her parents politically motivated, they were indicted in 2019 by BJay Pak, a US attorney nominated by Trump. Trump’s pardons mean the couple best known for the TV series Chrisley Knows Best would be freed from federal prison. Todd Chrisley, 57, was incarcerated at a minimum-security prison camp in Pensacola, Florida. Julie Chrisley, 52, was imprisoned at a facility in Lexington, Kentucky. Ina poston X thanking the new US pardon attorney, the Republican operativeEd Martin, Savannah Chrisley wrote that her parents “are home”. Prosecutors at the couple’s 2022 trial said the Chrisleys spent lavishly on high-priced cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel after taking out fraudulent bank loans worth millions of dollars and hiding their earnings from tax authorities. The White House released video of Trump calling Savannah Chrisley to tell her that he was pardoning her parents on Tuesday, and saying they had been “given a pretty harsh treatment based on what I’m hearing”. A federal judge in New Jersey said on Wednesday that the Trump administration’s bid to deport Columbia University student and pro-Palestinian activistMahmoud Khalilis likely unconstitutional. The US district judge Michael Farbiarz in Newark, New Jersey, said he will issue a further order with next steps later on Wednesday, Reuters reports. Khalil is currently in immigration detention in Louisiana. Nico Perrinoof the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expressioncalled ita “mixed ruling” on Khalil’s motion for a preliminary injunction, because the judge wrote that he “is likely to succeed on his First Amendment claim, but likely to lose on a residency application issue. For that reason, the judge denied the request for a preliminary injunction, pending further briefing on the First Amendment issue.” WhileOpenAIled a group of US tech giants who won a deal last week to build one of the world’s largest AI data centers in Abu Dhabi, behind the scenesElon Muskworked hard to try to derail the deal if it didn’t include his own AI startup, people familiar with the matterhave told the Wall Street Journal. According to some of the people, “on a call with officials at UAE AI firm G42, Musk warned those assembled that their plan had no chance of Trump signing off on it unless Musk’s companyxAIwas included in the deal”, writes the WSJ. The report goes on: “Musk had learned just before Trump’s mid-May tour of three Gulf countries that OpenAI chief executiveSam Altmanwas going to be on the trip and that a deal in the UAE was in the works, and grew angry about it, according to White House officials. He then said he would also join the trip, and appeared alongside Trump in Saudi Arabia. “After Musk’s complaints, Trump and US officials reviewed the deal terms anddecided to move forward. The White House officials said Musk didn’t want a deal that seemed to benefit Altman. Aides discussed how to best calm Musk down, one of the officials said, because Trump andDavid Sacks, the president’s AI and crypto adviser, wanted to announce the deal before the end of the president’s trip to the Middle East.” A federal judge has blocked the US transportation department from withholding federal funding fromNew Yorkas the Trump administration seeks to killManhattan’s congestion pricing program. The US district judgeLewis Liman, who a day earlier issued a temporary restraining order, issued a preliminary injunction preventing the federal government from withholding approval of or funding for New York projects. Liman said in his 109-page opinion that the transportation department had “challenged Plaintiffs to a game of chicken”, saying New York could either kill the program or “else may brace for impact and prepare to suffer the effects” of government compliance measures.",

    "title": "US federal court blocks Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs",
    "article_text": "A federal trade court on Wednesday blocked Donald Trump from imposingsweeping tariffson imports under an emergency-powers law. The ruling from a three-judge panel at the New York-based court of international trade came after several lawsuits arguing Trump has exceeded his authority, left US trade policy dependent on his whims and unleashed economic chaos. “The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs,” the court wrote, referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. “The court does not pass upon the wisdom or likely effectiveness of the president’s use of tariffs as leverage. That use is impermissible not because it is unwise or ineffective, but because [federal law] does not allow it,” a three-judge panel said in the decision. The Trump administration has reportedlyfiled a notice of appeal, and White House officials responded to the ruling with public statements challenging the court’s authority in the case.. “It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency,” Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement to Reuters. Financial markets, in contrast, cheered the ruling. The US dollar rallied following the court’s order, surging against currencies such as the euro, yen and the Swiss franc in particular. Wall Street futures rose and equities across Asia also rose. The ruling, if it stands, blows a giant hole through Trump’s strategy to use steep tariffs to wring concessions from trading partners, draw manufacturing jobs back to US shores and shrink a $1.2tn US goods trade deficit, which were among his key campaign promises. Without the instant leverage provided by the tariffs of 10% to 54% that Trump declared under the IEEPA, which is meant to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats during a national emergency, the Trump administration would have to take a slower approach of lengthier trade investigations under other trade laws to back its tariff threats. The decisions of the Manhattan-based court of international trade, which hears disputes involving international trade and customs laws, can be appealed to the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington DC, and ultimately the US supreme court. At least seven lawsuits are challenging the levies, the centerpiece of Trump’s trade policy.Tariffsmust typically be approved by Congress, but Trump says he has the power to act because the country’s trade deficits amount to a national emergency. He imposed tariffs on most of the countries in the world at one point, sending markets reeling. The plaintiffsargued that the emergency powers law does not authorize the use of tariffs, and even if it did, the trade deficit does not meet the law’s requirement that an emergency be triggered only by an “unusual and extraordinary threat.” The US has run a trade deficit with the rest of the world for 49 consecutive years. Trump imposed tariffs on most of the countries in the world in an effort to reverse America’s massive and longstanding trade deficits. He earlier plastered levies on imports from Canada, China and Mexico to combat the illegal flow of immigrants and the synthetic opioids across the US border. His administration argues that courts approved then president Richard Nixon’s emergency use of tariffs in 1971, and that only Congress, and not the courts, can determine the “political” question of whether the president’s rationale for declaring an emergency complies with the law. Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs shook global financial markets and led many economists to downgrade the outlook for US economic growth. So far, though, the tariffs appear to have hadlittle impact on the world’s largest economy. While Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, greeted the news of the ruling with apublic social media postclaiming “the judicial coup is out of control”, Trump did not immediately post a response on Truth Social. He responded on his platform instead to what he characterized as afavorable ruling in another lawsuit, in which he issuing the Pulitzer board, which awards America’s most prestigious journalism prizes. The tariffs lawsuit was filed by a group of small businesses, including a wine importer, VOS Selections, whose owner has said the tariffs are having a major impact and his company may not survive. A dozen states also filed suit, led by Oregon. “This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can’t be made on the president’s whim,” Oregon attorney general Dan Rayfield said.

    "title": "Methamphetamine trafficking surges from ‘Golden Triangle’ region",
    "article_text": "Drug production and trafficking has surged in the infamous “Golden Triangle“, where the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand meet, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has warned in a new report on the scale of the regional trade in synthetic drugs. The UNODC said a record 236 tonnes of methamphetamine were seized last year in the East and Southeast Asia regions, marking a 24 percent increase in the amount of the narcotic seized compared with the previous year. WhileThailand became the first countryin the region to seize more than 100 tonnes of methamphetamine in a single year last year – interdicting a total of 130 tonnes – trafficking of the drug from Myanmar’s lawless Shan State israpidly expanding in Laosand Cambodia, the UNODC said. “The 236 tons represent only the amount seized; much more methamphetamine is actually reaching the market,” the UNODC’s acting regional representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, Benedikt Hofmann, said in a statement. “While these seizures reflect, in part, successful law enforcement efforts, we are clearly seeing unprecedented levels of methamphetamine production and trafficking from the Golden Triangle, in particular Shan State,” Hofmann said. Transnational drug gangs operating in East and Southeast Asia are also showing “remarkable agility” in countering attempts by regional law enforcement to crack down on the booming trade in synthetic drugs. Myanmar’s grinding civil war, which erupted in mid-2021, has also provided favourable conditions for anexpansion of the drug trade. “Since the military takeover in Myanmar in February 2021, flows of drugs from the country have surged across not only East and Southeast Asia, but also increasingly into South Asia, in particular Northeast India,” the report states. The UNODC’s Inshik Sim, the lead analyst for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, said countries neighbouring Myanmar are becoming key trafficking routes for drugs produced in the Golden Triangle. “The trafficking route connecting Cambodia with Myanmar, primarily through Laos PDR, has been rapidly expanding,” Sim said, using the acronym that is part of Laos’s official name, the People’s Democratic Republic. “Another increasingly significant corridor involves maritime trafficking routes linking Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, with Sabah in Malaysia serving as a key transit hub,” he said. Evolving, cell-based transnational organized crime groups based in East and#SoutheastAsiaare increasingly adopting technologies across the entire drug supply chain while converging with other organized crime activities. Read more in our latest report:https://t.co/oL416cuZJ3pic.twitter.com/pqUfX5FmnF — UNODC Southeast Asia-Pacific (@UNODC_SEAP)May 28, 2025 The UNODC report also notes that while most countries in the region have reported an overall increase in the use of methamphetamine and ketamine – a powerful sedative – the number of drug users in the older age group has grown in some nations. “Some countries in the region, such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, have reported consecutive increases in the number of older drug users, while the number of younger users has declined,” the UNODC report states, adding that the age trend needed to be studied further. The UNODC’s Hofmann said the decline in the number of younger drug users admitted for treatment may be due to targeted drug use prevention campaigns. “It will be key for the region to increase investment in both prevention and supply reduction strategies,” he added.",

    "title": "China launches landmark mission to retrieve pristine asteroid samples",
    "article_text": "China has successfully launched a spacecraft as part of its first-ever mission to retrieve pristine asteroid samples, in what researchers have described as a “significant step” in Beijing’s ambitions for interplanetary exploration. China’s Long March 3B rocket lifted off at about 1.31am local time (18:30 GMT) on Thursday from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in southwest China’s Sichuan province. It was carrying the Tianwen-2 spacecraft, a robotic probe that could make China the third nation to fetch pristine asteroid rocks. Announcing the launch, Chinese state-run news outlets said the “spacecraft unfolded its solar panels smoothly”, and that the China National Space Administration (CNSA) had “declared the launch a success”. Over the next year, Tianwen-2 will approach a small near-Earth asteroid some 10 million miles (16 million km) away, named “469219 Kamoʻoalewa”, also known as 2016HO3. The spacecraft is scheduled to arrive at the asteroid, which researchers believe is potentially a fragment of the Moon, in July 2026. It will then shoot the capsule with rock samples back to Earth for a landing in November 2027. If successful, China would become only the third country to carry out such a mission after Japan first fetched samples from a small asteroid in 2010, followed by the United States in 2020. The People’s Daily state-run newspaper described the mission’s purpose as an “endeavour to shed light on the formation and evolution of asteroids and the early solar system”. The newspaper quoted Shan Zhongde, the head of the CNSA, as saying that the mission represented a “significant step in China’s new journey of interplanetary exploration”. He added that the mission was expected to yield “groundbreaking discoveries and expanding humanity’s knowledge of the cosmos”. The mission has multiple goals over the “decade-long expedition”, according to Chinese state media, including “collecting samples from near-Earth asteroid 2016HO3” and “exploring the main-belt comet 311P”. It will also aim to measure the “physical parameters of the two celestial targets”, including their “orbital dynamics, rotation, size, shape and thermal properties”. The samples will be used to determine the “physical properties, chemical and mineral composition and structural characteristics” of asteroids, according to researchers working on the project. As a quasi-satellite of Earth that has orbited the Sun in a synchronised path with the Earth for nearly a century, 2016HO3 has a diameter of between 120 feet (40 metres) and 300 feet (100 metres). China has swiftly expanded its space programmes and embarked on several landmark missions in recent years, including landing robots on thefar side of the Moonand collecting humankind’s first-ever samples from the area in June last year. China is also running its own Tiangong space station in orbit – the only operational space station other than the International Space Station (ISS) – after the US barred it from participating in the ISS. In April, three crew members landed back in the country’s north after spendingsix months on boardTiangong in what was the longest-ever mission in space by Chinese astronauts. Beijing has also invested heavily in planned crewed missions to the Moon that would see Chinese astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030. The US has also stated its aim to put astronauts back on the Moon for the first time since 1972, with NASA planning to launch its Artemis 3 mission in 2026 at the earliest.",

    "title": "Elon Musk announces departure from US President Trump’s administration",
    "article_text": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk has announced that he is leaving the administration of United States President Donald Trump, where he led a months-long project to cut costs in the federal government. “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” he wrote on the social media platform X on Wednesday evening. “The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,” Musk said, referring to the Department of Government Efficiency, which he was a top figure in. An unnamed White House official confirmed the news with Reuters and the Associated Press. Musk joined the Trump Administration in January with the promise of slashing at least $1 trillion from the US federal budget, although the DOGE website shows it has only achieved about $175bn in savings, or $1,088.96 per US taxpayer. Musk’s departure coincides with the 130-day limit for “special government employees”, and the White House said DOGE efforts to cut federal spending and restructure the government would continue, according to Reuters. The relationship between the billionaire and the US president, however, appears to have cooled since last year, when Musk poured nearly $300m into Trump’s presidential run. Over the weekend, Musk publiclyexpressed concerns about Trump’s flagship“big, beautiful bill”– a 1,000-page piece of legislation that extends the president’s 2017 tax cuts while adding work requirements for food assistance and Medicaid. “I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk told the news programme CBS Sunday Morning. The bill also allocates spending for some of Trump’s signature projects, like building a wall between the US and Mexico and raising funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The “big, beautiful bill” passed in the House of Representatives last week and will next be discussed by the Senate. If passed in its current format, the bill will cancel out DOGE’s work because it is expected to raise the US deficit by $3.9 trillion by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. “I think a bill can be big, or it can be beautiful, but I don’t know if it can be both. My personal opinion,” Musk told CBS. When asked about Musk’s concerns, Trump told reporters that work on the bill was still under way. “We will be negotiating that bill, and I’m not happy about certain aspects of it, but I’m thrilled by other aspects of it,” Trump said. “That’s the way they go.” Trump has avoided criticising Musk directly, but US media has reported clashes between the billionaire and members of the Trump Cabinet, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio. US news outlet Politico reported that Musk’s s exit was already under discussion as early as April, citing unnamed US officials, after he clashed with top White House officials and staff. Some of Musk’s DOGE cuts have also turned off US voters, including in crucial swing states. Earlier this year, the billionaire failed to secure a win for a conservative candidate in a race for the Wisconsin Supreme Court despite spending $20m. An April opinion poll from The Washington Post and ABC News also showed Musk’s approval rating at just 35 percent for his work with the Trump administration. Following an uptick in public scrutiny, Musk said earlier this month that he would scale back his political spending and re-focus his attention on companies like Tesla, which just suffered its worst quarter since 2022. “Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms. I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out,” Musk posted on his X platform over the weekend.",

    "title": "‘Not aid, but humiliation’: A desperate search for food in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip –Jehad Al-Assar left his tent in central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah early in the morning on a new and exhausting journey to get food for his family. His destination on Wednesday: an aid distribution point in Rafah, in the far south of Gaza, run by the United States-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Jehad walked a “gruelling” 10km (6.2 miles) to reach the site, driven along primarily by the weight of responsibility for his pregnant wife and two hungry daughters. With starvation spreading throughout Gaza, a direct result of Israel’s months-long blockade on the territory, the GHF site was Jehad’s only hope. This is despite the controversy surrounding the organisation, whose own headresigned on Sunday, saying that the GHF could not adhere “to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence”. The GHF’s lack of experience in dealing with aid distribution was highlighted on Tuesday, when at least threePalestinians were killedin the chaos that surrounded the relief effort. But in Gaza, people are hungry and desperate. Jehad is among them. After walking for 90 minutes, the 31-year-old reached the iron gates of the distribution centre, alongside thousands of others, before they suddenly opened. “Crowds surged in – thousands of people. There was no order at all,” Jehad told Al Jazeera. “People rushed towards the yard where aid boxes were stacked and moved into the inner hall, where there were more supplies.” “It was chaos – a real struggle. Men, women, children, all crammed together, pushing to grab whatever they could. No queues, no system – just hunger and disorder,” Jehad added. Inside the hall, people snatched whatever they could carry. “Anyone who could lift two boxes took them. Sugar and cooking oil were the priorities. They grabbed what they wanted and rushed out.” “There was no trace of humanity in what happened,” he said. “I was nearly crushed by the crowd.” Just a short distance away, armed foreign forces stood watching without intervening. Jehad said he approached one of them and confronted him. “I told them, ‘You’re not helping – you’re overseeing a famine. You should leave. You’re not needed here.'” Jehad managed to retrieve only a few items: cans of tuna, a small bag of sugar, some pasta and a packet of biscuits scattered on the ground. He carried them in a plastic bag slung over his shoulder and made the long journey back home. “I only got a little. I was afraid to stay longer and get trampled in the stampede – but I had to bring back something. My girls need to eat. I have no choice,” he said. When he returned to the tent, his daughters greeted him joyfully – even for the little he had brought. “My wife and I divide the food we bring home so the kids can eat over several days. We often skip meals. The children can’t endure this… and I bear the full responsibility for feeding them,” he said. Awad Abu Khalil was also among the desperate crowds on Wednesday. The 23-year-old described the crowds rushing to get to the food as “apocalyptic”. “Everyone was running. It was chaos. The aid was piled up and everyone just attacked it, grabbing what they could.” Awad said he heard gunfire in the distance, likely targeting young men trying to bypass the designated routes. He expressed deep frustration with the staff. “I expected the American staff to distribute aid at tables, handing each person their share – not this madness.” The images that emerged on Tuesday and Wednesday have added fuel to international criticism of the GHF, with representatives from several countries denouncing Israel’s decision to prevent the United Nations and international humanitarian organisations from bringing aid into Gaza. Israel stopped the entry of aid into Gaza in early March, while a ceasefire was still ongoing. It has since unilaterally broken the ceasefire, and doubled down in its war on Gaza, with the official death toll now more than 54,000 Palestinians. “We used to receive aid from international agencies and the UN,” said Jehad. “It was delivered by name, in an organised way – no chaos, no humiliation.” By the end of Wednesday, Gaza’s Government Media Office reported that at least 10 Palestinians desperately seeking aid had beenkilled by Israeli forcesin the previous 48 hours. Awad and Jehad were both able to return home with some food. Jehad said that his wife and mother made bread from the pasta, soaking it and then kneading it into dough. His wife used the sugar to make a simple pudding for the children. He will return on Thursday, he said. Even that is better than it is for most people in Gaza. Walaa Abu Sa’da has three children. Her youngest is only 10 months old. The 35-year-old could not bear watching people return to the displacement camp in al-Mawasi in Khan Younis carrying food while her children starved, so she decided to go to Rafah by herself. “I fought with my husband who refused to go out of fear of the [Israeli] army. I swore I would go myself,” Walaa told Al Jazeera. Entrusting her children to her sister, she joined the crowd heading towards the distribution site. “My children were on the verge of starving. No milk, no food, not even baby formula. They cried day and night, and I had to beg neighbours for scraps,” she said. “So I went, regardless of what my husband thought.” But by the time Walaa made it to Rafah, it was too late. “People were fighting over what little remained. Some were carrying torn parcels,” she said. Walaa left the distribution site empty-handed. On the way back, she saw a man drop a bag of flour from his torn parcel. “I picked it up and asked if I could have it,” she said. “He shouted, ‘I came all the way from Beit Lahiya in the far north [of Gaza] to get this. I have nine children who are all starving. I’m sorry, sister, I can’t give it away,’ and he walked off. “I understood, but his words broke me. I wept for what we’ve become.” Walaa described the experience as deeply humiliating. She was filled with shame and inferiority. “I covered my face with my scarf the whole time. I didn’t want anyone to recognise me going to get a food parcel,” Walaa, who is a teacher with a bachelor’s degree in geography, said. Despite her sorrow, Walaa says she will do it again if needed. “There’s no dignity left when your children are crying from hunger. We won’t forgive those who allowed us to reach this point.”",

    "title": "Trump commutes sentence of former Gangster Disciples leader Larry Hoover",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 28, 2025 / 11:27 PM EDT/ CBS Chicago President Trump on Wednesday commuted the sentence of notorious former Chicago street gang leader Larry Hoover, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover, 74, the co-founder of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples, was already serving a 200-year sentence on state charges in Illinois for the 1973 murder of 19-year-old neighborhood drug dealer William \"Pooky\" Young, when he was convicted of federal charges in 1997, and sentenced to six life terms. Hoover was among 39 Gangster Disciples leaders indicted in August 1995 in Operation Headache, a six-year effort by the feds to infiltrate Gangster Disciples. Federal prosecutors had accused him of leading a criminal enterprise to continue overseeing the gang while in prison in Illinois. Hoover is currently serving six life sentences in a maximum security prison in Colorado, according to federal prison records. It's unclear how soon he will be released from federal custody, but he still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence in Illinois, dating back to 1973 for Young's murder. Hoover's attorneys said he has spent nearly 30 years in solitary confinement at ADX Florence, a maximum security prison in Colorado that they described as \"the most restrictive, draconian supermax prison in the United States.\" In a statement, Hoover's attorneys, Jennifer Bonjean and Justin Moore, said they are \"thrilled\" to see he will be released from federal custody. \"The Courts have demonstrated a complete unwillingness to consider Mr. Hoover's considerable growth and complete rehabilitation. Despite the Court's unwillingness to do the right thing, Mr. Hoover has been able to keep his voice alive through the incredible work of many advocates and supporters. Thankfully, Mr. Hoover's pleas were heard by President Trump who took action to deliver justice for Mr. Hoover.\" \"Just thrilled for him, thrilled for his family, thrilled for his supporters — who have been chanting, 'Free Larry Hoover!' for a long time,\" Bonjean added in a follow-up interview. Bonjean also represented Hoover when he was up for parole on his state sentence in 2022 and was denied. \"He is eligible for resentencing, but the courts have been unwilling to give him that opportunity — notwithstanding the fact that he has literally done every single thing a human being could do to show that they have been rehabilitated,\" said Bonjean. In 1993, Hoover spoke to former CBS News Chicago reporter John Davis. At the time, Hoover was 42 years old and had already served 20 years in prison. \"I've done my time,\" Hoover said in the 1993 interview. \"I paid my debt to society.\" In the interview with Davis, the leader of the Gangster Disciples and convicted murderer he'd had a lot of time to think about ways to stop the gang violence on the streets of Chicago. \"Anytime you do extensive time it can have two effects — it can harden you, or it can make you think,\" Hoover said at the time, \"and I've thought.\" He said in the 1993 interview that he had done a lot of thinking about the senseless gang violence plaguing the streets of Chicago at the time. \"One teenager don't like the other teenager because of the way he wear his hat, because his ideology is different from his; a Disciple don't like a Vice Lord,\" Hoover said in the interview. \"We're all Black people. There's no difference.\" At that time, Hoover, also known as King Larry, admitted being part of a fragile gang truce in the city and organizing a protest over plans to close healthcare clinics in African American neighborhoods. Ron Safer, the lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial, expressed disappointment in the news of Hoover's sentence being commuted. \"I was disappointed,\" Safer said. \"I do not think that this is an appropriate end to the Larry Hoover story — at least the federal part of it.\" Safer said Hoover was perhaps the most notorious criminal the state of Illinois has ever known. \"He was convicted of running a continuing criminal enterprise that had approximately 30,000 members across 28 states, selling over $100 million worth of drugs in the state of Illinois alone each year,\" said Safer, \"and he ran that entire operation with ruthless efficiency from prison, where he was serving a state sentence for double murder.\" Safer also emphasized that about Hoover had been recorded saying teenagers needed to sell drugs for his criminal organization. The recording was made a year after the Gangster Disciples leader was interviewed on CBS Chicago. \"There was another tape where Larry Hoover said, 'You have to share your drugs with these children — and I'm talking about 12 years old, 13 years old, 14 years old — so that they can sell it, and they can have something',\" Safter said, \"and he said, 'Make them know that with you, they are somebody, and without you, they are nobody.'\" Again, Safer said those comments were made by Hoover after the Gangster Disciples said he was redeemed, and said he understood that all of the violence in the city should be stopped. Meanwhile, Wallace \"Gator\" Bradley, a former Gangster Disciples enforcer, has long advocated for Hoover's release. \"I've been calling for it since '92 or '93,\" said Bradley. \"I know that he has served his time. I'm happy beyond measure.\" Harold \"Noonie\" Ward, a former high-ranking member of the Gangster Disciples, served time with Hoover and is now an antiviolence advocate. \"Everybody deserves a second chance,\" said Ward, adding that he is not surprised that President Trump commuted Hoover's sentence. But Safer said he does not agree in Hoover's case. \"I believe in mercy. I believe in redemption,\" he said. \"I also believe that there are some crimes so heinous, so breathtakingly evil, that the justice system requires they be punished to the full extent of the law.\" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has not commented on whether he would consider commuting Hoover's sentence at the state level. Todd Feurer is a web producer for CBS Chicago.

    "title": "Trump administration will \"aggressively revoke\" Chinese students' visas",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 28, 2025 / 9:57 PM EDT/ CBS/AP The federal government will begin revoking the visas of some Chinese international students, including those studying in \"critical fields,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday — thelatest restrictionon foreign students. \"Under President Trump's leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,\" Rubio wrote in a statement. Rubio also said the government will \"revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong.\" China is the second-largest country of origin for international students, behind only India. In the 2023-24 school year, more than 270,000 international students were from China, making up roughly a quarter of all foreign students in the United States. The action comes at a time of intensifying scrutiny of the ties between U.S. higher education and China. House Republicans this month pressed Duke University to cut its ties with a Chinese university, saying it allowed Chinese students to gain access to federally-funded research at Duke. Last year, House Republicans issued a report warning that hundreds of millions of dollars in defense funding was going to research partnerships linked to the Chinese government, providing \"back-door access to the very foreign adversary nation whose aggression these capabilities are necessary to protect against.\" The announcement came a day after the State Department told embassies and consulates worldwide to temporarily stop scheduling new student visa interviews, in a cable obtained byCBS News. The cable said the department is preparing \"expanded social media vetting\" of visa applicants. The two policy changes from the State Department added to uncertainty for America's international students, who have faced intensifying scrutiny from the Trump administration. The government has attempted to revoke legal status for thousands of international students, many of whom appeared to draw federal scrutiny due tominor legal infractions— though a federal judge hashalted that practice. And the administration hassought to deportseveral pro-Palestinian student activists under a law allowing visas to be revoked if somebody poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" Earlier this week, the Trump administrationtried to haltall international student enrollments at Harvard University. A judgeblocked the move, part of awider battlebetween the government and the Ivy League school over its handling of campus protests. President Trump said Wednesday that Harvard, whose current student population is more than 25% international, should limit that percentage to about 15%. \"I want to make sure the foreign students are people that can love our country,\" Mr. Trump said. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 28, 2025 / 9:31 PM EDT/ CBS News Elon MuskannouncedWednesday night that his time as a \"special government employee\" with the Trump administration is winding down. \"As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President [Trump] for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\" Musk wrote on X. He added that his Department of Government Efficiency's \"mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\" Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur, will begin his offboarding process with the White House on Wednesday night, according to an administration official. Musk's DOGE team has upturned the government through employee cuts at nearly every federal agency and the termination of billions of dollars of government contracts. Musk has said the effort has cut around $160 billion in spending. However, some of the spending cuts cited by DOGE havecontained errors, and one reportestimatesthe cuts could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity and the cost of putting staff on leave and re-hiring some workers. The White House said in February that Musk is a \"special government employee,\" or SGE. The designation allowed him to work for the executive branch, subject to different ethics rules than federal employees. But SGEs are limited to working 130 days in a 365-day period. Friday, May 30, would mark 130 days since Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term and when Musk's work at DOGE began. Musk's announced departure comes a day after a\"CBS Sunday Morning\" interviewwhere he criticized the budget bill passed by House Republicans last week. The bill has been backed heavily by Mr. Trump, who dubbed it the \"big, beautiful bill.\" \"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" correspondent David Pogue in a broadcast exclusive interview. In an April earnings call with Musk's car company Tesla, he told investors his time at DOGE would \"drop significantly\" in May so he could focus on his companies. Musk suggested he would spend one to two days a week on government work, \"as long as the president would like me to do so.\" Some Tesla investors pushed Musk todial back his involvementin the Trump administration, worrying his attention was divided and the carmaker's brand was at risk. White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said in a Fox Business interview on Wednesday that the Trump administration will make some of DOGE's cuts permanent through a bill in Congress known as arescission package, which is a way for Congress to cancel funds it previously appropriated but that the federal government has not yet spent. Vought said that cuts to foreign aid and the U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as funds to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, would be included first.

    "title": "Judge directs Trump officials to lift pause on certain immigration applications",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 28, 2025 / 9:14 PM EDT/ CBS News A federal judge in Massachusetts on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to lift a pause it imposed on variousimmigrationapplications, saying it was not in the public interest for hundreds of thousands of immigrants to lose their legal status in the U.S. Therulingby U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani is a reprieve for many immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, Ukraine and other parts of the world whose ability to remain and work in the U.S. lawfully had been threatened by several Trump administration actions. Agreeing with pro-immigrant advocates who sued the Trump administration, Talwani found that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious, in violation of federal administrative law. \"This court emphasizes, as it did in its prior order, that it is not in the public interest to manufacture a circumstance in which hundreds of thousands of individuals will, over the course of several months, become unlawfully present in the country, such that these individuals cannot legally work in their communities or provide for themselves and their families,\" Talwani wrote in her order. The programs at the center of Talwani's order rely on a legal immigration authority known as parole, which allows the federal government to temporarily admit foreigners on humanitarian or public interest grounds. President Trump's appointees have sought to curtail the use of parole, arguing that the authority was broadly abused by the Biden administration. Talwani directed the Trump administration to enda pauseit quietly enacted in February to suspend the processing of immigration benefit applications filed by immigrants allowed into the U.S. under several Biden administration programs that relied on the parole authority. That pause mainly affected 240,000 Ukrainians allowed into the U.S. under a sponsorship program known as Uniting for Ukraine set up after the Russian invasion of their homeland in February 2022, as well as 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who benefited from another Biden-era parole policy. It prevented those who entered the U.S. under those policies from obtaining other forms of legal status, like asylum, Temporary Protected Status or permanent residency. Talwani ordered the government to lift anotherpause, issued in January that has barred immigration officials from considering parole extension requests from Afghans, Ukrainians and other immigrant populations granted entry into the U.S. through parole programs, mostly under the Biden administration. Her ruling also blocked the Trump administration from taking any actions to stop processing parole applications undera longstanding programdesigned to give temporary legal relief to the immigrant relatives of U.S. service members or veterans. The administration has said this program has not been affected by its efforts to restrict the use of parole. Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security and its sub-agency, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which oversees the parole programs, did not immediately comment on Wednesday's court order. The ruling by Talwani is the second time she ruled against the Trump administration's efforts to scale back parole programs. In April, Talwaniblockedthe administration from moving forward with a plan to terminate the legal status and seek the deportation of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who came to the U.S. under the parole program for citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Trump administration justified the move by saying the parole initiative was plagued by fraud and inadequate vetting procedures. The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to suspend Talwani's ruling from April, saying federal courts are unjustifiably interfering with Mr. Trump's immigration agenda. \"The court's order blocks the Executive Branch from exercising its discretionary authority over a key aspect of the Nation's immigration and foreign policy and thwarts Congress's express vesting of that decision in the Secretary, not courts,\" the Justice Department wrote ina May 8 requestto the Supreme Court.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 28, 2025 / 8:45 PM EDT/ CBS News The federal government is working to secure a charter flight to return a man who was removed from the U.S. back to America so he can have proper due process proceedings, the Justice Department said incourt documentsfiled Wednesday. Last week, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphyorderedthe man, only known by the initials O.C.G., to be returned to the United States after he found that necessary due process steps in his removal proceedings were \"ignored\" by the Trump administration. O.C.G.'s attorneys argued that he has no criminal history and sought asylum in the United States after multiple violent attacks against him in his native country of Guatemala. In March 2024, O.C.G. entered the United States illegally and was deported. After making it back to the United States again last year, he presented himself to Border Patrol for asylum proceedings. An immigration judge found in February 2025 that O.C.G. would face serious harm if he were sent back to Guatemala and ordered a \"withholding of removal\" that barred deportation back to his home country. Two days after the immigration judge's February decision, O.C.G. says he was placed on a bus and removed without due process to Mexico, where his attorneys said he was previously held for random and raped during his second attempt to get to the United States. He submitted evidence at his immigration hearing of his experiences in Mexico, and as a result the immigration judge said that O.C.G. could not be removed to a country other than Guatemala without additional due process. After O.C.G. was sent to Mexico by the United States, Mexican authorities removed him to Guatemala, where he remains in hiding, according to court documents. \"[The] immigration judge told O.C.G.— consistent with this Court's understanding of the law—that he could not be removed to a country other than his native Guatemala, at least not without some additional steps in the process,\" Murphywrote in his orderlast week. \"Those necessary steps, and O.C.G.'s pleas for help, were ignored.\" Murphy had previously ordered additional fact finding in the case, after the Trump administration submitted a declaration under oath that O.C.G. told government officials that he had no fear of being sent to Mexico. O.C.G had previously submitted a declaration to the court stating that he was told at the last minute before his removal that he was being sent to Mexico, and that he was denied a request to speak to his attorneys beforehand. The Justice Department admitted to Murphy that there was no witness who could verify the government's account of O.C.G.'s removal under oath and the declaration was made in error. \"The only evidence before the Court therefore is O.C.G.'s uncontroverted assertion that he was given no notice of his transfer to Mexico and no opportunity to explain why it would be dangerous to send him there,\" Murphy wrote in his order mandating the man's return. \"Defendants' retraction of their prior sworn statement makes inexorable the already-strong conclusion that O.C.G. is likely to succeed in showing that his removal lacked any semblance of due process,\" the judge added. The Trump administration's push to ramp up deportations has drawn other scrutiny from other federal judges who argue deportees aren't being given enough due process. Another judge ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the government admitted was sent to El Salvador in error. The Supreme Court affirmed that ruling, but Abrego Garcia remains in a Salvadoran prison, and the Trump administration says it's up to that country's government to return him.

The Trump administration has leaned into cryptocurrency, looking to ease regulations, promote growth in the industry, and bring it into the mainstream. Alongstanding backerof cryptocurrencies, Vance owned between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of Bitcoin, according to an August2024 financial disclosure. \"We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy, and are here to stay,\" Vance said Wednesday. Vance said it's been a while since he's been to a conference with \"this level of energy,\" adding, \"but I promise I'm not just saying that to juice my own memecoins.\" Vance gave few policy specifics in his speech. But he insisted that, through decentralized finance, crypto has \"transformed\" how Americans make transactions and acts as a \"hedge\" against bad policy. \"Crypto is a hedge against bad policymaking from Washington, no matter what party's in control,\" he said. \"It's a hedge against skyrocketing inflation, which has eroded the real savings rates of Americans over the last four years. And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics.\" Vance urged Congress to pass theGENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are a type of crypto tied to an underlying asset such as the U.S. dollar. \"In this administration, we do not think that stablecoin's threatened the integrity of the United States dollar, quite the opposite,\" Vance said Wednesday. \"In fact, we view them as a force multiplier of our economic might.\" Vance said he knows a lot of people in 2024 chose to \"speak up\" and \"get involved,\" and he needs them to step up again. \"Unless you guys get involved in politics, politics is going to ignore this industry,\" Vance said. \"... While Bitcoin is digital, none of you are. None of us are. What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, it will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we don't make the right decisions. So the first piece of advice, the first thing that I'd ask you, is to take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond.\" The Las Vegas event is also featuring ahandful of other Trump backers: His two eldest sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who have invested in crypto ventures, are speaking Wednesday on a panel about \"the rise of new bitcoin business models.\" Chris LaCivita, who co-managed Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, and David Sacks, a venture capitalist who serves as the White House'scrypto czar, spoke on Tuesday. Vance is the highest-ranking sitting politician to address the Bitcoin Conference, which describes itself as \"the world's largest gathering of bitcoiners\" and often draws crypto-friendly lawmakers. Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, was the headline speaker last year. Vance headlined a fundraiser hosted by MAGA Inc. on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, where tickets were priced at $1 million a head, CBS News has learned. The fundraiser was first reported by The Washington Post. Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, the popular trading platform for stocks and crypto, told CBS News at the conference that the Trump administration's approach to the crypto industry is welcome news. \"Under the previous administration, we have been subject to…it was basically a carpet bombing of the entire industry,\" Tenev said. \"And now suddenly, you're allowed to play some offense…And we have an administration that's open to the technology,\" he added.\" Bitcoin — and cryptocurrency more generally — hasgrown in prominenceand drawn allies from both parties, despiteskepticismabout its volatility. The price of Bitcoin, the world's most widely used cryptocurrency, has leaped nearly 60% in the last year. Mr. Trump was once a crypto skeptic, calling Bitcoin a \"scam\" whose value is \"based on thin air.\" But in his second term, he has enthusiastically boosted crypto and promised toreversestrict Biden-era regulations. Mr. Trump and his family also have financial interests in crypto, which makes up $2.9 billion of his net worth, according toone recent report. Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announcedTuesdayit is raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin. Meanwhile, businesses linked to the president launched a Trump-branded \"meme coin\" earlier this year, and Mr. Trumphosted the digital currency's top investorsat his Virginia golf club last week. The president and his sons are linked to crypto exchangeWorld Liberty Financial. And Eric Trump co-founded aBitcoin mining venturethat's seeking to go public. The moves have drawn criticism from Democrats and some ethics expertswhoargueMr. Trump's crypto ventures pose a conflict of interest, and investing in them could be a quick route to gaining access to the president. Tenev weighed in on Trump's personal investment in crypto. \"Of course, it is a potential conflict,\" Tenev said, but added, \"The idea that they're motivated by personal gain…I don't know if that has too much backing in fact.\" The GENIUS Act, the once-bipartisan Senate bill aimed at regulating stablecoins, bled support after Democratic lawmakers pushed for restrictions onelected officialsbuying or selling crypto — with some Democrats directly citing Mr. Trump's crypto investments. Senators ultimatelyvoted to advance the billearlier this month. The White House has strongly denied any conflict-of-interest issues, saying Mr. Trump's assets areheld in a trustmanaged by his children.

    "title": "What to know about escaped prisoner dubbed the \"Devil in the Ozarks\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 28, 2025 / 8:42 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Officials scoured Arkansas' rugged Ozark Mountains for a former police chief and convicted killer whoescaped from prisonover the weekend. Grant Hardin, who briefly served as police chief for the small town of Gateway, near the Arkansas-Missouri border, was serving a decadeslong sentence for murder and rape. Known as the \"Devil in the Ozarks,\" he escaped Sunday from the North Central Unit, a medium-security prison in Calico Rock. Hardin's escape happened days after 10 men fled aNew Orleans jailby going through a hole behind a toilet. Eight of those fugitives havesince been captured. Here's what to know about Hardin and his escape: Hardin escaped from the prison Sunday afternoon by impersonating a corrections officer \"in dress and manner,\" according to a court document. A prison officer opened a secure gate, allowing him to leave the facility. The outfit was not a standard inmate or correctional uniform, said Rand Champion, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Corrections. Officials are working to determine how he was either able to get the uniform or manufacture it himself. Video surveillance shows Hardin escaped at about 2:55 p.m. on Sunday, Champion said. Officials announced his escape about two hours later. But how he got out of the prison and escaped into a rural part of the state, as well as whether he had any help is still unclear. Prison officials say they are investigating what led up to the escape \"to help determine any assistance he may have had.\" \"An active search remains in effect involving a number of law enforcement agencies from across the state,\" the Arkansas Department of Correctionssaid in an updateTuesday afternoon. Champion said the decision to house Hardin in a medium-security facility, which has a capacity of about 800 people, weighed the \"needs of the different facilities and inmates\" and \"assessments\" of his crimes. \"As individuals go, there's very few people that have that many violent charges that they've been convicted of,\" said Bryan Sexton, the current prosecutor in Benton County, where Hardin was convicted in 2017. \"Our law enforcement partners in that part of the state are working hard to make sure they pick him up as quickly as possible and get him back in custody.\" Hardin had been held at the Calico Rock prison since 2017 after pleading guilty to first-degree murder for fatally shooting James Appleton, 59. Appleton, a Gateway water department employee, was shot in the head in 2017. Police found his body inside a car. Hardin was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Hardin's DNA was entered into the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, and it matched the 1997 rape of a teacher at an elementary school in Rogers, a city in northwestern Arkansas. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison for that crime. He was a police officer in Eureka Springs, not far from Rogers, at that time. Cheryl Tillman, the mayor of Gateway, is one of Appleton's sister. CBS News' Ian Lee asked Tillman what her reaction was when she found out Hardin had escaped prison. \"My heart just sank,\" Tillman said. \"You know, I thought, oh my gosh, what are we gonna do now?\" Tillman told CBS News that \"anxiety is really high.\" \"I get really nervous and scared. And I don't like guns, but we have one loaded now,\" Tillman said. Hardin became police chief of Gateway, a town of about 450 people, in 2016. Virtually overnight, people in the community described in the2023 HBO documentary\"Devil in the Ozarks\" a dramatic shift. \"He was out chasing cars for no reason,\" said Tillman. \"He was pulling guns on the citizens here in Gateway and then as time went on with him being the police chief things just started going down hill fast.\" The documentary revealed a crucial run-in between Hardin and Appleton in the Spring of 2016 in which Appleton stood up to Hardin about fixing a police car. A Benton county sheriff's office lieutenant described several times when they got into each other's faces and the dislike they both felt toward one another. The city council gave him an ultimatum: resign or be fired. He stepped down four months after taking the position and nine months later, he killed Appleton. The \"Devil in the Ozarks\" documentary revealed key details about the bubbling resentment Hardin felt toward Appleton as well as revealing accounts of the moments right before and after the murder. Then-Gateway Mayor Andrew Tillman, Cheryl Tillman's husband and Appleton's brother-in-law, described being on the phone with him when he was shot, while local resident John Bray spoke about driving past Appleton's car when the shooting happened. He was the first to find his body and identified Hardin as the shooter. \"I heard what I thought was someone had fired a riffle,\" he said. \"I went back and I seen it looked like he had been shot,\" he added, wiping away tears. The documentary also includes security video of Hardin at a restaurant with his family just after the shooting and the police interrogation in which he tells law enforcement he has \"the right to be silent\" and opted not to give a statement. Authorities are using canines, drones and helicopters to search the rugged northern Arkansas terrain, Champion said. Although he did not reveal the exact areas of the search, he did say it has expanded as more time has elapsed since the escape. Officials have faced challenges searching the areas as it's very rocky and heavy rain has fallen in recent days. The area around the prison is a rural part of the state, which can make Hardin's escape more difficult. In a small community, there's a higher chance someone will recognize him and alert the authorities, said Craig Caine, a retired inspector with the U.S. Marshals who has handled many cases involving escaped prisoners. The Division of Correction and the Division of Community Correction are following leads with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 28, 2025 / 8:39 PM EDT/ CBS News New York City— Frank Bisignano, commissioner of the Social Security Administration, told CBS News that he believes technology, and specifically artificial intelligence, could be the key to improving his agency's customer service, despite recent changesthat have promptedconcern among some of the nearly 69 million Americans that receive Social Security each month. \"We're bringing a massive technology effort to transform the servicing agenda,\"Bisignanosaid. \"We're gonna bring AI into the phone system...I intend it to be completed this year.\" The agency gets about 390,000 calls per day, according to SSA data. The average wait time for those calls as of April was 68 minutes,down from112 minutes in January. \"I say, we're gonna meet our beneficiaries where they want to be,\" said Bisgnano, who was CEO of financial services company Fiserv before being tapped by President Trump in December to lead the SSA. \"You want to come into a field office? We we'll always be there. You want to meet us on the web? We will be there. And you want to meet us on the phone, we'll be there.\" The SSA announced in March that it would require in-person identity checks at field offices for new and existing beneficiaries, with some limited exemptions. Following backlash to the move, however, the White House in Aprilbacked off that requirement, saying that seniors and other recipients could verify their identities over the phone. About six million seniors would have faced a 45-mile trip to reach an SSA office, according to ananalysisfrom the Center on Budget and Public Policies. There are questions about how Bisgnano plans to implement changes despite a smaller workforce. In February, the agency said it intended to cut itsstaffing levelsdown from about 57,000 to 50,000, a 12% reduction. The website for the White House's Elon Musk-ledDepartment of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has identified more than a dozen field offices for closure. Bisignano argues that the cuts won't prevent the SSA from increasing its efficiency, which he believes can be achieved \"through technology and process engineering.\" The SSA turns 90 this year, but as the U.S. ages, the gap between benefit payments and revenue is widening. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2033, the fund used to pay retirement and survivor benefits will be exhausted. \"There's lots of senators that I've heard from that have all ideas about how to fix it,\" Bisignano said. \"So, we need to just go to work on how to fix it.\" Bisignano is seeking to reassure Americans who are planning to file for Social Security in 10 years that they will still receive their full benefits, not just a portion of them. \"Everybody is committed to Social Security for the rest of time.\" Maurice DuBois is an Emmy Award-winning journalist and co-anchor of the \"CBS Evening News\" in New York, the flagship evening broadcast on CBS News.

    "title": "Court strikes down Trump's tariffs, ruling them illegal",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 28, 2025 / 8:36 PM EDT/ CBS News A federal court on Wednesday froze many of the large-scale tariffs imposed by President Trump on virtually every foreign nation, ruling the levies exceed the president's legal authority. The ruling — issued by a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade — halted thesweeping 10% tariffsMr. Trump assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner on \"Liberation Day\" last month, with higher tariffs threatened for dozens of countries. The court also blocked a separate set of tariffsimposedon China, Mexico and Canada by the Trump administration, which has cited drug trafficking and illegal immigration as its reasoning for the hikes. The Trump administration has justified the tariffs by citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, whichgives the president the powerto regulate imports during certain emergency situations. But the court on Wednesday rejected the government's interpretation of the law, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs. \"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday. The court said Mr. Trump's global 10% tariffs aren't authorized by IEEPA because they're designed to deal with trade imbalances between the U.S. and the rest of the world, which the judges said should fall under non-emergency legislation. And the China, Canada and Mexico tariffs aren't legal because they \"do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders,\" the court also found. The three judges who wrote Wednesday's ruling were nominated to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan, former President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump in his first term. The Trump administration signaled in court papers it willappeal the rulingto the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded to the ruling by defending the reasoning for the tariffs, saying the U.S.'s trade deficits with other countries have \"created a national emergency that has decimated American communities.\" \"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness,\" Desai said in a statement. Tariffs are a signature part of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. He argues the levies are necessary to boost U.S. manufacturing and end what he views as unfair trade practices. But the moves have rattled financial markets and drawn rebuke from Democrats, as well as some Republicans. Mr. Trump has stood by his tariff strategy but halted many of the levies while vowing to negotiate with U.S. trading partners. A set of so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countrieswere paused in Aprilfor a period of at least three months. Goods that fall under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement were exempted from25% tariffs. Massive tariffs on Chinese goods havealso been cut backamid negotiations. Meanwhile, the tariffs have drawn lawsuits from businesses, Democratic states and other parties. Wednesday's ruling was linked to two lawsuits: One from a group of businesses that say they have been harmed by the tariffs, and one from several states. Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs have raised legal doctrineslong championed by conservative lawyers and judgesto restrict the authority of executive branch agencies. Those include the major questions doctrine, which says Congress needs to give clear authorization for federal agencies to decide issues of major economic significance, and the nondelegation doctrine, which holds that Congress can't delegate its legislative power to the executive branch.

    "title": "Federal trade court rules against several Trump tariffs",
    "article_text": "A federal three-judge panel on Wednesday ruled against several of President Donald Trump's tariffs on international trading partners, ruling that he had exceeded his authority. The Trump administration quickly moved to appeal in the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In their judgment Wednesday, the U.S. Court of International Trade panel said that Trump’s tariffs lacked “any identifiable limits,” and found that the decades-old International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a federal law that Trump cited in many of his executive orders, did not “delegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President.” “We instead read IEEPA’s provisions to impose meaningful limits on any such authority it confers,\" they wrote. The ruling blocks most of the tariffs Trump has rolled out so far in his second term, including the 10% rate applied to most trading partners and those on China. It also includes fentanyl-related levies on Canada and Mexico. The panel's judgment on Wednesday pertained to two lawsuits over Trump's tariffs — in one agroup of statesled by Arizona and Oregon had sued over the tariffs, and in another, severalsmall businesses had sued,both arguing that Trump had exceeded his authority. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, said in astatementthat the tariffs \"were poised to devastate our state’s economy.\" \"I will continue to fight for affordability for Arizonans and against President Trump’s illegal abuses of power,” she added. Democratic Attorney General Dan Rayfield of Oregon lauded the ruling as a victory for working families and small businesses. \"President Trump’s sweeping tariffs were unlawful, reckless, and economically devastating. They triggered retaliatory measures, inflated prices on essential goods, and placed an unfair burden on American families, small businesses and manufacturers,\" Rayfield said. White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that trade  deficits \"have created a national emergency that has decimated American communities, left our workers behind, and weakened our defense industrial base — facts that the court did not dispute.\" \"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency,\" Desai added. In early evening trading, Nasdaq futures jumped nearly 2% while S&P 500 futures rose about 1.7%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rallied 520 points, or nearly 1.2%. In the weeks since the president rolled out his massive tariff plan on April 2, markets have lost and regained tens of trillions of dollars of wealth — and that’s just counting the U.S. market. At one point, some of Wall Street’s top banks dialed up their recession predictions to as high as 60%. Since April 2, the 30-stock Dow remains slightly negative, but the broad S&P 500 is up 3.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen 8.5% throughout the wild ride. The Russell 2000, which tracks smaller companies, is up 1% since April 2.",

    "title": "U.S. will 'aggressively' revoke Chinese students' visas, Marco Rubio says",
    "article_text": "HONG KONG — The United States will start “aggressively” revoking the visas of Chinese students, Secretary of StateMarco Rubiosaid Wednesday, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. The announcement is the latest move in the Trump administration’s campaign against U.S. universities and international students in particular, after it revoked thousands of students’ visas, detained or deported other students over political activism and sought tobar international students from enrolling at Harvard University. Rubiosaid in a statementthat visa criteria would also be revised to “enhance scrutiny” of all future visa applications from the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese territory ofHong Kong. “Under President Trump’s leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students,” he said. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment outside of business hours. Beijing has previously expressed opposition to the “politicization” of educational exchanges and said it would “safeguard the legitimate rights and interests” of Chinese students overseas. NBC News reportedTuesday that the Trump administration had stopped scheduling new interviews for foreign nationals seeking visas to study in the United States, citing an internal State Department cable. The cable said the suspension was in preparation for expanded social media screening of applicants. China is thesecond-biggest source of international studentsin the United States afterIndia, though numbers have been dropping in recent years amid growing U.S.-China tensions and disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic. About 277,000 Chinese students were in the United States in the 2023-24 academic year, down from a peak of more than 370,000 in 2019. By contrast, there were only about 800 Americans studying in China last year, down from a peak of about 15,000 in 2014. Though Rubio did not specify what he meant by “critical fields,” both the U.S. and China are concerned about each other’s advancements in strategically sensitive areas such as biotechnology, quantum computing and artificial intelligence. In March, House Republicans introduced a bill that wouldend the issuance of student visas to Chinese nationalsseeking to study at U.S. universities or take part in exchange programs, citing national security concerns. The legislation is unlikely to pass amid widespread criticism, including that it is racist and xenophobic. House Republicans have also sought torevive the China Initiative, a national security program from the first Trump administration that was shut down after a series of failed prosecutions of Chinese students and researchers accused of espionage. International students make up about 6% of the total population of U.S. higher education institutions overall. Many universities rely heavily on the tuition charged to international students, which is often higher than that charged to American students. According to theAssociation of International Educators, a nonprofit group based in Washington, international students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported more than 378,000 jobs during the 2023-24 school year. Seeking to draw top talent, universities outside the U.S. have already started reaching out to students at Harvard, where about 20% of international students are from China. In Hong Kong, which is home to multiple top-ranked universities, the city’s top leader,John Lee, said Tuesdaythat he welcomed any students “who face discrimination and unfair treatment in the U.S.”",

    "title": "Elon Musk officially leaves the White House",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk's days working at the White House are over. Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO whom President Donald Trump enlisted to cut waste in the federal government, started offboarding from his role Wednesday, a White House official told NBC News, a day after he criticized a Republican bill to fund much of Trump’s agenda. Two sources later confirmed to NBC News that Musk's more than114-day long tenureas a special government employee officially concluded Wednesday evening. Musk commented on his exit Wednesday on X, his social media platform. He called for the “DOGE mission” to become “a way of life throughout the government,” referring to his Department of Government Efficiency initiative. “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,”wrote Musk, the richest person in the world. While a senior White House official has previously stressed that Musk is a friend of Trump’s, the White House did not provide an on-the-record comment Wednesday about Musk’s departure. NBC News has reportedthat special government employees, a class of temporary worker that included Musk, can typically work up to 130 days in a calendar year, though the days can be split up. The White House first publicly acknowledged Musk’s role on Feb. 3, so he was most likely nearing the end of that tenure. Musk’s official departure came at a charged moment in his relationship with Trump. On Tuesday, CBS News’ “Sunday Morning” shared a clip of him sharing his disappointment in the “massive spending bill,” which he said “undermines” the work of his DOGE operation, which has aimed to reduce federal spending by slashing the size of the federal workforce, cutting government programs and eliminating grants deemed wasteful. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the Republican funding package would add $2.3 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years,largely because ofthe extensions of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and new expenditures that outweigh the savings. Musk initially set out to cut upward of $2 trillion through the operation, a goal he later significantlywalked back. Now he leaves the government with DOGE having thus far fallen well short of the trillions of dollars of savings he once touted on the campaign trail. As of Wednesday evening, the DOGE government websiteclaimed $175 billion in savings, though itsclaimshave been found to bequestionable. Trump responded to Musk's criticisms Wednesday afternoon in the Oval Office, defending the funding package. He said the legislation would deliver on several of his key priorities, but he also noted the complexities of passing such a sprawling bill through a sharply divided House. “My reaction’s a lot of things. No. 1, we have to get a lot of votes. We can’t be cutting a — you know — we need to get a lot of support, and we have a lot of support. We had to get it through the House,” Trump said. Musk was among the most visible people in the early days of the second Trump administration, securing Trump's favor after having fueled his 2024 presidential campaign withupward of $250 million, according to campaign finance reports. He was frequently seen alongside Trump, often wearing a Trump hat while appearing with one of his young children. Musk appeared to relish his role as Trump’s waste and fraud czar, taking the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Februarywith a sizable chain sawto tout his cost-cutting initiative. Musk also at one pointthreatened to use his wealthto fund challengers to any Republicans who dared to oppose Trump’s agenda. But behind the scenes, tensions between Musk and other Trump administration members mounted, with some of those making their way to the public through news reports abouttense meetingsandshouting matches. Musk also took some of his grievances public, includingcriticism of Trump’s tariffs. Meanwhile, Musk’s public profile suffered — as did the perception of his most consumer-centric business, Tesla. Public poll numbers showed that he and DOGE wererelatively unpopular, and Tesla vehicles and dealershipsbecame the targets of protests and vandalism. Tesla’s stock is down 11% so far this year. Trump continued to support Musk, at one point in March turning the South Lawn of the White House intoan impromptu Tesla showroomand buying one of the vehicles. Musk’s power, both in terms of his cash contributions as well as his political clout, took a hit in late March when Republicanslost a high-profile judicial election in Wisconsinin which Musk spent heavily and became a target for Democrats. Musk had maintained that his participation in the Trump administration and DOGE was temporary, but in recent weeks he has signaled that he may pull back from politics more broadly. Over the weekend,he wrote on Xthat he was \"Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms.\" Last week, hesaid he planned to scale down his sizable spending on politics, though said he would spend in the future if he saw a reason to do so. “I don’t currently see a reason,” he said. While Musk has said DOGE will continue to operate, it’s unclear just how much pull it will have without him at the helm. The legacy of the Musk-led effort will most likely be reflected legislatively, as the House is expected to soon put forth a rescissions package to codify DOGE cuts. “We want to make sure that Congress passes its first rescissions bill, including the DOGE [cuts], and we will send more if they pass it,” Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought told Fox Business on Wednesday.",

    "title": "Family of suspect in Beanie Babies mansion attack said they tried to warn authorities days before",
    "article_text": "Relatives of the man accused ofviolently attacking a woman in the California mansion of Beanie Babies billionaireTy Warner said Wednesday that in the days before the assault, they repeatedly tried to warn authorities that he might hurt someone. In a statement to NBC News, Russell Phay’s family said that beginning on May 19 — two days before the alleged assault that left Linda Malek-Aslanian in a coma — his siblings repeatedly called the state agency in Colorado that oversees parolees and tried to sound the alarm. “We left multiple messages over the course of the week expressing our fear that Russell was spiraling and could harm someone,” the family said in the statement, referring to the Colorado Department of Corrections. For many years, they said, Phay has experienced severe schizophrenia, a condition that they said transformed him from a kind, loving child into a person who is unstable, at times violent and no longer recognizable. “Many of us have had to distance ourselves from Russell for our own safety, though it has never been easy to do so,” the family said. “Even with our estrangement, we tried to take action when we saw warning signs that he was in crisis.” Weeks before the California attack, the family began getting worrisome phone calls from Phay. He made little sense, a sibling said in an interview, and he provided no details about where he was. He made no specific threats, but the calls prompted the family to reach out to authorities, said the sibling, who asked not to be identified because they didn’t want to be publicly associated with Phay. They said that they never heard back from the Corrections Department and that they learned of Phay’s arrest only when he called a family member from jail on Sunday, four days after the attack at Warner’s home, the family said. The Colorado Corrections Department didn’t respond to requests for comment Wednesday. “This tragedy might have been preventable, and we are devastated that our efforts to sound the alarm went unanswered,” the family said. Phay, 42, has a criminal history that spans multiple states and includes guilty pleas to assault, stalking and menacing, court documents and public records show. In Colorado, he was ordered to remain on parole for two years after the completion of a 512-day prison sentence in 2021 for a case that appeared to be one of his most recent in that state, according to the records. It isn’t clear whether Phay was on parole at the time of the alleged attack in Santa Barbara, but the siblings said representatives from the state Corrections Department told the family he was. The family member said relatives weren’t sure where Phay was when they first reached out to authorities. In an effort to track him down, the family first called officials in Texas and Nevada, where, the sibling said, Phay had prior criminal cases, but were told he wasn’t on probation or parole in those states. After being told that he was on parole in Colorado, the family focused their attention on trying to alert the person the representatives identified as Phay’s parole officer, the sibling said. Public records show that one of Phay’s most recent criminal cases in Colorado appears to have been in December 2020, when he was accused of assaulting someone with a baseball bat, a complaint shows. He pleaded guilty to felony menacing in June 2021 and was sentenced the following month to two years in prison, with 218 days suspended, court records show. Authorities haven’t said why they believe Phay broke into Warner’s home in Montecito, the wealthy enclave just outside Santa Barbara, and assaulted Malek-Aslanian. Afterward, Phay barricaded himself inside the house and tried to flee by leaping from a second-story bathroom, the sheriff’s office said. Phay was arrested and charged with attempted murder, burglary, kidnapping, assault and other crimes. His attorney declined to comment. Representatives for Warner haven’t responded to requests for comment, nor have relatives of Malek-Aslanian. In the statement, Phay’s family said they are “heartbroken by the horrific incident involving our brother, Russell M. Phay, and the innocent woman who was so grievously harmed. Our hearts are with her, her family, and everyone affected by this senseless act of violence. We are deeply saddened by the pain and trauma caused.” The relatives added they are grieving not only for the victim and her loved ones, “but also for the brother we once knew — and the system that continues to fail so many families like ours.”",

    "article_text": "We do this thing as sports fans where we say a team or player can’t win it all, until they do. Some fans wanted to break up Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown in Boston until the organization’s patience paid off with a banner No. 18. It’s not new — there was a time when it was popular to say Michael Jordan couldn’t win the big one — and it’s not just basketball, ask the Philadelphia Eagles’ Jalen Hurts. There were plenty of fans and some knowledgeable people inside basketball heading into the playoffs who were not convinced that Oklahoma City was any more than a good regular-season team. All those questions have been answered. Those critics have been silenced. “These guys are uncommon. They do everything right. They’re high character,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. With a chance to make the NBA Finals on the line, the Oklahoma City Thunder blew out the Minnesota Timberwolves, 124-94, to take the series 4-1. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 34 and was rightfully named Western Conference Finals MVP.

The Thunder will be heavy favorites to win the title, regardless of whether the Pacers or Knicks come to town next week. While SGA was fantastic and Chet Holmgren added 22 points and Jalen Williams 19, it was the Thunder defense that won them this game, and this series. Oklahoma City came out on Wednesday with defensive pressure that once again had Minnesota on its heels, and the Timberwolves started the game 1-of-11, putting them in a hole.

Minnesota scored 32 first-half points with an offensive rating of 61.5 (compared to 125 for Oklahoma City), and they trailed by 33 at that point. Julius Randle and Anthony Edwards combined for `17 first half points on 17 shot attempts with five turnovers. The Timberwolves had 21 turnovers in this game, limiting those was a key coming into the series but something they proved unable to do. While the Timberwolves made a couple of pushes, the game was never in doubt in the final 24 minutes. “We just struggled to find a rhythm,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. “Everyone was kind of trying to do it all by themselves.

    "title": "Trump admin's effort to deport Mahmoud Khalil is likely unconstitutional, judge rules",
    "article_text": "A federal judge in New Jersey ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration's effort to deport pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil on foreign policy grounds is most likely unconstitutional but stopped short of releasing him from detainment. In a lengthy order, U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz said Khalil was \"likely to succeed\" in his claim that the administration’s determination that he is a threat to U.S. foreign policy is \"unconstitutionally vague.\" Farbiarz said therarely used provision in immigration law the government cited for Khalil's detentionwas \"unconstitutional as applied\" to Khalil and added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not \"affirmatively determine\" that Khalil's conduct had any impact on U.S. relations with another country. Farbiarz said deporting Khalil under the provision would be “unprecedented.” Khalil’s legal team said in a statement, “The district court held what we already knew: Secretary Rubio’s weaponization of immigration law to punish Mahmoud and others like him is likely unconstitutional.” They added that his continued detention is an “affront to justice” and vowed to continue fighting for his freedom. The Justice and State departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday night. The ruling is the first time a federal judge has weighed in on the constitutionality of the Trump administration's use of the immigration provision. Farbiarz ordered Khalil's legal team to submit additional information while he considers its request to release Khalil and block the administration from invoking the law against other noncitizens who have spoken out in support of Gaza or were critical of Israel while the case proceeds. Still, Farbiarz said, Khalil's attorneys have not made a \"substantial argument\" against the government's allegations that Khalil withheld information from his permanent residency application. Farbiarz said his attorneys are permitted to address the issue in subsequent filings. Khalil, who is a permanent U.S. resident, was arrested at his Columbia University apartment in March as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on foreign students who his administration alleges are a threat to U.S. foreign policy. After he was arrested in New York, Khalil was transported briefly to a facility in New Jersey and then transferred to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Jena, Louisiana, where he is currently held. Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Wednesday night: \"It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should no longer be in this country.\" Khalil’s attorneys have submitted evidence rebuking allegations of antisemitism, and they denied he ever provided support to Hamas or any other terrorist organization. Multiple federal judges in recent weeks have ordered the government to release other pro-Palestinian activists, includingMohsen Mahdawi,Rümeysa ÖztürkandBadar Khan Suri, from immigration detention while they fight the administration's efforts to deport them.",

    "title": "Trump commutes sentence of Chicago gang founder after lobbying by Ye",
    "article_text": "Many Americans may not know Larry Hoover Sr. beyond a passing reference to him in Rick Ross’ 2010 hit single “B.M.F (Blowin’ Money Fast),” in which Ross sings, “I think I’m Big Meech (Woo), Larry Hoover ...” But on Wednesday, President Donald Trump commuted the six life sentences that Hoover, a Chicago gang founder, was serving for a 1997 conviction in federal court. Trump commuted the sentences after a campaign by hip-hop artist Ye, aka Kanye West, now Kim Kardashian’s ex-husband, who has lobbied Trump in the Oval Office to consider releasing Hoover. Hoover, though, will not be freed. He will be transferred from the federal “Supermax” prison in Colorado, where is held now, to a state prison in Illinois to serve the rest of a 200-year sentence for crimes he was separately convicted of in state court. Hoover founded the Gangster Disciples, a Chicago-based criminal organization that sold cocaine and other narcotics beginning in the early 1970s. Called the “chairman of the board” and “the king” of the gang, he was also declared “one of the most notorious criminals in Illinois history.” Prosecutors have said in court filings that “Hoover directed violence and drug trafficking in Chicago from at least 1970 until 1995.” Prosecutors presented evidence at trial that the Gangster Disciples profited $109 million each year from the sale of narcotics, “a substantial proportion of which went straight to Hoover’s family’s pockets.” Hoover’s attorneys praised Trump’s decision. “The Courts have demonstrated a complete unwillingness to consider Mr. Hoover’s considerable growth and complete rehabilitation,” Jennifer Bonjean and Justin Mooretold CBS Newsin a statement. “Despite the Court’s unwillingness to do the right thing, Mr. Hoover has been able to keep his voice alive through the incredible work of many advocates and supporters,\" they added. \"Thankfully, Mr. Hoover’s pleas were heard by President Trump who took action to deliver justice for Mr. Hoover.” Larry Hoover Jr., Hoover’s son, has called for his father’s release for years and was featured in the 2021 Kanye West song “Jesus Lord.” Hoover has said from prison that he changed the name of his group from “Gangster Disciples” to “Growth and Development.” He said he now discourages violence and has made education mandatory for his followers, pushing inmates to develop job skills they can use after they are released. Hoover’s family has said he is no longer associated with the Gangster Disciples. But federal prosecutors recently have said Bureau of Prisons intelligence records show that Hoover did not want to be disassociated from the gang. In September, attorneys for the Justice Department argued in court that “Hoover remains the heralded leader of the GDs, despite the intensive monitoring to which he is subject at Florence ADX,” which is the highest-level security prison in the United States and home to convicted terrorists and Juán \"El Chapo\" Guzmán. They strongly urged the court to decline any effort to release Hoover as part of the “First Step Act” supported by Kardashian, which Trump signed into law during his first administration. “Hoover has well earned his life sentence, and he is not the type of defendant Congress intended to benefit in enacting the First Step Act,” prosecutors wrote. During the 2108 Oval Office meeting with Trump, Ye urged him to commute Hoover’s sentence. “The reason why they imprisoned him is because he started doing positive for the community,” Ye said. “He started showing that he actually had power, that he wasn’t just one of a monolithic voice, but he could wrap people around. “So there’s theories that there’s infinite amounts of universe and there’s alternate universe,” Ye added. “So it’s very important for me to get Hoover out, because in an alternate universe, I am him. And I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago.” After news of the commutation broke Wednesday,Ye posted on X, “WORDS CAN’T EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR OUR DEVOTED ENDURING PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FREEING LARRY HOOVER.”",

    "title": "Harvard agrees to relinquish early images of enslaved people, ending a long legal battle",
    "article_text": "BOSTON — Harvard University will relinquish175-year-old photographsbelieved to be the earliest taken of enslaved people to a South Carolina museum devoted to African American history as part of a settlement with a woman who says she is one of the subjects’ descendants. The photos of the subjects identified by Tamara Lanier as her great-great-great-grandfather Renty, whom she calls “Papa Renty,” and his daughter Delia will be transferred from the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology to the International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina, the state where they were enslaved in 1850 when the photos were taken, a lawyer for Lanier said Wednesday. The settlement marks the end of a 15-year battle between Lanier and the university to release the 19th-century daguerreotypes, a precursor to modern-day photographs. Lanier’s attorney Joshua Koskoff told The Associated Press that the resolution is an “unprecedented” victory for descendants of those enslaved in the U.S. and praised his client’s yearslong determination in pursuing justice for the people she had identified as her ancestors. “I think it’s one of one in American history, because of the combination of unlikely features: to have a case that dates back 175 years, to win control over images dating back that long of enslaved people — that’s never happened before,” Koskoff said. A key question of the case was whether Harvard could legally be allowed to continue owning dehumanizing images of enslaved people who couldn’t consent to taking part. The Massachusetts court system ultimately sided with Harvard on the question of ownership, but allowed Lanier to continue to pursue emotional damages from the institution. Harvard said Wednesday that it had long been working to relinquish ownership of the images “to put them in the appropriate context and increase access to them for all Americans.” Negotiations between Harvard and Lanier lawyers resulted in a settlement that included the removal of the images from Harvard’s ownership. On Wednesday, Lanier stood holding a portrait of Papa Renty while arm-in-arm with Susanna Moore, the great-great-great-granddaughter of Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz, who commissioned the images on behalf of the university and whose theories on racial difference were once used to support slavery in the U.S. Both great-great-great grandaughters — one of enslaved people and another of a man who exploited them — praised the resolution. “This is a moment in history where the sons and daughters of stolen ancestors can stand with pride and rightfully proclaim a victory for reparations,” Lanier said. “This pilfered property, images taken without dignity or consent and used to promote a racist psychoscience will now be repatriated to a home where their stories can be told and their humanity can be restored.” Moore called the images captured by her ancestor, Agassiz, a “deeply racist project.” “This victory reminds us that the meaning of such objects in museums can and should change,” she said. “This woman standing next to me, she knew all along she was not small and she was not alone.” In 2019, Lanier sued Harvard, alleging the images were taken “without Renty’s and Delia’s consent and therefore unlawfully retained.” The suit attacked Harvard for its “exploitation” of Renty’s image at a 2017 conference and in other uses. It said Harvard has capitalized on the images by demanding a “hefty” licensing fee to reproduce them. Agassiz came across Renty and Delia while touring plantations in search of racially “pure” enslaved individuals born in Africa, according to Lanier’s suit. To create the images, both Renty and Delia were posed shirtless and photographed from several angles. “To Agassiz, Renty and Delia were nothing more than research specimens,” the suit said. “The violence of compelling them to participate in a degrading exercise designed to prove their own subhuman status would not have occurred to him, let alone mattered.” In 2021, a Massachusetts courtruledthat photos are the property of the photographer, not the subject — a stance affirmed by the Massachusetts Supreme Court. However, while Harvard sought to have the case dismissed, the state high court allowed the case to proceed on Lanier’s claim to emotional distress damages. The state’s highest court recognized “Harvard’s complicity in the horrific actions surrounding the creation of the daguerreotypes,” saying that “Harvard’s present obligations cannot be divorced from its past abuses.” In a statement, Harvard said it had “long been eager to place the Zealy Daguerreotypes with another museum or other public institution.” “This settlement now allows us to move forward towards that goal,” the university said. “While we are grateful to Ms. Lanier for sparking important conversations about these images, this was a complex situation, particularly since Harvard has not confirmed that Ms. Lanier was related to the individuals in the daguerreotypes.” Tonya M. Matthews, the CEO of the International African American Museum, called Harvard’s relinquishing of the images a moment “175 years in the making.” “The bravery, tenacity, and grace shown by Ms. Lanier throughout the long and arduous process of returning these critical pieces of Renty and Delia’s story to South Carolina is a model for us all,” she said in a statement. The South Carolina museum has committed to working with Lanier and including her in decisions about how the story of the images will be told. In Lanier’s lawsuit, she asked for Harvard to acknowledge its complicity in slavery, listen to Lanier’s oral family history and pay an unspecified sum in damages. An undisclosed financial settlement was part of the resolution with Harvard announced Wednesday, but Koskoff said Harvard still hasn’t publicly acknowledged Lanier’s connection to them or its connection to perpetuating slavery in the U.S., Koskoff said. “That is just left unanswered by Harvard,” he said. Koskoff said he wants to be clear that Lanier and his team “firmly support”Harvard’s current fightagainst the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump as the White House moves tocut billions in federal aidandblock the enrollment of international students, accusing the institution of being a hotbed of liberalism and antisemitism. “We are not here today to bash Harvard... but that doesn’t mean that they are perfect, and that doesn’t mean that they don’t have the obligation to tell a full history, even one that sheds poorly on their own veritas,” he said. He said Lanier isn’t expecting or waiting to hear from the institution, but that the settlement speaks for itself. “In the end, the truth will find you — you can, you can only hide from it for so long,” he said. “Yes, history is written by the winners. But over time, you know, those winners look like losers sometimes.”",

    "title": "Oklahoma City Thunder advance to NBA Finals",
    "article_text": "Just three years after they finished with one of the worst records in the Western Conference, the Oklahoma City Thunder are now best in the West. The Thunder beat the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday, 124-94, to win their conference finals in five games and advance to the team’s first NBA Finals since 2012. Oklahoma City will face Indiana or New York; the Pacers hold a 3-1 series lead. No matter its Finals opponent, Oklahoma City will host Games 1 and 2 by virtue of its top playoff seed, on June 5 and June 8. It would also host Games 5 and 7, if necessary, on June 16 and June 22. Oklahoma City led by as many as 39 points to turn an otherwise tense deciding game Wednesday into a blowout, led by 34 points from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who last week wasnamed the NBA's Most Valuable Player. Even by the standards of the NBA, where franchises’ fortunes and windows to win championships can change quickly, Oklahoma City’s rebuild that has returned it in the Finals has taken place with stunning speed. In 2021, it won 22 games during a Covid-shortened season, the fourth-worst record in the NBA and the franchise’s fewest victories since it moved from Seattle to Oklahoma in 2008. The next year it won 24 games — 40 fewer than Phoenix on its way to the West’s No. 1 playoff seed. Every year since then, Oklahoma City has gradually taken another step forward, with 40 wins in 2023 followed by 57 last season, the most in the conference, only to lose in the playoffs’ second round. This season, Oklahoma City’s upward trajectory continued with 68 wins, tied for fourth most in NBA history. Of the six other teams who won at least that many times in a single season, four went on to win the NBA Finals. Oklahoma City will have the opportunity to join that select club. Oklahoma City hasn’t won an NBA championship since it relocated in 2008. In 2012, the Thunder made the Finals behind a roster with three future Most Valuable Players but lost to the Miami Heat. The current Thunder feature one MVP in Gilgeous-Alexander and a roster, unique for its depth and versatility, that was built intentionally during its lean years. In addition to Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City received a haul of draft picks from the Los Angeles Clippers in 2019 in exchange for superstar Paul George, a trade that served as a pivot point for Oklahoma City’s franchise. One day after the trade, the Thunder made a far more under-the-radar roster decision by signing an undrafted Arizona State wing named Lu Dort, who has since become a perennial all-defense candidate while underpinning what has become the NBA's best defense during both the regular season and the postseason. Three years after Oklahoma City acquired Gilgeous-Alexander and a mountain of draft picks, one of those selections from the Clippers became Jalen Williams, who this year earned All-Star honors while becoming the Thunder’s second-leading scorer. And the losing in 2022 helped secure the second overall draft pick Oklahoma City used to draft Chet Holmgren, its third-leading scorer, who scored 22 points Wednesday. Oklahoma City opened the 2025 postseason with a sweep of the Memphis Grizzlies before it outlasted Denver in seven games in the conference semifinals. Facing Minnesota with a berth to the Finals on the line, Oklahoma City took a 3-1 series lead before it routed the Timberwolves on Wednesday.",

    "title": "The internet thinks this video from Gaza is AI. Here's how we proved it isn't.",
    "article_text": "New video posted to social media from southern Gaza became the center of a heated internet debate about whether it was generated using artificial intelligence. The video, which started circulating Tuesday, shows a person in a camouflage-print face covering and baseball cap making a heart sign and a “shaka” sign with their hands in front of a large crowd of Palestinians gathered along rows of fences,waiting for food aid at the Tal as Sultan distribution site in Rafah. A combined analysis from NBC News and Get Real Security, a cybersecurity company that specializes in detecting generative AI, proved the video was not made with AI, finding no evidence of AI generation or manipulation in the video. NBC News geolocated the video to inside the Tal as Sultan aid distribution site, recently constructed by Israel’s civilian policy unit — the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories — in partnership with the Gazan Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The GHF’s chief spokesperson confirmed with NBC News that the video was originally distributed by its team but could not confirm the identity of the person in the video. The foundation said in a statement, “Any claim that our documentation is fake or generated by AI is false and irresponsible.” Satellite imagery from Planet Labs anddrone videorecorded taken by the Israeli military show the same row of light poles and lines of fencing in the video. Additional collapsed structures and foliage rise behind and between the poles across a dirt lot in the direction of the Mediterranean Sea. Shortly after the video was posted to X, users began fighting in the comments about its authenticity. “This video is AI generated,”a user wrote. “Nothing can be believed because it could just as easily have been AI generated.” Hany Farid, a co-founder of Get Real Security and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told NBC News, “I am not seeing any obvious signs that this video is AI-generated.” “We see strong continuity in features as the camera pans back and forth, something that generative AI struggles with,” Farid said, noting specific details like the crisp “Ray Ban” logo on the side of the sunglasses worn by the person sporting the baseball cap, as well as the consistency of the shadows made by various objects in the video. Farid noted that the audio track appears to be consistent with what’s shown in the video itself — down to the sound of the wind and someone saying in English: “Isn’t that crazy? Look at that.” A reverse image search revealed that the person making gestures to the crowd was wearing a pair of Oakley S.I. gloves, which U.S. contractors have been seen wearing in Gaza as recently as January. AI-generated videos have emerged around the war in Gaza. In February, President Donald Trump posted afake videoto his Truth Social account that showed Elon Musk throwing money and Trump drinking by a pool with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Even more common are real videos from previous conflicts around the world mislabeled as depicting certain events in Gaza. “Generative-AI is a double-edged sword,” Farid said. “It can create harmful and fake content that muddies the water of a conflict. It also casts a long shadow and can be used to deny uncomfortable or inconvenient facts.”",

    "article_text": "Emily Feng U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio shown testifying before the Senate Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on May 20, 2025 in Washington, D.C.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Imageshide caption In the latest and most drastic move yet to curtail the numbers of international students studying in the U.S. the federal government will \"aggressively\" revoke visas from Chinese students and enhance scrutiny for future applicants, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. \"Under President Trump's leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"We will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong.\" Depending on how broadly the State Department and Department of Homeland Security define these criteria, the edict could affect many ofthe 280,000 or so Chinesehigh school, university, and graduate level students currently in the U.S. Rubio did not define what he meant by \"critical fields,\" but he likely means students working in areas like semiconductor engineer or aerospace where the U.S. and China are technological rivals. During the first Trump administration, thousands of mostly graduate-level Chinese students had their visasrevoked, particularly if their research was in cutting-edge engineering fields that may have dual-use applications. The newest move to pare back the numbers of Chinese students in the U.S. will likely further strain a bilateral relationship that has been imperiled by another trade war and serious technological competition over artificial intelligence and semiconductor chips. Revoking visas from Chinese students is also yet another blow to the American higher education system, from which the Trump administration has cut billions of dollars of funding. Some smaller, private colleges and boarding schools have come to rely financially on foreign students, who tend to pay full tuition. For decades, prestigious research universities have also been able to recruit from vast pools of talented and highly-educated students from China. Earlier this spring, the Trump administrationabruptly terminatedthe records of about 1,800 international students, including some Chinese citizens, from a national database, a move thatjeopardizedtheir student visas and which waschallengedby dozens of lawsuits nationwide. The termination of those records in what is called the SEVIS database was ultimately reversed by a federal judge, but immigration officials said they would stillpursuemore restrictive policies for foreign students. This week, the State Department said in a cable it waspausinginterview signups for student visa applicants in order to adequately screen their social media profiles, prompting waves of anxiety among Chinese students in the process of finalizing their student visas to the U.S. for the upcoming fall semester. China's foreign ministry this weekcalledon the U.S. to \"protect the legitimate rights and interests of international students, including those of Chinese students.\" For decades, China was the biggest source of international students to the U.S., but those figures have declined steadily after tensions with the U.S. worsened and a global coronavirus pandemic temporarily closed borders. Last year, the volume of students hailing from India eclipsed China. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Trump administration cancels plans to develop a bird flu vaccine",
    "article_text": "Rob Stein The H5N1 bird flu virus has been raising fears across the country and has spread into dairy cattle.thianchai sitthikongsak/Moment RF/Getty Imageshide caption The federal government announced Wednesday that it is cancelling a contract to develop a vaccine to protect people against flu viruses that could cause pandemics, including the bird flu virus that's beenspreading among dairy cowsin the U.S., citing concerns about thesafety of the mRNA technologybeing used. The Department of Health and Human Services said it is terminating a $766 million contract with the vaccine company Moderna to develop an mRNA vaccine to protect people against flu strains with pandemic potential, including theH5N1 bird flu virus that's been raising fears. \"After a rigorous review, we concluded that continued investment in Moderna's H5N1 mRNA vaccine was not scientifically or ethically justifiable,\" HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said in a statement. \"This is not simply about efficacy — it's about safety, integrity, and trust. The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public,\" Nixon said. He added that \"the move signals a shift in federal vaccine funding priorities toward platforms with better-established safety profiles and transparent data practices. HHS remains committed to advancing pandemic preparedness through technologies that are evidence-based, ethically grounded, and publicly accountable.\" The official did not provide any additional details. Jennifer Nuzzo, the director of Brown University's Pandemic Center, said the decision was \"disappointing, but unsurprising given the politically-motivated, evidence-free rhetoric that tries to paint mRNA vaccines as being dangerous.\" \"While there are other means of making flu vaccines in a pandemic, they are slower and some rely on eggs, which may be in short supply,\" Nuzzo added in an email. \"What we learned clearly during the last influenza pandemic is there are only a few companies in the world that make flu vaccines, which means in a pandemic there won't be enough to go around. If the U.S. wants to make sure it can get enough vaccines for every American who wants them during a pandemic, it should invest in multiple types of vaccines instead of putting all of our eggs in one basket.\" The cancellation comes even though Moderna says a study involving 300 healthy adults had produced \"positive interim\" results and the company \"had previously expected to advance the program to late-stage development.\" \"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program,\" Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive officer, saidin a statement. \"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats.\" The administration's move drew sharp criticism from outside experts. \"This decision puts the lives and health of the American people at risk,\" said Dr.Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown School of Public Health, who served as President Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator. \"Bird Flu is a well known threat and the virus has continued to evolve. If the virus develops the ability to spread from person to person, we could see a large number of people get sick and die from this infection,\" Jha said. \"The program to develop the next generation of vaccines was essential to protecting Americans. The attack by the Administration on the mRNA vaccine platform is absurd.\" Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota agreed. \"This decision will make our country far less prepared to respond to the next influenza pandemic,\" he said in an email. \"This is a dangerous course to follow.\" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the H5N1 flu virus has spread to 41 dairy herds, and 24 poultry farms and culling operations, and caused 70 human cases. While the virus has had a high mortality rate in other countries, so far H5N1 has only caused one death in the U.S. and has not shown any signs of spreading easily from one person to another. But infectious disease experts are concerned that the more the virus spreads, the greater the chance it could mutate into a form that would spread from person to person, which would increase the risk of a pandemic.

    "title": "Federal trade court blocks Trump's emergency tariffs, saying he overstepped authority",
    "article_text": "By Danielle Kurtzleben , Scott Horsley President Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House on April 2 in Washington, D.C.Mark Schiefelbein/APhide caption A federal court on Wednesday struck down many of the tariffs Trump imposed this term, including sweeping worldwide tariffs that unsettled consumers and sent stock markets plummeting. The judgment from the Court of International trade rules thetariffs Trump imposedon April 2 on most countries are illegal. Trump already moved to temporarily scale those tariffs back to 10 percent.The ruling also strikes down separate tariffs Trump imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico, which the administration justified as a reaction to fentanyl trafficking. In theirruling, the court's three-judge panel wrote that Trump's worldwide tariffs had exceeded his power under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, or IEEPA, which the Trump administration cited in imposing those tariffs. \"Because of the Constitution's express allocation of the tariff power to Congress…we do not read IEEPA to delegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President,\" the court wrote. The White House responded by rejecting the court's authority. \"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness.\" He did not answer directly when asked if the administration planned to appeal the ruling. IEEPA, the law at the heart of the case, had never been used to impose tariffs until President Trump did so. As the name suggests, the law gives a president broad economic powers during a national emergency. The judgment came in a case brought against the administration by 12 states and five businesses. While the court found Trump had exceeded his authority by imposing broad worldwide tariff, the three-judge panel made a different argument in ruling against the fentanyl tariffs. In that case, the court found that the president's argument – that the tariffs will create leverage to get other countries to crack down on drug trade – invalidates the tariffs. Under IEEPA, the judges wrote, a tariff must directly \"deal with\" the emergency a president cites when imposing the tariff. The fentanyl tariffs do not directly address the drug trade, the judges wrote, but instead merely attempt to create economic pressure within other countries. The three judges were appointed by three separate presidents: Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, and Trump himself. In a statement, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield – one of the state attorneys general who brought the case – celebrated the ruling. \"The court's ruling is a victory not just for Oregon, but for working families, small businesses, and everyday Americans,\" he said. \"President Trump's sweeping tariffs were unlawful, reckless, and economically devastating.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "China extends its reach into the Solar System with launch of asteroid mission",
    "article_text": "Tianwen-2 will first return samples from an asteroid, then explore a mysterious comet-like object. A Chinese spacecraft built to collect specimens from an unexplored asteroid and return them to Earth successfully launched Wednesday from a military-run spaceport in the country's mountainous interior. Liftoff aboard a Long March 3B rocket at 1:31 pm EDT (17:31 UTC) from the Xichang launch base kicked off the second mission in a series of Chinese probes to explore the Solar System. This mission, designated Tianwen-2, followsthe Tianwen-1 mission, which became the first Chinese spacecraft to land on Mars in 2021. Chinese officials confirmed the 2.1-metric ton Tianwen-2 spacecraft unfurled its fan-shaped solar arrays shortly after launch, marking an auspicious start to a decade-long tour of the Solar System. China's objectives for Tianwen-2 are two-fold. First, Tianwen-2 will fly to a near-Earth asteroid designated 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, or 2016 HO3. Once there, the spacecraft will retrieve a rocky sample from the asteroid's surface and bring the material back to Earth in late 2027 for analysis in labs. After the spacecraft releases its sample carrier to land on Earth, Tianwen-2 will change course and head to a mysterious comet-like object found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Tianwen-2 will become the first Chinese spacecraft to bring home celestial material from beyond the Moon, where China has landed two previous sample retrieval missions. China's exploits at the Moon have made its space program the world leader in 21st century lunar exploration, at least for now. But the Chinese space program lags behind the United States in exploring the Solar System. NASA and Japan's space agency have returned samples from asteroids before, while the European Space Agency has orbited a comet. Tianwen-2 will attempt to do both on a single mission. Scientists believe the asteroid selected for Tianwen-2 is less than 60 meters, or 200 feet, in diameter, and could be made of material thrown off the Moon some time in its ancient past. Results from Tianwen-2 may confirm that hypothesis. Asteroid Kamoʻoalewa is a unique target for a sample return mission. The asteroid is a \"quasi-satellite\" of the Earth, meaning its orbit around the Sun closely matches that of our own planet. This keeps Kamoʻoalewa relatively close to Earth throughout the year, making it an attractive candidate for a sample return mission. That's one reason why Tianwen-2's roundtrip journey to asteroid Kamoʻoalewa will last just two-and-a-half years. Japan'sHayabusa 2 asteroid sample return missionlasted six years from launch through its return to Earth, while NASA'sOSIRIS-REx missionmade the trip to an asteroid back in seven years. Both visited near-Earth asteroids more distant than Kamoʻoalewa, where Tianwen-2 will arrive in July 2026 and start searching for a location to retrieve samples. Tianwen-2 will try to collect samples in several ways. One method will involve maneuvering the spacecraft close to the surface and matching the asteroid's rotation, and extending a robotic arm to gather specimens. The spacecraft will also descend to the asteroid's surface for a \"touch-and-go\" similar to the way Japan's Hayabusa 2 spacecraft and NASA's OSIRIS-REx sampled their asteroids. Scientists also hope to try another sampling method known as \"anchor-and-attach,\" where the spacecraft will secure itself to the asteroid's surface using four arms with drills at the ends of them. Chinese officials have not said how much material they hope to bring back to Earth, but Tianwen-2 is reportedly designed to collect at least 100 grams of rocks and dust from the asteroid. Mission planners know little about the shape of Kamoʻoalewa, but long-range measurements suggest it spins once every 28 minutes, relatively fast for an asteroid. This spin rate, coupled with the object's tenuous gravity, will complicate Tianwen-2's maneuvers near the asteroid. Once it has the samples in hand, Tianwen-2 will depart the asteroid in early 2027 and head for Earth, where it will release a reentry module containing bits of Kamoʻoalewa for landing in late 2027. Researchers will study the specimens to determine their basic physical properties, chemical, mineral, and isotopic compositions, textures, and structures, according to a paper published in the research journalEarth and Planetary Physics. In the paper, four Chinese scientists write that results from the sample return will not only improve knowledge of asteroids, but could tell us about the Earth and the Moon. \"Confirming the origin of Kamo’oalewa, from its prevailing provenance as debris of the Moon, could be a promising start to inferring the evolutionary history of the Moon,\" the scientists write in the journal. \"This history would probably include a more comprehensive view of the lunar far side and the origin of the asymmetry between the two sides of the Moon.\" Tianwen-2's mothership, with 11 scientific instruments, will commence the second phase of its mission after dropping off the asteroid specimens at Earth. The probe's next journey will bring it near an enigma in the asteroid belt named 311P/PanSTARRS in the mid-2030s. This object is one in a rare class of objects known as active asteroids or main-belt comets, small worlds that have tails and comas like comets but loiter in orbits most commonly associated with asteroids. Tianwen-2 will be the first mission to see such an object up close. Until the last few years, China's space program has primarily centered on the Moon as a destination for scientific exploration. The Moon remains the main target for China's ambitions in space, with the goal of accomplishing a human lunar landing by 2030. But the country is looking farther afield, too. With the Tianwen-1 mission in 2021, China became the second country to achieve a soft landing on Mars. After Tianwen-2, China will again go to Mars with the Tianwen-3 sample return mission slated for launch in 2028. Tianwen, which means \"questions to heaven,\" is the name given to China's program of robotic Solar System exploration. Tianwen-3has a chance to become the first missionto return pristine samples from Mars to Earth. At the same time, NASA'splans for a Mars Sample Return missionare faltering. China is looking at launching Tianwen-4 around 2029 to travel to Jupiter and enter orbit around Callisto, one of its four largest moons. In the 2030s,China's roadmapincludes a mission to return atmospheric samples from Venus to Earth, a Mars research station, and a probe to Neptune. Meanwhile, NASA has sent spacecraft to study ever planet in the Solar System, and currently has spacecraft at or on the way to the Moon, Mars,Jupiter, ametal asteroid, and ininterstellar space. Another US science mission,Dragonfly, is scheduled for launch in 2028 on a daring expedition to Saturn's moon Titan. But NASA's science division isbracing for severe budget cutsproposed by President Donald Trump. In planetary science, the White House's budget blueprint calls for canceling a joint US-European Mars Sample Return mission and several other projects, including the DAVINCI mission to Venus.

    "title": "Epic Universe’s Monster Lore Gives Us the Best Possible Dark Universe",
    "article_text": "When you visitEpic Universe’sDark Universe, you get hints of a story that’s so mysterious you’ll want to keep coming back to learn more. InDarkmoor Village, where monsters and humans co-existâbarelyâthe relationship between the villagers, the mad scientist in her castle with her monsters, and the vampires below is a very fragile menagerie of the macabre. When io9 visited Darkmoor during Epic Universe’s opening week, we couldn’t help but wonder if the dense canon introduced would offer some insight into Universal’s abandoned Dark Universe film franchise. It turns out that some elements in the attractions, details in the land offerings, and immersive interactions echo what was once supposed to herald an Avengers-like assembly of the Universal Monsters on the big screen. When you enter Darkmoor, you pass by a massive crypt where you hear Victoria Frankenstein’s assistant Ygor shuffling about with the land’s version of Frankenstein’s Monster looking for victims to use in her experiments. There’s squelching noises and creepy creature screeches, and it’s so cool to get the sense of story as soon as you walk in. Wepreviously coveredhow when you meet Frankenstein’s Monster along with the Bride, she’s nothisBride but hisfriend. The Monster we’re more familiar with is displayed in a glass resting place within Frankenstein Manor. However, before you get that deep into the land, you first come across the village square which features a well that at night glows blood red. The familiars in the land shared that it’s there as a monument to the dominance the vampires have on the village, and is where blood sacrifices are made to the vampire hive below in the catacombsâdark unipart of a pact to keep a balance struck between the living and the dead. In the rideMonsters Unchained: The Frankenstein Experiment, you see that the original Dr. Frankenstein played a huge role in the careful and sensitive cessation of carnage, and it’s something his granddaughter fights to maintain. We also learn that Victoria Frankenstein has assembled monsters under her “control;” the last remaining one she’s trying to dominate is Dracula, but he’s playing very hard to get. When the Dark Universe films were still in play, Alex Kurtzman, the director of the only entry that actually made it to theatersâ2017’sThe Mummy, starring Tom Cruiseâtalked about the framework that was to have anchored the planned series. In his film, Russell Crowe’s Dr. Jekyll headed up an organization devoted to keeping tabs on supernatural bad guys. “We wanted to know that monsters existed for millennia. And we knew that as the story evolved there was going to be an organization that was maybe cataloging them, following them, collecting them,” Kurtzman explained at a December 2016 press eventio9 reported on at the time. “That would determine the good ones from the bad ones. That was sort of the keeper of that secret history.” That idea carries over into the theme park, albeit very minimally. Dr. Jekyll currently only has a brief interactive moment at his apothecary window, where you can hear him tell you to discover more monsters at the Burning Blade Tavernâand to tell the bartender Dr. Jekyll sent you. We didn’t get to try this as alcohol was not provided to press but it results in you being offered a choice between two shots: a Jekyll or Hyde one. You can guess that in Darkmoor, Jekyll might side with Victoria’s initiative, while Hyde is definitely with the monsters. In the panels of comics decorating Epic Universe merch (we’re waiting for real issues!) and in theMonsters Unchainedride queue, we see Victoria front and center doing just what was envisioned for the movies: cataloging, following, and collecting. So it feels like the concept for the theme park canon retained that through line. There are definitely some monsters who are more heroic than others aligning themselves with the side that will have the lowest body count. Yet, it still mirrors the Dark Universe’s cinematic plans. In 2016,The Mummydirector Kurtzman looked to the Dark Universe future at that same press event. “To me, the fun of the promise of bringing them together is that theyâre probably going to fuck each other up pretty badly,”he said then. “Itâs not going to be a pretty room with those guys in it. And thatâs a lot more exciting than people who are going to behave nobly and predictably. It just makes it a more interesting experience, and a more interesting prospect.” And that’s pretty much what happens on the ride between Frankenstein, the Wolfman, and Dracula and his Brides (while the Phantom of the Opera plays sweet tunes on his organ). Other pieces of merchandise that will get you other glimpses of the lore are the designs in the Dark Universe collection that depict the blueprints of Frankenstein Manor. Also, if you get transformed into a monster at the park’s Darkmoor Monster Makeup Experience, then run into Ygor, you’re recruited even more relentlessly than the average human to volunteer for the Frankenstein Experiment. Ygor is by far one of the most interesting walk-around characters created and really drives the lore in his interactions. When askedback in 2016how the Dark Universe monsters would end up teaming up, Kurtzman said ideas around that were still being formulated. But most important, he said, was the question “Why would you bring them together? There has to be some kind of unifying reason if youâre going to do that.” Dracula. Dracula is the drama. And I wonder if he was meant to be the big bad in the film universe just as much as he is the big bad in the theme park canon. When you go into the Das Stakehaus restaurant, you see the former vampire leaders of Darkmoor staked and on display atop the bar. Why? Well, Dracula felt their bending the knee to the Frankenstein family to try and co-exist to further the scientists’ agendas was an affront to their kind. (Really, the familiars have all the tea, it’s fabulous.) So the conflict is thereâDracula wants to take control back of the village for a feast, instead of letting Victoria Frankenstein continue her experiments. Clearly, it’s an ongoing battle. Like the familiars at the restaurant, the interactive characters at the Burning Blade Tavern have even more to share. The monster hunters that hang out there motion to the monster heads on display behind the bar, including another “creature” from the Darkmoor swamplands, and be careful going in there in monster makeup. We also got hunter knowledge as to why Dracula is barefoot with the ugliest toenails on the ride (a detail that’s going viral). Their version of whyâand we are not sure if they were jokingâis that allegedly it was done as a way to shame Dracula when he was captured, by taking his shoes off when he was chained. And honestly, that’s so foul I would be so mad about it too. It’s rumored that the stories they tell of monsters they’re on the hunt for (and that we have yet to meet) are Easter eggs for future Dark Universe expansions and we hope it’s true. And it really ties in the monsters that were all floated for the cinematic universe, which included the Invisible Man (who is a roaming character at the park), Dracula, Jekyll/Hyde, the Wolfman, the Creature From the Black Lagoon, Frankenstein’s Monster, and the Bride. We’d love to see a boat ride featuring the Creature some day. Dark Universe is now open at Epic Universe in Orlando, Florida. Want more io9 news?

    "article_text": "\"It's actually quite bad as a phone.\" No? Really? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The tech inside Nintendo's Duck Hunt Zapper gun is easily some of the coolest to come out of 80's gaming. The way this device worked with the NES to determine whether or not you'd shot those poor innocent pixel ducks is truly some ingeniously innovative stuff. Unfortunately, with modern technology we don't really have a lot of space for something designed to work with CRT TVs. The next logical step is to see what else we can do with these cool light reading guns. In a true homage to 80's nostalgia one enthusiast has turned the Zapper into a working telephone. Novelty household phones were huge in the 80's and 90's. Once folks realised those plastic outer shells could be shaped like basically anything, well they took that as a challenge. According toHackaday, Nick has taken that challenge to the next level by developing this wonderfully impractical Zapper phone. Instead of reading a CRT screen for the perfect input of light patterns, Nick uses the light sensing capability of the Zapper to receive phone calls and transmit audio. It does this by reading the patterns in the laser light transmitted from the phones base station and translating these waves into audio.It's actually based off of the first phone invented back in 1880 which used light to transmit sound. What's old is new and old again. He figured out the device could be used this way after doing a complete tear down on the Zapper, which you can alsocheck out on his channel.In this he got a good understanding of how the gun worked, and also figured out how to bypass Nintendo's anticheat technology included in the Zapper. By Nick's own admission, there is one real downside to the incredible Zapper Phone. It has to be pointed perfectly to receive the laser, which isn't very useful for a wireless device.. \"It's actually quite bad as a phone.\" Says Nick, adding \"The sound quality is quite good, but you have to have line of sight with a laser, and it has to be lined up almost perfectly.\" Fortunately, the tech here is so cool, I really don't care how useful the device is. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As these guns didn't come with microphones, for some reason, Nick has also added one for this project. The resulting setup is this kind of magical laser communication device that transmits audio between the base station and the gun-reciever. Also you get to talk into a NES Zapper gun, what more could you want? You can get a better look at Nick's creation in the video above, including an explainer on how it works, and a demo video of the final result.

    "title": "Corsair's new One i600 mini PC packs an RTX 5080 into a stunning understated wood panel case",
    "article_text": "A PC that would look just as good at my grandmother's house as it would on my gaming desk. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. One of the best looking prebuilt compact PCs is back, with the new Corsair One i600 PC. This new mini-beast looks a lot like last year'sCorsair One i500 PCwith a beautiful toned down appearance, and hard hitting specs. And of course, a price tag to match. The new Corsair One i600 follows in theseries footstepsby hiding a GeForce RTX™ 5080 graphics card in its unassuming, elegant design. This is paired with an Intel® Core™ Ultra 9 processor that seems to be in almost every gaming machine available at the moment. These have both been assigned their own 240mm liquid coolers that they no doubt need in order to keep temperatures at acceptable levels in such a discrete case. On top of that you've got 64GB DDR5 memory, which should be more than enough for any gaming you come across. Then there's 4TB NVMe SSD storage as default, which is really nice to see in a world where most machines baselines seem to be the 2TB drives. Games certainly aren't getting any smaller, so a good amount of solid state storage has never been more necessary for fast load times. To further manage all this you've got the Corsair desktop software. This kind of bloatware on these bespoke PCs can be really annoying, but I think in this case something to help keep an eye on those temperatures and manage them is a good idea. While the specs are impressive, it's really all about that sleek chassis. They're built to optimise airflow including fans on top of the liquid cooling to really try to keep those temperatures down and the running silent. Given how quiet theCorsair One i300 PCwas, I have a fair bit of trust that the brand can deliver a hushed machine, even with those internals. But what I love most about these machines is the look. These i600 PCs come in two different styles for the front panel: Metal Dark and Wood Dark. The black metal is nice, but the Wood Dark is definitely where it's at. Not only does it set these rigs apart, but it's actually real wood, to the point of being FSC-Certified. I don't know why this matters, but it looks great, and really subtle too. The perfect stealth gaming PC design, but don't worry, it also has RGB lighting. But the price, as to be expected, is not so stealthy. For these fabulous looking PCs you'll be set back$5,000 USD. It's really not cheap, but it is gorgeous. It's also inline with previous prices of this line, so it doesn't look like tariffs have effected the cost of these too much. Still, might have to go out and find a nice piece of wood to stick on the front of my case so I can pretend affording one of these would ever be within my reach.

    "title": "Top-down modded Morrowind lets you experience Vvardenfell like it's Baldur's Gate",
    "article_text": "Though it does make cliff racers even more annoying. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Morrowind came out in 2002, the same year as isometric RPGs like Icewind Dale 2, Divine Divinity, Freedom Force, and Dungeon Siege. Its first-person/third-person perspective was a selling point at the time, though some would argue that playing a full 3D game with randomized to-hit chances made for an unsatisfying experience. Nowadays, thanks to the mod combo of OpenMorrowind and OpenNevermind, we can experience Morrowind as if it was a top-down CRPG complete with click-to-move and having to zoom in so you can pick up small objects. YouTuber Mehrunes Mike just uploaded a video showcasing OpenNevermind and a UI mod of his own design that gives Morrowind an action bar and a little bit of Baldur's Gate 3 flavor—minimap in the top right, enemy portraits across the top, you know the deal. It's an impressive piece of work, and I hope he shares it with the rest of us, even if it's not designed to deal with the massive inventory of the average Morrowind hoarder. Mehrunes Mike stuck with the top-down perspective for most of his playthrough, in which he completed Morrowind's main questline, explored all the dwemer ruins, and killed every single werewolf to cap it off. There were a few moments where he had to cave in and switch back to first-person, mostly to pick up items that were tiny and obscured from above, and sometimes to go through doors. For the most part though it works surprisingly well. It's fascinating watching someone play Morrowind from a completely different perspective yet do all the things I do, like trying to jump into the water from the top of Molag Mar and failing to clear the bottom level. And a lot of it looks great—areas with levels like the Waistworks, some of the dungeons, and anything with a bridge looks gorgeous, even if he has to rotate the camera a lot to see where he's going. If you want to play Morrowind like this you'll need to downloadOpenMWand thenOpenNevermind. The latter mod started out as an April Fool's joke but despite its issues has been embraced by the Morrowind community, who are pretty comfortable with a high degree of jankiness to begin with.

    "article_text": "Help with today's Wordle if you need it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's a clue for the May 29 (1440)Wordleright here if you find yourself in need of a nudge. Have a read right now and give your first line a huge boost, or save it for later if you like, there if you need a helping hand. We've got today's answer ready to read too, able to save any game in a flash. Thursday's answer wouldn't have naturally sprang to mind, but luckily for me all the guesses I made before it guided me in its direction. Today's puzzle was a great reminder of the importance of paying close attention to any grey letters that pop up along the way—they're not just wrong, they're a chance to refresh and refocus your thinking. You'll most often see this word in legal or official settings, where it's used to make clear that some previous statement or legal ruling is no longer true. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. If you're new to the daily Wordle puzzle or you just want a refresher after taking a break, I'll share some quick tips to help you win. There's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day. You're not up against a timer, so you've got all the time in the world—well, until midnight—to find the winning word. If you're stuck, there's no shame in coming back to the puzzle later in the day and finishing it up when you've cleared your head. Here you go. The answer to the May 29 (1440) Wordle isQUASH. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Keeping track of the last handful of Wordle answers can help to eliminate current possibilities. It's also handy for inspiring opening words or subsequent guesses if you're short on ideas for the day. Here are the last 10 Wordle answers: Wordle presents you with six rows of five boxes every day and the aim is to figure out the correct five-letter word by entering guesses and eliminating or confirming individual letters. Getting off to a good start witha strong wordlike ARISE—something containing multiple vowels, common consonants, and no repeat letters—is a good tactic. Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "title": "This narrative thriller takes place in a fictional '80s OS, and the devs obsessed over keeping just the right amount of old school jank: 'We did retain the dial-up modem'",
    "article_text": "Vice Undercover introduces the world wide web into the already harrowing world of Reagan-era drug control. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Few games commit to building an alternate reality like Vice Undercover. Much of the game is played on the fictitious Amigo OS, an amalgam of Windows 3.1 and early Apple operating systems with a dozen built-in applications, a boxy media player, and even a persistent Clippy pastiche with all sorts of eager advice for you. But this isn't a starry-eyed trip down memory lane—it's a \"narco-thriller\" where you poke around in drug cartel communications, careful not to get caught. \"Paranoia is one of the core emotions we were going for. That fear of being caught, the moral ambiguity of what you're doing, and sort of questioning what is right and wrong when you're combating something like this,\" said Cos Lazouras, co-CEO of indie dev Ancient Machine, in an interview with PC Gamer. \"That kind of thing is part and parcel with the core of the gameplay.\" In Vice, which takes place in 1980s Miami, you play as an undercover cop with an hour a day to access a cartel-run computer. It looks to be informed by synthwave and neo-noir as much as it is by actual history, and Lazouras said that's no mistake; there are plenty of treats for web historians and true crime buffs alike. \"The idea of, 'what would have happened if Pablo Escobar and other cartels like that in the '80s had access to the sort of technology we take for granted?' What does that world look like,\" he said. \"We did a lot of research about the drug wars of the '80s, and Miami was the central focus of cocaine distribution into the country … we have every criminal organization in this game, sometimes peripherally, but we've got everything from the yakuza, triads, Indonesian mob, the Italian mafia, the police as a big part of the corruption, government agencies.\" As a narrative game, the closest analog to fiddling around in Amigo OS is probably something likeHer Storyor therecently acclaimed Roottrees are Dead. It's a nonlinear web of discoveries lying in wait, scattered about databases full of disparate information. If you're the sort who's always wished you could puff a stogie and illustrate a series of connections on a bulletin board using tacks and yarn, that's how I imagined myself while checking out its demoon Steam. You might notice that the Amigo isn't quite as frustrating to navigate as it could be given its inspirations. According to Ancient Machine's other co-CEO, Albert Ramon Puig, figuring out the right amount of friction was a tightrope walk unto itself. \"We discovered trying to simulate a desktop is crazy and it's not fun. We decided to reinvent all the mechanics and incorporate things that are modern, like the alt-tab … You have chats, a lot of missions, a lot of applications, a big database. [The game is about] how to organize and investigate more than complicated mechanics.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Puig and Lazouras discovered in early playtests that players were flabbergasted when they realized how slow-going an era-appropriate OS would have been when frictionless alt-tabbing between a gazillion windows wasn't always a given. To keep the focus on the story, they decided to hold back most of the jank—with a little leftover, as a treat. \"We did retain the dial-up modem, though,\" said Lazouras. \"So when you lose the internet, you do have to go in and re-dial up and reconnect … when you have five people giving you missions and contracts because you're working for both the police and the cartel, and then these external characters start introducing themselves, then that desktop management becomes a key component.\" Old school cool aside, Vice Undercover is a game about living on the razor's edge—something the team at Ancient Machine had no qualms with themselves working on their passion project. Lazouras said: \"The policy that we set right from the start is no control from anybody else. We make this game, and it has to be like this.\" The team had a distributor lined up at one point, but working within the needs of that partnership \"meant cutting [Vice Undercover] back way too much.\" To make the game they wanted, the team had to take a chance. Lazouras said that only stoked his passion, looking back now on having written 500 character backstories for Vice Undercover's labyrinthine plot. Coming from a background in AAA development, Lazouras was excited by the challenge of \"having a really pared down solution to the core of a game\" purely focused on the concept rather than the production values of \"big, overblown games.\" \"It's a lot more fun working on something that's just pure risk, especially when you put your own mortgage up on the line, because we're self-funding it,\" he said. Despite the complicated road behind, Lazouras is \"super proud\" of the game that's slated to come out later this year. \"We really want you to feel like you're an undercover cop buried under this storyline. I think we've achieved that. I think that's the crowning glory of where we're at with the game.\" Vice Undercover doesn't have a release date locked in yet, but expect iton Steamsometime this summer. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Justin first became enamored with PC gaming when World of Warcraft and Neverwinter Nights 2 rewired his brain as a wide-eyed kid.

Whether he's extolling the virtues of Shenmue or troubleshooting some fiddly old MMO, it's hard to get his mind off games with more ambition than scruples. When he's not at his keyboard, he's probably birdwatching or daydreaming about a glorious comeback for real-time with pause combat. Any day now...

    "article_text": "Wake me up! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheFromSoftwareaesthetic is best summed up by thefamous quote from Dark Souls director Hidetaka Miyazaki. When presented with an early, gross and gribbly design for the Undead Dragon in Dark Souls, Miyazaki returned it with the comment that it should be more dignified, saying, \"Can't you instead try to convey the deep sorrow of a magnificent beast doomed to a slow and possibly endless descent into ruin?'\" At some point behind the scenes there must have been a meeting about how to soundtrack the launch trailer forElden RingNightreign. And that meeting ended by deciding that what the majestic ruin of the Lands Between needed was the song you'd hear in a mid-2000s AMV where someone edits all their favorite clips from Berserk together. Yes, theElden Ring Nightreign traileris backed by Bring Me to Life by Evanescence, a slice of crossover nu-metal coming at you direct from 2003. Back then this song was pretty cringeworthy, which is what we said instead of just \"cringe\" at the time, but like everything you're embarrassed by, 20 years later you hear it at a retro night and suddenly realize it rules actually. Bandai Namco does have form here, having released atrailer for Dark Souls soundtracked by folk-rock band The Silent Comedy. In an age of ultra-polished trailers backed by slowed-down cover versions it's kind of nice to see something a bit more amateurish? When the three heroes do their slow walk into battle during a quiet bit in Bring Me to Life it definitely has a \"me and my friends made this\" feel that's appreciated in a game that will ultimately come down to you and your friends working together. In his review ofElden Ring Nightreign, Tyler Colp recalled that \"Everyone cheered in voice chat when Centipede Demon, the boss nobody remembers from Dark Souls, showed up to get obliterated by 14 years of action RPG combat advancement. When the stars align—and they will—Nightreign is unlike anything else I've played.\" He gave it a score of 80, and though he had plenty to say about its impenetrability and messiness, he also clearly had a good time. Just like I will, singing \"save me from the nothing I've become\" at my desk for the rest of the day.

    "title": "Apple’s Logic Pro for iPad and Mac can now capture your performances even when you forget to hit record",
    "article_text": "Plus, Stem Splitter gets more powerful When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Apple’s been on a roll with Logic Pro on the Mac and iPad – in 2024, the tech giantushered in several AI-powered features, including an impressive Stem Splitter, and now, for the first major update of 2025, you could say it’s turning things up to 11. Leading the improvements for both the Mac and iPad is a new tool that will save your brilliant take, even if you forget to hit the record button. Beyond that, Stem Splitter is an even more powerful tool, andApple Intelligenceis arriving within the long-standing Notepad functionality. So let’s start with Flashback Capture – this is a renaming of ‘Capture Recording’ and an expansion of its capabilities. Whether you’re a pro at Logic or maybe just upgrading from GarageBand, you’ve likely experienced this when you start strumming on a guitar, sing a few chords, or play another instrument – greatness strikes, but you forget to hit record. This feature has the potential to be a lifesaver, as it automatically captures your performance before you hit record. With the press of a button, you can then make it appear on your timeline. As part of its rebranding, Flashback Capture now works with any MIDI source – or, more accurately, with any audio source. It also works if you play something while listening to another piece of your timeline – when inspiration strikes, regardless of whether you start recording, Flashback Capture kind of saves the day. This update is now available for Mac with Logic Pro 11.2 and for iPad with Logic Pro version 2.2, both of which are now available. The ever-popular Stem Splitter, which utilizes AI to analyze an audio file and separate the instruments or vocals into individual tracks, is receiving an enhancement. Previously, it could separate vocals, bass, and drums into separate tracks while placing other potential elements into a track called “other.” Now, Apple is adding the ability to recognize piano and guitar, while also promising better audio fidelity. This should be pretty helpful, though if you have a horn section in your band, those wonderful brass instruments will still live in the ‘other’ track. There will also be presets to pick from, including a cappella, instrumental with vocals, or just instrumental. Stem Splitter will still only be available on Macs and iPads withApple Siliconinside, specifically the M1 chip or newer. While there is some AI and machine learning, Apple is also incorporating Writing Tools integration. Essentially, the Notepad tool inside Logic Pro will now have a dedicated button forWriting Tools, allowing you to leverage Apple’s own models orChatGPT’s smartsto help flesh out lyrics, potentially. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. If you’re keen on new sound packs, Logic Pro on the Mac is gaining Magnetic Imperfections and Tosin Abasi, while the iPad version gets the brand-new Dancefloor Rush. The latter here offers alchemy patches and hundreds of loops, all themed around drum and bass. It sounds a lot like summer pop and should be fun. Lastly, for Logic Pro on iPad, Learn MIDI is arriving and will help you get the hang of these physical control devices with minimal previous experience. Essentially, you can plug a compatible MIDI device into your iPad via USB-C and then assign a function in Logic Pro to a physical control, such as a knob. You’ll be able to customize the experience to your exact needs, and as they evolve, you can adjust your setup accordingly. The best news, though, and keeping with Apple’s past enhancements to the software suite, is that if you’ve already bought Logic Pro for the Mac or subscribe to Logic Pro for iPad, you’ll get all these new features for free. Apple’s also not increasing the cost for either. Logic Pro for the Mac is still a one-time purchase of $199.99 / £199.99 / AU$ 299.99 and Logic Pro for iPad is $5.99 / £4.99 / AU$7.99 or annually at $49.99 / £49.99 / AU$59.99. Additionally, you can still get a one-month free trial on the iPad or a 90-day free trial on the Mac for Logic. Jacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

    "title": "Lavrov briefs Rubio on Ukraine negotiations",
    "article_text": "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov discussed the Ukraine peace negotiations during a phone call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday. According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov briefed Rubio on“concrete proposals for the next round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul.” “Both sides affirmed their intent to maintain constructive and respectful dialogue,”the ministry said in a statement on its website. US State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said that Rubio“welcomed Russia and Ukraine’s exchange of ‘1,000-for-1,000’ prisoners over the weekend.” “The secretary reiterated President Trump’s calls for constructive, good-faith dialogue with Ukraine as the only path to ending this war,”Bruce added. The conversation took place as US President Donald Trump intensified his rhetoric toward Russia, accusing President Vladimir Putin of“playing with fire.”He stopped short, however, of imposing new sanctions – something he suggested could still happen if peace talks stall.“We’re going to find out whether or not [Putin is] tapping us along, and if he is, we’ll respond a little differently,”Trump said on Wednesday. Russia and Ukraine held their first direct negotiations in three years on May 16 in Istanbul, agreeing to carry out a major prisoner swap and to each draft a memorandum outlining their terms for a potential ceasefire. The exchange was conducted in several phases and concluded last week. While Kiev has said it shared its memorandum with both Moscow and Washington, the Kremlin stated on Wednesday that it is“finalizing”its version of the document. Lavrov proposed holding the next round of talks in Istanbul on June 2. Russia’s lead negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, has rejected Ukraine’s claims that Moscow is stalling the process. Ukraine has backed Trump’s proposal for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. However, Russia has stated that, for a full ceasefire to be achieved, Ukraine must halt mobilization, stop receiving foreign weapons, and withdraw its forces from Russian territory. Moscow also insists that Kiev must abandon its plans to join NATO and formally recognize Crimea and four other regions as part of Russia. The Kremlin has described NATO’s expansion as one of the“root causes”of the conflict – an issue it says must be addressed in the ongoing talks.",

    "title": "Musk stepping down as special government employee",
    "article_text": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk, head of the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has announced that he will no longer serve as a government employee. The statement comes amid reports of a growing rift between Musk and President Donald Trump. Trump established DOGE to identify and eliminate wasteful spending as part of his effort to make the federal government more responsive to everyday Americans. Musk’s organization, which is not a federal agency in the traditional sense, has overseen the elimination of grants and programs, as well as the termination of government jobs. Trump has also used DOGE to dismantle the Department of Education and the US Agency for International Development (USAID). “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,”Musk wrote on his X platform on Wednesday evening. “The DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,”he added. According to the New York Times, special government employees are appointed to“perform important, but limited, services to the government, with or without compensation, for a period not to exceed 130 days.” An unnamed White House official confirmed to Reuters on Wednesday that Musk is leaving the administration and that his“off-boarding will begin tonight.” Musk recently voiced disappointment over Trump’s tax and spending bill, which he said would increase the deficit and undermine DOGE’s mission. He also said last week that he would like to wind down his involvement in politics because he has“done enough.” Trump defended the bill passed by the House last week, though he admitted on Wednesday that he was“not happy about certain aspects.” According to DOGE’s website, the task force has helped save an estimated $175 billion in taxpayer funds. Democrats have criticized the initiative, and courts have blocked some of its actions.",

FILE - Singer Cassie Ventura also known as Cassie arrives for the screening of Killing Them Softly at the 65th international film festival, in Cannes, southern France, Tuesday, May 22, 2012. (AP Photo/Lionel Cironneau, File) Casandra Ventura, the R&B singer and actor known simply as Cassie, has welcomed her third child, a son. The news arrived Wednesday (May 28) in the midst of the ongoing Sean “Diddy” Combs sex trafficking trial, at which Cassie is an essential witness.She finished testifyingearlier this month while visibly pregnant over four emotional days on the stand, during which she described being beaten and raped by a man she once loved. Reports from multiple media outlets said Cassie gave birth in a New York hospital Tuesday. Stylist Deonte Nash, who worked for Combs for a decade, testified Wednesday that he talked to Cassie the previous day to congratulate her on the birth. Cassie, 38, is perhaps best known for the platinum-selling 2006 hit single Me & U. She married personal trainer Alex Fine in September 2019. Their first daughter, Frankie Stone Fine, was born that same year and they welcomed their second daughter, Sunny Cinco Fine, in 2021. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has. Combs, 55, is on trial in New York on charges that he exploited his status as an entertainment executive to force women, including Cassie, into drug-fuelled “freak-offs” with male sex workers and engaged in other abusive acts against people who relied on him for their careers. Combs has pleaded not guilty to federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges. After departing the trial, Cassie, who dated Combs for a decade, released a statement through her lawyer saying she hoped her testimony helps others “heal from the abuse and fear”. Representatives for Cassie and Fine did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/ File Photo SEOUL :South Korea's exports of automobiles, steel and semiconductors are expected to fall as the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs take effect later this year, the central bank said on Thursday. Weaker car exports will drag down South Korea's exports by 0.6 per cent, and U.S.-bound exports by 4.0 per cent, posing the biggest risk, the Bank of Korea projected in a report, adding automakers so far have responded to 25 per cent U.S. tariffs with existing stocks. Steel products are also estimated to lower the country's exports by 0.3 per cent, with a decline of 1.4 per cent in U.S.-bound shipments, as 25 per cent tariffs on the sector start to weigh from the third quarter after a time lag in shipments, the central bank said. The BOK saw semiconductors lowering the country's exports by 0.2 per cent, assuming 10 per cent U.S. duties on the sector, although there have so far been positive effects from advance orders ahead of Trump's planned tariffs.

(File photo: AP/Bill Sikes) WASHINGTON: United States President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday (May 29) canceled a US$590 million contract with Moderna to develop an avian flu vaccine, the US biotech company said. It marked the latest move against vaccines by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has spent decades promoting misinformation about immunisation. The contract, announced on Jan 17 - three days before Trump took office - was for an mRNA vaccine targeting the H5N1 influenza strain, which has been circulating in birds and cattle. Experts have warned thevirus could jump to humansand spark a pandemic. American pharmaceutical and biotechnology company Moderna disclosed the news as it announced positive results from an early stage clinical trial of 300 people designed to test safety and immune response. \"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine and we will explore alternative paths forward for the programme,\" said CEO Stephane Bancel in a statement. \"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats.\" The statement added Moderna would \"explore alternatives\" for funding the development and manufacturing of the vaccine. Dr. Ashish Jha, a public health expert who served as former president Joe Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator, reacted with dismay. \"The attack on mRNA vaccines is beyond absurd,\" he posted on X. \"It was President Trump's Operation Warp Speed that gave us mRNA vaccines.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "article_text": "World World US President Donald Trump giving a speech at West Point in Michie Stadium on May 24, 2025. (Photo: AFP/Michael M Santiago) US President Donald Trump’s tariff decisions since he took office on Jan 20 have given investors and political leaders alike whiplash with his on-again, off-again policies. His decisions have upended financial markets and sent a wave of uncertainty through the global economy as countries scrambled to make deals and sought new partnerships to overcome any potential economic impact from the levies. In the latest development, a US federal courtblockedmost of Trump’s sweeping“Liberation Day” tariffsfrom going into effect,ruling that the president had overstepped his authority with the across-the-board global levies. Here is a timeline of the major developments: Feb 1 - Trump imposes 25 per cent tariffs on Mexican and most Canadian imports and 10 per cent on goods from China, demanding they curb the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants into the US. Feb 3 - Trump suspends his threat of tariffs on Mexico and Canada, agreeing to a 30-day pause in return for concessions on border and crime enforcement. The US does not reach such a deal with China. Feb 7 - Trump delays tariffs on de minimis, or low-cost, packages from China until the Commerce Department can confirm that procedures and systems are in place to process them and collect tariff revenue. Feb 10 - Trump raises tariffs on steel and aluminium to a flat 25 per cent \"without exceptions or exemptions\". Mar 3 - Trump says 25 per cent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada will take effect from Mar 4 and doubles fentanyl-related tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20 per cent. Mar 5 - The president agrees to delay tariffs for one month on some vehicles built in Canada and Mexico after a call with the CEOs of General Motors and Ford and the chair of Stellantis. Mar 6 - Trump exempts goods from Canada and Mexico under a North American trade pact for a month from the 25 per cent tariffs. Mar 26 - Trump unveils a 25 per cent tariff on imported cars and light trucks. Apr 2 - Trump announces global tariffs with a baseline of 10 per cent across all imports and significantly higher duties on some of the US' biggest trading partners. ASEAN nations are among the most heavily hit, with countries such as Cambodia and Laos slapped with 49 per cent and 48 per cent import tariffs respectively. Apr 8 - Singapore sets up anew task forceto help businesses and workers tide through US tariffs. The task force focuses on communication and information sharing and aims to help businesses and workers address immediate uncertainties, strengthen resilience and adapt to a new economic landscape. Apr 9 - Trump pauses for 90 days most of his country-specific tariffs that kicked in less than 24 hours earlier following an upheaval in financial markets that erased trillions of dollars from bourses around the world. The 10 per cent blanket duty on almost all US imports stays in place. Trump says he will raise the tariff on Chinese imports to 125 per cent from the 104 per cent level that took effect a day earlier. This pushes the extra duties on Chinese goods to 145 per cent, including the fentanyl-related tariffs imposed earlier. Apr 13 - The US administration grants exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones, computers and some other electronics imported largely from China. Apr 22 - The Trump administration launches national security probes under Section 232 of the Trade Act of 1962 into imports of both pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of a bid to impose tariffs on both sectors. May 4 - Trump imposes a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the US. May 5 - Singapore enters afree trade agreementwith the Pacific Alliance for three countries. The FTA for Singapore, Peru and Chile was entered into force first, while Colombia and Mexico undergo their ratification processes. The Pacific Alliance, comprising Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, is the ninth-largest economy in the world. May 9 - Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announce a limited bilateral trade agreement that leaves in place 10 per cent tariffs on British exports, modestly expands agricultural access for both countries and lowers prohibitive US duties on British car exports. May 12 - The US and China agree to temporarily slash reciprocal tariffs. Under the 90-day truce, the US will cut the extra tariffs it imposed on Chinese imports to 30 per cent from 145 per cent, while China's duties on US imports will be slashed to 10 per cent from 125 per cent. May 13 - The US cuts the low value \"de minimis\" tariff on China shipments, reducing duties for items valued at up to US$800 to 54 per cent from 120 per cent. May 23 - Trump says he is recommending a straight 50 per cent tariff on goods from the European Union starting on Jun 1. He also warned Apple it would face 25 per cent tariff if phones it sold in the US were manufactured outside of the country. May 25 - Trumpbackpedalson his threat to slap 50 per cent tariffs on imports from the EU, agreeing to extend the deadline for talks between the US and the block until Jul 9. May 26 - Singapore’s Prime Minister Lawrence Wong suggests the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should aim to be“100 per cent tariff-free”within its free trade area. At the 46th ASEAN summit, the leadersdiscussed new trade partnersand ways to tackle US tariffs.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang called on the sides to build a model of “cross-regional openness”, referring to the economic and developmental potential of “fully connecting” the three regional markets. May 28 - A US trade court blocked Trump's tariffs from going into effect in a sweeping ruling that the president overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on imports from nations that sell more to the United States than they buy. The Trump administration said it would appeal the ruling.

The Jun 3 election comes after months of political turmoil and a power vacuum following the botched attempt by former leader Yoon Suk Yeol to impose martial law. \"In order to overcome the current crisis ... and start again as a Korea of recovery and growth, please vote,\" Lee said after casting his ballot at a university district in the city. His comment came after the Bank of Korea cut interest rates on Thursday and slashed its 2025 growth forecast for Asia's fourth-largest economy to 0.8 per cent from 1.5 per cent previously.

Some 3,107,164 people, or 7 per cent of total eligible voters, had voted as of around 11am local time (10am Singapore time), according to National Election Commission data, the highest turnout for the equivalent period in a presidential poll and compared with 5.38 per cent in the 2022 vote. South Korea has 44.39 million eligible voters and early voting is allowed on Thursday and Friday. The top three candidates based on the last published Gallup Korea poll before the blackout period put Lee at 49 per cent public support, followed by his main conservative rival Kim Moon-soo of the People Power Party with 35 per cent and another conservative candidate, the New Reform Party's Lee Jun-seok, on 11 per cent. Kim and Lee Jun-seok also voted on Thursday. Kim had eroded what was a more than 20 percentage point gap with Lee Jae-myung at the start of the campaign on May 12, but has failed to convince Lee Jun-seok to drop out and back him to improve his chances.

    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore The Indonesian said he would fight the charges in a trial. The SingaporeAir and Kris+ apps, which use KrisFlyer miles, are displayed on a mobile phone on May 28, 2025. (Photo: CNA) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: A man was on Thursday (May 29) charged with spending over 250,000 KrisFlyer miles in other people's accounts without their permission. Rizaldy Primanta Putra, a 28-year-old Indonesian, was charged with four counts under the Computer Misuse Act. Appearing through a video link from remand, he told a district court that he intended to claim trial to the charges. His bail has been set at S$15,000 (US$11,600). Rizaldy is accused of using 4,672 miles in a KrisPay wallet to buy items valued at S$31.15 at Bugis Junction on Jun 8, 2024. The KrisPay wallet was linked to a KrisFlyer account that belonged to another person, which Rizaldy was not authorised to use. On Jun 21, 2024, he allegedly used 245,491 KrisFlyer miles from another account to buy S$1,636.61 worth of items at Changi Airport. For each of these two instances, Rizaldy was also given a charge of logging into the accounts on the Kris+ app without authorisation. According to the police, Rizaldy accessed KrisFlyer accounts that belonged to other people after illegally buying them online while he was overseas. He flew to Singapore in June 2024, and allegedly committed the offences by buying pastries at Bugis Junction and a phone and phone cover at Changi Airport. In October 2024, Singapore Airlines made a police report about suspected fraudulent transactions using KrisFlyer miles that were detected by local retailers.

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Women Wellness Wellness Singapore Living Buyers' Guide Living Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Dining Dining Dining Experiences Singapore Experiences Experiences Travel Entertainment Entertainment On Tuesday (May 27), the 25-year-old member of K-pop girl group Aespa uploaded photos on Instagram – some of which showed her wearing a black jacket with red stripes and the number 2. Both the colour red and the number 2 have been associated with South Korean presidential candidate Kim Moon-soo of the conservative People Power Party (PPP). The now-deleted Instagram showed Karina wearing the jacket seemingly in Japan. (Photo: Instagram/katarinabluu) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Karina of K-pop girl group Aespa has issued an apology over a now-deleted Instagram post which, according to South Korean netizens, had signalled her support for the conservative People Power Party (PPP) inthe country's upcoming presidential election. On Tuesday (May 27), the 25-year-old uploaded a series of photos – some of which showed her wearing a black jacket with red stripes and the number 2. Both the colour red and the number 2 have been associated with South Korean presidential candidate Kim Moon-soo of the PPP, with red being the party's representative colour and Kim being the second listed candidate on the ballot. The caption of Karina's Instagram post also featured an emoji of a red rose; the upcoming election has been called a \"rose election\" in South Korea as it comes during a season when roses are in bloom. During election season, South Korean entertainment figures, including K-pop idols, are strongly advised by their agencies to avoid actions that could signal their political affiliations. These include wearing the representative colours of the various political parties and showing certain hand gestures, such as a thumbs-up or a peace sign, in public. Following the backlash surrounding her post, Karina took to the fan messaging app Bubble to apologise. She wrote: “I’m really sorry for making Mys [Aespa's fans] worry. I had no such intention at all. But the misunderstanding kept growing and since you were so worried, I thought I should talk to you directly. From now on, I’ll also try to be more attentive and act more carefully. I’m sorry once again for making you worry.” Karina's agency, SM Entertainment, has also issued a separate statement, apologising for Karina's actions. “Karina merely shared something about her daily life on social media, with no other intention or purpose whatsoever,” wrote SM Entertainment. “However, upon realising that the post could lead to misunderstandings, she promptly deleted it. We sincerely apologise for the unintended concern it may have caused. We will also be more mindful and put in greater effort to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. We hope that the artiste’s intentions will no longer be distorted or consumed with a specific agenda. We will continue to do our utmost to protect Karina and all of our artistes.” Conversely, Karina has seen a rise in support from fans of the PPP, with many of them calling her a \"goddess\" in online communities. The jacket she wore, made by American brand Vaquera, has also sold out in numerous online stores. On Jun 3, South Koreans will vote for their next president. The election will determine the successor of former president Yoon Suk Yeol, who has since left the PPP. He was removed from power for violating the constitution after he called for martial law in December 2024.

    "title": "Musk to exit US government role after rare break with Trump",
    "article_text": "World World Elon Musk listens to US President Donald Trump speak in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US on Feb 11, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Kevin Lamarque) WASHINGTON: Billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday (May 28) announced he was leaving his role in the United States government, intended to reduce federal spending, shortly after his firstmajor breakwith President Donald Trump over his signature spending Bill. \"As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President Donald Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\" he wrote on his social media platform X. \"The DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency) mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,\" he added. Musk's 130-day mandate as a special government employee in the Trump administration was set to expire around May 30. The administration has said DOGE's efforts to restructure and shrink the federal government will continue. A White House official told Reuters it was accurate that Musk is leaving the administration and his \"off-boarding will begin tonight\". Musk reportedly did not have a formal conversation with Trump on Wednesday before he announced his departure, a source told Reuters, adding that his exit was decided \"at a senior staff level\". Musk on Tuesday criticised the price tag of Republicans' tax and budget legislation. The South African-born tech tycoon had said Trump's spending Bill would increase the deficit and undermine the work of DOGE, which has fired tens of thousands of people. Musk, who was a constant presence at Trump's side before pulling back to focus on his SpaceX and Tesla businesses, also complained that DOGE had become a \"whipping boy\" for dissatisfaction with the administration. \"I was disappointed to see the massive spending Bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk said in an interview with CBS News, an excerpt of which aired late Tuesday. Trump's\"One Big, Beautiful Bill Act\"- which passed the US House last week and now moves to the Senate - offers sprawling tax relief and spending cuts and is the centrepiece of his domestic agenda. But critics warn it will decimate health care and balloon the national deficit by as much as US$4 trillion over a decade. \"A Bill can be big, or it can be beautiful. But I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion,\" Musk said in the interview, which will be aired in full on Sunday. The White House sought to play down any differences over US government spending, without directly naming Musk. \"The Big Beautiful Bill is NOT an annual budget Bill,\" Trump's Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said on Musk's social network, X, after the tech titan's comments aired. All DOGE cuts would have to be carried out through a separate Bill targeting the federal bureaucracy, according to US Senate rules, Miller added. But Musk's comments represented a rare split with the Republican president whom he helped propel back to power, as the largest donor to his 2024 election campaign. Trump tasked Musk with cutting government spending as head of DOGE, but after a feverish start, Musk announced in late April he was mostlystepping backto run his companies again. Musk complained in a separate interview with the Washington Post that DOGE, which operated out of the White House with a staff of young technicians, had become a lightning rod for criticism. \"DOGE is just becoming the whipping boy for everything,\" Musk told the newspaper at the Starbase launch site in Texas ahead of SpaceX's latest launch on Tuesday. \"Something bad would happen anywhere, and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it.\" Musk blamed entrenched US bureaucracy for DOGE's failure to achieve all of its goals, although reports say his domineering style and lack of familiarity with the currents of Washington politics were also major factors. \"The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realised,\" he said. \"I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.\" Musk has previously admitted that he did not achieve all his goals with DOGE even though tens of thousands of people were removed from government payrolls and several departments were gutted or shut down. Trump and DOGE have managed to cut nearly 12 per cent, or 260,000, of the 2.3 million-strong federal civilian workforce largely through threats of firings, buyouts and early retirement offers, a Reuters review of agency departures found. Musk's own businesses suffered in the meantime. Protesters against the cost-cutting targeted Tesla dealerships while arsonists even torched a few of the electric vehicles, and the firm's profits slumped. \"People were burning Teslas. Why would you do that? That's really uncool,\" Musk told the Post. Musk has also been focusing on SpaceX after a series of fiery setbacks to his dreams of colonising Mars - the latest of which came on Tuesday when its prototype Starshipexplodedover the Indian Ocean. The tycoon last week also said he would pull back from spending his fortune on politics, having spent around a quarter of a billion dollars to support Trump.

After going a goal down, Chelsea quickly asserted themselves and left little doubt by the final whistle that they were the better side, closing the match in Wroclaw with a commanding 4-1 victory over Spanish side Real Betis.

REUTERS/Alexander Manzyuk/File Photo TOKYO :Oil prices rose on Thursday after a U.S. court blocked most of President Donald Trump's tariffs from taking effect, while the market was watching out for potential new U.S. sanctions curbing Russian crude flows and an OPEC+ decision on hiking output in July. Brent crude futures climbed 78 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to $65.68 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude advanced by 78 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $62.62 a barrel at 0405 GMT. A U.S. trade court on Wednesday ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on imports from U.S. trading partners. The court was not asked to address some industry-specific tariffs Trump has issued on automobiles, steel and aluminium using a different statute. The ruling buoyed risk appetite across global markets which have been on edge about the impact of the levies on economic growth, but analysts said the relief may only be temporary given the Trump administration has said it will appeal.

This image released by Sony Pictures shows, from left, Ralph Macchio, Ben Wang and Jackie Chan in a scene from \"Karate Kid: Legends.\" (Jonathan Wenk/Sony Pictures via AP) Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio blend fighting techniques to train a new karate kid in the latest instalment of the martial arts movie franchise. Karate Kid: Legends, which opens Jun 5 in Singapore, stars Ben Wang as Beijing kung fu whizz Li Fong who moves with his mother to New York, where he befriends pizza restaurant owner and retired boxer Victor and his daughter Mia. When that friendship irks a local karate champion, Li enters a karate tournament and begins training with his old kung fu teacher Mr Han, played by Chan, and Macchio's Daniel LaRusso, the protagonist of the original 1984 film The Karate Kid who learned karate from mentor Mr Miyagi. “They presented the concept to me ... connecting the Miyagi to the Han family and how that made sense ... I was like ‘That's kind of clever. Okay, so how do we maintain this connective tissue into Li Fong’s story that is organic and truthful',\" Macchio told Reuters in a joint interview with Chan and Wang. \"That was the challenge at first and figuring that out. Working with Jackie was like, ‘Woohoo sign me up–when, where?’ And then who's the kid? If we don't love this kid, then you have no movie. So all those, like it happens with The Karate Kid universe, is magic dust that comes down and somehow it continues to resonate. So I'm excited for the next generation version.” The movie is Macchio's fourth Karate Kid film playing LaRusso, a character he also portrayed in the Cobra Kai television series. Chan reprises the role of Mr Han, a character he first played in the 2010 film The Karate Kid opposite Jaden Smith. \"Now we've both become a Miyagi,\" Chan said, referring to both his and Macchio's characters becoming mentors. \"I remember when I saw the first one. Why him (Macchio)? Why not me?...I want to be The Karate Kid. (Now) We work together.” Wang, 25, said Chan's 2010 film introduced him to the franchise. “Stepping into it, it's a terrifying thing in a certain way because it's a beloved franchise and ... the fans love it so much so I want to do right by them,\" he said. \"But it's also a great honour because a lot of people auditioned for this part so I know how special and lucky it is that I get to do this with the two of them.\" Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "title": "Trump is down but not out in court battle over Harvard's foreign student visas",
    "article_text": "Fox News legal editor Kerri Urbahn discusses the legal battle between the Trump administration and Harvard University over foreign student enrollment on ‘America’s Newsroom.’ A federal judge upheld a court order blocking PresidentDonald Trumpfrom stripping Harvard University of its ability to sponsor international student visas. U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs on Thursday extended her earlier restraining order, which blocks the Trump administration from revoking Harvard’s certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, or SEVP. That certification allows colleges to sponsor international students for U.S. visas during their enrollment. Burroughs, an Obama appointee, said she would preserve the status quo while both sides confer and submit either a joint proposed preliminary injunction order or individual proposed orders. But the update from the court is not a loss for the Trump administration — at least not yet. TRUMP NOMINATES FORMER DEFENSE ATTORNEY EMIL BOVE FOR FEDERAL APPEALS COURT VACANCY Banners at the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library on the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Mass., May 27, 2025.(Sophie Park/Bloomberg) At issue is whether the Trump administration has grounds to revoke Harvard's SEVP certification. Trump officialshave accused Harvard Universityof \"fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,\" according to a statement from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. Legal experts told Fox News Digital that foreign students have far fewer protections than U.S. citizens, which puts Harvard at the government's mercy as long as the Trump administration satisfies certain procedural requirements. Experts noted that the SEVP program falls squarely under the authority of DHS and ICE, giving the Trump administration broad discretion to certify, extend or revoke a university’s participation based on the conduct of its foreign student visa holders. STATE DEPARTMENT NOW SCRUTINIZING ALL VISA HOLDERS ASSOCIATED WITH HARVARD While U.S. citizens haveFirst Amendmentprotected free speech rights, the same is not true for foreign students studying in the U.S., whose status is sponsored by their university. The intersection \"of First Amendment [issues] with immigration law, at least to this extent, has really become a new thing under this administration,\" Robert Shibley, the special counsel for campus advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, told Fox News Digital. \"Part of the complication here is that the government does have so much more leeway on foreign policy issues,\" Shibley said. \"However, I think in this case, there's a pretty clear process laid out in the regulations for stripping a school of its ability to get foreign students to attend on visas — and simply demanding a certain amount of information from the school and stripping them immediately, which is what they originally said, not the process.\" Demonstrators gather on Cambridge Common to protest Harvard's stance on the war in Gaza and show support for the Palestinian people outside Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., April 25, 2025.(Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images) Shortly after court adjourned Thursday, the Trump administration gave Harvard 30 days to submit evidence and argue why its SEVP certification should not be revoked. It’s unclear whether that alone satisfies procedural requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act. The court must also consider what type of conduct foreign student visa holders are engaged in and whether these student visa holders are \"systemically\" engaged in serial violations of immigration law or are acting in support of foreign terrorist organizations, alleged foreign terrorist organizations or foreign totalitarian governments. \"That gives DHS stake to investigate and reevaluate on an off-cycle basis, the SEVP certification and eligibility,\" said Aram Gavoor, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School and a former Justice Department attorney. In this case, he said, DHS would have \"significant authorities to authorize, regulate, certify and, if necessary, decertify, the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.\" TRUMP ADMIN WORKING TO FLY BACK GUATEMALAN MIGRANT ERRONEOUSLY DEPORTED FROM US \"And, in a number of circumstances, the ability of a university to operate its own educational institution with what it teaches and how it teaches that can — in certain circumstances — come into tension with the authority of the U.S. government to regulate immigration in the context of student exchange visitors,\" Gavoor added. Lawyers for Harvard told the court that, if enacted, the revocation of its SEVP program would affect roughly 7,000 international students at the school at the undergraduate and post-graduate level, causing irreparable harm. They also claimed the action was a breach of administrative procedure, which requires the administration to grant a certain period of notice before revoking their SEVP credentials. \"The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence,\" Harvard University President Alan Garber said Friday in a letter to the Harvard community. In the short term, the uncertainty could lead foreign students in the visa program to flee Harvard, seeking transfers to other universities that are not targeted by the Trump administration, experts told Fox News. Harvard President Alan Garber acknowledges an extended round of applause during Harvard University's commencement ceremonies Thursday, May 29, 2025 in Cambridge, Mass.(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) Student visa holders are given roughly 180 days after their status is revoked to leave the country or risk violating the law, making the case of utmost importance for thousands of students. Legal experts notedthe courtis wading into largely uncharted territory. Asked how it might play out, many scholars pointed to a lack of precedent and offered no clear answer. \"As with many things that Trump does, the answer is unclear, because it hasn't been done before,\" Josh Blackman, a law professor atSouth Texas College of Law, said. \"No president has tried to do this before, so I don't think there's a clear precedent on the answer. \"What I'll say is this: Trump has basically accused Harvard of being a front for terrorism and emboldening terrorism,\" he added. \"And I think what they're trying to do is determine if this institution can basically exist.\" This was echoed by Gavoor, who said things need to play out between the Trump administration and Harvard before the court can properly decide if the government followed the law. \"I think Harvard does need to comply with the off-cycle review of DHS's SEVP certification,\" Gavoor said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP At the same time, he said, even if the Trump administration loses on the merits of this case, \"there's a point to be argued that it may have won as a function of policy,\" he said. \"That's because it simply creates a chilling effect for students who would otherwise be attending or apply to Harvard University to be less inclined to do so or [causes them] to make alternative plans for their education In the U.S.\" Breanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering the Trump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI, and other national news.",

A top United States military general warned Thursday thatterror groupsin Africa are ramping up their ability to conduct attacks in the U.S. Gen. Michael Langley, the four-star Marine General who leads U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), said the Sahel region of the continent is now the \"flashpoint of prolonged conflict and growing instability. It is the epicenter of terrorism on the globe.\" Several terror groups have expanded drastically in the last three years. Al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, is three times the size it was in 2022, he said, and has spread across Mali, Burkina Faso, and parts of Niger, which theU.S. militarypulled out of last year.

Khalil is a pro-Palestine, anti-Israel activist who led protests at Columbia University. An immigration judge recently said he could be deported, but U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz for the District of New Jersey said that the order is likely to be dismissed as \"unconstitutionally vague.\" Still, Khalil will remain in custody. \"The district court held what we already knew: Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio’s weaponization of immigration law to punish Mahmoud and others like him is likely unconstitutional,\"lawyers for Khalilsaid after the judge’s ruling.

Mahmoud Khalil lied his way into our country, concealed ties to a foreign regime, and then led a pro-Hamas takeover at Columbia University. Now, a judicial activist wants to block his deportation?

Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson's new book, \"Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" was released in May to much fanfare. The book helped set the recent news cycle with new accusations of the BidenWhite Househiding the truth about the former president's fitness for office. To promote the project, Tapper has embarked on a wide-ranging book tour that landed him on a variety of podcasts, talk shows and cable news. The book has also been promoted relentlessly across CNN, but the spotlight on Tapper has seemingly failed to give him a boost in viewership. TAPPER ADMITS FEELING 'HUMILITY' ABOUT PAST BIDEN COVERAGE AS LIBERALS DISPARAGE NEW BOOK Jake Tapper embarked on a wide-ranging book tour that landed him on a variety of podcasts, talk shows and even on CNN rival MSNBC.(Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Warner Bros. Discovery) \"The Lead with Jake Tapper\" averaged 525,000 total viewers from April 28 through May 25, shedding 25% of CNN’s audience in its timeslot from the same period last year in the process. By comparison, Fox News offerings \"The Five\" and \"Special Report with Bret Baier\" averaged 3.3 million viewers from April 28 through May 25, trouncing Tapper. MSNBC also beat Tapper among total viewers, as programming on the progressive network averaged a little over one million viewers in the timeslot. As a result, Tapper settled for only 11% of the cable news audience share, while MSNBC managed 21% andFox Newscommanded 68% during the timeframe. It was Tapper’s lowest-rated month since August 2015.

Tapper’s newscast averaged only 95,000 viewers among the critical demo from April 28 through May 25, for a 15% drop. \"The Lead with Jake Tapper\" wasn’t the only CNN offering to struggle, as the network had its second-worst month ever in the demo across both total day and primetime during May. While Tapper’s efforts to promote \"Original Sin\" haven’t helped viewership, the CNN host has managed to generate headlines by admitting he didn’t report on Biden’s age issues aggressively enough and declaring the cover-up of the former president’s mental decline may be aworse scandal than Watergate. CNN's Jake Tapper admitted he didn't cover Joe Biden's cognitive decline enough when the former president was in office.(Screenshot/CNN) When reached for comment, CNN noted that Nielsen Media Research only reflects CNN’s audience in the United States, but Tapper’s program airs on other platforms. \"The award-winning program The Lead with Jake Tapper reaches broad global audiences across CNN, CNN International and Max’s streaming platform.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on the Trump administration’s foreign policy battles and Elon Musk’s remarks about the ‘big, beautiful bill’ on ‘Special Report.’ Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhas amassed some 50,000 troops on Ukraine’s northern border despite a united push by the U.S. and Ukraine to get Moscow to enter into \"meaningful\" ceasefire negotiations. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyon Wednesday warned that Putin is preparing a massive summer offensive in a move to push Ukraine’s troops out of Russia’s Kursk region, and to launch a new invasion into Ukraine’s Sumy region — a mere 200 miles from the capital city of Kyiv. Zelenskyy reiterated this week that he is ready to hold direct negotiations with Putin and suggested that if the Kremlin chief is uncomfortable with a bilateral meeting, a trilateral meeting could be held with PresidentDonald Trump.

The U.S. president said he was \"very disappointed\" at Russia's continued bombardment of Ukraine during negotiation attempts, but he has refused to hit Putin with more sanctions, telling reporters, \"I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that.\" Heorhii Tykhyi, spokesman for Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Thursday during a live chat on X that since theMay 16 meeting in Turkey, Russia had launched 120 missiles, more than 1,500 Shahed drones and more than 2,500 guided bombs on Ukrainian cities. The Sumy regional governor confirmed on Monday that Russian forces had officially taken overfour Ukrainian villagesnear the Ukraine-Russia border which were previously evacuated, and which sat in a \"gray zone\" that has long been militarily contested following Russia’s February 2022 invasion.

Implementing a buffer zone onUkraine’s northern territorywill likely be used as a bargaining chip if Moscow engages in ceasefire negotiations, which Kyiv has said Russia has failed to do in good faith after delegations from both sides met in Istanbul earlier this month, but failed to advance peace talks.

    "article_text": "New aid distribution center established in the Tel al-Sultan area of Gaza. (Video: IDF.) The terrorist group known as Hamas has long plagued theGaza Stripbut is facing a point of crisis as its influence and support, which was already far from sweeping, continues to drop amid internal pressure to end the war and return the hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. \"Hamas’s current posture reveals a critical inflection point in its grip over the Gaza Strip,\" Joe Truzman, a senior research analyst and editor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Long War Journal and an expert on Palestinian terrorist groups, told Fox News Digital. \"By opposing the new aid distribution mechanism, one that is coordinated by the U.S. and Israel, Hamas is signaling that its primary concern is not the well-being of Palestinians but the preservation of its authority.\" Despite the monthslong aid blockade on the Gaza Strip byIsraeland the images of starvation, Hamas this week threatened any Palestinian civilians who accept food aid for their families and warned they \"will pay the price, and we will take the necessary measures.\" Displaced Palestinians line up pans to collect hot food from a charity food distribution center in Gaza City, northern Gaza, on Tuesday, May 27, 2025.(Photographer: Ahmad Salem/Bloomberg via Getty Images) HAMAS TERROR GROUP REPORTEDLY BUCKLING UNDER FINANCIAL STRAIN AMID ISRAELI MILITARY GAINS AND GROWING UNREST Despite the threats, Palestinians have flooded theaid siteserected by the U.S.-Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), reportedly resulting in scenes of chaos as desperate civilians overran one distribution location on Tuesday. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its \"troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound,\" adding, \"Control over the situation was established … and the safety of IDF troops was not compromised.\" The U.N. Human Rights Office claimed some 47 people were injured during the gunfire, while the Hamas-run health ministry said one person was killed and 48 others were wounded, reported theBBC, though Fox News Digital could not independently verify the casualty count. On Wednesday, GHF said in a statement that, contrary to reports, no Palestinians have been questioned or detained while receiving aid. Additionally, GHF said that no Palestinians had been shot or killed while trying to get aid. \"As we have repeatedly cautioned, there are many parties who wish to see GHF fail. Their goal is to force a return to the status quo, even if it means risking lifesaving aid to the people of Gaza,\" the GHF said in a statement. \"Reports to the contrary originated from Hamas and are inaccurate.\" Hamas fighters stand in formation as Palestinians gather on a street to watch the handover of three Israeli hostages to a Red Cross team in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, on February 8, 2025(Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Truzman explained that it is in Hamas interest to portray the aid delivery as negatively as possible, and to use the chaos to promote itsreturn to power. \"Hamas had significant influence over aid flows, which it used not only for governance but also as leverage to reinforce loyalty, reward patronage networks, and maintain internal control,\" the expert explained. \"The erosion of this influence poses both a symbolic and operational threat to the group. \"With Hamas becoming sidelined from the aid process, the group is facing a legitimacy crisis,\" Truzman added. Despite the chaotic scenes that arose as aid finally returned to Gaza, the GHF said Tuesday that it had distributed about 8,000 food boxes totaling 462,000 meals so far. Displaced Palestinian children wait to receive a free meal from a charity food distribution center in Gaza City, northern Gaza, on Tuesday, May 27, 2025.(Photographer: Ahmad Salem/Bloomberg via Getty Images) On Wednesday, eight trucks worth of aid were delivered, which equates to some 378,262 meals. \"Operations will continue to scale up tomorrow,\" the GHF confirmed. One Gazan told the Center for Peace Communications that the failure of Hamas, which serves as the local government, to secure affordable and accessible food has driven civilians to the American distribution site. \"In fact, they were good to us,\" he said. \"They were handing out rations cards and started to tell us to take them. Unlike those ruling Gaza who don't do anything for us. \"We, as a people, are telling you that we need anyone, anyone who can provide us with these necessities,\" he added. \"Otherwise, no one would be going to the American distribution point. If Hamas is listening to us, get off the people's backs. \"The people are dying,\" the man added. ISRAELI AMBASSADOR SLAMS UN'S 'MAFIA-LIKE' TACTICS AGAINST US-BACKED GAZA FOUNDATION In recent months, civilian populations have not only been turning to external actors for relief where possible, they haveincreasingly called on Hamasto return the hostages, stop the war and even leave the Gaza Strip. \"This shift undermines Hamas’s image as the authority in Gaza and exposes its weakened state,\" Truzman said. \"However, any assumption that Hamas might yield under these conditions must be tempered by the nature of its surviving leadership,\" he warned. \"Those who remain at the helm are among the most ideologically entrenched and militarily committed members of the organization.\" Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in 2007 after it defeated its rival party, Fatah, which is part of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Despite the plurality vote nearly two decades ago, Hamas has struggled to maintain control and stability for years and its support – even in the lead up to the 2023 attacks that prompted the largest-ever war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza – was reportedly lacking and its leadership growing increasingly unpopular.

Abumohsen/Anadolu via Getty Images) ISRAEL BLOCKS HUMANITARIAN AID INTO GAZA AFTER HAMAS REJECTS CEASEFIRE EXTENSION PROPOSAL Israel and Egypt have limited the flow of goods into the Gaza Strip for the last two decades, and border crossing restrictions have been heavily enforced since the 1980s. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2025. However, according to a report by theWilson Center, only a fraction of the population prior to the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks blamed food shortages on external factors like sanctions, while a third blamed the Hamas-run government for mismanagement, while another quarter of the population blamed inflation. The report also found that nearly half of Palestinian civilians said they had no trust in Hamas' leadership, while roughly a third of the population threw their support behind the group. Support isbelieved to have droppedin the nearly 600 days that followed the Oct. 7, 2023 terror attacks, and the subsequent devastation brought to the Gaza Strip.

    "title": "West Point decision to cut ‘duty, honor, country’ from mission statement under fire again",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump gives his closing statement during his West Point commencement address. EXCLUSIVE:A United States Military Academy mission statement swap from \"duty, honor, country\" to \"Army Values\" is coming under fire again — this time by a conservative judicial and government watchdog group who claims the school engaged in a \"cover up\" scheme when it altered its mission statement in 2024 as part of an effort to advance a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) agenda. On March 11, 2024, West Point Superintendent Lt. Gen. Steven Gilland publicly announced that West Point would update its mission and insert the term \"Army Values\" in lieu of \"duty, honor, country.\" Even so, Gilland stressed that \"duty, honor, country\" would remain West Point’s motto as it has been since 1898. Judicial Watch obtained documents via a Freedom of Information Act request seeking all emails regarding the removal of \"duty, honor, country\" from the mission statement between officials at West Point. HEGSETH QUIPS '99.9%' OF DEI INITIATIVES ARE GONE FROM THE MILITARY UNDER TRUMP’S WATCH Among the documents Judicial Watch obtained is a document from Gilland detailing mission statement talking points for Founders Day speakers that was sent on March 23, 2024. The memo instructs speakers to \"AVOID saying ‘removed,’ ‘replaced,’ ‘deleted’—just refer to the ‘updated mission statement and reinforce that the motto remains unchanged.’\" The memo does not explicitly connect the mission statement change to any DEI initiatives. However, Judicial Watch argues that the talking points document it obtained implies DEI was a factor in the mission statement change because the document also contains an FAQ section that appears to downplay the role of DEI, claiming only five to eight students each year complete West Point’s Diversity and Inclusion Studies minor. \"These records detail how the DEI agenda helped change the mission statement of West Point — and how leadership under the Biden administration tried to cover it up,\" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a Thursday statement to Fox News Digital. But in the memo outlining mission statement talking points, Gilland urged speakers to push back against the narrative that the mission statement change was done for political purposes. \"EMPHASIZE the actual seven values as some in the audience don’t realize Army Values is a defined term and to counter the social media narrative that the Army Values change for political reasons. AVOID comparing DHC to AV—it’s not either/or,\" the mission statement talking points document said. NAVAL ACADEMY CLOSING DEI OFFICES TO ALIGN WITH TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDERS: MEMO The U.S. Military Academy at West Point is a selective institution that prepares students to become officers in the U.S. Army.(iStock) \"AVOID the perception that the External Review Team was political or made the decision. The Academy selected them. They advised. Academy leadership made Decisions,\" the document said. The term \"Army Values\" keeps \"duty\" and \"honor\" within its core set of values, but also includes the following: loyalty, respect, selfless service, integrity and personal courage. Gilland said in a statement announcing the change that \"country\" is reflected in the term \"loyalty.\" \"The Army Values include Duty and Honor, and Country is reflected in Loyalty, bearing truth faith and allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, the Army, your unit, and other Soldiers,\" Gilland said in an announcement about the mission statement change. Gilland also said that \"duty, honor, country\" is \"foundational to the United States Military Academy's culture and will always remain our motto.\" An Army spokesperson directed Fox News Digital to Gilland's original announcement where he wrote: \"Our absolute focus on developing leaders of character ready to lead our Army's Soldiers on increasingly lethal battlefields remains unchanged.\" West Point is one of several U.S. military academies that trains students to become military officers. Meanwhile, West Point’s mission statement has been changed nine times in the past century, and the words \"duty, honor, country\" didn’t make it into West Point’s mission statement until 1998. As of March 2024, West Point’s mission statement is: \"To build, educate, train, and inspire the Corps of Cadets to be commissioned leaders of character committed to the Army Values and ready for a lifetime of service to the Army and Nation.\" WEST POINT DISBANDS GENDER-BASED, RACE CLUBS IN TRUMP'S DEI SWEEP West Point cadets in formation. (U.S. Military Academy) West Point’s previous mission statement, first adopted in 2005, remained: \"To educate, train and inspire the Corps of Cadets so that each graduate is a commissioned leader of character committed to the values of Duty, Honor, Country and prepared for a career of professional excellence and service to the Nation as an officer in the United States Army.\" West Point’s superintendent at the time, Lt. Gen. William Lennox, requested the change in 2005 and then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Peter Schoomaker approved the change. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile,Republicanshave pushed to incorporate \"duty, honor, country\" back into the mission statement. For example, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spearheaded legislation in January to add the words back to the military academy’s mission statement. \"For centuries, the United States Army has set the global standard for military excellence because its leaders embrace a lifetime of selfless service and embody the values of ‘Duty, Honor, Country.’ West Point’s removal of these core values from its mission statement risks eroding the foundation of American military leadership,\" Cruz said in a statement in January.

    "article_text": "Rep. Ashley Hinson spoke at a town hall in Iowa on Wednesday, where she was jeered after mentions of President Donald Trump. (Credit: C-SPAN) An Iowa congresswoman touted her support for PresidentDonald Trump’stax and spending bill in back-to-back town halls on Wednesday, even as members of the audience jeered and disrupted her speech. \"They were booing when I was saying, you know, ‘We're preserving tax cuts,’ and I can't believe people would boo tax cuts for themselves,\" Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, told Fox News Digital on Thursday. \"I think there are a number of people who just show up to these town halls who want to disrupt. They didn't care what I had to say. They just want to boo and yell and be angry.\" And there were a significant number of such people at both her town halls in Elkader and Decorah on Wednesday. SCOOP: HOUSE GOP MEMO HIGHLIGHTS REPUBLICAN WINS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' Rep. Ashley Hinson held back-to-back town halls on Wednesday.(Getty Images) At both events, Hinson touted her support for Trump and House Republicans’budget reconciliation billand promoted the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) efforts. Both issues drew largely negative reactions from people there, save for some exceptions. At one point in the first town hall, a woman named Linda stood on behalf of another woman, Nicole, who was in a wheelchair and had \"difficulty speaking.\" Nicole, who relied on federal health and food programs, was concerned about any cuts to those programs making her life more difficult, Linda said. The crowd then cheered as Hinson pledged that Republicans were only reforming those programs, \"so that people like you can continue to have access to the treatments and medications you need.\" The goodwill was short-lived, however, when the next questioner accused Republicans of cutting university funding in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy – despite Hinson pointing out the bill does not change income tax brackets. MIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET ‘BIG, 'BEAUTIFUL’ WIN AS BUDGET PASSES HOUSE \"It’s an absolute crime,\" the man shouted. The boos grew louder when Hinson accused top universities of \"letting men play in girls' sports.\" People in the crowd could be heard screaming \"stop it\" and \"stop spinning.\" At her second town hall, the crowd jeered as Hinson emphasized her support for Trump. \"The president is, I believe, fighting for you and fighting for me. I’m fighting alongside of him. I think God saved President Trump’slife in Butler,\" Hinson said before briefly pausing as the boos swelled. \"I think He saved his life in Butler, Pennsylvania for a reason. I think he is helping us to save this country,\" she continued. Hinson was still unfazed by the protesters when she spoke with Fox News Digital the next day.

And I will not only defend this agenda and answer any questions any day, any time of the week, but I think it is really important that I'm out there on offense, correcting the record.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The congresswoman said the disruptions grew so loud that it prompted a Vietnam War veteran to address her after one of the events and tell her, \"I couldn’t hear over all that, and I think that’s a shame because I wanted to hear what you had to say.\" \"That’s really the disservice. Again, these people who their only intent is to disrupt, someone like that man who served our country, who wanted to come hear what I had to say, had trouble hearing me,\" Hinson said. \"People there want to be able to have civil discourse and ask the questions and hear my answers.\" Elizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

    "article_text": "Chicago Democratic Mayor Brandon Johnson fumes over DOGE cuts, compares rise of Trump to rise of Adolf Hitler. (City of Chicago) Chicago Democratic MayorBrandon Johnsonlaid into the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and PresidentDonald Trump'seconomic policies during his weekly press availability, drawing parallels between the Third Reich in Germany and Trump's second term in the White House. Johnson saidthe Windy City is the most \"pro-worker\" city in the U.S., but faces \"hostility\" from Washington. \"The fact that the President of the United States of Americais cutting off food supplyand medicine to working people and families across this country — that is an act of war,\" Johnson fumed. \"And we're going to need leaders who are prepared and willing to stand up for working people, because this battle has reached our front doors all across America where people are struggling and suffering. And in order to alleviate that pain and discomfort, it's going to require bold leadership. We can't tippy toe.\" PROPOSED CHICAGO POLICE RESOURCE CUTS COULD LAND CITY IN COURT, TOP OFFICIALS WARN Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.(AP/Charles Arbogast) Addressing a reporter who asked how to work with the Trump administration for the benefit of the city from such an adversarial position, Johnson cited Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker’s State of the State address in February, which referenced how it \"took the Nazi’s one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a Constitutional Republic.\" \"Governor Pritzker… offered up a warning,\" Johnson said. \"You have a president that is cutting off medicine and food, a president that is working to erase culture. I mean, you can't make this up. He's doing it in plain sight.\" Pritzker had compared the rise of former German Chancellor Adolf Hitler to Trump’s popularity, in that the eventual national-socialist dictator was seen as the answer to \"inflation and [the public] looking for someone to blame.\" CHICAGO DEMOCRAT GOES OFF ON CITY'S HANDLING OF MIGRANT CRISIS Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, left, and German Chancellor Adolf Hitler at a Nazi parade in Germany, circa 1937.(Getty) In his remarks,Johnson notedhow people have wondered how Germany could have descended into Nazism and anti-Semitism so quickly and dreadfully, saying that Trump is \"carry[ing] out the playbook that was done against an entire people-group.\" \"He’s doing it right here in this country, against working people, erasing Black folks from museums and the history and the culture. So, when you ask how we balance that, you have to fight it and resist it with everything that's in you,\" he said. \"The President of the United States of America is capturing the hopes and aspirations of working people and holding us hostage as he works to implement and annihilate democracy,\" Johnson said, returning to comment on lawsuits the city has joined to halt DOGE-type efforts. Chicago is party to a lawsuit filed by several municipalities, including Baltimore; Santa Clara, California; and the county that encompasses Houston, which seeks to stop DOGE’s slashing of the federal bureaucracy. \"Congress created these federal agencies. It funded them. But the president is trying to fire all these people and gut these agencies that Congress created,\" Chicago Deputy Corporation Counsel Steve Kane told thecity’s ABC affiliate, calling the situation unconstitutional. DOGE-driven cuts affecting the Windy City have included the Energy Department’s 2025 Small Business Expo, originally pinned for June. The cut came as part of billions in spending reductions for cabinet agencies, and other closures of clean-energy-centric operations have affected the city, according to reports. Earlier in May, Chicago hired Ernst & Young, an international consulting firm, to find ways to bridge its own budget gaps,according to Bloomberg. The Trump administration has threatened to withhold funding from sanctuary cities, a definition within which Chicago falls. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While city-specific data was not immediately available for DOGE-related cuts, the Trump administration saw the Department of Health & Human Services cut its regional office in Illinois, which served 28,000 low-income families. Efforts to consolidate federal real estate and office space affected America’s third-largest city as well. The Federal Transit Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission, Labor Relations Authority and Civil Corps of Engineers all saw their offices there shut down. A federally-owned art collection in Chicago also sees some of its staffing on the chopping block,according to Axios. Fox News' Remy Numa and Patrick McGovern contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Thursday that the newly increased scrutiny on foreign student visas will be a 'continued' process, as opposed to a stricter 'one-time' check. State Department spokespersonTammy Bruceindicated Thursday that the increased scrutiny the Trump administration is placing on foreign student visas will not be a \"one-time\" check, but rather a process that lasts the entire time foreign students remain studying in the country. Bruce was peppered with questions at a Thursday press briefing about theTrump administration'splans for increased vetting for foreign students. The briefing came amid news that the Trump administration has paused new student visa appointments at embassies across the globe. The Trump administration also indicated this week it would begin \"aggressively\" revoking the visas of Chinese students that pose national security threats, and has plans to implement expanded social media vetting for foreign student visas. \"Everyone who's here on a visa has to recognize – certainly it is what they've seen over the last few months – that America takes their visa seriously, that vetting is not a one-time process – it's continuing,\" Bruce said in response to questions about what the new scrutiny and vetting will entail. \"When things, if things happen, if youget arrested,if there's some kind of an issue, it's probably going to be seen at some point,\" Bruce added. STATE DEPARTMENT NOW SCRUTINIZING ALL VISA HOLDERS ASSOCIATED WITH HARVARD State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce speaks at a State Department press briefing in April.(State Department) \"There's an interest in making sure that those who are here from China on a visa understand that we are taking our national security seriously,\" she continued. \"And, if everything's fine, terrific. But, that will be a vetting that certainly continues and is important.\" Citing national security concerns, Bruce did not reveal many details about what the new scrutiny on foreign students will look like. However, she did tell reporters that the student visa interviews will likely resume \"sooner-than-later,\" once a formalized process has been agreed upon. Bruce framed the new student visa scrutiny as part of President Donald Trump's \"America First\" agenda aimed at reducing alleged political indoctrination on campuses and ensuring that American students can receive the highest quality education possible without interference.

    "title": "Flashback: Top five wildest moments from Elon Musk's DOGE tenure as it comes to an end",
    "article_text": "Fox News co-host Charlie Hurt discusses the Tesla CEO's departure from his government duties on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’ Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced his departure from DOGE on social media Wednesday after five months of viral moments and cuts that sparked both praise and controversy nationwide. Fox News Digital compiled five of the top memorable moments from that span. As Musk’s efforts to cut government waste resulted in outrage from Democrats and violent protests at Tesla dealerships across the country, along with a dip in Tesla’s stock price, PresidentDonald Trumpannounced he was going to purchase a Tesla and met with Musk outside the White House to look at options. \"I’m going to buy a brand-new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,\" Trump announced. WHAT'S NEXT FOR DOGE AFTER ELON MUSK'S DEPARTURE? 'ONLY JUST BEGUN' Musk announced his last day as the public face of DOGE this week.(DOGE via X/Getty) \"To Republicans, Conservatives, and all great Americans, Elon Musk is ‘putting it on the line’ in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World’s great automakers, and Elon’s 'baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,\" Trump said on Truth Social. Trump and Musk were photographed examining different Tesla models and sitting inside them. Musk got in on the passenger side and joked about \"giving the Secret Service a heart attack\" as they talked about how to start a vehicle that can reach 60 miles per hour in a few seconds. \"That's beautiful, this is a different panel . . . everything's computer!\" Trump remarked, in a comment that went viral on social media. \"That's beautiful! Wow!\" Trump told reporters that he would write a check for the car he chose, which retails for roughly $80,000, and leave it at the White House, so his staff could drive it. The president also said he hopes his purchase will boost Tesla, which was struggling with sagging sales and declining stock prices at the time. One of the most notable DOGE revelations as it scoured the government for waste, fraud, and abuse wasMusk’s announcement in Februarythat his agency was looking into a limestone mine in Pennsylvania where he said federal employee retirements are processed manually using a system that could take months. \"We're like, well, what? Why is that? Well, because all the retirement paperwork is manual on paper,\" Musk said. \"It's manually calculated and written down on a piece of paper. Then it goes down to mine and like, what do you mean, a mine?\" DOGEwrote on Xthat an old limestone mine in Boyers, Pennsylvania, about 60 miles north of Pittsburgh, is where about 700 workers operate more than 230 feet underground to process about 10,000 federal retirement applications per month. The applications are processed by hand using paper, and are stored in manila envelopes and cardboard boxes, DOGE said. TheWashington Postdescribed the facility as a \"sinkhole of bureaucracy\" in a 2014 article. At the time, the report said the total spending on the retirement system was $55.8 million. \"And then the speed, the limiting factor is the speed at which the mine shaft elevator can move, determines how many people can retire from the federal government,\" Musk said. \"And the elevator breaks down and sometimes, and then you can't, nobody can retire. Doesn't that sound crazy?\" 'BUREAUCRATIC AND WASTEFUL': DOGE SNIFFS OUT EYE-POPPING SPENDING ON BIDEN DEI EFFORTS IN KEY AGENCY President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's son, \"Lil X,\" on the South Lawn on March 14, 2025, in Washington.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Musk’s 4-year-old son, Æ A-12, also known as \"Lil X,\" was often seen accompanying his father for visits to the White House and Capitol Hill in recent months, often going viral on social media. In February, Lil X made headlines after attending an Oval Office meeting and mimicking his father while he spoke, at one point sitting on Musk’s shoulders and putting his fingers in the former DOGE chief’s ears, and holding onto the Resolute Desk. \"This is X, and he's a great guy. High IQ,\" a chuckling Trump said, adding that the boy is a \"high-IQ individual.\" In March,heartwarming photographsof Trump walking to the president's helicopter, Marine One, with Elon Musk’s son went viral on social media, with internet users doting over the joyful moment. Musk sat down with \"Special Report\" executive editor Bret Baier for arevealing behind-the-scenes interviewwith members of his team earlier in March and offered previously unseen glimpses into the work being done. Musk, along with DOGE members Steve Davis, Joe Gebbia, Aram Moghaddassi, Brad Smith, Anthony Armstrong, Tom Krause and Tyler Hassen, illustrated key efforts of the department to achieve Trump's goal. Davis brought up federal credit cards, which he labeled a \"mundane\" but \"illustrative\" example of DOGE's work. TOP 5 MOST OUTRAGEOUS WAYS THE GOVERNMENT HAS WASTED YOUR TAXES, AS UNCOVERED BY ELON MUSK'S DOGE President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk depart after looking at Tesla vehicles on the South Lawn of the White House on March 11, 2025, in Washington.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) \"There are in the federal government around 4.6 million credit cards for around 2.3 to 2.4 million employees. This doesn't make sense. So one of the things all of the teams have worked on is we've worked for the agencies and said, 'Do you need all of these credit cards? Are they being used? Can you tell us physically where they are?'\" Davis explained. \"Clearly there should not be more credit cards than there are people,\" Musk responded. The eight-man group also discussed DOGE's work relating to the federal workforce, financial management, government infrastructure, computer systems,Social Securityand more. \"They may characterize it as shooting from the hip, but it is anything but that,\" Musk said, noting that the agency's approach to cuts is to \"measure twice, if not thrice, and cut once.\" Earlier this month, Musk and his team gave a second revealing interview to \"Jesse Watters Primetime,\" outlining examples of waste they had discovered in government. As the team shared cases of wasteful spending from top departments to smaller agencies, Watters asked how the findings made Musk and the DOGE members feel. \"Unfortunately, like the 100th time you've heard it, it's hard not to get a little numb, and by the 200th time, you're like, well, OK, it was just another day at the office,\" Musk replied. One DOGE member, who joined Musk on \"Jesse Watters Primetime,\" revealed that he had dropped out of Harvard University to \"serve my country,\" but faced backlash. \"It's been unfortunate to see lost friendships. Most of campus hates me now, but I think, fundamentally, I hope people realize through conversations like this that reform is genuinely needed,\" he said. In the interview, 19-year-old DOGE team member Edward Coristinerevealed howhe got the nickname \"Big Balls,\" which had received significant chatter online. Coristine went on to say that the system that distributes government or taxpayer money \"literally has no checks and no accountability to the actual American taxpayer.\" \"So, it’s a huge vector for fraud, waste, and abuse.\" Out of the many agencies that experienced cuts during Musk’s time at DOGE, USAID was perhaps the most discussed and most affected by DOGE’s findings. In March,Secretary of State Marco Rubioannounced that 83% of USAID programs would be canceled following the conclusion of a six-week review by DOGE.

    "article_text": "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., commends President Donald Trump tearing into America's nation builders in the Middle East and weighs in on a Wisconsin judge being indicted for hiding an illegal immigrant from ICE on 'The Ingraham Angle.' FIRST ON FOX –Sen.Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asked the Justice Department on Thursday to investigate a Chinese-owned self-driving trucking company, one of the largest in the U.S., citing allegations that it had shared proprietary data and other sensitive technology with state-linked entities in Beijing. The letter, sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and previewed exclusively to Fox News Digital, asks the Justice Department to open a formal investigation into the autonomous truck company TuSimple Holdings, a Chinese-owned company and one of the largest self-driving truck companies in the U.S. In it, Hawley cites recentreporting from the Wall Street Journalthat alleges that TuSimple \"systematically shared proprietary data, source code, and autonomous driving technologies\" with Chinese state-linked entities— what he described as \"blatant disregard\" of the 2022 national security agreement with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. \"These reports also revealed communications from TuSimple personnel inside China requesting the shipment of sensitive Nvidia AI chips and detailed records showing ‘deep and longstanding ties’ with Chinese military-affiliated manufacturers,\" Hawley said.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., wants the Justice Department to investigate TuSimple Holdings, a Chinese-owned self-driving trucking company.(Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) He noted that to date, TuSimple \"has not faced serious consequences\" for sharing American intellectual property with China, despite having continued to share datawith Chinaafter signing a national security agreement with the U.S. government in 2022, which was enforced by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. \"If the reports about TuSimple are accurate, they represent not just a violation of export law, but a breach of national trust and a direct threat to American technological leadership,\" Hawley said.

The letter asks Bondi and the Justice Department to take certain steps to investigate the company's actions, asallegedby the recent reports – including investigating whether TuSimple provided protected information to any Chinese-based entities, and what activities were covered by the company's national security agreement with CFIUS, struck more than two years ago. Hawley also asked Bondi what actions, if any, DOJ has taken to date to ensure that Bot Auto—a new Texas-basedself-driving vehicle companystaffed by many former TuSimple employees, \"is not engaging in similar behavior.\" In this photo illustration, the TuSimple logo is seen displayed on a smartphone screen.(Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to the Wall Street Journal report, TuSimple's actions helped shape new Commerce Department regulations, which blocked the sale of internet-linked cars and different components with links to China. According to the report, a CFIUS investigation determined TuSimple's tech sharing did not violate the official national security agreement— but the company was fined for other infractions, and ultimately paid out a $6 million settlement. The letter comes as Hawley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, has emerged as one of the Senate's more vocal critics of the Chinese Communist Party, especially as it relates to the conduct of certain U.S. companies, and the sharing of certain intellectual property.

    "title": "Less than half of DOGE-terminated contracts can be publicly tracked, only about a quarter of grants: watchdog",
    "article_text": "Linda Miller tells CBS program \"60 Minutes\" that the Trump administration's DOGE program has an opportunity to save the taxpayers significant money. With Elon Musk's departure from the agency, there's debate roiling over how effective theDepartment of Government Efficiency's (DOGE), has been in its mission. In a report released just one day prior to Musk stepping down, financial watchdog Open The Books published a report finding it is likely impossible for the average American taxpayer to track the savings associated with the contracts and grants that were terminated by the DOGE team. According toOpen The Books' analysis,which mined all the data published on DOGE's official website, the average American taxpayer would likely only be able to confirm 42% of contracts and 27% of grants through an independent review of public federal spending databases. \"This doesn’t mean these targets aren’t real, it simply means it’s very hard for taxpayers who want to see additional savings to find proof and evidence of savings,\" Open The Books points out in its analysis, shared in a report the group released Tuesday. 'BUREAUCRATIC AND WASTEFUL': DOGE SNIFFS OUT EYE-POPPING SPENDING ON BIDEN DEI EFFORTS IN KEY AGENCY Elon Musk (LEFT) has been a controversial figure in the Trump administration, with many of his critics arguing he has wielded too much power in the Trump administration.(Getty) \"Because taxpayers don’t have access to real-time transparency and a real-time look at the Treasury Payment System, it’s still too difficult for even a highly motivated Joe Taxpayer to confirm the savings claims DOGE is making,\" the analysis, released ahead of Elon Musk stepping down from running the agency, continued. \"It’s also far too easy for critics to sew [sic] doubt and confusion.\" DOGE sayson its websitethat the group's work up to this point has provided the American taxpayer with $175 billion in \"estimated\" savings from the elimination of contracts, grants and leases, as well as through renegotiations, fraud and improper payment deletion and other mechanisms. However, DOGE's estimated savings have been contested by watchdog groups and budget experts. Such critics have posited that the inclusion of already canceled contracts, double-counting or misrepresentation of contract values, and the unaccounted cost burden that could be imposed on the government when it has to re-hire folks down the line, or revamp its productivity, due to DOGE cuts, have led to inflated savings estimates. Nate Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, has accused DOGE of \"overestimating contracts by a factor of two,\" according to CBS News. ELON MUSK 'DISAPPOINTED' BY TRUMP'S SPENDING BILL, SAYS IT UNDERMINES WHAT DOGE IS DOING ButWhite Housespokesperson Harrison Fields told Fox News Digital that DOGE has produced \"historic savings\" for the American people. \"DOGE is working at record speed to cut waste, fraud, and abuse, producing historic savings for the American people,\" Fields said. \"The DOGE Wall of Receipts provides the latest and most accurate information following a thorough assessment, which takes time. Updates to the DOGE savings page will continue to be made promptly, and departments and agencies will keep highlighting the massive savings DOGE is achieving.\" \"DOGE’s job is to identify, not enact, savings targets. It’s up to Congress to do the heavy lifting,\" Open The Books said in their analysis about DOGE savings.(Fox News Digital) \"DOGE andElon Muskhave done the country an incredible service by identifying savings targets,\" added Open The Books CEO John Hart. \"Having worked on the last major deficit commission with the late Senator Tom Coburn, we would have been elated to have had Musk in our corner. Now it's up to Congress to not only turn DOGE's recommendations into durable savings but to go beyond DOGE's scope and truly tackle our long-term debt and deficit crisis.\" Open The Books highlighted two \"common sense\" standards to help establish an \"intellectually honest\" approach to understanding the true impact of government cuts, such as those being recommended by DOGE. The first is the \"durable standard,\" which asks whether a proposed cut can be easily reversed. OBAMA-NOMINATED JUDGE ALLOWS LAWSUIT TARGETING MUSK'S ROLE WITH DOGE TO PROCEED, DROPS CLAIMS AGAINST TRUMP \"Describing something as ‘durable’ does not mean it is permanent or irreversible; it simply means it is hard to reverse,\" the Open The Books' analysis stated. \"The most durable budget cut in our constitutional system would bepassed by Congress,signed into law by the president and be clearly constitutional, or unassailable in a court challenge. Budget cuts become less durable when they lack any of these three elements.\" The second is called a \"duty standard,\" which illuminates the power behind certain cuts based on who is trying to impose them. \"In our constitutional system, the founders gave the job of budget savings to three branches but primarily to Congress,\" Open The Books points out. \"DOGE’s job is to identify, not enact, savings targets. It’s up to Congress to do the heavy lifting. And We the People have a responsibility to be informed and hold our elected officials accountable.\" WHITE HOUSE SENDING $9.4B DOGE CUTS PACKAGE TO CONGRESS NEXT WEEK White House Senior Advisor Elon Musk walks to the White House after landing in Marine One on the South Lawn with U.S. President Donald Trump (not pictured) on Mar. 9, 2025, in Washington, DC.(Samuel Corum/Getty Images) Open The Books ultimately concluded that due to various limitations associated with publicly available data on government spending and revenue, in particular a lack of real-time access to the government's Treasury Payment System, it is still too difficult for even the most motivated average American citizen to either confirm, or deny, the savings claimed by DOGE. Elon Musk officially stepped down from his role as DOGE chief Wednesday evening, as his position of \"special government employee\" in theTrump administrationwas limited by law to a few months. Amid the transition, Musk criticized Republicans' spending bill that was passed ahead of Memorial Day in the House, indicating he was \"disappointed\" it would increase the federal deficit. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk told CBS News in an interview that will air in full on June 1.",

Job Corps was originally created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life through education and community. But Trump administration officials told Fox News Digital that an \"in-depth fiscal analysis and a startling number of serious incident reports reveal the program is not helping students achieve intended outcomes or keeping them safe.\" NEW REPORT EXPOSES HOW GOVERNMENT PROGRAM WITH EYE-POPPING BUDGET IS FAILING VULNERABLE STUDENTS The decision to suspend the program comes after the Job Corps transparency report was compiled and released in April, finding that the average graduation rate for the program was just 38.6%. Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer told Fox News Digital that \"a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve.\"(Allison Robbert/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The graduation rate of the program costs as much as $155,600 per student, the report states. The average cost of a four-year college education in the United States is $153,080, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Additionally, once those students move through the program, the study found that they are largely being hired in minimum-wage positions, with participants earning $16,695 annually on average after they leave the program. Currently, there are approximately fewer than 25,000 students enrolled in the Job Corps program, and participants’safetyis \"often at risk.\" Officials said there were 14,913 serious incident reports filed in 2023. In 2023, 373 instances of inappropriate sexual behavior and sexual assaults were reported; 1,764 acts of violence were reported; 1,167 breaches of safety or security were reported; 2,702 instances of drug use were reported; and 1,808 hospital visits for students were reported. Trump administration officials told Fox News Digital that the Department of Labor is beginning a phased pause in operations at contractor-operated Job Corp centers nationwide, initiating an orderly transition for students, staff and local communities. The U.S. Department of Labor is suspending operations of Job Corps centers across the nation.(Getty) Currently, there are 123 Job Corps centers across the United States, and 99 of the centers are run by contractors administered by the Department of Labor. An official said that those contracts will be terminated to pause operations. The remaining 24 centers are run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and will not be impacted by the suspension. The pause of operations at all contractor-operated Job Corps centers will occur by June 30. During the transition, the Department of Labor will collaborate with state and local workforce partners to assist current students in advancing their training and connecting them with education and employment opportunities. Once the phased suspension occurs, students will be connected to other resources and will be registered within the American Job Center closest to their home and the Labor Exchange system in their home states.

(Annabelle Gordon/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The program began in 1964 as part of former President Lyndon B. Johnson’s war on poverty under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. The program was intended to give young people from low-income backgrounds a chance to gain academic, vocational and social skills in a residential setting. For program year 2024, Job Corps was operating at a $140 million deficit, requiring centers to be paused to save approximately $119 million to reach the end of this program year. Department of Labor officials project that in program year 2025 the deficit would grow to $213 million. \"The program has been in a financial crisis for years, creating constant uncertainty for participants and administrators,\" a Department of Labor official told Fox News Digital. The official stressed, though, that the Department of Labor is \"not eliminating Job Corps,\" and stressed that only Congress has that authority. In December 2024, the Biden administration’s Department of Labor instituted a similar pause in operations at two of the Job Corps centers, amid concerns of issues and rising program costs. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Officials said that, at this point, the Job Corps program is financially underwater, and the funds appropriated by Congress for the year will not cover the costs of operations for the remaining program year.

    "title": "Earth's oceans are growing darker, threatening marine life worldwide: study",
    "article_text": "The SpaceX CEO has predicted humans could land on Mars as early as 2029. Oceans around the globehave become darker over the last two decades, leaving researchers fearful for their marine inhabitants, according to a new study. Professor Thomas Davies of the University of Plymouth said in a study published inthe Global Change Biologyjournal there is growing concern for the marine ecosystem. Satellite data fromNASA's Ocean Color Webdata portal showed 21% of the planet’s oceans had darkened between 2003 and 2022. According to Davies, the majority of marine life lives in the photic zones of the ocean, which is where sufficient light penetrates to stimulate photobiological processes. RARE COLOSSAL BABY SEA CREATURE CAUGHT ON CAMERA FOR THE FIRST TIME Oceans around the world have grown darker over the last two decades, leaving researchers fearful about marine inhabitants, a new study claims.(AP Photo/Thanassis Stavrakis, File) The photic zone, which is 200 meters deep, is where global nutrients and carbon budgets sustain the planetary fish markets. This is the area where light reachesmarine lifethat lives closer to the surface of the ocean. These ocean inhabitants rely on boththe moonlightand sunlight for hunting, mating, reproduction and other important milestones. SPOOKY DEEP-SEA FISH RARELY SEEN BY HUMANS CAUGHT ON CAMERA IN SHALLOW WATER: ‘NIGHTMARE FUEL’ The darkening of the ocean could affect marine life around the world, a new study says.(Kevin Carter/Getty Images) The upper level of the ocean is where microscopic organisms and different types of plankton live. With the oceans beginning to darken, it will cause creatures that rely on light to begin moving closer to the surface, potentially creating a cramped living space. Using satellite data and an algorithm-derived measure of the attenuation of light in seawater, Davis was able to measure how deep each photic zone was around the world. Among the darker oceans, 9% of their photic zones were 50 meters more shallow, and 3% of the oceans' photic zones were 100 meters more shallow. Darker oceans could prompt marine life to move closer to the surface, resulting in a cramped living space, according to the study.(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) The reasoning behind the darkening of oceans far offshore is less clear. Global warmingand changes in ocean currents are thought to be involved in this phenomenon, according to the study. Despite an overall darkening, about 10% of oceans, or 37 million square kilometers, have become lighter over the past 20 years, the study found.

However, the study found that this does not translate into a net reduction in photic zone depth near shorelines. Davies predicts the implications of ocean darkening could be severe for marine food webs, global fisheries and carbon and nutrient budgets. Nick Butler is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

    "title": "When 2-year-old goes into cardiac arrest, parents take life-saving action",
    "article_text": "Stephanie and Kris Thomas of Illinois jumped into action when their 2-year-old experienced sudden cardiac arrest in the middle of the night. The toddler was ultimately diagnosed with Brugada syndrome. Most parents of toddlers worry about sleep habits and sniffles, but heart failure isn’t usually a concern. It certainly wasn’t on the Thomases’ radar when their 2-year-old son went intosudden cardiac arrestin the middle of the night at their Illinois home. When the child woke up screaming, his parents ran into the room.(See the video at the top of this article.) HODA KOTB REVEALS DAUGHTER'S CONCERNING DIAGNOSIS INFLUENCED HER EXIT FROM 'TODAY' \"Hearing him scream out was alarming, as he usually slept soundly, and it was a horrible cry,\" Stephanie Thomas told Fox News Digital. \"When I went into his room, he continued to scream out and then face-plant into his crib.\" Stephanie and Kris Thomas' 2-year-old son went into sudden cardiac arrest in the middle of the night at their Illinois home.(Stephanie Thomas/OSF HealthCare) At first, the couple thought their son was just having a night terror, so Stephanie Thomas — aclinical dietitianat OSF HealthCare Children’s Hospital of Illinois — sat next to her son's crib with her hand on his back, trying to calm him down. \"When he finally settled, I could feel his breathing slowly come to a stop,\" she recalled. \"I picked him up out of his crib and placed him on the floor. With him being unresponsive, I felt for a pulse and started CPR.\" \"I was petrified and confused about how my seemingly healthy 2-year-old was in this situation.\" She added, \"I was petrified and confused about how my seeminglyhealthy 2-year-oldwas in this situation.\" As she performed CPR, her husband, Kris Thomas, called 911. Emergency responders rushed the boy to OSF HealthCare. After 11 days of testing, he was diagnosed withBrugada syndrome, a very rare heart condition that can cause sudden cardiac arrest and death. After 11 days of testing, the 2-year-old was diagnosed with Brugada syndrome, a very rare heart condition that can cause sudden cardiac arrest and death.(Stephanie Thomas/OSF HealthCare) Though there can be some signs of Brugada syndrome, such as fainting or passing out, the condition is often not discovered until cardiac arrest occurs. The Thomases’ son had a similar incident about a month before the cardiac arrest, which they now believe may have been his first episode. AI BREAKTHROUGH ALLOWS DOCTORS TO 'SEE' DANGEROUS BLOOD CLOTS FORMING \"He woke up in the middle of the night with a horrible scream, had some gasping and was hard to calm,\" Stephanie recalled. \"It was only a short period, and once he calmed, he seemed ‘normal.’ We assumed it was a night terror.\" As Brugada syndrome is often inherited, both parents were tested forgenetic abnormalities, but it was determined their son's syndrome is a \"mosaic defect,\" which is when there are two or more genetically different sets of cells in the body. \"Our son acts and appears healthy more than 99% of the time, until his heart gets into an arrhythmia that his body and medication cannot manage on their own,\" Stephanie Thomas told Fox News Digital.(Stephanie Thomas/OSF HealthCare) The OSF team implanted the young boy with an EV-ICD (extravascular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), which is positioned outside the heart's blood vessels. It's designed to detect and correct anyabnormal heart rhythms. This was the first time the device was implanted in a child at such a young age, the hospital noted in a press release. Since the first episode, the childhas been hospitalizedsix more times. Each time an abnormal heart rhythm is detected, the EV-ICD delivers a \"life-saving shock\" to the boy’s heart. \"Our son acts and appears healthy more than 99% of the time, until his heart gets into an arrhythmia that his body and medication cannot manage on their own,\" Stephanie Thomas told Fox News Digital. \"In these cases, he receives a shock from his ICD.\" CDC REMOVES COVID VACCINE RECOMMENDATION FOR HEALTHY CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN The boy has been readmitted to the hospital due to arrhythmias and medication titration seven times since his initial discharge, his mother added. Sunita Ferns, M.D., a pediatric electrophysiologist at OSF HealthCare Saint Francis Medical Center who is treating the Thomases' son, noted that her young patient is now \"married to cardiology.\" The parents said it can be challenging to navigate the episodes with a 2-year-old who can’t understand what’s happening.(Stephanie Thomas/OSF HealthCare) \"We monitor these devices constantly. If we see any arrhythmia in the background, despite the medication he's on, we can offer him other technologies,\" Dr. Ferns said in the OSF press release. BABY WITH FATAL BRAIN DISORDER ‘SAVED’ BY ANONYMOUS $47K DONATION \"Ablative technologies can help modify the substrate, which is the tissue that's responsible for the bad rhythm.\" To help control his arrhythmias, the boy also takes a compoundedoral medicationevery six hours, which he will take for the rest of his life.

Golf ballsare going further than ever before, resulting in the pros man-handling some of the world's best courses. Players are stronger and faster, as is the technology - andJake Knapp, whose swing might be the smoothest since Fred Couples, is near the top of the driving distance list. Knapp ranks 31st in average driving distance, averaging 298.9 yards. In 666 drives this season, his golf balls have traveled over 113 miles. Knapp used that money driver, buttery swing and a hot putter tojoin the 59 Clubearlier this year at the Cognizant Classic.

It is safe to say the 31-year-old is \"not really a fan of the rollback stuff.\" \"I think if we were going to change golf in any way, I think you could do a lot of different things that don't change a player's deal in depth perception and things like that. I've been playing with basically a golf ball that goes probably about the same distance ever since I was a kid. So it's like, you have all this feel developed over time, and then if you were to change it to go shorter. I mean, there's also things you can do in your equipment to make up for most of that anyway, so I don't think it's going to be as big of a deal as they think,\" Knapp said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. Knapp is doubling down on that stance after collaborating with both PXG and Pennzoil to give away a brand-new driver.

When the opportunity came about, it just seemed like a no-brainer for me, and then when I heard about it, I thought it was something that I really wanted to be a part of,\" Knapp said of the partnership. If given the choice, Knapp would rather roll back the technology, rather than the ball itself. \"I think if, personally, if there was a way that they were going to change it that I think could make it more difficult or kind of get what they want out of it, they could just make more regulations on clubs for professionals or Tour events and things like that, where they're maybe harder to hit, they're smaller, not as forgiving,\" he said. \"There's things like that that I think would be better than rolling back the ball in my personal opinion.\" However, the Pennzoil PXG driver is not rolled back one bit.

    "title": "Youth baseball gets MLB technology upgrade as Perfect Game partners with PitchCom",
    "article_text": "Jon Updike explains how the partnership between Perfect Game and PitchCom will be of great benefit to youth baseball players. EXCLUSIVE: PitchCom wasintroduced to MLBat the beginning of the 2022 season, and the communication system has quickly become prominent in the baseball world, overhauling pitcher-catcher communication. Perfect Game, a youth baseball company that promotes baseball by hosting high-quality amateur events and providing exposure for players to play at higher levels, is the first organization of its kind to partner with PitchCom, Fox News Digital exclusively learned Thursday. PitchCom emerged after theHouston Astrossign-stealing scandal during their World Series run in 2017 rocked the baseball world. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM PitchCom devices on a field with the Perfect Game logo.(Courtesy of PitchCom) John Hankins, co-investor and co-owner of PitchCom, saw that MLB had a need for a communication device that could prevent sign stealing. The challenge was the device couldn’t be vocal, and MLB officials didn’t want players to wear a communication device on their bodies. Hankins came upwith PitchCom, which allows a catcher to press a button on a transmitter to call pitches. The transmitter sends prerecorded audio clips to the receivers, who in turn will hear the pitch call and defensive signals. The pitcher and fielders wear the receiver in their hats and can hear what the catcher inputs, allowing for clear and secure communication safe from being stolen, unlike traditional catcher signs. When Major League Baseball first heard of it, it loved the idea. TIGERS' TARIK SKUBAL PITCHES INCREDIBLE GAME IN WIN OVER GUARDIANS: 'SKY IS THE LIMIT' \"(We had) a meeting before a playoff game. The immediate response was this solves all of our problems,\" Hankins told Fox News Digital. \"That was nice, and we left the meeting feeling pretty good. But, within about an hour, we got another phone call that said, 'Can you meet with 20 of our executives on Zoom tomorrow. That was a positive sign.\" After that meeting, Major League Baseball became PitchCom’s first client. Jered Goodwin, the vice president of scouting operations at Perfect Game, trains with MLB players during the offseason. Goodwin told Fox News Digital the players had \"a ton of positive feedback\" about PitchCom. San Francisco Giants catcher Blake Sabol (2) adjusts his PitchCom device during the eighth inning against the Milwaukee Brewers at Oracle Park May 7, 2023.(Darren Yamashita/USA Today Sports) \"I can tell you from a guy that gets to coach some pitchers during the offseason, they love being on a level playing field,\" Goodwin said. \"They’re throwing a pitch without anybody on the field being able to know what’s coming (prior to PitchCom), and there’s been open conversations about that. There hasn’t been a lot of negative feedback. You get some transmitters you got to replace, but it takes a really short amount of time. And I think really everybody in baseball, players to owners and especially fans, have loved the pace of play and the shorter games.\" \"Obviously, some other rules were put into effect as well, but the direct communication in the short amount of time it takes has definitely been a ton of positive feedback.\" ROCKIES FAN FILES LAWSUIT AGAINST MLB TEAM, CLAIMS TO HAVE SUFFERED INJURIES DUE TO CLUB'S LACKLUSTER OUTPUT Goodwin said he first thought of trying to bring PitchCom to Perfect Game when MLB began using it. He called it an \"easy decision\" to bring PitchCom into youth baseball and to form a partnership. \"I knew very early on that this was going to be something that was going to stick, so as it’s grown into majorcollege baseball, to MLB, it’s great that we got to have a direct path for our players and our coaches to be able to learn operationally, intensely during a game. Anything like that of what they are going to use directly at the next level. So, it really was on the agenda as soon as it could be scaled,\" Goodwin said. Jon Updike, vice president of customer relations at PitchCom, said the device offers youth players benefits beyond just pitcher-catcher communication. San Francisco Giants pitcher Spencer Bivens (76) holds his glove to his ear to hear his PitchCom against the St. Louis Cardinals during the ninth inning at Oracle Park Sept. 28, 2024.(Robert Edwards/Imagn Images) \"It’s just not calling the pitches,\" Updike said. \"It’s the ability to send in maybe technical cues, but even more so than that, ‘Hey, great job’ or ‘You’re going to get them next time.’ \"You are able to send in some psychological messages to them as well that will help either uplift them or snap them into place, which is a lot easier when it’s being whispered to an 8-year-old or a 12-year-old or 14-year-old’s ear than being yelled across the field.\" Goodwin said the introduction of PitchCom into Perfect Game will allow for more development among kids. \"Being able to talk through, especially with direct communication, being able to talk directly about why you called a pitch, how you were calling a pitch, being able to go over what those different reasons were, because you’ve got just an extra second to be able to do it. When you can speed up the game but also slow down the process, some real development of the ‘why?’ can happen,\" Goodwin said. SHOHEI OHTANI’S FIRST TIME PITCHING TO HITTERS AS A DODGER IS A SUCCESS: ‘HE’S A TOP-END STARTER’ \"I think you are going to see some things come out directly related to PitchCom helping with development. Whether it’s pitch calling, whether it’s the speed of the game, whether it’s location that (is) really going to help the youth be able to understand how they are trying to attack, why they are trying to attack, why this in that situation or that pitch in this situation and that’s one of the things that nobody is really dove into yet. \"But at Perfect Game we are constantly trying to find different ways to develop, and I think this is going to be a real asset to young ballplayers.\" Not only does Goodwin believe PitchCom will help players’ development. It should also change the way coaches teach and communicate in games. \"It speeds up the time, but it also slows down what’s going on. Reaffirm some of the things that you might have gone over in practice. So, I think it’s such a huge advantage when these young athletes are going to be able to have that sense of pace, but also a sense of communication and development at a younger age,\" Goodwin said. Baltimore Orioles catcher James McCann adjusts his PitchCom system during the first inning of a game against the Cleveland Guardians at Oriole Park at Camden Yards May 29, 2023.(Tommy Gilligan/USA Today Sports) Updike said the introduction of PitchCom at the youth baseball level will make for cleaner games because of the enhanced communication the device allows. \"I see it has an opportunity to reduce pitches, which will directly, in turn, have a chance of reducing over usage and injury,\" Updike said. \"Just from having better information or paying attention to it. And then, on top of that, it makes it a cleaner baseball game. Less wild pitches, less cross-ups and more quality executed pitches.\" The voice that comes through the transmitter is an AI-generated voice, but Updike said the voice can be \"anybody’s voice.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It’s a simple, easy, clean process. And then what we found is that some of our colleges and some of our major league clubs would run the tracks through an AI voice generator to create something else. Whether it was a star or a famous voice and then put it on, sometimes even recording other players, it’s kind of like your limitation is your imagination with it,\" Updike said. Updike said he heard one pitcher in college baseball customize the voice to be his favorite musician. \"I won’t give up the secret sauce for a few clubs, but like we have a college, a really good NCAA team, their Friday night guy is a real good pitcher, and he’s got a musician that he loves, or a rapper, and it’s that rappers' voice every time they call a pitch. So, it’s unique to see how creative everybody’s been with the product,\" Updike said. Goodwin said he heard a story about how a coach programmed the voice to be a player’s mother’s voice, and that it provided good results for the player. Baltimore Orioles catcher Adley Rutschman covers a PitchCom device during the first inning against the Los Angeles Angels at Oriole Park at Camden Yards May 17, 2023.(Tommy Gilligan/USA Today Sports) \"The guy had a really close relationship with his mom, and the coaches wanted to see if that in turn would kind of be a calming presence. So I thought that was pretty cool, pretty interesting. Obviously, a lot going on with sports psychology now and things like that. So, I think there are a lot of things that you can do here even from voice recognition to maybe help kids, and maybe not,\" Goodwin said. \"I do know that in the early stages of this the kid actually did very well when it happened.\" The PitchCom's will be given out to Perfect Game in August, and coaches and players will be able to use them for the All-American Classic and PG Select Festivals.

    "article_text": "Animals at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, Illinois, were spotted eating cicadas. The periodical cicadas have emerged for the first time in 17 years and are part of two broods. The last time this happened was in 1803. The low hum of summer typically includes lawnmowers and sizzling burgers — and this year, it may be thesound of cicadas. This year’s brood of insects may be the second-biggest ever. Two types of cicadas commonly exist in the Eastern United States: annual cicadas, which emerge every year, and periodical cicadas, which emerge every 13 or 17 years, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The insects reside primarily in trees and shrubs. INVASIVE INSECT POSES HEALTH THREAT IN 19 STATES, EXPERT WARNS Broods are a way of categorizing cicadas based on this pattern, and less of abiological trait. Because broods emerge in different areas, places that had cicadas last year may not have them this year, according to Dr. John R. Cooley, associate professor-in-residence of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut. Two types of cicadas commonly exist in the Eastern United States: annual cicadas and periodical cicadas.(iStock) Brood XIV is referred to as a \"keystone\" brood, Cooley told Fox News Digital. It is the second-largest behind Brood XIX, the \"Great Southern Brood,\" which last emerged in 2024 in 15 states from Oklahoma to Maryland. FLESH-EATING NEW WORLD SCREWWORM COULD POSE HEALTH RISKS TO CATTLE, HUMANS While there is another \"Great Eastern Brood\" – Brood X, which emerged in 2021 – Brood XIV is larger, and could thus be considered the \"Great(er) Eastern Brood.\" Brood XIV will emerge in states ranging from Georgia all the way up toNew York, according to the University of Connecticut. Because of the way broods emerge in different areas, places that had cicadas last year may not have them this year.(iStock) \"Once an emergence gets going, it lasts about a month, depending on the weather,\" Cooley said. \"It seems like the weather this year has been quite strange — the emergence is well underway in North Carolina, but further north, because of the cold weather, it hasn’t even really started yet in Pennsylvania,\" he added.

The babies, called nymphs, hatch from these eggs after six weeks and fall to the ground. They then burrow into the soil and begin feeding on the roots of trees and shrubs to restart the cicada lifecycle, according to the EPA.

    "article_text": "International researchers from the Noah's Ark Project have tested soil samples from the Durupinar site in eastern Turkey, which suggest that the boat-shaped site once harbored ancient wood. (Credit: NoahsArkScans.com) Archaeologists recently discovered the purpose of a mysterious 1,500-year-old bucket at one of England'smost historic sites– and it wasn't pleasant. The National Trust released a statement about the Byzantine Bromeswell bucket, found at Sutton Hoo, in May. The site of two ancient Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, Sutton Hoo has offered a wealth of knowledge about pre-Norman British history since its first excavation in 1938. STRANGE VIKING GRAVE WITH 'CHRISTIAN OVERTONES' DISCOVERED BY PERPLEXED ARCHAEOLOGISTS: 'VERY UNUSUAL' During an excavation last summer, archaeologists unearthed the base of the Bromeswell bucket, which dates back to the 6th century. Different fragments of the bucket were uncovered in past excavations, but this latest discovery gave researchers more to study. With the base in hand, researchers quickly went to work to analyze the artifact with a variety of techniques, including computerized tomography,CT scans and X-rays– and they found an answer. Archaeologists recently discovered the purpose of a 6th-century Byzantine Bromeswell bucket found at Sutton Hoo, the site of two cemeteries.(National Trust Images / David Brunetti / James Dobson) In a morbid turn of events, experts learned the bucket was used to hold thecremated remainsof an important person, and their grave goods. \"The cremated human and animal bones uncovered confirm the find was used as a cremation vessel,\" the National Trust noted. The organization added, \"Cremated human bones included parts of a talus (ankle bone) and fragments of a skull vault (the upper part of the skull that protects the brain).\" \"It’s a remarkable mixture – a vessel from the southern, classical world containing the remains of a very northern, very Germanic cremation.\" The bucket dates back to the 500s. It's decoratedwith a hunting scenedepicting men armed with swords and shields, as well as dogs and lions – painting a vivid picture of life in the past. \"The latest fragments include feet, paws, the base of shields and even the missing face of one of the men,\" the statement described. The bucket originated from Antioch in the Byzantine Empire in the 500s.(National Trust Images / David Brunetti) It is believed the bucket came from Antioch in the Byzantine Empire, now located inmodern Turkey. The National Trust noted, \"Letterforms used within the bucket’s design suggest it was made in the 6th century, meaning it was already 100 years old when it arrived here at Sutton Hoo.\" Researchers also found \"a mystery object\" that turned out to be a double-sided comb made from an antler. Interestingly, the object had not been burned. LATE BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT DATING BACK 3,000 YEARS UNCOVERED AMID ROAD WORK: 'IMPORTANT DISCOVERY' The National Trust said the presence of the comb suggests the Anglo-Saxonstook grooming seriously, as combs have been found in male and female burials before. \"Slightly less romantically, combs also would have been useful in the control of lice,\" the statement said. \"Although the human bone in the cremation couldn’t be sexed, it’s hoped thatancient DNAfrom the owner might survive on the comb, and analysis could reveal more about them.\" Sutton Hoo has offered a wealth of knowledge since its first excavation in 1938.(Getty Images) National Trust archaeologist Angus Wainwright said that he was \"hopeful\" future research will uncover new insight into \"this very special burial.\" For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle \"We knew that this bucket would have been a rare and prized possession back in Anglo-Saxon times, but it’s always been a mystery why it was buried,\" Wainwright said. \"Now we know it was used to contain the remains of an important person in the Sutton Hoo community.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Anglo-Saxon expert Helen Geake told the National Trust the puzzle of the Bromeswell bucket has \"finally\" been solved. \"It’s always been a mystery why it was buried.\" \"Now we know that it is the first ofthese rare objectsever to have been used in a cremation burial,\" she said. \"It’s a remarkable mixture – a vessel from the southern, classical world containing the remains of a very northern, very Germanic cremation.\" A depiction of a burial at Sutton Hoo during the Anglo-Saxon period is shown.(Getty Images) She also said the find \"epitomizes the strangeness\" of Sutton Hoo, which has captivated British history enthusiasts for decades.

    "article_text": "Ramapo College, working with various authorities in New Jersey, recently identified the remains of Capt. Henry Goodsell, whose bones washed up on the Jersey Shore multiple times in the past three decades. (Credit: New Jersey State Police) Bones that mysteriously washed up onthe Jersey Shoreover the past three decades were recently identified, thanks to cutting-edge technology and diligent students. Ramapo College announced the discovery in a May 21 press release. The remains were identified as belonging to Henry Goodsell, a captain who died in an 1844 shipwreck off the coast of South Jersey's Brigantine Shoal.(See the video at the top of this article.) The ship was carrying 60 tons of marble for Girard College, a preparatory school, when it sprung a leak and sank. DIVERS UNCOVER MYSTERIOUS 2,500-YEAR-OLD SHIPWRECK, FILLED WITH UNUSUAL ARTIFACTS, OFF COAST OF SICILY Goodsell's bones didn't wash up until over a century later, when they were found on various beaches in the Garden State. \"A skull washed ashore in Longport in 1995, and more bones were found in Margate in 1999, both in Atlantic County,\" Ramapo College's statement noted. \"In 2013, additional remains were found in Ocean City, Cape May County.\" Experts recently identified bones that washed ashore on several New Jersey beaches over the past three decades.(Getty Images; New Jersey State Police) \"Scattered Man John Doe went without a name for 30 years since traditional methods of investigation could not deliver an identification.\" Cairenn Binder, assistant director of the Ramapo College InvestigativeGenetic Genealogy(IGG)Center, told Fox News Digital that her team conducted traditional DNA testing to find a matching profile in the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), a national DNA profile database. \"More identifications like these will be made now that we have advances in technology.\" \"While there was no missing person sample on file that matched with the profiles from the bones, the bones all matched one another, so that’s how [the New Jersey State Police] learned they were all connected before we began working on the case,\" she said. METAL DETECTORISTS DISCOVER HOARD OF PRICELESS GOLD COINS DATING BACK TO BIBLICAL TIMES Over the past several months, Ramapo students have gleaned various details about Goodsell's life from old newspapers. He was 29 years old when he died, and his ancestors were among the earliest settlers in Connecticut. Henry Goodsell's remains were known as Scattered Man John Doe until the recent discovery.(New Jersey State Police) \"Capt. Goodsell’s ancestors lived in Litchfield and Fairfield Counties in Connecticut and had all been there since the 1600s – some of the earliest European Americans,\" Binder said. \"He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, but lived in Boston from at least the late 1830s.\" Goodsell also left behind a wife and two children when he perished;his familywas financially devastated by the shipwreck.

    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson says a tech support scam used a fake Windows Defender pop-up, tricking the victim to call and download software. All modern Windows PCs come withMicrosoft Defenderbuilt in. For the unaware, this tool is Windows’ native antivirus. Over time, it has matured into a reliable security tool capable of blocking a wide range of threats. However, a tool called Defendnot can shut down Microsoft Defender completely, without exploiting a bug or using malware. It simply convinces Windows that another antivirus is already running. The implications are serious. This tool does not break into the system or use advanced code injection. It usesWindows featuresthe way they were designed to be used. And that makes the problem harder to detect and harder to fix. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! Windows software on a PC(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Windows is built to avoid running multiple antivirus products at once. When a third-party antivirus registers itself, Windows disables Microsoft Defender to prevent conflicts. Defendnotexploits this systemusing an undocumented API that security software uses to communicate with the Windows Security Center. The tool registers a fake antivirus that appears legitimate to the system. It uses a dummy DLL and injects it into Task Manager, a trusted Windows process. By operating inside this signed process, Defendnot avoids signature checks and permission blocks. Once the fake antivirus is registered, Windows disables Microsoft Defender without warning or confirmation. WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE No security alertis shown to the user. No visible changes are made to indicate that the system is unprotected. Unless someone checks manually, the machine remains open to attacks with no real-time protection running. The tool also includes options to set a custom antivirus name, enable logging and configure automatic startup. It achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task that runs whenever the user logs in. Windows software on a laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) WINDOWS DEFENDER VS ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE: FREE PROTECTION FALLS SHORT Defendnot is based on an earlier project called No-Defender. That project used code from an actual antivirus product to fake registration. It gained attention quickly and was removed after a copyright complaint from the vendor whose code had been reused. The developer took the project down and walked away from it. With Defendnot, the creator rebuilt the core features using original code. This version avoids copyright issues and uses a new method to achieve the same effect. It does not rely on another antivirus or third-party binaries. It was written from scratch to demonstrate how simple it is to manipulate Windows security from inside the system. Microsoft Defender currently flags the tool as a threat. It detects and quarantines it under the name Win32/Sabsik.FL.!ml. However, the fact that it works at all points to a weakness in how Windows handles antivirus registration and trust. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Windows laptop showing the home screen(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS While Defendnot is a research project, there’s a chance that similar tools are already out there and could be used to compromise your PC. Here are a few tips to help you stay safe: 1. Use strong antivirus software:Even with regular updates, Windows systems can be left exposed by tools like Defendnot that silently disable built-in defenses. A strong third-party antivirus with real-time protection and frequent updates provides essential backup security. Look for solutions with real-time protection and frequent updates to tackle emerging threats.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 2. Limit exposure:Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled). 3. Avoid running unexpected commands: Never paste or run commands (like PowerShell scripts) you don’t understand or that were copied from random websites. Attackers often trick users into unknowingly running malware this way. 4. Keep your software updated:Regularlyupdate your operating system, browsers and all software applications. Updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that malware can exploit. 5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA):Enable2FAon all your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password. 6. Invest in personal data removal services:Even with strong device security, your personal information may still be exposed online through data brokers and people-finder sites. These services collect and publish details like your name, address and phone number, making you an easier target for identity theft or phishing. Automated data removal services track down these sites and submit removal requests on your behalf, helping to reduce your digital footprint and increase your online anonymity. While they can't erase every trace of your information, they make it significantly harder for attackers to find and exploit your personal data, which saves you time and reduces unwanted spam in the process. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. Get afree scanto find out if your personal information is already out on the web. RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID Defendnot points to a bigger issue with how Windows handles security. It takes a feature meant to prevent software conflicts and turns it into a way to completely disable protection. The system assumes any registered antivirus is legitimate, so if attackers can fake that, they get in without much resistance. We often think of security as blocking the bad and trusting the good. But this case shows what happens when that trust is misplaced. Defendnot doesn’t sneak past Windows defenses. It walks right in using valid credentials. The solution isn’t just more patches or stronger malware signatures. What we need is a smarter way for systems to tell what is actually safe.

    "article_text": "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, discusses how the left attacked Elon Musk for his DOGE efforts as the billionaire announces his time as a special government employee is coming to a close on ‘Hannity.’ There’s an old adage that especially applies to Washington, DC that no good deed ever goes unpunished. And no one has been more victimized by that truism thanElon Musk. Musk is arguably one of the 10 greatest entrepreneurs, wealth-creators and visionaries in world history. His businesses from Tesla to SpaceX are worth over a trillion dollars. His patriotic voyage to Washington to help President Trump was intended toidentify the waste, inefficiency, fraud and theft that is rampant in the United States government. Who better to make the government more productive and less wasteful? WHAT'S NEXT FOR DOGE AFTER ELON MUSK'S DEPARTURE? ‘ONLY JUST BEGUN’ But from the start, his quest tosave money for taxpayerswas ridiculed and attacked by the media, the permanent ruling class, and the unaccountable blob in Washington. He attacked the vast bureaucracy in the many agencies of government where well-paid federal employees were taking home $150,000 pay checks or more, but not bothering to show up for work. He exposed the millions of dollars that were being sent out to Social Security recipients of more than 120 years old, and the antiquated computer systems in government agencies like the Air Traffic Control system that were installed in the 1980s. His team found that the government’s foreign aid programs like USAID couldn’t even account for what happened to hundreds of millions of dollars as those funds got swallowed up by a syndicate of \"nongovernmental organizations.\" He spotlighted for all American taxpayers the outrageous and rapacious way the government bureaucrats and contractors in Washington were serving themselves and not the public. The fact that three of the five wealthiest counties in the United States are in and around Washington, DC spoke volumes to American taxpayers in faraway places like Kansas, Maine, and Montana. In just a few months Musk’sDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE), identified $160 billion in savings by terminating wasteful contracts, modernizing IT systems, such as digitalizing the OPM retirement process.\" Just think if he had had more time and support from the people who work for the government. He naively believed that he would be seen as a national hero. Instead, his reward for exposing to the American public that the empire of Washington wears no clothes was to create a revolt on the left against Tesla and his other world-class companies. Why the outrage? Because the crooked system is so endemic and the hundreds of billions of dollars that go into this racket and make fraudsters rich from all the graft have created a self-defense mechanism far more powerful than he or any of us thought was possible. Putting a muzzle on a rabid dog is no easy feat. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Now Elon isunderstandably frustrated. He has even done a mea culpa for being \"too political.\" He has concluded that Washington is permanently broken and perhaps even unfixable. After all, if he and Trump can’t fix our arrogant, obese and broken $7 trillion enterprise in Washington, who can? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In one of his most recent social media posts, Musk concluded that the only way to shrink out debt and Washington’s tumor on American life and culture is to \"grow our private economy\" at warp speed so that, in relative terms, Washington becomes less and less consequential - a deadweight loss that we just write off every year as a cost of doing business. He may be right that economic growth is the only way to fix our nation’s finances. The good news is there’s nobody better to do that than him.

    "title": "ILYA SHAPIRO: Yes, take down Harvard but Team Trump must do it the right way",
    "article_text": "Fox News legal editor Kerri Urbahn discusses the legal battle between the Trump administration and Harvard University over foreign student enrollment on ‘America’s Newsroom.’ Elite universitiesdeserve all the opprobrium they’ve been getting. They’ve discriminated on the basis of race in admissions and hiring, required loyalty oaths in the form of diversity statements, and allowed agitators to disrupt classes, block access to facilities, and wage mass campaigns of intimidation and harassment. The liberal left hand knew what the illiberal far-left hand was doing—the explosion in DEI that spawned everything from intellectual corruption and indoctrination to antisemitism and cancel culture—but was cowed into placating it. Harvard, besides being the biggest global brand inAmerican higher education, is at the epicenter of this crisis. For example, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) named it the worst school in the country for free speech for the last two years, the only one with a negative score. There are other schools that may be worse on other measures, but Harvard is a fitting lightning rod for popular displeasure with our gowned oligarchy. Still, the Trump administration’s blunderbuss tactics threaten its reformist goal,with which I’m entirely sympathetic. Left-wing intolerance and perfidy have undermined universities’ core mission of open inquiry and truth-seeking, but executive-branch overreach and impatience with legal niceties have allowed Harvard grandees to don the mantle of academic freedom and educrats to dig in their heels. JUDGE TO BLOCK TRUMP ADMIN'S HARVARD FOREIGN STUDENTS BAN The executive branch is fully justified in launching investigations of Harvard and dozens of other schools for violating civil rights by: allowing antisemitism to flourish, using racial preferences in defiance of the Supreme Court, subverting student rights to free speech and due process, making hiring decisions based on illegal criteria, and a host of other pernicious practices. Violations of that kind do indeed imperil all federal funds, including grants to scientific and medical researchers who may want nothing to do with woke administrators, because there’s no germaneness or even proportionality requirement in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and other relevant laws. It can even go after plagiarism—recall Harvard’s short-lived president,Claudine Gay, who remains on the faculty with a $900,000 salary—because that’s taxpayer-subsidized fraud. But imposing financial consequences, let alone revoking tax-exempt status, requires waiting for those investigations to be completed so that an evidence-backed indictment can be laid at Harvard’s feet. Issuing a list of demands—in a letter that was apparently sent by mistake—won’t cut it. A view of the statue of John Harvard on the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.(Maddie Meyer) It’s not surprising that Harvard responded with a lawsuit, one it’s likely to win based on process fouls, without even reaching the substance of the administration’s charges against the school. Alas, that would damage the administration’s leverage over universities. CAN PRESIDENT TRUMP FIX HARVARD? TheWhite House’slatest move further illustrates the weakness in the administration’s approach. Last week, it announced that Harvard would be cut off from the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP), meaning that the school would be unable to sponsor student visas. The move set off understandable panic, because27 percent of Harvard students are foreigners. That’s not unusual in the Ivy League; the foreign share of Yale students stands at28 percent, while the figure isover 50 percentat Columbia. Why so high? Follow the money: international students are more likely to pay the exorbitant sticker price of tuition, plus many foreign governments fund American universities. Unsurprisingly, Harvard immediately got a temporary restraining order, and on Thursday the same judge issued a preliminary injunction. That’s because the ostensible basis for revoking Harvard’s SEVP certification—non-compliance with information requests—doesn’t pass the legal smell test. Visa-sponsoring schools do have to report certain things about their foreign students, like whether they’re making progress towards their degree or whether they’ve been disciplined for misconduct. But the information that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noemdemandedgoes beyond what the law requires. For example, she wants Harvard to report everything it knows about international students’ \"dangerous\" actions and turn over any \"audio or video footage . . . of any protest activity.\" TRUMP-HARVARD FEUD SPARKS DEBATE AMONG STUDENTS ABOUT DISCRIMINATION IN ADMISSIONS Therelevant regulation, however, requires schools to report \"any disciplinary action the school takes against a student as a direct result of a criminal conviction,\" explicitly excluding \"student life infractions.\" The government can certainly ask for more than is required by that provision, but Harvard is within its rights to hold DHS to the letter of the law on visa eligibility. Moreover, Harvard has a strong argument that the government is singling it out for its high-profile opposition. Why didn’t Secretary Noem ask for the same information from every Ivy League university or every university over a certain threshold of foreign students? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Why didn’t the Justice Department do this as part of the numerous civil-rights investigations described above? It’s too coincidental that Harvard is the only university suing the administration. After all, Columbia is worse at \"perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students\" and \"promot[ing] pro-Hamas sympathies\" (quoting Noem’s letter), but Columbia settled with the administration. Politically, it makes sense to go after Harvard, the self-anointed center of the academic universe, but judges don’t go in for PR stunts. The administration is on much surer footing in pausing student-visa interviews while considering new guidance on social-media vetting, or in revoking the visas of Chinese students \"with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.\" These are measured steps that are tied to specific statutory authorities. But the government can’t steal legal bases, even in pursuit of a righteous cause against bad-faith actors. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP From its own perspective, the administration may prevail either way. Even if Harvard wins in court, the administration wins in the court of public opinion. But is the point to \"own the libs\" and make Harvard even more unpopular or to effect lasting change? Asmy colleague Chris Rufo has written, instead of \"making graphic displays of force, the administration should change incentives, rewrite laws, [and] depersonalize its enforcement actions.\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ILYA SHAPIRO Ilya Shapiro is the director of constitutional studies at the Manhattan Institute.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: Musk’s DOGE changed the way America sees federal spending waste",
    "article_text": "New York Post financial correspondent Lydia Moynihan on Elon Musk departing from DOGE, his criticism of the 'big, beautiful bill' and President Donald Trump's response. The moment that Elon Musk’s most ardent critics have been waiting for has finally arrived as he exits the Trump administration and hands over control of theDepartment of Government Efficiency. They will assure us that the results have been an embarrassing failure, but they could not be more wrong. Musk has forever changed how Americans look atfederal spending, and that is a wonderful thing. WHAT'S NEXT FOR DOGE AFTER ELON MUSK'S DEPARTURE? 'ONLY JUST BEGUN' First of all, DOGE estimates that it has saved taxpayers $160 billion. A sneering NPR claims that there is only data to prove $63 billion, but even if that is true, that’s an enormous amount of waste being cut. Was Musk shooting for a higher number? Sure. This is, after all, a guy who is literally trying to get to Mars. But the savings DOGE has already found and will continue to find until it sunsets in July of next year are nothing to sneeze at. White House Senior Advisor Elon Musk walks to the White House after landing in Marine One on the South Lawn with U.S. President Donald Trump (not pictured) on March 9, 2025 in Washington, DC.(Samuel Corum/Getty Images) The impact of Musk and DOGE also goes well beyond the mere grand total dollar figure. It is the speed with which they identified wasteful spending and the absurdity of many of the programs they uncovered and cut that has proven to be a game-changer. Whocan forgetthe discovery that we gave a former Taliban member $132,000 to promote peace, or $20 million for Sesame Street to be broadcast in Iraq, along with boatloads of dollars for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs throughout our government and around the globe? Over the first 60 days of the Trump administration, it seemed like every hour some new and ridiculous spending was being identified. What Americans had felt as a vague sense that the federal government is wasteful became one concrete example after another of blatant and frivolous waste. These revelations have moved the Overton window in American discourse around spending. We will no longer accept blue-ribbon commissions with no power studying the problem for years on end, only to do nothing. We want action now. And while DOGE still requires approval from cabinet secretaries to finalize its cuts, they have generally been willing and able to do so. Musk and DOGE have also shown that it is OK to make mistakes when zealously safeguarding the taxpayer’s dime, because errors can be quickly fixed. For example, when funding for the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Md., was cut early in the administration, officials appealed to Homeland Security Secretary Kristie Noem, who recognized the importance of the program which trains100,000 firefighters a year. Funding was restored. (DOGE via X/Getty/) Slashing federal spending is not like a haircut. You can put back things that are wrongly cut, so there is no reason to be paralyzed by fear when trimming. Perhaps more than anything else, what Musk has succeeded in doing with DOGE is toopen up the hood of federal spendingand give us all a sobering look at the engine. This is very similar to what he did when he bought Twitter and allowed journalists to produce the Twitter Files, revealing many shady secrets that proved the platform had been harshly censoring conservative viewpoints. This kind of radical transparency is anathema to a deep state that demands to be like a black box, where our money flows in, never comes out, and we don’t get to look inside. Bureaucrats have clearly been treating the federal budget like a slush fund for all manner of pet projects and silly endeavors, and boy do they hate having any light exposed on their massive contracts to export condoms everywhere or study trans animals. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION For decades, federal spending has been like a giant Rock of Gibraltar that nobody could get their arms or heads around. But now, instead of focusing on the gigantic forest of spending, Musk has found ways to identify the dying trees. It is natural that Musk and his supporters feel some measure of disappointment that more could not have been cut, and that some Republicans in Congress don’t seem eager to codify cuts to what has been found. But politics is, as they say, the art of the possible. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Today, thanks to Musk, there are far more possibilities out there, far more programs that bring little value to be exposed, far more opportunity for the American people to see the senseless spending in black and white. Finally, and it's an important point, federal bureaucrats, the people who spend our money, suddenly have to look over their shoulder and be prepared to justify that spending, and when they glance up to see who is peeking at their work, it's not just Musk, it's not just DOGE, it is the American people.

    "article_text": "California GOP chairwoman Corrin Rankin joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss Gavin Newsom's stunning policy reversal on free healthcare for migrants and his recent shift away from ultra-progressive policies. We’re all familiar with the impact of regulations. Sometimes, they’re in your face, like the taxes we pay or how long it takes to navigate the DMV. Other times, they’re pedantic annoyances, like the permits some states require for kids’ lemonade stands or when hair braider licenses require more training hours than EMTs. And sometimes they even impact how you take out your trash. That’s what we’re seeing inCalifornia, where a combination of state, federal and county regulations resulted in the closure of a landfill that was serving Los Angeles County. Local citizens, the landfill and elected officials are dealing with a challenging and rare chemical reaction taking place in an old part of the landfill. It has been a massive undertaking that involves federal and numerous state regulatory bodies. CALIFORNIA'S GREEN NEW SCAM COULD COST YOU $20,000 But here’s where theprogressive rubbermeets the reality road: People didn’t stop throwing out their trash, so the closure hasn’t solved any problems. It’s merely increased the cost and complexity of trash removal, because county taxes are now paying for transport to a landfill further away. Too often,government policiesare based not on helping people, but on a politician’s personal and professional goals. Is there a financial crash? Regulate the banks (after bailing them out)! Is healthcare expensive? Put stringent regulations on them (even though it increases the costs)! Close all the restaurants during COVID (but keep open the ones that serve Hollywood)! These grandstanding policies have real impacts on real people. When the federal government was raising the minimum wage almost two decades ago, Walmart received a lot of praise for supporting the effort. The problem was that Walmart pay was already above the minimum wage, so there was no impact on that company. But there were a lot of impacts on its small, local competitors, who went out of business. That’s good for Walmart. For small business owners? Not so much. California is theposter childfor policies that generate attention but have little positive impact on those who have the least flexibility and power. One of the highest income taxes (to fund social welfare)? Check. Insane cost of living (caused in cities like San Francisco by housing regulations and across-the-state by high taxes)? Check. Massive environmental bureaucracy that somehow leaves fire hydrants depleted, reservoirs empty and trash removal more expensive? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Check, check, check. And as we’ve seen, not even landfills — or your trash cans — are safe. It’s no wonder Golden State residents can’t flee fast enough. And those who are left behind may not have enough jobs to support them. From 2018 to 2021 alone, 352 companies moved their headquarters out of California to more business-friendly states because, in part, they don’t want to pay the state’s 8.84% corporate tax rate, which is the eighth-highest in the nation. Instead, they are heading to states like Texas, which has no corporate tax. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP With fewer people, there are fewer households to pony up taxes and fund the extravagant programs that elected officials in California have enacted. That means the residents and businesses who decide to stick it out are now faced with even higher taxes, increased costs of living and higher fees for trash pickup. Regulations havereal impacts, especially in states like California that are so over-regulated that even trash collection is affected. That’s a basic municipal service that is essential to the health and well-being of all residents. But maybe they won’t be residents for much longer anyway. Maybe those dinner table conversations will be about which state they should pack up and move to. Michael Feuz is a key member of ITR Economics’ team of expert economists and consultants.

There’s something almost poetic about the Democratic Party’s desperation. Faced with amass exodus of young menfrom their ranks, the left’s solution isn’t to rethink their disastrous policies or the cultural rot they’ve championed. Nope, they’ve decided to shell out tens of millions of dollars to study us. Not talk to us. Not listen. Not ask honest questions. Just study us - like we’re alien creatures under a microscope. That's not strategy — it’s stupidity.

You couldn’t make this up if you tried.Let’s get one thing straight: no amount of polling, focus groups or think-tank memos is going to win back the respect of my generation. Because Gen Z guys aren’t confused about why we’re walking away — we’re walking away because the modernDemocratic Partyhas spent years demonizing us, mocking masculinity and replacing real leadership with TikTok cringe and rainbow flag activism.We’ve been told we’re toxic if we believe in traditional values.

    "title": "MORNING GLORY: Trump emerges as 'closer-in-chief' to push 'one big, beautiful' tax bill through Congress",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on U.S. Senate efforts to pass President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' on 'Special Report.' When then-President-electDonald Trumpdeclared to me on January 5 of this year that \"My preference is one big, as I say,one big, beautiful bill,\"he started a snowball rolling down Congressional Hill that has gathered momentum and should be on his desk, perhaps by July 4, and certainly not later than Labor Day weekend. Trump willed H.R. 1 into being the way he willed his return to the Oval Office: By speaking clearly and repeatedly about what had to be done. Turns out the commander-in-chief is also the \"closer-in-chief.\" Of course, the House and Senate GOP knew they could not have allowed Trump’s 2017 triumph of his first tax bill to expire at the end of this year and thus shatter an economy recovering its bearings and its potential for great growth after the disastrous years of inflation unleashed by former President Joe Biden’s reckless looting of the federal treasury. But neither did it seem likely they could make the Trump tax code permanent as well as add more cuts to taxable income for folks who depend on tips, for seniors and for homeowners in states with burdensome tax rates. SCOOP: HOUSE GOP MEMO HIGHLIGHTS REPUBLICAN WINS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' But the president worked so closely with House SpeakerMike Johnson,Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Majority Whip Tom Emmer that he not only got the \"one, big, beautiful bill\" through the House, he got what he promised on the campaign trail last year. Now he seems likely to help Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thuneand Senate GOP Whip John Barrasso and Conference Chair Senator Tom Cotton pilot H.R. 1 through the narrows of that body. House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans celebrated passing Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\"(Getty Images) But the challenge will come when the Senate \"leaves its fingerprints\" on the bill, as West Virginia Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito put it to\"the fellas\"on the \"Ruthless\" podcast this week. Senators have ideas too. They are equal participants with the House members and the Senate GOP can also only lose three of their 53 votes and still carry the \"one, big, beautiful bill\" forward. There are two things which can be done to make the bill better and also create some space for money for rural hospitals which, as Capito stressed, is of great concern to many in the GOP conference. MIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET ‘BIG, 'BEAUTIFUL’ WIN AS BUDGET PASSES HOUSE The first big change is to add a process by which entitlement reform could commence, and the second is an\"IRA/401k conversion window\"where a flat tax would be applied to seniors who wish to convert their IRA/401k assets into Roth IRAs, a window which if opened for this tax year, would yield trillions in revenue next year and thus prevent the \"one, big beautiful bill\" from increasing the debt, while also being wildly popular with the demographic most likely to vote in the 2026 mid-terms. First, fiscal hawks worried about the rising debt could be lured into supporting the final version of the bill by the promise of a shot at entitlement reform — not cuts — in this Congress. To accomplish this requires the senators remember both the \"Greenspan Commission\" and the \"BRACs.\" The Greenspan Commission, officially the National Commission on Social Security Reform, was a bipartisan commission appointed by President Ronald Reagan and the leaders of the two houses in 1981 to address a short-term financing crisis facing Social Security. Led by Alan Greenspan, its report produced the Social Security Reform Act of 1983, which included both benefit-reduction and revenue-raising measures to address the projected funding shortfall. Social Security was in much worse shape then than now. Now, Social Security, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, need reforms, not benefit cuts. INSIDE TRUMP'S URGENT MEETING WITH HOUSE GOP TO PASS THE 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' The \"BRAC\" was the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, established by law, which proposed closures or realignments of military facilities across the U.S and the world to improve efficiency and reduce costs. A BRAC Commission has been used five times — with rounds initiated in 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995 and 2005 – and each produced lists of military bases and facilities to be combined or closed. Its members compiled the lists and the result was presented to Congress with the choice: do nothing and the BRAC recommendations became law or pass a resolution rejecting them all. It was and remains a brilliant idea that can be applied to entitlement reforms produced by a new Greenspan Commission. Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo told Hugh Hewitt that a flat tax on IRA/401(k) conversions could raise at least $1 trillion. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The new commission, like the original, would be made up of presidential and congressional appointees. It would be tasked with proposing entitlement reforms that would — very gradually— make entitlements fiscally stable. (An example: Raise the retirement age a month every year for the next 40 years, which would raise the retirement age to 69 by 2065. That is a \"reform\" not a cut, one so gradual as to be unnoticed by Social Security recipients who are already working longer without a prompt from the federal government. Similar reforms for Medicare and Medicaid can be put into place that allow for gentle transitions of the sort that responsible reforms embrace.) TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' PASSES KEY HOUSE HURDLE AFTER GOP REBEL MUTINY I’ve written about the second big add-onbefore: the flat tax on IRA/401(k) conversions. Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told me last month this reform is very much on the table. It would raise at least a trillion dollars in one-time revenue and perhaps twice that amount or more. There is opposition from the retirement planning community that operates IRAs and other retirement vehicles, but those offered a 10% or 15% or even a 20% tax on conversion from standard retirement accounts to Roth accounts would applaud long and hard and remember this change come November 2026. Led by Alan Greenspan, its report produced the Social Security Reform Act of 1983, which included both benefit-reduction and revenue-raising measures to address the projected funding shortfall. The impact of the amendment to the tax code would fly through theSenateparliamentarian’s review under the \"Byrd rule\" and more than balance out the fiscal impact of increasing the SALT deduction. Here’s to sanity among the bill’s drafters in the Senate: Sometimes the obvious thing to do is also the right thing to do. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP With just these two additions to the bill, both fiscal hawks and the politically minded would find the \"one, big, beautiful bill\" a magnet that could not be resisted. All the Senate has to do is polish up H.R. 1 and the Congress can go home for a well-earned summer vacation.

    "article_text": "White House envoy for Ukraine Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg (Ret.) joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's position with Vladimir Putin as the administration continues to push for peace with Ukraine. Since his first day in office, PresidentDonald Trumphas mismanaged negotiations over an end to the war in Ukraine. More than 100 days later, innocent Ukrainians are still dying while the president gets played byRussian President Vladimir Putin– illustrated starkly by the barrages of drones and missiles continually aimed at Ukrainian cities as Trump posts online. It’s good to hear Trump finally express some frustration toward Putin and admit that his negotiating tactics aren’t working, that, as he says, Putin is \"just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently.\" The reasons for this aren’t complicated. Instead of increasing his leverage over Russa, Trump offered concession after concession before talks even began. Getting U.S. policy right inUkrainematters. If we allow Russia to end these negotiations as the victor, our NATO allies in Poland and the Baltics could be next. China’s President Xi Jinping will draw clear lessons from our capitulation as China plots a takeover of Taiwan.

TRUMP TELLS PUTIN 'STOP' AFTER DEADLY RUSSIAN STRIKES ON KYIV Sadly, Trump is unlikely to listen to me, to our allies, or even to reasonable voices within his own White House and administration. My hope, though, is that he will be guided by the concepts from his own playbook — \"The Art of the Deal\" — tosecure a just peaceand end this war. Russia launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the war started.(Reuters/Gleb Garanich) Donald Trump says never let yourself be pushed around — but that’s exactly what Putin is doing to him. When Trump proposed an unconditional ceasefire, Putin delayed and then shot a missile at a playground full of children. When Trump threatened additionalsanctionsif Putin didn’t agree to a ceasefire, Putin blew past Trump’s demands without consequence. Instead of continuing to get pushed around, the president should heed his own words: \"You do your thing, you hold your ground, you stand up tall, and whatever happens, happens.\" Backing down now by threatening to walk away from talks is incentivizing Putin. This weakness invites Russian and Chinese aggression because an easy deal today undermines security for Europe, Taiwan and the United States tomorrow. TRUMP SAYS HE IS 'PISSED OFF' WITH PUTIN OVER LACK OF PEACE PROGRESS: REPORT Trump should increase sanctions — not just threaten them — and provide continued security assistance and intelligence sharing to Ukraine to sustain its war efforts against Russia. We should also reconsider Ukraine’s interest in NATO membership to apply all points of pressure on Putin. Russia’s economy is in real trouble with hundreds of thousands of Russians having been killed or wounded on the front lines. Putin needs this war to end. I couldn’t agree more with Trump when he wrote: \"The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. That makes the other guy smell blood, and then you’re dead.\" Trump should not act as though Americans need this war to end more than the Russians do. While everyone wants to see an end to the bloodshed, America must approach these negotiations from a position of strength, so we can secure the best possible deal. Our economy and alliances dwarf those of Russia, which is poorer, more isolated and badly diminished by Putin’s war. TRUMP BLAMES BIDEN FOR GETTING US INTO A 'MESS WITH RUSSIA' Trump should also not give away our leverage for nothing and that includes the economic might and political unity of our European partners. Presenting a united front means implementing punishing collective sanctions that have damaged Russia’s economy and thrown sand in its war gears. Acting together with our allies undermines Putin’s agenda in Europe, inflicts the greatest pain on Russia’s economy and significantly limits Russia’s negotiating space. Deeds matter more than words. As Trump wrote himself: \"If you don’t deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.\" He has deeply weakened decades of American leadership and credibility by abandoning our allies and the rules-based system that allowed for predictability, peace and prosperity for Americans and much of the world. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The only way to fix America’s credibility is to be decisive and show American strength. An immediate ceasefire allows Trump to deliver on his commitment to the American people and test Russia’s willingness to seek peace. But he should make clear that a stiffer sanctions package, including secondary sanctions outlined in Republican Sen.Lindsey Grahamand Democrat Sen. Richard Blumenthal’s legislation, will be imposed imminently. More than 80 senators of both parties have endorsed this bill. He must convince Putin — through bold and decisive action — that continued war is folly. Only then will there be a durable peace that restores deterrence in Europe and allows Ukraine to rebuild. Smoke rises over the Kyiv skyline after a Russian attack, Monday, July 8, 2024. Russian forces launched multiple ballistic and cruise missiles against Ukrainian targets on Monday, Ukraine’s air force said, with explosions felt and heard across the capital, Kyiv.(AP Photo/ Evgeniy Maloletka) Ukraine’s signing of the mineral deal with the U.S. is a promising step, in contrast to Putin’s recent no-show in Ankara. Trump can re-start peace efforts on his own terms by imposing a stiffer sanctions package on Russia without delay. If he is indeed committed to securing Ukraine’s independent future, Trump must demonstrate that he is in the stronger position. PUTIN REPORTEDLY CONCERNED OVER RUSSIA'S ECONOMY AHEAD OF POSSIBLE TRUMP TARIFFS But let me be clear: based on its history, the Kremlin is not interested in peace. Whether in Moldova, Georgia or Ukraine, Moscow has demonstrated strategic patience and abused others’ good faith to string out negotiations and then escalate when it sees fit. Simply put, when you give Putin an inch, he will take a mile. The only way to prevent this continued cycle is to secure a peace agreement that retains Ukraine’s national identity and that offers lasting security. Only then will President Trump prevent further aggression that threatens to draw America into future conflict.

    "title": "SENS WARREN, SHEEHY: Pentagon wastes billions with devastating repair rules. We’re working together to stop it",
    "article_text": "Retired Navy SEAL officer Mike Sarraille discusses the importance of Memorial Day during an appearance on ‘Fox & Friends.’ Our defense industrial base is stumbling. For years, the U.S. Department of Defense – under both Republicans and Democrats – failed to address one of the most fundamental issues within our military industrial complex, perverse incentives for contractors. But with the recently announced Army Transformation Initiative, Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll and General Randy George are taking a major step to stand up for soldiers and strengthen our military readiness. Driscoll’s plan will help end one source of waste, fraud, and abuse. Every other military branch should follow their lead – and, if they do, they will have our bipartisan support. TheDepartment of Defenseis the largest federal agency, consuming half the discretionary budget the federal government spends every year. In 2023, for example, DoD spent almost $450 billion on contracts. But buried down deep in the fine print, many of those contracts included restrictions that prevent our troops from fixing their own weapons and equipment. That fine print means that every time something breaks, DoD must call the contractor, schedule a repair visit, and pay a hefty fee. For some contracts, the repairs are more profitable than the original sale – a dynamic that represents how years of broken bureaucracy has slowed our acquisition process and driven costs higher and higher. ARMY UNVEILS NEW FITNESS TEST WITH TOUGHER STANDARDS — COULD YOU PASS IT? Our military buys a lot of gear – from tanks to helicopters to night vision goggles, and the process to buy that gear is longer and more complicated than ever. Even worse, because our service members often can’t make any repairs, they can be stuck waiting weeks or months, even for simple problems they could fix themselves with a little know-how and a 3D printer. Military repairs done in the field rely on contractors who can take over 200 days to fix equipment. FILE: An M1128 Stryker Mobile Gun System, with 1st Squadron, 82nd Cavalry Regiment, Oregon Army National Guard, shoots it’s 105mm cannon during a live-fire exercise during the squadron’s annual training, July 26, 2018, at Orchard Combat Training Center near Boise, Idaho.(Oregon Army National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Zachary Holden, Oregon Military Department Public Affairs) Driscoll has identified these problems in the Army, butright to repair restrictionshave spread across the military. The Navy was forced to rely on flying contractors out to sea for maintenance. The Air Force is struggling to keep its planes ready for combat because of restrictions and companies that won’t even negotiate. Every hour these servicemembers can’t fix their own weapons undermines their readiness to meet their assignments. Instead of working to help the military be ready for battle, these contractors are focused on squeezing out more revenue. SECRETARY OF THE ARMY DAN DRISCOLL: ARMY UNVEILS MODERNIZATION PLAN BECAUSE, ‘NO LOBBYIST EVER WON A WAR' These restrictions lead to three critical problems: readiness, cost and lack of competition. First, when contractors stop soldiers from fixing their own equipment, it threatens military readiness. All around the country, maintainers were struggling to keep the F-35 flying because Lockheed Martin won’t give them the data they need to fix damage to basic parts. When our military could fix a helicopter in Korea themselves, they saved 207 days and roughly $1.8 million. Our military can’t afford to wait 207 days to get a helicopter back online. And, in the most extreme cases, our military can’t afford to have soldiers unable to repair equipment in the heat of battle, either because the contract has tied their hands or because they haven’t had the chance to learn how. $1,300 COFFEE CUPS, 8,000% OVERPAY FOR SOAP DISPENSERS SHOW WASTE AS DOGE LOCKS IN ON PENTAGON Imagine how frustrating it would be to be in the field up against an enemy, suffer an equipment breakdown, and there would be nothing to do about it. We need to end these dangerous right-to-repair restrictions so that our military is always ready. Second, repair restrictions waste billions of dollars. If Boeing got thePentagonto agree that only Boeing can repair equipment, what stops them from charging whatever they want for that fix? Suddenly a $0.16 clip costs $20, and the defense budget rises even higher. That is a terrible deal for the taxpayer. By some estimates, giving the military the right to repair would save us billions. But more importantly, it would reinvigorate the operational resilience of our forward-deployed elements and allow them to self-sustain. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and a missile interceptor. If the Army is going to upgrade its equipment, it needs to focus on the right to repair.(Reuters ) DEFENSE SECRETARY ANNOUNCES PAY RAISE FOR PARATROOPERS DURING FORT BRAGG SPEECH And third, letting a contractor monopolize repairs doesn’t just hurt taxpayers, it hurts small businesses that otherwise could compete for the repair work, depressing competition and thinning out our industrial base. Why would a small business start manufacturing a safety clip when the military is forced to go to its larger competitor to buy it? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION And equally alarmingly, if that big contractor decided one day to stop producing the part,the militarywould be out of luck because the contractor had the only game in town. To be sure, the military created this monopolistic environment, incentivizing consolidation through decades of bureaucratic process. Now they are reaping the whirlwind. We need a more diverse array of contractors who can bring free market competition to our defense space, driving costs down and efficiencies up. Until now, the military has enabled a broken status quo, handing over billions of dollars and hoping that there is no emergency when the equipment they need is sidelined. Meanwhile, over 70% of voters support giving the military the right to repair their own equipment. But Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll showed real leadership. He stood up to a broken bureaucracy and announced that every new Army contract would explicitly guarantee the right of the Army to fix its own equipment. That’s a big deal. Every hour these servicemembers can’t fix their own weapons undermines their readiness to meet their assignments. Instead of working to help the military be ready for battle, these contractors are focused on squeezing out more revenue. The new Army policy is a breakthrough in our fight to empower soldiers, but unless every single military service follows his lead, taxpayers will keep getting ripped off. And, because this is a directive from the secretary, a subsequent secretary could go back to the way things were before. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But we have a plan to solve that problem. In the coming weeks, we will be introducing abipartisan billthat would make changes to right to repair permanent. With a single change in the law, we can boost military readiness and cut costs by allowing servicemembers to repair their own equipment. On both sides of the aisle, many of us agree thatwaste, fraud and abuseare real problems in our government – and it’s worse when it threatens our military readiness. It’s time to show servicemembers we’ve got their backs and restore their right to fix their own equipment. Republican Tim Sheehy represents Montana in the United States Senate.

HopeJR is a full-size humanoid robot that has 66 actuated degrees of freedom, or 66 independent movements, including the ability to walk and move its arms. Reachy Mini is a desktop unit that can move its head, talk, listen, and be used to test AI apps.

The company’s co-founder and CEO, Clem Delangue, told TechCrunch over email that they expect to start shipping at least the first few units by the end of the year, and the waitlist is currently open. Hugging Face estimates that the HopeJR will cost around $3,000 per unit and the Reachy Mini will cost around $250 to $300, depending on tariffs. “The important aspect is that these robots are open source, so anyone can assemble, rebuild, [and] understand how they work, and [that they’re] affordable, so that robotics doesn’t get dominated by just a few big players with dangerous black-box systems,” Delangue said via email. This robot release was made possible in part by the company’s acquisition of humanoid robotics startupPollen Robotics, which was announced in April, according to Delangue. He added that the Pollen team gave Hugging Face “new capabilities” required to make these bots. Hugging Face has been making a concerted push into the robotics industry over the past few years. It launchedLeRobot, a collection of open AI models, datasets, and tools to build robotics systems, in 2024. So far in 2025, the company has released an updated version of its 3D-printed and programmable robotic arm,the SO-101, which the company built in a partnership with French robotics firm The Robot Studio.

After a Reddit userposted a photoof the new height setting in the Tinder app, a company spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the discovery setting has been launched as a global test. Tinder Gold and Premium subscribers in the test group will have access to the feature, but not free users, we’re told. In addition, the setting will indicate a preference, rather than functioning as a “hard filter,” the company says. That means it won’t actually block or exclude profiles but instead inform recommendations. “We’re always listening to what matters most to our Tinder users — and testing the paid height preference is a great example of how we’re building with urgency, clarity, and focus,” said Phil Price Fry, VP Comms at Tinder, in an emailed statement. “This is part of a broader effort to help people connect more intentionally on Tinder. Our new product principles guide every decision, and this one speaks directly to a few: prioritizing user outcomes, moving fast, and learning quickly. Not every test becomes a permanent feature, but every test helps us learn how we can deliver smarter, more relevant experiences and push the category forward.” While typically dating apps let users filter for people by more traditional concerns, like someone’s age or whether they want a long-term relationship or kids, the height setting is likely to cause more controversy and concern. Since the rise of online dating, a focus on someone’s physicality — like their looks or size — has become a primary factor in determining who’s worth a match. Tinder helped accelerate this trend thanks to its user interface, which puts a heavy emphasis on looking through people’s photos. Other Tinder users often quickly react to those photos with left or right swipes to indicate interest. In addition to exposing people’s preferences for the conventionally attractive, dating apps’ popularity led to a culture where abias toward taller menbecame the norm. It’snot uncommon to come across profileswhere women state they’re only looking for matches who are at least 6 feet tall, for instance — even if in real life they’d be more flexible about this requirement. Tinder has even poked fun at this trend in previous years, like when it made an April Fools’ Dayannouncementthat it wouldintroducea “height verification” feature in its app. (Many mendidn’t findthis particular joke funny.) The height bias has also been the subject of other parodies, like whendesigner Soren Iverson imagineda version of Tinder that let men override users’ height requirements for a fee. The company may hope that the addition of a height setting could encourage more women to use and pay for the app, which tends to be more heavilydominated by men both in the U.S.andinternationally. The test’s launch follows Tinder parent Match’s recent earnings, whichrevealed a 5% fall in paying users. Paid subscribers across Match’s dating apps fell to 14.2 million in the first quarter, down from 14.9 million users a year ago. The company is in the middle ofanother CEO transition, with Match CEO Spencer Rascoff set to run Tinder too later this summer.

The independent evaluation could prolong the transition, or gum up OpenAI’s plans even further. OpenAI’s conversion will help it attract new investment andeventually go public, but first, the startup needs to secure approvals from state regulators. Although OpenAI and Microsoft have hired their own investment banks to advise on the deal, Delaware’s attorney general is now seeking an independent evaluation of the equity that OpenAI’s nonprofit will receive. Regulators seem to be zeroing in on a key factor in OpenAI’s conversion, which could significantly affect the price OpenAI ultimately pays to simplify its structure. Corporate governance experts sayElon Musk may have raised the price of OpenAI’s nonprofitwhen he submitted a $97.4 billion takeover bid for the startup, despite the fact that OpenAI promptly rejected it.

Perplexity Labs is available on the web, iOS, and Android, and coming soon to Perplexity’s apps for Mac and Windows. “Perplexity Labs can help you complete a variety of work and personal projects,” Perplexityexplainsin a blog post. “Labs is designed to invest more time — 10 minutes or longer — and leverage additional tools [to accomplish tasks], such as advanced file generation and mini-app creation.” Labs, which arrives the same day as viral AI agent platformManusreleased a slide deck creation tool, is a part of Perplexity’s effort to broaden beyond its core business of search. Perplexity is currently previewing a web browser,Comet, and recently acquiredRead.vc, a social media network for professionals. Perplexity Labs, powered by AI, can conduct research and analysis, taking around 10 minutes and using tools like web search, code execution, and chart and image creation to craft reports and visualizations. Labs can create interactive web apps, Perplexity says, and write code to structure data, apply formulas, and create documents. All files created during a Perplexity Labs workflow — such as charts, images, and code files — are organized in a tab from where they can be viewed or downloaded. “This expanded capability empowers you to develop a broader array of deliverables for your projects,” according to Perplexity’s blog post. It all sounds good in theory, but AI being an imperfect technology, Labs likely doesn’t always hit the mark. Of course, we’ll reserve judgment until we have a chance to test it. Perplexity has increasingly invested in corporate-focused functionality, last summerlaunchingan enterprise plan with user management, “internal knowledge search,” and more. The moves could be in part at the behest of the VCs backing Perplexity, who are no doubt eager to see a return sooner than later. Perplexity isreportedlyin talks to raise up to $1 billion in capital from investors at an $18 billion valuation.

Heron Poweris developing solid-state transformers, which promise to be more compact and responsive than the century-old analog models. Transformers are key parts of the electrical grid, stepping voltage up and down as it moves through the system. Heron focuses on so-called medium-voltage transformers, which covers a range of possible applications, from large substations behind fences to the green metal boxes found throughout residential neighborhoods. Heron Powersaid it’s targeting initial installations in early 2027, and it’s partnering with “major energy and data center developers.” Capricorn Investment Group led the round, with participation from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Energy Impact Partners, Gigascale Capital, Powerhouse Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, and former Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn.

    "title": "In a victory for Palmer Luckey, Meta and Anduril work on mixed reality headsets for the military",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us On Thursday, Anduril and Meta announced news that feels like a fairy tale ending for Anduril co-founder Palmer Luckey. The two companies are working together to build extended reality (XR) devices for the U.S. military, Andurilannouncedin a blog post. “I am glad to be working with Meta once again,” Luckey is quoted as saying in the post. “My mission has long been to turn warfighters into technomancers, and the products we are building with Meta do just that.” This partnership stems from the Soldier Borne Mission Command (SBMC) Next program, formerly called the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) Next. IVAS was a massive military contract, with a total $22 billion budget, originally awarded to Microsoft in 2018 intended to develop HoloLens-like AR glasses for soldiers. But after endless problems, in February the Army strippedmanagement of the program from Microsoft and awarded it to Anduril, with Microsoft staying on as a cloud provider. The intent is to eventually have multiple suppliers of mixed reality glasses for soldiers. All of this meant that if Luckey’s former employer, Meta, wanted to tap into the potentially lucrative world of military VR/AR/XR headsets, it would need to go through Anduril. The devices will be based on tech out of Meta’s AR/VR research center Reality Labs, the post says. They’ll use Meta’s Llama AI model, and they will tap into Anduril’s command and control software known as Lattice. The idea is to provide soldiers with a heads-up display of battlefield intelligence in real time. Luckey is apparently feeling good about this reconciliation. He was, of course,famously firedfrom Facebook in 2017, about three years after Facebook bought his startup Oculus for $2 billion. This came after Luckey was embroiled in a brouhaha over his support for Donald Trump in his 2016 election. Luckey turned around and founded Anduril in 2017, with co-founders Brian Schimpf, Trae Stephens, and Matt Grimm. An Anduril spokesperson tells TechCrunch that the product family Meta and Anduril are building is even called EagleEye, which will be an ecosystem of devices. EagleEye is what Luckey named Anduril’s first imagined headset in Anduril’s pitch deck draft, before his investors convinced him to focus on building software first. “All of them had worked with me for years via Oculus VR, and when they saw the EagleEye headset in our first Anduril pitch deck draft, they pointed out that it seemed like I was sequencing things irrationally. They believed, correctly, that I was too focused on winning a pissing contest over the future of AR/VR, on proving that I was right and the people who fired me were wrong,”Luckey tweetedin February after winning the IVAS contract. After Thursday’s news, Luckeyposted on X: “It is pretty cool to have everything at our fingertips for this joint effort – everything I made before Meta acquired Oculus, everything we made together, and everything we did on our own after I was fired.” And to show that Luckey has really buried the hatchet, he said Anduril has even launched aFacebook page.

With this integration, viewers will soon be able to use Google Lens to search what they see while watching Shorts. For example, if you’re watching a Short filmed in a location that you’re interested in visiting, you can select a landmark and ask Lens to identify it. From there, you would be able to learn more about the destination’s culture and history. By integrating Lens into Shorts, YouTube is working to enhance visual search capabilities and give users more ways to discover and search for content in an intuitive and interactive way. It makes sense for the company to enhance search capabilities for YouTube Shorts viewers by leveraging Google Lens, especially since TikTok and Instagram Reels don’t offer similar functionality. Once the functionality rolls out, users will be able to try it out by pausing a Short and then selecting the “Lens” option in the top menu. Then they will need to either draw, highlight, or tap on something they want to search. Lens will then provide visual matches and search results overlaid on the Short. Once you’re done with the Short, you can jump back into the content that you were watching. Users won’t see ads in search results during the beta phase of Lens in Shorts, YouTube says. The Google-owned company also notes that Lens in Shorts isn’t available for Shorts with YouTube Shopping affiliate links or with paid product promotions. YouTube is starting to roll out the beta to all viewers this week. Today’s announcement comes as YouTube has been building out Shorts with added capabilities to take on TikTok and Instagram Reels. In April, YouTubeannounced new upcoming featuresthat are designed to help creators publish engaging short-form videos. Creators will get access to an improved video editor, the ability to generate AI stickers, a feature that syncs content to the beat of a song, enhanced templates, and more.

But the Chinese AI lab also released a smaller, “distilled” version of its new R1, DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, that DeepSeek claims beats comparably sized models on certain benchmarks. The smaller updated R1, which was built using theQwen3-8B modelAlibaba launched in May as a foundation, performs better than Google’sGemini 2.5 Flashon AIME 2025, a collection of challenging math questions.

So-called distilled models like DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B are generally less capable than their full-sized counterparts. On the plus side, they’re far less computationally demanding.Accordingto the cloud platform NodeShift, Qwen3-8B requires a GPU with 40GB-80GB of RAM to run (e.g., an Nvidia H100). The full-sized new R1 needsaround a dozen 80GB GPUs. DeepSeek trained DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B by taking text generated by the updated R1 and using it to fine-tune Qwen3-8B. In a dedicated web page for the model on the AI dev platform Hugging Face, DeepSeek describes DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B as “for both academic research on reasoning models and industrial development focused on small-scale models.” DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B is available under a permissive MIT license, meaning it can be used commercially without restriction.

On Thursday, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controlannouncedthe sanctions, saying Funnull is “linked to the majority of virtual currency investment scam websites reported to the FBI.” The press release said that the $200 million in losses results in an average loss of $150,000 per victim, but that the numbers “likely underestimate the total losses, as many victims of scams do not report the crime.” Pig butchering scamsinvolve criminals approaching victims online, often pretending to be interested in a romantic relationship, with the goal of tricking the victims into sending them money to invest in nonexistent crypto projects. According to the Treasury, Funnull is based in the Philippines and run by Chinese-national Liu Lizhi, who was also sanctioned on Thursday. Funnull, according to the Treasury, generated domain names for websites on IP addresses it owns, and provided “web design templates to cybercriminals.” “These services not only make it easier for cybercriminals to impersonate trusted brands when creating scam websites, but also allow them to quickly change to different domain names and IP addresses when legitimate providers attempt to take the websites down,” the Treasury said. The FBIreleased an alertthat included more information about these activities. The Treasury referred tothe Polyfill supply chain attackin its press release, saying Funnell “purchased a repository of code used by web developers and maliciously altered the code to redirect visitors of legitimate websites to scam websites and online gambling sites, some of which are linked to Chinese criminal money laundering operations.” Those activities are exactly whatresearchers from cybersecurity firm Silent Push accused FUNNULL of carrying out last year. Researchers found that Funnull was responsible for the Polyfill supply chain attack, which was launched to push malware to whoever visited websites that used Polyfill’s code. The goal was to redirect users to a malicious network of casino and online gambling sites, the researchers found.

Zach Edwards, a researcher at Silent Push who worked on the Funnull report last year, told TechCrunch that he was “really glad to see the facts aligned with our suspicions.” “It’s encouraging that the Treasury has taken actions against the largest pig butchering and money laundering network that exists targeting people in the U.S., but we know that more needs to be done,” said Edwards. “This effort from Funnull is the tip of the iceberg for what is actually going on right now out of China with financial schemes targeting Americans.” “Global threat actors that are targeting Americans with financial scams need to be held accountable, and doxing the companies they work with and the individuals who run those companies, is an important first step,” he added.

Now, the company’s energy business — a rarebright spotamidfaltering demandfor its EVs — is under assault. House Republicans passed a reconciliation bill last week that would undo much of the Inflation Reduction Act, including tax credits for residential solar installations and for clean energy projects. That bill is now before the Senate. If the Senate were to pass it with those repeals in tact, it could have a devastating impact on Tesla’s energy division, which brought in $2.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter, a 67% increase year-over-year. With CEOElon Muskclaiming that his time in government has come to an end, Tesla has taken to lobbying legislators on X. There, Tesla Energyappealedto Senate Republicans. “Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid – we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down of 25D and 48e,” Tesla posted on X. “This will ensure continued speedy deployment of over 60 GW capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth.” Today, homeowners qualify for 30% tax credits on new solar installations, while clean energy developers can generally claim the same. Those provisions are currently scheduled to sunset at the end of 2032, but House Republicans want to end the credits four years earlier and require projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Cutting those parts of the law could risk the deployment of 60 gigawatts of capacity annually “to support AI and domestic manufacturing support,” Tesla said. The Trump administration has made “energy dominance” a key priority, and slowing the deployment of renewable and clean energy puts that goal at risk. Last year,93%of all new generating capacity in the U.S. was clean energy, mostly solar and grid-scale storage. In the first quarter this year, renewables added 7.4 gigawatts, the second best Q1 ever. Queues for new natural gas turbines stretch for years, while solar farms can generally be completed in 18 months. Like many residential solar installers, Tesla’s energy business is heavily dependent on tax incentives. Since Republicans have prioritized repealing the Inflation Reduction Act, American solar stocks have taken a beating. This year, Enphase is down 45%, Sunrun has lost a quarter of its share price, and First Solar is off 15%.

The company says its U.S. App Store ecosystem has generated $406 billion in developer billings and sales in 2024 — a figure that’s nearly tripled in size since 2019, when it then generated $142 billion. Apple also made a point to note that, for 90% of the billings and sales facilitated by the App Store, developers paid no commission. The new figures come from an Apple-funded study conducted by Professor Andrey Fradkin from Boston University Questrom School of Business and economist Dr. Jessica Burley from Analysis Group. Analysis Group has beenworking with Apple for yearsamid growing antitrust scrutiny to create reports and studies that showcase the App Store’s market power in a more favorable light and as a net positive for developers. In particular, these studies have stressed that only a small sliver of Apple’s developer base even pays Apple commissions, and the majority of those who do so are on a Small Business plan or other programs where their commission is reduced from the standard 30% to 15%. However, those findings haven’t protected Apple from being forced to open up the App Store to increased competition in the U.S. Last month, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogersruled that Apple had violated the court’s order arising from Fortnite maker Epic Games’ lawsuitthat had required Apple to reform its App Store’s policy around external payments. As a result of that ruling, Apple was forced to letdevelopers add links to their app that point to web payment options, where Apple is not allowed to take a commission. Apple is now in the processof appealingthe ruling. The years-long fight over App Store commissions has led to increased hostility and disappointment from members of the iOS developer community,who believe thattheir applications are part of the reason for the iPhone’s historical success. Many feel they should be treated with more gratitude for their efforts, and not as a resource to extract money from. Apple, on the other hand, staunchly believes that the App Store itself is the reason for the developers’ success, as it provides the marketplace that allows consumers to discover new apps and easily pay for the developers’ software and services. That comes through in Apple’s latest report as well, where Apple notes that earnings for U.S.-based developers have more than doubled over the last five years, while small business developers have seen earnings increase by 76% from 2021 to 2024. (The latter number is not surprising. In 2020,Apple launched its Small Business Programthat reduced commissions for developers making less than $1 million per year. An earnings increase is to be expected.) Apple also reminds U.S. developers that its App Store allows them to reach a global market of 175 countries and regions, and itprevents billions in fraudulent transactions. Its developer investments include 250,000 APIs,  as part of frameworks like HealthKit, Metal, Core ML, MapKit, and SwiftUI. Additionally, the new report highlights how much developers are making from the App Store in areas where they don’t have to pay commission. For instance, Apple says that last year, the U.S. App Store ecosystem facilitated $277 billion in total billings and sales from physical goods and services, $75 billion from in-app advertising, and $53 billion from digital goods and services. It also notes that, since 2019, spending on physical goods and services more than tripled and in-app spending on digital goods and services and in-app advertising more than doubled. General retail spending and grocery delivery increased more than fourfold. Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

But the upgraded R1, also known as “R1-0528,” might also be less willing to answer contentious questions, in particular questions about topics the Chinese government considers to be controversial. That’s according to testing conducted by the pseudonymous developer behindSpeechMap, a platform to compare how different models treat sensitive and controversial subjects. The developer, who goes by the username “xlr8harder” on X, claims that R1-0528 is “substantially” less permissive of contentious free speech topics than previous DeepSeek releases and is “the most censored DeepSeek model yet for criticism of the Chinese government.” Though apparently this mention of Xianjiang does not indicate that the model is uncensored regarding criticism of China.  Indeed, using my old China criticism question set we see the model is also the most censored Deepseek model yet for criticism of the Chinese government.pic.twitter.com/INXij4zhfW As Wiredexplainedin a piece from January, models in China are required to follow stringent information controls. A 2023 law forbids models from generating content that “damages the unity of the country and social harmony,” which could be construed as content that counters the government’s historical and political narratives. To comply, Chinese startups often censor their models by either using prompt-level filters or fine-tuning them. Onestudyfound that DeepSeek’s original R1 refuses to answer 85% of questions about subjects deemed by the Chinese government to be politically controversial. According to xlr8harder, R1-0528 censors answers to questions about topics like the internment camps in China’s Xinjiang region, where more than a million Uyghur Muslims have been arbitrarily detained. While it sometimes criticizes aspects of Chinese government policy — in xlr8harder’s testing, it offered the Xinjiang camps as an example of human rights abuses — the model often gives the Chinese government’s official stance when asked questions directly. TechCrunch observed this in our brief testing, as well. China’s openly available AI models, including video-generating models such asMagi-1andKling, have attractedcriticismin the past for censoring topics sensitive to the Chinese government, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre.

    "title": "A decade in, bootstrapped Thinkst Canary reaches $20M in ARR without VC funding",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us This month, cybersecurity company Thinkst will mark its 10th anniversary since the launch of its now-flagship product, Canary. The company debuted Canary after seeing companies spend millions of dollars on cybersecurity products, yet were still taking months or longer to realize that they had been breached. Thinkstbelieved it could make a digital tripwire product that would catch hackers in the act, and by all accounts, it did just that. Over the past decade, the company has grown to around 40 employees, mostly developers and engineers; hasn’t taken on any outside funding; and is on track this year to make a healthy profit on $20 million in annual recurring revenue,almost double from 2021, Thinkst founder Haroon Meer told TechCrunch. It’s an impressive, if not refreshing feat, at a time when many cybersecurity companies are driven by breakneck growth and speed and fueled by venture capital. Meer, who founded Thinkst and serves as its chief executive from Cape Town in South Africa, told TechCrunch in a call earlier this month that Thinkst made it this far by focusing on its customers and what they need — specifically a product that does what it says it does — and not growing the company at an uncontrolled rate. Meer said this approach is working, pointing to 60% of its first-year customers who are still with the company today. “We’re not artificially holding back growth, but we’re also not doing any of the really silly, ‘pour gasoline on the fire’ growth-at-all-costs stuff,” said Meer. “What you have to do is keep the promises that you make, and you’ll grow into the people that are right for you.” In 2015, Thinkst launched its Canary hardware product — named after acanary in a coal mine, essentially a very early warning system — that can detect and alert when hackers are present on a company’s network. A canary is set up like a honeypot, so that when a malicious hacker (or anauthorized pen-testerstress-testing a company’s defenses) accesses the canary thinking they struck it lucky by accessing a Windows PC with an open file share, or a server packed with customer data, secret API keys, or a vital service for a company’s operations, the canary will send an alert about the breach and allow the company to take immediate action. The canary’s purpose is to reduce the amount of time that hackers have to sneak around on a victim’s network to search for sensitive data, plant malware, or otherwise cause damage before getting caught. The average hacker has around 24 days on a victim’s network before detection, according to Verizon’s most recent annual data breach report. The company also offersCanary Tokens, its free and public offering that lets anyone drop an item of ostensible value, like a password, document, or a credit card number, for example, in a safe place so that when someone accesses or opens the item, you are alerted at the same moment your safe place was compromised. “One of the things we got accidentally lucky with is it’s really hard to deploy a canary wrong,” said Meer. “If you make it fit in, then you catch attackers, and if you make it stick out, you catch attackers.” After all, if a malicious hacker sees an advantage to get what they need faster, they’re going to take the opportunity. “It’s rare for us to have a week without getting an email from a customer saying this saved our lives, or we had a pen test and this is the only thing that caught our attackers,” said Meer. It is these success stories that “fuels” the company, said Meer, and helps drive the company’s organic sales growth. Thinkst does not have an outbound sales team; instead, the company relies largely on word of mouth, or existing customers who want to buy more of the company’s honeypots. Meer said that while Thinkst hasn’t taken any outside funding to date, he does not begrudge the VC industry and values its insights. While conceding that some companies cannot get to where they are without heavy cash injections, he argues that money is “not the gate that stops you from doing stuff.” Meer said that companies focusing on making their products work and their customers happy is core to good business. “My main thing is that you should run the business in a way that you are still attractive for investment or acquisition,” said Meer. “If you build a good enough business so that you don’t need it, you can always ask for it when you do.” Meer was not shy about his company’s ambitions. “We think every company should be running at least five canaries now,” he said. Some companies have a handful of canaries and some into the hundreds or more. “There’s a bunch of stuff that we could do to make more money; we just don’t think that’s necessary right now, because what we’re doing is offering a good product at a fair price, and that’s growing.” “We are $20 million now, but we don’t think $20 million is our ceiling,” said Meer.

    "title": "Where does court ruling leave Trump's tariff agenda?",
    "article_text": "The US Court of International Trade on Wednesday struck down President Donald Trump's tariffs imposed under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The court ruled IEEPA did not give the president the authority to impose certain tariffs. This affects the \"fentanyl\" tariffs imposed by the White House on Canada, Mexico, China since Trump returned to the White House. These tariffs were brought in to curb smuggling of the narcotic into the US. It also affects the so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announced on 2 April, including the universal 10% baseline tariff on all imports to the US. However, the ruling does not affect the Trump administration's 25% \"sectoral\" tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and also his 25% additional tariffs on cars and car part imports, as these were implemented under a different legal justification. A US federal appeals court decided on Thursday night that Trump's global tariffs can temporarily stay in place while it considers the White House's appeal against the trade court's judgement - but the future of the President's tariff agenda remains in the balance. Data from US Customsshowsthe amount of revenue collected in the 2025 financial year to date (ie between 1 October 2024 and 30 April) under various tariffs. The data gives an approximate sense of the proportion of tariffs struck down and unaffected by the trade court's ruling. It shows the tariffs imposed under IEEPA on China, Mexico and Canada in relation to the fentanyl smuggling had brought in $11.8bn (£8.7bn) since February 2025. The 10% reciprocal tariffs - also justified under IEEPA - implemented in April had brought in $1.2bn (£890m). On the other side of the ledger, the tariffs on metals and car parts - which are unaffected by this ruling - brought in around $3.3bn (£2.4bn), based on rounded figures. And the biggest source of tariff revenue for the US in the period was from tariffs imposed on China dating back to Trump's first term in office, which raised $23.4bn (£17.3bn). These are also not affected by the court ruling, as they were not justified by IEEPA. However, this is a backward looking picture - and the new tariffs were expected to raise considerably more revenue over a full financial year. Analysts at the investment bank Goldman Sachs have estimated that the tariffs the trade court has struck down were likely to have raisedalmost $200bn (£148bn) on an annual basis. In terms of the overall impact on Donald Trump's tariff agenda, the consultancy Capital Economics estimates the court ruling would reduce the US's average external tariff this year from 15% to 6.5%. This would still be a considerable increase on the 2.5% level of 2024 and would be the highest since 1970. Yet 15% would have been the highest since the late 1930s. Trump had been using his tariffs as negotiating leverage in talks with countries hit by his 2 April tariffs. Some analysts believe this trade court ruling will mean countries will now be less likely to rush to secure deals with the US. The European Union (EU)intensified negotiationswith the White House last weekend after Trump threatened to increase the tariff on the bloc to 50% under IEEPA. The EU  - and others, such as Japan and Australia - might now judge it would be more prudent to wait to see what happens to the White House's appeal against the trade court ruling before making any trade concessions to the US to secure a deal. The response of stock markets around the world to the trade court ruling on Wednesday suggested it would be positive. But it also means greater uncertainty. Someanalystssay Trump could attempt to reimpose the tariffs under different legal justifications. For instance, Trump could attempt to re-implement the tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which empowers the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to address foreign practices that violate trade agreements or are deemed \"discriminatory\". And Trump has also threatened other sectoral tariffs, including on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. Those could still go into effect if they are not justified by IEEPA. Last month the World Trade Organization (WTO) said that the outlook for global trade had \"deteriorated sharply\" due to Trump's tariffs. The WTO said it expected global merchandise trade to decline by 0.2% in 2025 as a result, having previously projected it would grow by 2.7 per cent this year. The trade court ruling - if it holds - might help global trade perform somewhat better than this. But the dampening impact of uncertainty regarding whether US tariffs will materialise or not remains. The bottom line is that many economists think trade will still be very badly affected this year. \"Trump's trade war is not over – not by a long shot,\" is the verdict of Grace Fan of the consultancy TS Lombard.

    "title": "How the West is helping Russia to fund its war on Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Russia has continued to make billions from fossil fuel exports to the West, data shows, helping to finance its full-scale invasion of Ukraine – now in its fourth year. Since the start of that invasion in February 2022, Russia has made more than three times as much money by exporting hydrocarbons than Ukraine has received in aid allocated by its allies. Data analysed by the BBC show that Ukraine's Western allies have paid Russia more for its hydrocarbons than they have given Ukraine in aid. Campaigners say governments in Europe and North America need to do more to stop Russian oil and gas from fuelling the war with Ukraine. Proceeds made from selling oil and gas are key to keeping Russia's war machine going. Oil and gas account for almost a third of Russia's state revenue and more than 60% of its exports. In the wake of the February 2022 invasion, Ukraine's allies imposed sanctions on Russian hydrocarbons. The US and UK banned Russian oil and gas, while the EU banned Russian seaborne crude imports, but not gas. Despite this, by 29 May, Russia had made more than €883bn ($973bn; £740bn) in revenue from fossil fuel exports since the start of the full-scale invasion, including €228bn from the sanctioning countries,according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). The lion's share of that amount, €209bn, came from EU member states. EU states continued importing pipeline gas directly from Russia until Ukraine cut the transit in January 2025, and Russian crude oil is still piped to Hungary and Slovakia. Russian gas is still piped to Europe in increasing quantities via Turkey: CREA's data shows that its volume rose by 26.77% in January and February 2025 over the same period in 2024. Hungary and Slovakia are also still receiving Russian pipeline gas via Turkey. Despite the West's efforts, in 2024 Russian revenues from fossil fuels fell by a mere 5% compared with 2023, along with a similar 6% drop in the volumes of exports,according to CREA. Last year also saw a 6% increase in Russian revenues from crude oil exports, and a 9% year-on-year increase in revenues from pipeline gas. Russian estimates say gas exports to Europerose by up to 20%in 2024, with liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports reaching record levels. Currently, half of Russia's LNG exports go the EU, CREA says. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, says the alliance has not imposed \"the strongest sanctions\" on Russian oil and gas because some member states fear an escalation in the conflict and because buying them is \"cheaper in the short term\". LNG imports have not been included in the latest, 17th package of sanctions on Russia approved by the EU, butit has adopted a road maptowards ending all Russian gas imports by the end of 2027. Data shows that money made by Russia from selling fossil fuels has consistently surpassed the amount of aid Ukraine receives from its allies. The thirst for fuel can get in the way of the West's efforts to limit Russia's ability to fund its war. Mai Rosner, a senior campaigner from the pressure group Global Witness, says many Western policymakers fear that cutting imports of Russian fuels will lead to higher energy prices. \"There's no real desire in many governments to actually limit Russia's ability to produce and sell oil. There is way too much fear about what that would mean for global energy markets. There's a line drawn under where energy markets would be too undermined or too thrown off kilter,\" she told the BBC. In addition to direct sales, some of the oil exported by Russia ends up in the West after being processed into fuel products in third countries via what is known as \"the refining loophole\". Sometimes it gets diluted with crude from other countries, too. CREA says it has identified three \"laundromat refineries\" in Turkey and three in India processing Russian crude and selling the resulting fuel on to sanctioning countries. It says they have used €6.1bn worth of Russian crude to make products for sanctioning countries. India's petroleum ministrycriticised CREA's reportas \"a deceptive effort to tarnish India's image\". \"[These countries] know that sanctioning countries are willing to accept this. This is a loophole. It's entirely legal. Everyone's aware of it, but nobody is doing much to actually tackle it in a big way,\" says Vaibhav Raghunandan, an analyst at CREA. Campaigners and experts argue that Western governments have the tools and means available to stem the flow of oil and gas revenue into the Kremlin's coffers. According to former Russian deputy energy minister Vladimir Milov, who is now a diehard opponent of Vladimir Putin, sanctions imposed on trade in Russian hydrocarbons should be better enforced - particularly the oil price cap adopted by the G7 group of nations, which Mr Milov says \"is not working\". He is fearful, though, that the US government shake-up launched by President Donald Trump will hamper agencies such as the US Treasury or the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which are key for sanctions enforcement. Another avenue is continued pressure on Russia's \"shadow fleet\" of tankers involved in dodging the sanctions. \"That is a complex surgery operation. You need to periodically release batches of new sanctioned vessels, shell companies, traders, insurers etc. every several weeks,\" Mr Milov says. According to him, this is an area where Western governments have been much more effective, particularly withthe introduction of new sanctionsby Joe Biden's outgoing administration in January 2025. Mai says that banning Russian LNG exports to Europe and closing the refining loophole in Western jurisdictions would be \"important steps in finishing the decoupling of the West from Russian hydrocarbons\". According to Mr Raghunandan from CREA, it would be relatively easy for the EU to give up Russian LNG imports. \"Fifty percent of their LNG exports are directed towards the European Union, and only 5% of the EU's total [LNG] gas consumption in 2024 was from Russia. So if the EU decides to completely cut off Russian gas, it's going to hurt Russia way more then it's going to hurt consumers in the European Union,\" he told the BBC. Experts interviewed by the BBC have dismissedDonald Trump's ideathat the war with Ukraine will end if Opec brings oil prices down. \"People in Moscow are laughing at this idea, because the party which will suffer the most… is the American shale oil industry, the least cost-competitive oil industry in the world,\" Mr Milov told the BBC. Mr Raghunandan says that Russia's cost of producing crude is also lower than in Opec countries like Saudi Arabia, so they would be hurt by lower oil prices before Russia. \"There is no way that Saudi Arabia is going to agree to that. This has been tried before. This has led to conflict between Saudi Arabia and the US,\" he says. Ms Rosner says there are both moral and practical issues with the West buying Russian hydrocarbons while supporting Ukraine. \"We now have a situation in which we are funding the aggressor in a war that we're condemning and also funding the resistance to the war,\" she says. \"This dependence on fossil fuels means that we are really at the whims of energy markets, global energy producers and hostile dictators.\" Friedrich Merz said earlier there were \"no longer\" any range restrictions on weapons supplied by Kyiv's Western allies. The BBC reports from Donetsk where swarms of fibre optic drones give Russia the edge as Ukraine defends towns behind the front line. Relations between war-torn Ukraine and its Nato neighbour Hungary plummet to a new low. The advance may be linked to Moscow's attempts to create \"buffer zones\" along the border, Ukrainian regional authorities say. Trump said that Vladimir Putin had gone \"absolutely crazy\" following massive aerial attacks on Ukraine.",

    "title": "Robert Jenrick hopes video of Tube confrontation will shame fare dodgers",
    "article_text": "Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick has said he hopes his video confronting fare evaders on the London Underground will \"shame people into action\". Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley, Jenrick said activities such as fare dodging along with graffiti and playing music on public transport were \"chipping away at society\". Asked if his party's policy of austerity was a contributing factor, Jenrick said he believed in being \"honest about the mistakes of the last Conservative government\". Responding to Jenrick's video, Transport for London (TfL) said fare evasion was \"unacceptable\" and that it was expanding its team of investigators to \"target the most prolific fare evaders\". In the video,which has had more than 3.5 million views on the social media platform X, Jenrick is seen at Stratford station in east London challenging a number of people squeezing through barriers in an apparent effort to avoid paying the fare. Along with the video, he posted a message reading: \"Sadiq Khan is driving a proud city into the ground. Lawbreaking is out of control. He's not acting. So, I did.\" Explaining his reasons for making the video, Jenrick said he was \"sick to death of people fare dodging\" and felt he needed to \"highlight the issue\". \"It's about the authorities - in this instance Tfl or the police - not stepping up and not enforcing the rules,\" he said. \"It makes most people feel silly, feel foolish. Why are they paying for their fares on the Tube when others aren't doing so.\" Asked if he had sought permission from TfL to make a video on their premises, he replied \"I didn't know that was their rule\", adding: \"They should be going after people breaking the law, not the rules.\" TfL said it aimed to reduce the rate of evasion, which costs the organisation more than £100m a year, to 1.5% by 2030. Last month, it reported that the evasion rate for 2024/25 was averaging 3.4%, down from 3.8% in the previous year. TfL also pointed to statistics suggesting levels of fare evasion in New York stood at 13%. Announcing a new fare evasion strategy earlier this month,TfL said it was using data and CCTV to analyse travel patterns to focus on \"those who evade fares repeatedly\". In the press release, TfL said it continued to \"tackle blatant fare evasion such as gate-pushing\" which it said created \"an intimidating atmosphere for staff and customers\". It added: \"TfL is increasing the number of accredited enforcement officers on its network who can refuse entry and remove people from stations, and deploying them to locations with high prevalence of people pushing through gates.\" The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association trade union said it had \"consistently called for properly trained and fully resourced personnel... to deal with fare evasion in a way that is effective, lawful and safe\". It added: \"Fare evasion is a serious issue but it must be tackled with professional trained enforcement, not MPs trying to score points or social media clout on their daily commute.\" Asked about the video, Treasury Minister Darren Jones told BBC Radio 4's PM the Conservatives had cut the number of police while Labour was trying to increase neighbourhood policing to \"deal with this type of anti-social behaviour\". \"If Robert Jenrick wants a job, we will be hiring some special constables,\" he added. In recent months Jenrick has made similar videos on litter-dropping and theft of trade tools, leading to suggestions he is running an ongoing campaign to be Conservative Party leader. Jenrick stood in the last leadership contest but came second to Kemi Badenoch. Asked if he still wanted to be Tory leader, he replied: \"No, absolutely not... I'm just trying to do my job.\" He said Badenoch would lead his party into the next election, adding that the Tory Party had \"been in tough spots before but has always bounced back\". Jenrick was recently seen having lunch with Rupert Lowe, an independent MP who was expelled from Reform UK earlier this year. Asked if he would like Lowe to join the Conservatives, Jenrick said: \"I want the Tory Party to be the natural home for any small-c conservatives in this country... \"Rupert is somebody who has taken strong lines on things like border control, like crime, on how we build a more integrated country.\" However, Jenrick said he had not asked Lowe to join the party and Lowe \"hasn't asked to\". \"Ultimately it's for him to decide what his future is and for Kemi, as leader of the party, to decide if he or anybody else is suitable to join us,\" he added.

    "title": "Banksy reveals lighthouse artwork - but keeps fans in dark about location",
    "article_text": "Banksy's latest piece of grafitti art has been revealed to the world - but where it was painted remains a mystery for now. Images posted on theelusive artist's Instagram depict a lighthouse stencilled on a drab, beige wall, along with the words: \"I want to be what you saw in me\". A false shadow appears to have been drawn on the pavement from a nearby bollard, giving the illusion that the lighthouse is itself a silhouette of the mundane street furniture. But unlike a lighthouse, the post gives little away as to the artwork's location. A second, wider shot showing two people walking their dogs offers little more. Geoguessers on social media have speculated that the street art may lurk in Marseille, in the south of France, while others debate how to interpret the work's meaning. Another image of the art circulating online shows a blurred person riding a scooter in front of the piece, with a graffiti tag seemingly reading \"Yaze\" further along the wall. The tag matches that used by a Canadian graffiti artist Marco The Polo, whose Instagram account features photos of his own work but who has called Banksy an inspiration. Banksy has kept his true identity a secret throughout his career, and it is only through the Instagram account that works are identified as genuine. Often imbuing his works with a political message, his previous pieces have alluded to immigration, the war in Ukraine and homelessness, among other things. The meaning of some of his works, though, is less clear - such as his motivation behindthe series of animals painted in various locations across Londonlast summer. Prior to the lighthouse, in December, Banksy posted another piece, depicting a Madonna and child with a fixture in the wall appearing like a bullet wound in her chest. The theme to this year's free festival is Manchester and Other Great Cities Around the World. The Black Sabbath street art is set to be completed in time for their concert at Villa Park in July. Painted on the side of a former bingo hall it features a white rose, an eagle and the town's crest. The unknown Isle of Wight artist has been dubbed \"Bogsy\" and is driving everybody potty. The artwork in a pedestrian tunnel near Hessle Foreshore depicts the land meeting the sea.",

    "title": "Andrew and Tristan Tate will return to UK to face charges, lawyers say",
    "article_text": "Andrew and Tristan Tate will return to the UK to face 21 criminal charges once proceedings against them in Romania have concluded, their lawyers have said. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said on Wednesday that it had authorised charges including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking against the brothers in 2024, before an extradition warrant was issued to bring them back from Romania. Authorities in Romania are investigating the two British-Americans in a separate case, in relation to a number of charges which they deny. In a statement on Thursday, lawyers for the Tates said that \"once those proceedings are concluded in their entirety then they will return to face UK allegations\". Previously, the brothers' legal representatives said that UK allegations dated back to between 2012 and 2015. At the time of an arrest warrant obtained by Bedfordshire Police in March 2024, the Tates said they \"categorically reject all charges\" and were \"very innocent men\". A Romanian court has already ruled that the brothers could be extradited to UK following the end of any trial there, for which there is no clear timescale currently, and theCPS said \"domestic criminal matters in Romania must be settled first\". The CPS said Andrew Tate, a 38-year-old influencer and former kickboxer, faces 10 charges connected to three alleged victims, including rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain. Tristan Tate, 36, faces 11 charges connected to one alleged victim, including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking. The CPS's charging decision came after it received a file of evidence from Bedfordshire Police. Responding to the allegations on the Tates' behalf, their solicitors said there had been a \"vast amount of misinformation in the media regarding the allegations faced by our clients\" and that they were being subject to \"a trial by media\". A statement added: \"Regardless of your views, it must be the case that everyone that is tried in England and Wales has the expectation of a fair trial.\" They added that \"UK prosecutors refuse to give even the most basic information to allow our clients to understand the allegations they face\". The BBC has been told the CPS believes it is fully complying with its role in accordance with disclosure obligations. In recent years, Andrew, a self-described misogynist, has built a massive online presence, including more than 10 million followers on X, sharing his lifestyle of fast cars, private jets, and yachts. The pair were both born in the US but moved to Luton in the UK with their mother after their parents divorced. Since first being arrested in Romania by the Romanian authorities in December 2022, with Andrew accused of rape and human trafficking and Tristan suspected of human trafficking, the pair have largely been under travel restrictions in the country. They then faced further allegations in Romania in August 2024 including sex with a minor and trafficking underage persons, all of which they deny. Earlier this year they unexpectedly had their travel ban lifted and visited Florida in the US, before returning to Romania less than a month later in March 2025. British authorities faced criticism for allegedly not requesting an extradition to the UK while they were in Florida, after authorities there said they would have approved it, but the BBC understands that this was to avoid subverting the UK-Romania arrangement. Given the complexity of the proceedings in Romania, their return to the UK is unlikely to be soon.",

    "title": "Why Succession creator Jesse Armstrong is writing about rich people again",
    "article_text": "Jesse Armstrong, one of the UK's most successful screenwriters, is not one to rest on his laurels. Hot off the back of his hit showSuccession, which followed the twists and turns in the lives of media mogul Logan Roy, played by Brian Cox, and his four children, Armstrong is back with his first feature-length film,Mountainhead. It's a satire film about a group of four tech billionaire friends who go away to a mountain resort for the weekend but find themselves and their social media companies under scrutiny as social unrest spreads across the globe. Speaking at the Hay Festival, Armstrong says: \"People start by saying, 'Why are you doing these rich people again? And it's a fair question. They're tech billionaires. Succession was about a big media family. And I think it's because I'm interested in power, I don't think it's about just wealth. \"Succession was very clearly about why is the world like it is, who has power?\" HBO's Mountainhead, starring Steve Carrell and Ramy Youssef, was made very quickly. \"We did it at great speed. I pitched it in December and wrote it in January... carried on re-writing it through pre-production and then shot it in 22 days, then edited it. \"We only finished (editing) about a week ago and it's on TV this weekend!\" Armstrong, 54, wanted to do a quick turnaround on the film to try to capture the feeling  and pace of technological developments and society's fear about keeping up. \"The anxieties that we have about technology, especially AI, feel very present and move quite fast. And I wanted to try and write it in the same mood as you might be when you're watching it, so I was keen to do it quickly,\" he says. \"Another attraction for me was that I've never directed anything before and it made me feel less anxious to run at it and do it really, really quickly.\" Armstrong, who cut his teeth in children's TV before writing for shows such as The Thick of It and going on to co-create series like Peep Show and Fresh Meat, said the inspiration for Mountainhead came from listening to podcasts. \"I wrotea book review about Sam-Bankman-Fried, the crypto fraudster, and then I read more and more about tech, and I started listening to podcasts of senior tech figures, from Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman, but also the mid-level people and even lower level - it's an ecosphere. \"I couldn't stop thinking about the voice of these people. I do love getting the vocabulary right. For me, that opens the door, once I can hear them talking. And since it seems like the AI companies are scraping so much of our hard work to train their models, I thought I would scrape them back [using their podcasts]!\" Armstrong told the Hay audience that while he knew his job was to engage viewers, writing the film \"was a way of expressing a load of feelings about that world and about those men - they're almost all men in that world  - and it's cathartic\". His shows are known for their dark humour and Armstrong says if he had to write his job description in his passport application, he would put down \"comedy writer\", adding that he doesn't think of himself as a storyteller. \"I'm trying to make a story engaging that will probably involve people laughing. And the bit that I find most challenging is finding a story because people remember jokes, but you just won't make it through that half hour or hour unless that story is is compelling enough to make an audience follow along.\" Many writers and showrunners end up directing episodes of the series that they have created but Armstrong says he couldn't do that on Succession, which won multiple awards including 14 primetime Emmys. \"I always felt like the people who did it were so good at it that it was rather rude of me to suggest I could just come in and do it just as well.\" Armstrong doesn't appear to be your stereotypical confident showrunner, coming across as quite shy and humble, despite his success. \"Sometimes very creative people have a real 'screw you' attitude to authority, and I don't have that. Maybe I'm a bit more fearful, a bit more amenable. I like everyone to be happy. I want to to give people what they want in quite a decent and humane way. \"I don't have a confrontational attitude to people I work with, unless someone's a jerk -  I hope I can stand up for myself and the work.\" Mountainhead is released on HBO and Max on 31 May",

    "title": "Draper edges past Monfils in late-night French Open thriller",
    "article_text": "Jack Draper had not won a French Open match until this year's tournament Jack Draper ensured there will be three British men in the French Open third round for the first time since 1968 by seeing off home favourite Gael Monfils in a memorable late-night thriller. With the Parisian crowd willing on 38-year-old Monfils, fifth seed Draper stayed focused and regrouped to win 6-3 4-6 6-3 7-5 on Court Philippe Chatrier. Former world number six Monfils threatened to force a decider in an absorbing contest - full of high-quality rallies and entertainment - but could not serve out at 5-3 or take two set points at 5-4. Draper, 23, maintained his composure superbly to record the finest Roland Garros win of his fledgling career. \"My brain was fried out here,\" Draper said afterwards. \"I'm not sure if I am going to go to sleep tonight because my brain is just all over the place with what [Gael] was doing out here. \"That's why he has had such a successful career and is loved by all the fans. The players love to watch him play as well but not to play against him.\" Draper beats Monfils in four thrilling sets to reach French Open third round - reaction Boulter loses to end British interest in women's singles Fearnley's startling rise doing justice to Murray legacy The British number one, who plays Brazilian teenage sensation Joao Fonseca next,  moved into the last 32 alongside Jacob Fearnley and Cameron Norrie, who play each other in an all-British meeting. Fearnley, 23, progressed when his French opponent Ugo Humbert retired following a nasty fall. Fearnley, who replaced Norrie as the British number two earlier this year, was leading 6-3 4-4 when 22nd seed Humbert quit. Norrie, 29, booked his place earlier on Thursdaywith a 7-6 (9-7) 6-2 6-1 winover Argentine qualifier Federico Gomez. It will be the first time in the Open era - which started in 1968 when professionalism was ushered in - that two British players have met beyond the first round in Paris. Over the past year, Draper has developed into a leading player with genuine ambitions of landing the biggest prizes in the sport. The way the Englishman overcame Monfils was another example of his growing maturity. After two chastening previous experiences on the Paris clay, Draper has returned with a point to prove. Patience was required as he battled from a set down against Italian opponent Mattia Bellucci on Tuesday to earn his first career win at Roland Garros. It was a similar theme against the popular Monfils, who can whip up the crowd with his talented shot-making and infectious character. The French fans have a reputation for being boisterous and, with one of their favourite sons playing in the twilight of his career, created an energetic atmosphere which Draper had to block out. Crucially, he remained calm for the majority of the entertaining contest. Despite having his errors enthusiastically cheered, with spectators implored to stop shouting out, Draper stayed locked in to retake the lead after Monfils levelled. Signs of agitation did show in the fourth set, though. Draper shared a warm embrace with Monfils at the net after completing victory An outburst towards his box released some tension - and drew whistles from the home fans - but could not prevent Draper from losing serve for 4-2. After not converting five break-back points in a 13-minute seventh game, Draper took his chance in the ninth - but the drama continued as Monfils had two set points in the 10th. Draper, though, is a different beast these days. Having won three consecutive five-setters at the Australian Open in January, he proved again that he can come through moments of adversity deep into Grand Slam matches - even though he avoided a decider this time. Draper managed to keep playing with clarity of mind, winning the final five games of the match and sealing a three-hour victory at 11:44pm local time. \"There were times where I was very frustrated but I reminded myself that this is why I put in the hard work to play on courts like this,\" said Draper. \"It is something I enjoyed while I was playing even though it didn't look like it.\" Sinner and Djokovic win on day of upsets and drama Second seed Gauff through to Paris third round 'It can't look like a circus' - Munar on crowd For Edinburgh's Fearnley, becoming British number two earlier this year was another notable landmark. Having graduated from university in the United States last April, Fearnley was ranked outside of the world's top 500 just 12 months ago. Since then he has made one of the fastest climbs in ATP Tour history and broke new ground at the Grand Slam tournaments. The eye-catching draws continued when he was paired against Swiss former champion Stan Wawrinka last week at Roland Garros. The manner in which he quietened the pro-Wawrinka crowd in an efficient victory stood him in good stead for facing Humbert. Fearnley, whose background in the trash-talking US college game helps ensure he does not get fazed, sapped some energy from the home fans in a confident start. He did trail by a break in the second set, but ultimately progressed in the way which no player wishes to win. Humbert tumbled as he stretched for a return at 40-40 in the eighth game and clutched his right leg. After receiving treatment, he tried to continue wearing heavy strapping and lost serve before deciding it would not be sensible to carry on. Humbert was aiming to reach the third round of the French Open for the first time As a result, Fearnley - now 55th in the world - moved into the last 32 on his French Open debut. Now he will switch his attention to Norrie, who also learned his craft playing for Texas Christian University. Norrie has slipped to 81st in the rankings, but has rediscovered his form on clay and earned one of the most satisfying wins of his career when he beat former world number one Daniil Medvedev at Roland Garros earlier this week. Facing 114th-ranked Gomez in a match he was expected to win presented a different challenge. \"I had to get up for this match - I was the favourite to win it,\" Norrie told BBC Sport. \"I was able to bring a 6/7 out of 10 performance, I was happy with that.\" 'Mozart of tennis' Gasquet bows out in Paris Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Fraudster made £550,000 selling fake 'Scottish-grown tea'",
    "article_text": "A fraudster who tricked luxury hotels and stores into buying \"Scottish-grown tea\" that was grown abroad has been found guilty of a £550,000 scam. Thomas Robinson supplied high-end customers such as Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel and the Dorchester in London with varieties with names like Dalreoch White, Highland Green, Silver Needles and Scottish Antlers Tea. Trading as The Wee Tea Plantation, he claimed they had been grown on farmland in Perthshire. Instead, the tea had been imported, repackaged and then resold at hugely-inflated prices, Falkirk Sheriff Court was told. Robinson also defrauded genuine aspiring Scottish tea growers by selling them plants he claimed were grown in Scotland. The 55-year-old, who is also known as Thomas O'Brien or Tam O' Braan, rented a former sheep farm near Loch Tay and began spinning \"elaborate lies\" to customers. Prosecutors said he created the \"CV of a fantasist\"  - claiming among other things that he was a multi-millionaire, a polymer scientist, a former bomb disposal expert and had invented the \"bag for life\". He also claimed to have developed a \"special biodegradable polymer\" that would make the tea plants grow in half the usual time. The court was told it looked like a black bin liner. Robinson's false claim that \"our Scottish grown teas come from gardens in our farming heartland in Perthshire and Dumfries and Galloway\" was reprinted on the Balmoral Hotel's Palm Court luxury tea menu. He boasted that tea he had supplied to London's Dorchester Hotel was \"the Queen's favourite\". The media was also taken in with numerous stories appearing, including on theBBC News websiteand in a BBC podcast. The court heard that in reality Robinson had bought over a tonne of tea grown abroad and had it delivered to mailbox address in Glasgow, using a different company name to cover his tracks. One expert said a kilo of top tea from Africa could be sold for 100 times its cost if passed off as Scottish. Robinson claimed his tea plants had been grown from cuttings and seeds  at Dalreoch Farm, at Amulree in Perthshire. When a buyer from the prestigious food store Fortnum and Mason's wanted to visit he hurriedly bought in plants from a nursery in Sussex and put them on show. Between 2015 and 2016 he conned a dozen genuine tea growers in Scotland and one from Jersey by supplying them with 22,000 plants at £12.50 each. The court heard he had actually imported them from a horticulturist in Italy at three Euros each. Many of these plants died or failed to thrive. One grower from Dumfries and Galloway was told he could expect to harvest his first tea after a year and enjoy a yield of 100kg of top tea as well as 450kg of secondary leaf for blends. After battling for seven years, the grower was only able to harvest 100g of finished tea. The scam began to unravel in 2017 after Perth and Kinross Council started to check if he had a food processing licence. Eventually the food crime unit at Food Standards Scotland was called in and an investigation launched, headed up by a retired police inspector. Robinson denied the charges and claimed paperwork that would have proved his innocence had been destroyed in a flood. He said he was proud of his work and told the jurors: \"I wanted to leave something that would stand in the history of tea.\" After a three-week trial jurors took six hours to find him guilty of defrauding tea growers, hotels and tea companies  of nearly £553,000 in total. He will be sentenced at a later date, and also faces proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Mark Killick, from Somerset, has gone on trial accused of stealing more than £2m from 46 victims. Police arrest 18 people believed to be behind sophisticated fraud scams across London, the Met says. Two young men were said to have impersonated St Barnabas workers and asked people to set up direct debits. The former Miss Grand International winner had heavily touted the gummies on social media. The pair also find fake firms and accounts are being set up in their name.",

The Daily Express describes Mr Doyle as a\"businessman and a father of three\". The Sun, like other papers, highlights his background asa former Royal Marine.

According to the Guardian, Badenoch is safe for now, despite grassroots disquiet. The paper also warnsagainst writing off the Tories, given the party's ability to re-invent itself.

    "title": "Students or spies? The young Chinese caught in Trump's crosshairs",
    "article_text": "Xiao Chen turned up at the US Consulate in Shanghai on Thursday morning, hours after Washington announced that it would\"aggressively\" revoke the visas of Chinese students. The 22-year-old had a visa appointment: she was headed to Michigan in the autumn to study communications. After a \"pleasant\" conversation, she was told her application had been rejected. She was not given a reason. \"I feel like a drifting duckweed tossed in wind and storm,\" she said, using a common Chinese expression used to describe feeling both uncertain and helpless. She had been hopeful because she already had the acceptance letter. And she thought she had narrowly escaped the bombshells in recent days. First, Donald Trump's administration moved to endHarvard University's ability to enrol international students, a move that has since been blocked in court. And then it said it hadstoppedvisa appointmentsfor all foreign students. But now, Chen is ready for plan B. \"If I can't get the visa eventually, I'll probably take a gap year. Then I'll wait to see if things will get better next year.\" A valid visa may still not be enough, she adds, because students with visas could be \"stopped at the airport and deported\". \"It's bad for every Chinese student. The only difference is how bad.\" It has been a bleak week for international students in the US - and perhaps even harder for the 280,000 or so Chinese students who would have noticed that their country has been singled out. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of \"co-ordinating with the Chinese Communist Party\". Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the move against Chinese students in the US would include \"those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields\". That could hit a wide swathe of them given membership of the Communist Party is common among officials, entrepreneurs, business people and even artists and celebrities in China. Beijing has called it a \"politically motivated and discriminatory action\", and its foreign ministry has lodged a formal protest. There was a time when China sent the highest number of foreign students to American campuses. But those numbers slipped as the relationship between the two countries soured. A more powerful and increasingly assertive Beijing is now clashing with Washington for supremacy in just about everything, from trade to tech. Trump's first term had already spelled trouble for Chinese students. He signed an order in 2020 barring Chinese students and researchers with ties to Beijing's military from obtaining US visas. That order remained in place during President Joe Biden's term. Washington never clarified what constitutes  \"ties\" to the military, so many students had theirvisas revokedor were turned away at US borders, sometimes without a proper explanation. One of them, who did not wish to be named, said his visa was cancelled by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) when he landed in Boston in August 2023. He had been accepted into a post-doctoral program at Harvard University. He was going to study regenerative medicine with a focus on breast cancer, and had done his master's degree from a military-affiliated research institution in China. He said he was not a member of the Communist Party and his research had nothing to do with the military. \"They asked me what the relationship was between my research and China's defence affairs,\" he told the BBC then. \"I said, how could breast cancer have anything to do with national defence? If you know, please tell me.\" He believes he never stood a chance because the officials had already made up their minds. He recalled one of them asking: \"Did Xi Jinping buy your suitcase for you?\" What was surprising, or even shocking then, slowly turned normal as more and more Chinese students struggled to secure visas or admissions to study science and technology in US universities. Mr Cao, a psychology major whose research involves neuroscience, has spent the past school year applying for PhD programs in the US. He had graduated from top-tier universities - credentials that could send him to an Ivy League school. But of the more than 10 universities he applied to, only one extended an offer. Trump's cuts to biomedical research didn't help, but the mistrust surrounding Chinese researchers was also a factor. Allegations and rumours of espionage, especially in sensitive subjects, have loomed over Chinese nationals at US universities in recent years, even derailing some careers. \"One of the professors even told me, 'We rarely give offers to Chinese students these days, so I cannot give you an interview,\" Mr Cao told the BBC in February. \"I feel like I am just a grain of sand under the wheel of time. There is nothing I can do.\" For those who did graduate from US colleges, returning home to China has not been easy either. They used to be lauded as a bridge to the rest of the world. Now, they find that their once-coveted degrees don't draw the same reaction. Chen Jian, who did not want to use his real name, said he quickly realised that his undergraduate degree from a US college had become an obstacle. When he first came back in 2020, he interned at a state-owned bank and asked a supervisor if there was a chance to stay on. The supervisor didn't say it outright, but Chen got the message: \"Employees should have local degrees. People like me (with overseas degrees) won't even get a response.\" He later realised that \"there really weren't any colleagues with overseas undergraduate background in the department\". He went back to the US and did his master's at Johns Hopkins University, and now works at Chinese tech giant Baidu. But despite the degree from a prestigious American university, Mr Chen does not feel he has an edge because of the stiff competition from graduates in China. What also has not helped is the suspicion around foreign graduates. Beijing has ramped up warnings of foreign spies, telling civilians to be on the lookout for suspicious figures. In April, prominent Chinese businesswoman Dong Mingzhu told shareholders in a closed-door meeting that her company, home appliance maker Gree Electric, will \"never\" recruit Chinese people educated overseas \"because among them are spies\". \"I don't know who is and who isn't,\" Ms Dong said, in comments that were leaked and went viral online. Days later, the CIA released promotional videos encouraging Chinese officials dissatisfied with the government to become spies and provide classified information. \"Your destiny is in your own hands,\" the video said. The suspicion of foreigners as the US and China pull further away from each other is  a surprising turn for many Chinese people who remember growing up in a very different country. Zhang Ni, who also did not want to use her real name, says she was \"very shocked\" by Ms Dong's remarks. The 24-year-old is a recent journalism graduate from Columbia University in New York. She says she \"doesn't care about working at Gree\", but what surprised her was the shift in attitudes. That so many Chinese companies \"don't like anything that might be associated with the international\" is a huge contrast from what Ms Zhang grew up with - a childhood \"filled with [conversations centred on] the Olympics and World Expo\". \"Whenever we saw foreigners, my mom would push me to go talk to them to practice my English,\" she says. That willingness to exchange ideas and learn from the outside world appears to be waning in China, according to many. And America, once a place that drew so many young Chinese people, is no longer that welcoming. Looking back, Ms Zhang can't help but recall a joke her friend made at a farewell dinner before she left for the US. Then a flippant comment, it now sums up the fear in both Washington and Beijing: \"Don't become a spy.\" Additional reporting by Kelly Ng The BBC's Nomia Iqbal meets foreign Jewish students at Harvard left scared and uncertain after Trump's threats against the university.

    "title": "Security breaks down in Gaza as desperate people search for food",
    "article_text": "There is a state of chaos, a breakdown of security, and looting in north Gaza's main city, where Palestinians are desperately searching for food and where aid is difficult to access. The Hamas-run interior ministry said seven of its police officers deployed to a market in Gaza City on Thursday were killed by an Israeli air strike as they attempted to restore order and confront what it called \"looters\". The Israeli military has not commented on the incident, but it did say it had struck \"dozens of terror targets\" throughout Gaza over the past day. Local medics and rescuers said at least 44 people were killed across the territory on Thursday, including 23 at the central Bureij refugee camp. It comes a day after the UN's World Food programme (WFP) said at least two people were shot dead as what it described as \"hordes of hungry people\" broke into its warehouse in the central town of Deir al-Balah in search of food after 11 weeks of a total Israeli blockade. It was not clear who opened fire. Almost 50 people were also reportedly shot and injured when thousands overran a new aid distribution centre run by the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in the southern city of Rafah on Tuesday, according to a senior UN official in Gaza. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots into the air but not at the crowds. On Thursday, interior ministry police officers armed with Kalashnikov-style rifles and handguns went to a market near Gaza City's central al-Saraya junction, which houses a number of small stalls selling canned food and vegetables. Videos circulating on social media, too graphic to share, show bodies, blood, and scattered remains lying on the ground following what the ministry said was an Israeli attack. \"Israeli occupation aircraft targeted a number of police officers... while they were performing their duty in confronting a group of looters earlier today, leading to the martyrdom of several officers and civilians in yet another massacre,\" a statement said. The BBC requested comment from the Israeli military. It did not address the incident directly in its reply, saying that it was not provided with the \"relevant coordinates and the specific time\". It added that the IDF \"follows international law and takes precautions to mitigate civilian harm\". There has been increased lawlessness in Gaza since Israel began targeting the Gaza interior ministry's police officers last year, citing their role in Hamas governance. After the territory's police chief and his deputy were killed in a strike in January, the ministry insisted the force was a \"civilian protection agency\". The Israeli military accused the force of \"violating human rights and suppressing dissent\". There were reports of a breakdown of order elsewhere in Gaza on Thursday, as desperate people searched for food and other supplies. One witness who had gone to a GHF aid distribution centre near Rafah told the BBC that thousands of people had gathered in the area from dawn, and that they ended up breaking through the site's gate to try to obtain supplies. At 08:00 local time, the witness said, the Israeli military issued a warning via a quadcopter drone instructing people to head to the distribution centre, and that they began moving in an orderly way towards the area. \"For exactly 10 minutes, things were organised but then the crowd broke through the gate and rushed into the courtyard.\" \"People grabbed boxes and sacks of flour and left, all under the surveillance of the Israeli quadcopter,\" they added. Footage from near the GHF site shows thousands of Palestinians walking near the centre on Thursday morning. Some are in horse-drawn carts, while others wheel bicycles covered with goods. Young men, for the most part, can be seen carrying sacks of flour on their heads and backs. One exhausted woman appears to struggle to walk among the crowd. Abu Fawzi Faroukh, a 60-year-old Palestinian man who was at the site on Thursday morning, told AFP news agency that aid supplies were more difficult for the elderly and vulnerable to obtain. \"The young men are the ones who have received aid first, yesterday and today, because they are young and can carry loads. But the old people and women cannot enter due to the crowding.\" \"We have been humiliated, the Palestinian people are humiliated,\" he added. People described similar scenes at the newly opened GHF distribution site in central Gaza, with a number telling the BBC they had come away empty-handed. Umm Mohammed Abu Hajar said she had heard there was aid being distributed in the area, so took her ID and went to see what she could get. \"I found all the people hungry,\" she said. \"So, I couldn't get anything. I left like this... empty-handed.\" She said more organisation was needed in order to distribute aid \"fairly\", adding that currently, \"some people eat and some people don't\". Another man, Hani Abed, who was at the same distribution centre, said he'd failed to get any aid for him and his 10 family members. \"I came empty-handed and I left empty-handed,\" he said. \"I will take dirt for my children to eat.\" The GHF said approximately 17,280 food boxes, containing the equivalent of 997,920 meals, were handed out to Gazans at its three operational distribution sites on Thursday. \"Operations will continue scaling, with plans to build additional sites across Gaza, including in the northern region, in the weeks ahead,\" it added. It also rejected the reports of Palestinians being shot at while trying to obtain aid at its centres. \"No shots have ever been fired,\" it said. The GHF's new aid system bypasses the UN and requires Palestinians to collect food parcels fromdistribution sites protected by US security contractors in areas controlled by the Israeli military in southern and central Gaza. The UN has refused to co-operate with the system, saying it is unethical and workable. The head of the UN's humanitarian office in Gaza, Jonathan Whittall, said on Wednesday that GHF could not possibly meet the needs of the 2.1 million population and was \"essentially engineering scarcity\". The US and Israeli governments have said the new system is preventing aid from being stolen by Hamas, which the armed group denies doing. Israel imposed a total blockade on humanitarian aid and commercial supplies to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. It said the steps put pressure on the armed group to release the 58 hostages still held in Gaza, at least 20 of whom are believed to be alive. On 19 May, the Israeli military launched an expanded offensive that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said would \"take control of all areas\" of Gaza. The following day, he said Israel would also temporarily ease the blockade and allow a \"basic\" amount of food in. The families of the remaining hostages have urged Netanyahu to agree a new ceasefire with Hamas to secure their release. On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Israeli government \"supported\" a new ceasefire proposal that was sent to Hamas by US special envoy Steve Witkoff. \"Israel signed off on this proposal before it was sent to Hamas,\" she said. However, a senior Hamas official later told the BBC that the group rejected the proposal because it contradicted the discussions that it had with Witkoff. The official said it did not include guarantees that the temporary ceasefire would lead to a permanent end to the fighting or that Israeli troops would withdraw to the positions they held before 2 March. Israeli and US media cited Israeli officials as saying Witkoff's proposal included releasing 10 living hostages and the remains of dead hostages in two phases in exchange for a 60-day ceasefire and the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response Hamas' cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,249 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 3,986 since Israel resumed its offensive, according to the territory's health ministry. The biggest such move in years is condemned by the Palestinian presidency as a \"dangerous escalation\". Mohammed Sinwar was the target of a Israeli strike on the courtyard of the European hospital in Khan Younis on 13 May. The Israeli military says troops fired warning shots into the air but not at Palestinians during Tuesday's incident in Rafah. Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, says the bloc also does not support a new aid distribution model which bypasses the UN and other humanitarian organisations. Their letter warns of genocide in Gaza, and calls on the UK to take concrete actions to meet its international legal obligations.",

    "title": "Sean 'Diddy' Combs raped and attacked ex-assistant, she tells court",
    "article_text": "A former assistant of rap mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has told a New York court that he repeatedly sexually assaulted her while she was employed by him for eight years. The witness - who testified anonymously under the pseudonym \"Mia\" - also tearfully said she lived in fear of violent rages from Mr Combs as she worked by his side. The hip-hop mogul watched from the defence table with arms folded in his lap as she testified about her fears of retribution for reporting his alleged abuse. Mr Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. Warning: This story contains details some readers may find distressing \"I couldn't tell him no about a sandwich,\" she said. \"I couldn't tell him no about anything.\" Mr Combs' legal team has not yet had the chance to question Mia, or respond to her claims. She is the second witness in the New York trial to allege that Mr Combs sexually abused her, along with Mr Combs' ex-girlfriend, Casandra Ventura. Mia testified that she started working for Mr Combs as a personal assistant in 2009 when she was in her mid-20s, joining what she described as a \"chaotic\" and \"toxic\" work environment. \"The highs were really high and the lows were really, really low,\" she told the court on Thursday. The job required her being \"always within eyesight\" of Mr Combs, she testified, and \"anticipating his needs, whims and moods\". She said she was often required to stay at his homes, where she could not lock the door or leave without the rapper's permission. During her time working for Mr Combs, he was frequently violent towards her, Mia testified. On one occasion, she said he threw a spaghetti bowl at her, which narrowly missed her head, Mia told the court. Another time, she said Mr Combs forcefully threw his computer at Mia's head when she told him the wifi nearby was still being fixed, she testified. She also testified about another situation when she witnessed Mr Combs being violent with his ex-girlfriend, Ms Ventura, who had became close friends with Mia during her time working for the rapper. Mia once went on holiday with the couple in the Turks and Caicos, she told the court. One late night on the trip, she said Ms Ventura ran into her room screaming that Mr Combs was \"going to kill me\", she testified. They ran away and hid on the beach, she said. Also on that holiday, Mia testified that she and Ms Ventura had used a paddle board to go into the water to escape Mr Combs, who was pacing back and forth on the beach. Before they knew it, the sky turned dark, portending a storm. \"I was trying to weigh if it was scarier to face mother nature, or go back to Puff [Mr Combs],\" Mia testified. Mia was also there one night in 2013 when she said that Mr Combs was banging on Ms Ventura's door in Los Angeles. She testified that he attacked her and cut open her eyebrow when throwing her on to the bed frame. Mia told the court that she tried to jump on Mr Combs' back, but he threw her against the wall. \"He's actually going to kill her,\" Mia said she remembered thinking to herself. Mia told the court that despite witnessing Mr Combs's abuse toward Ms Ventura, she did not report him because she \"believed that Puff's authority was above the police\". She testified about multiple instances where she alleged Mr Combs sexually assaulted her, including one time when she said she woke up to him trying to rape her. Mia told the court that the assaults began early in her career working for Mr Combs, including one night on his 40th birthday at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. She said he gave her two vodka shots that hit her \"very hard\" and kissed her and put his hand up her dress. Another night, between the years of 2009-10, while Mia was sleeping in a bunk bed at Mr Combs' Los Angeles home, she said she woke up to the \"weight\" of Mr Combs on top of her. She was confused, she said, and Mr Combs began to rape her. \"I just froze,\" she said. \"It was very quick but it felt like forever.\" Mia told the court that Mr Combs sexually assaulted her \"sporadically\" throughout her time working for the rapper. But she told the court she didn't always remember the details, only a \"dark feeling in my stomach\". Pressed by a prosecutor on why she did not say \"no\" when Mr Combs assaulted her or go to the police, Mia told the court she feared what he would do. \"I knew his power,\" she said. \"I knew his control over me and I didn't want to lose everything I worked so hard for.\" She told the court that another assistant had been fired for reporting Mr Combs' violence toward Ms Ventura. Mr Combs also threatened to tell Ms Ventura, Mia's close friend, about the sexual encounters between them, she testified. After the alleged assaults, Mia told the court that she tried her best to pretend the \"most shameful thing\" of her life never happened. Asked by prosecutors why she was telling her story in court, she replied: \"I had to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\" Mia will continue to testify on Friday and Mr Combs' defence team will be able to question her on the stand.

    "title": "Farage would crash economy like Truss, says Starmer",
    "article_text": "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said Reform UK's policies would \"crash the economy\", comparing Nigel Farage to former PM Liz Truss. In a speech attacking the Reform leader, Sir Keir accused him of \"fantasy\" economics and promising unfunded tax cuts. Reform made big gains in the English local elections earlier this month, cementing it as a prime challenger to Britain's traditional main parties. A spokesperson for Reform dismissed the prime minister's comments as a \"desperate attack\" from a party \"behind in the polls\". Sir Keir's speech at a business in the north-west of England came after Farage set out a number of policy pledges on Tuesday. \"In opposition we said [Liz Truss] would crash the economy and leave you to pick up the bill,\" the PM said. \"We were right. And we were elected to fix that mess. \"Now in government, we are once again fighting the same fantasy – this time from Farage.\" Labelling Farage as \"Liz Truss 2.0\", he said the Reform leader was making \"the exact same bet\" as the Conservative former PM, \"that you can spend tens of billions on tax cuts without a proper way of paying for it\". Sir Keir accused Farage of \"using your family finances, your mortgage, your bills as a gambling chip on his mad experiment\", adding: \"The result will be the same.\" Truss's mini-budget in 2022, which included £45bn of tax cuts funded by borrowing,  sparked turmoil on the financial markets and contributed to increased mortgage rates. The prime minister sought to contrast himself personally with Farage, who has claimed Reform is now \"the party of working people\". \"Unlike Nigel Farage, I know what it's like growing up in a cost-of-living crisis,\" he said. \"I know what it's like when your family can't pay the bills, when you fear the postman, the bills that may be brought, and I know how much work we have to do.\" Sir Keir's speech is further evidence that the prime minister now sees Farage as his principal political adversary, despite Reform only having five MPs. Asked why he was focusing so much on Reform, Sir Keir said the Conservative Party had \"run out of road\" and were \"sliding into the abyss\". He added: \"The choice at the moment is between the choice of a Labour government that thinks stable finances are at the heart of building better lives for working people, or Nigel Farage and Reform, who only this week said they would spend billions upon billions upon billions, tens of billions of pounds, in an unfunded way, which is an exact repeat of what Liz Truss did.\" In a speech on Tuesday, Faragepledged more generous tax breaks for married couplesand to restore winter fuel payments for all pensioners. He also said Reform would scrap the two-child benefit cap, which some Labour MPs have been calling for. The policy prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. Asked whether he would abolish the cap, Sir Keir said he was \"determined\" to reduce child poverty and a taskforce was looking at \"all options\". \"There isn't a single bullet, but I'm absolutely determined that we will drive [child poverty] down.\" Some economists have questioned how Reform would fund its policies, particularly a commitment to raise the threshold at which someone starts to pay income tax from £12,570 to £20,000. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank said the policy could cost between £50bn and £80bn a year – and that Reform had not spelled out how they would pay for this. \"Of course they don't have to do that yet – we're not at a general election,\" said IFS economist Stuart Adam. \"But at some point, if they're going to be a party of government, they would have to make those numbers add up.\" Reform has said its policies would be funded by scrapping net-zero climate measures, stopping hotel accommodation for asylum seekers, ending diversity and equality initiatives in the public sector, and cutting the number of quangos - bodies which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government. May's elections saw Reform make big gains at the expense of both Labour and the Conservatives – winning one by-election and two mayoral races, as well as gaining 677 new councillors. The party won most votes, most seats and overall control of most councils. Reform chairman Zia Yusuf said polls suggested that the public saw Reform as a \"viable alternative\" and Sir Keir was \"panicking\". \"We're always being told by the two old parties that there's no money left,\" he said. \"There's infinite money to give away our sovereign territory and to house illegal migrants at the taxpayers' expense, but when it comes to British pensioners there's no money left.\" Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said both Labour and Reform had a \"cavalier attitude to public finances\" and the Conservatives were \"the only party of fiscal responsibility, hardworking families and businesses\". Responding on social media to Sir Keir's criticism of her government, Truss said: \"Repeating lies is not going to fix the economy... \"Britain is headed for a real economic crisis - not the confected crisis that the establishment used to sabotage my policies.\" Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.

    "title": "Constance Marten's partner previously convicted of rape in US, retrial told",
    "article_text": "Mark Gordon was convicted of a series of sexual offences, including rape, which took place in Florida in 1989 when he was aged 14, a jury heard on Thursday. The details of his previous convictions were read to the jury at a retrial of separate charges at the Old Bailey in London. Gordon and his partner Constance Marten are standing trial on charges of the manslaughter by gross negligence of their newborn baby Victoria and of causing or allowing the death of a child. They both deny the charges. Victoria's decomposing body was found in a shopping bag in a shed in a Brighton allotment in March 2023. The jury were told of the details of Gordon's prior offences in the United States. On 29 April 1989, he broke into the house of a next door neighbour wearing a nylon stocking over his face, armed with a knife and hedge clippers, the court heard. He demanded that the woman inside the house undress and attempted to rape her, before orally raping her and committing other sexual assaults. Gordon then held her for four-and-a-half hours against her will. On 21 May of the same year, he broke into another property carrying a flat-headed shovel and beat a male occupant about the head with the shovel. He was sentenced in the US to 40 years in prison, of which he served 22 years. In questions to Det Sgt Ian Valentine, who was giving evidence about the convictions, Mark Gordon, who is now representing himself, suggested that he had been \"manipulated\" in his police interviews in Florida, saying he had been a 14-year-old child without adult supervision. Det Sgt Valentine said: \"I am not aware of the circumstances of the case. I am just aware of the outcome.\" The jury also heard that on three occasions Marten's family commissioned private investigators to conduct surveillance on the couple. A company called LSG was hired by Marten's mother, Virginie de Selliers, in 2016 to trace her daughter. LSG was successful and managed to take some photos of the couple. LSG was then hired by Marten's father, Napier Marten, to engineer a meeting in a café. Mrs de Selliers hired a second company, Blackstone Consultancy, in 2021 to investigate the couple's \"pattern of life\". The resulting investigation, dubbed \"Operation Lynx\", lasted two months, and more photographs were taken. The retrial will continue on Monday.",

    "title": "Loose Women's Nadia Sawalha brands ITV cuts 'brutal'",
    "article_text": "Loose Women panellist Nadia Sawalha has said ITV's cuts to its daytime schedule came \"out of the blue\" and have been \"absolutely brutal\" for those working on the show. ITVannounced last weekit was axing more than 220 jobs and making cuts to shows including Loose Women and Lorraine. Speaking on her YouTube channel, Sawalha said: \"What's been brutal, absolutely brutal, over the last week, honestly I feel tearful about it, is that hundreds of people... are going to be made redundant out of the blue, these are all the people behind the scenes that support us in every way.\" There have been reports that the pool of panellists will be reduced, and Sawalha said she \"could be let go tomorrow, [or] I could be let go in five years\". In an announcement last week, ITV boss Kevin Lygo stressed that daytime is \"a really important part\" of its programming, and said he recognised that the plans \"will have an impact on staff\". In her video, Sawalha, who has also appeared in EastEnders, Dancing on Ice and The Bill, said Loose Women and Lorraine had been \"highly successful\", but that she accepted inflation was \"insane, and cuts have to be made\", before becoming emotional. \"Behind the scenes there are people that are really suffering, and what you don't realise is when you attack the show you attack them, because you never see all the army of people behind the scenes and how hard they work,\" she said. \"So to all my friends and colleagues behind the scenes that have just got a huge shock out of the blue, I'm so sorry.\" She added that she thought some conversations about the cuts had been \"misogynistic\", stressing the impact of the cuts on many of her friends and colleagues on the show, who have worked there for decades. \"I can't tell you how upsetting it was to see people walking around numb with shock and fear about what they are going to do... [when] television is coming very slowly to its natural end.\" Speaking from her own perspective, she added: \"What people don't realise at Loose Women is that we're self-employed. I am self-employed. Every contract is a new contract. \"I could be let go tomorrow, I could be let go in five years, you don't know because we're not employees.\" Under the changes, Loose Women will be broadcast for 30 instead of 52 weeks. Lorraine Kelly's morning show will also be cut to 30 weeks, and will reduce from an hour to 30 minutes. While ITV did not comment on Sawalha's views, they referred to Lygo's comments about the cuts in last week's announcement. \"I recognise that our plans will have an impact on staff off-screen in our Daytime production teams, and we will work with ITV Studios and ITN as they manage these changes to produce the shows differently from next year, and support them through this transition,\" ITV's managing director of media and entertainment said. \"Daytime has been a core element of ITV's schedule for over 40 years and these changes will set ITV up to continue to bring viewers award winning news, views and discussion as we enter our eighth decade.\" During weeks when Lorraine is not on air, Good Morning Britain will extend by half an hour, from 06:00 BST to 10:00 BST. This Morning will stay in its slot on weekdays across the year. In February, ITV announced that soapsCoronation Street and Emmerdale would see their content cut by an hour a weekbetween them from next year. Earlier this month, ITV chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall said the company was making \"good progress\" on a cost-cutting drive, and that she expected to make £30m non-content savings during 2025. In the past few years, there has been a downturn in advertising revenue, part of a funding squeeze throughout the TV industry.

    "title": "Trial of Maradona's medical team collapses",
    "article_text": "The trial of Diego Maradona's medical staff has collapsed in Argentina after it was found that a judge involved in the case had taken part in a documentary about it. The judge in charge of the proceedings said the trial, which began on 11 March and was expected to last until July, would have to start again. Seven members of Maradona's medical team were charged with negligent homicide relating to the former footballer's death in 2020. They deny the allegations. One of the three presiding judges, Julieta Makintach, stepped down this week. Maradona, a former Napoli and Argentina midfielder, had been recovering at his home in Buenos Aires from brain surgery for a blood clot in November 2020 when he died of a heart attack, aged 60. Among the medical team on trial are a neurosurgeon, a doctor and a night nurse. They claim the retired footballer refused further treatment and should have stayed at home for longer after his operation. If convicted, they face between eight and 25 years in prison. Earlier this week, Prosecutor Patricio Ferrari accused Makintach ofbehaving \"like an actress and not a judge\"after she took part in a documentary about the case. As a trailer for the documentary series, called Divine Justice, was played in court, defence lawyer Rodolfo Baque shouted \"trash!\" at Makintach. Maradona's daughter Gianinna and his former partner Veronica Ojeda both cried after seeing the footage. It is a violation of court rules for unauthorised filming to take place and the documentary was being filmed without the permission of the court. Following criticism for taking part in the show, Makintach said she had \"no choice\" but to excuse herself from the case. The trial was then adjourned pending the decision on Thursday, which ultimately was to declare a mistrial. Since beginning, the trial had heard the testimony of almost 50 witnesses, including Maradona's daughters. The date for the new trial was not initially set and new judges were not nominated.

    "article_text": "Outraged Oasis fans who have spent hundreds of pounds for the band's homecoming gig in Manchester are complaining that they have to enter a ballot to get close to the stage at Heaton Park. An email to gig goers from Ticketmaster said the safety adviser for the shows has divided the concert area into two areas - general admission and a front standing zone - each with its own tickets. Fans have until Friday to opt-in to a ballot for tickets for the front area, prompting one fan to ask on X:\"Are they actively trying to ruin it?\" Ticketmaster has been contacted for a comment. The email to those who booked tickets said the two-tier viewing would \"ensure fan safety and improve the fan experience while entering the site\". Ticketmaster told its customers: \"If the number of opt-in requests exceeds availability tickets will be allocated at random from a pool of applicants.\" Fans posting on X were not impressed. \"Rather the chaos of Finsbury Park where my feet didn't touch the ground for half an hour in the crush than this Oasis front pit access ballot for Heaton Park, absolute nonsense,\" said@dumbsaints. Another fan,@Ste106956, said \"by paying a premium I will be fully expecting a wristband for the front\". In March, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the company may have misled fans by selling \"platinum\" tickets for almost 2.5 times the standard price, without explaining they came with no additional benefits.

    "title": "Not the coming man much longer - Bethell's arrival is due",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Explosive Bethell batting display steals the show for England There are a few reasons why Jacob Bethell might not have been playing for England in the first one-day international against West Indies at Edgbaston. First, and most obviously, the boy born in Barbados could have quite easily been in maroon instead of royal blue, in the away dressing room rather than on his home ground for Warwickshire. He might have remained at the rescheduled Indian Premier League (IPL), his Royal Challengers Bengaluru side marching to the final some 4,000 miles away in Chandigarh. Virat Kohli and all that. In a short international career, the 21-year-old has regularly made waves. Once again he showed why he is a cause of so much hype. Bethell's 82 from 53 balls does nothing to quieten the debate around his inclusion in the Test team. This was the left-hander's England comeback, a first home appearance since impressing in his debut Test series in New Zealand, a first international since a hamstring injury ruled him out of the Champions Trophy. It says much about Bethell's growing stature that he was so badly missed in such an awful campaign. England begin Brook era by hammering West Indies TMS podcast: Brook begins white ball captaincy with emphatic win RCB beat Kings to reach first IPL final since 2016 There was the kerfuffle over his non-availability for the Zimbabwe Test. Bethell was the only current member of the Test squad to play in the IPL, rather than turn up at Trent Bridge. There are some who argued he made the wrong choice, especially after new white-ball captain Harry Brook pulled out of his deal with Delhi Capitals. In Bethell's defence, he was picked up by Bengaluru before his Test debut and would surely have taken advice from England coach Brendon McCullum and Test skipper Ben Stokes, two men well-versed in the IPL. More broadly, there are howls of derision when England get thumped in a limited-overs tournament, or are clueless when it comes to batting against and bowling spin. There is a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka early next year. Bethell will have learned an immeasurable amount from sharing a dressing room with an all-time great like Kohli, playing under a coach like Andy Flower and opening the batting against Mitchell Starc, who called him \"an absolute gun\". Speaking to BBC Test Match Special, Bethell said: \"I was always going to be in the IPL after I signed that contract. I watched the boys do well from afar and really enjoyed it. \"Virat was great. He was happy to share lots of advice with me and Andy Flower was a great coach, too. I felt the energy when I went out to bat with Virat and that is something I will take into my game, that intensity.\" This video can not be played Brook era begins with dominant win over West Indies In Nottingham, Bethell was the story without being there. However Stokes chose to spin it, his \"put two and two together\" comments were ambiguous at best and clumsy at worst.The captain's bite back at the mediaprobably confirmed that Bethell will be in the squad for the first Test against India, but not the XI. At Edgbaston, Bethell was the headline act. The day could have been about new captain Brook or former skipper Jos Buttler. Bethell showed he is England's superstar-in-waiting. His innings was one of patience, poise and pizzazz. He might have been unsettled by a relatively slow start of 11 from 19 deliveries, or rattled by a clonk on the head from Alzarri Joseph. Instead he eased through the gears and looked nailed on for a first hundred in senior professional cricket before losing the strike towards the end of the England innings. When West Indies dropped short, Bethell snapped into swivel pulls, the ball disappearing into the stands. When the tourists then tried to hide the ball outside off stump, he surgically dissected the field with off-drives. There was the brutality of slaps down the ground and cheek of reverse-scoops. England have talked up Bethell's potential as a left-arm spinner and when Jamie Overton needed treatment on a finger injury, Bethell was called upon in the powerplay. He snared fellow protÃ©gÃ© Jewel Andrew, thanks to Brook's flying catch. This video can not be played Brook makes diving catch at extra cover to dismiss Andrew for eight Whatever Stokes said or meant to say at Trent Bridge, he ultimately confirmed the battle for a place in the Test side is between Bethell and Ollie Pope. England have plenty of justification for sticking with Pope. He has just made a century, is Stokes' vice-captain, has a good record at number three and has been willing to be versatile over the past 12 months. Bethell is a strong option to hold in reserve in case Pope or Zak Crawley struggle, England feel they don't need Shoaib Bashir as a frontline spinner or another injury hits Stokes. On the other hand, England under Stokes and McCullum have not shirked big selection decisions. Alex Lees, Jack Leach, James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow and Ben Foakes were all moved on when they might have had reason to think they had not done a great deal wrong. Further back, in the build-up the 2005 Ashes, perhaps the last time when a period of Test cricket felt so defining for an England team, they were faced with a decision between the late Graham Thorpe and Kevin Pietersen. Thorpe had just reached 100 Test caps and his form was solid. Captain Michael Vaughan went for the flair of the uncapped Pietersen. The rest is history. Perhaps it does not matter when England decide to pull the trigger on Bethell's Test inclusion. It will come sooner or later. \"He's a confident lad,\" said Brook. \"He knows he's a good player and we all know he's an exceptional player. He's going to have a very long England career if he keeps on batting the way he does. \"He brings so much to a side, he can bowl and field as well. To have a player like him in our side, for him to only be 21 and play the way he is, he's only going to go upwards if he keeps working hard on his game.\" Bethell will not be England's coming man for long. An arrival is due. This video can not be played Bethell hits six to take England to 300 Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "article_text": "Amad joined Manchester United from Atalanta in 2021 Manchester United winger Amad responded to supporters in Malaysia with an obscene gesture after being subject to \"serious personal abuse\", the club say. The Ivory Coast international was pictured putting his middle finger up to people outside the team's hotel in Kuala Lumpur on United's post-season tour. A video of the incident was widely shared on social media. United say the winger's gesture was in response to \"serious personal abuse\" about his mother. \"I have respect for people but not for the one who insults my mum,\" Amad wrote on X. \"I shouldn't have reacted like that but I don't regret what I did.\" The abuse, which occurred as United's players made their way towards the team coach, was not of a racist nature, according to the club. It had been suggested that the 22-year-old had taken exception to supporters shouting \"Diallo\" at him. The Ivorian was caught up in a trafficking case during his time at Atalanta, which saw him fined Â£42,000 by the Italian FA in 2021 after an investigation into allegations that false documents and fake parents were used to secure his entry into the country. After dropping Traore from his name, the player requested to be known simply as Amad. Unitedlost 1-0 to the ASEAN All-Starson Wednesday, with Amad appearing in the second half.

    "article_text": "This video can not be played Injury gave me time to grieve - Toone England midfielder Ella Toone said she didn't \"actually grieve\" after the death of her father until a period on the sidelines through injury forced her to get \"mentally right\". Nick Toone was diagnosed with prostate cancer the day after the Lionesses beat Germany to win Euro 2022, where his daughter scored the opening goal. He passed away in September 2024, three days before his 60th birthday. Manchester United's Women's Super League campaign got under way just two weeks later and Toone started every league game for them untilsuffering a calf injury in trainingin November. Toone hadn't scored in six games before her injury and in her own words had lost her love for the game. \"I had just lost my dad before the season started,\" the 25-year-old told The Tooney & Russo Show. \"I played on after that and probably wasn't enjoying it as much as I should have been. I would never have told myself that or admitted it because all I ever wanted to do was play football for him. \"When it actually got taken out of my hands it made me realise, 'right, I do need this, I do need to step away from football and get myself mentally right more than anything'. I needed to have that love for the game again and miss it.\" Toone's time away from the pitch allowed her to physically and mentally focus on herself. She started speaking to a counsellor and spent time in Dubai with her partner Joe while undergoing rehab. \"At first I didn't miss it,\" she added. \"I was doing my rehab, I was enjoying being in the gym and getting stronger. It was the best thing I could have done to get myself mentally right and actually grieve. \"I don't think I grieved, I don't think I thought that it was real.\" Ella Toone scored on her return from injury, netting in the 7-0 FA Cup win over West Brom After nine weeks out, Toone was back with a bang. She scored six goals in her first five games back for United, including astunning hat-trickagainst rivals Manchester City. \"When I was back on the grass and around the girls I was like 'I miss it' and that's when I knew I was ready to kick on,\" Toone said. \"I came back and started playing well and scoring goals. Then my love for the game really grew and I wasn't putting as much pressure on myself as I was before in wanting to do everything and wanting to score for dad, thinking I'm never going to score again. \"It was perfect timing and now it's about not falling again. It's hard in football because you are up and down all the time anyway.\" Toone is currently on international duty as England prepare to face Portugal and Spain in the Nations League. Her former United team-mate, best friend and podcast partner Alessia Russo, who now plays for Arsenal, drove to Manchester when she heard of Nick's passing. \"From living together to then being so far away down in London was hard anyway,\" Russo said. \"When something as heavy as that happens, all I wanted to do was be there. \"Whether she wanted me there or not I didn't really care. I just wanted to be there, to sit with her, to cry with her, to eat with her, to try and make her laugh and to help with anything she needed. \"It's so hard being away from someone at a time like that. As soon as I could I wanted to go and see her. I know Tooney would drop anything to help me if I needed her, big or small.\" Ella Toone said her dad was her biggest cheerleader growing up Russo was one of a number of Toone's team-mates from both club and country who rallied around her in the dark times. \"Everyone came together,\" Toone added. \"They have been amazing, my team-mates as well, just being normal, not pottering around me or not knowing what to say. \"When it was the funeral it was unbelievable to see the amount of people there. I had the girls coming up from London, I had Georgia [Stanway] flying over from Germany. \"I had all these people coming and I thought, 'wow, I am so lucky to have these people' or else what would I have done?\" A difficult season on and off the pitch for Toone ended with an impressive eight goals and four assists. Each time she found the back of the net, she pointed to the sky to celebrate with her dad. \"It's hard because everyone is sad that day and talks about memories and it's done then for everyone. But for us it's still so hard. \"I've been blessed with a lot of good people around me and definitely couldn't have got through it without them. Now I just want to keep kicking on and doing things right and making him proud.\" Season Two of the Tooney and Russo Show drops on BBC Sounds and YouTube on Friday 30 May, with new episodes every Monday and Friday.

    "article_text": "Ipswich striker Liam Delap has a Â£30m release clause Chelsea look set to sign Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap after triggering the Â£30m release clause in his contract. Manchester United, Everton, Newcastle and Nottingham Forest were among the clubs to have shown a serious interest in Delap, who was made available for Â£30m when Ipswich were relegated, while Manchester City also hold a buy-back option. The 22-year-old joined Ipswich from Manchester City in a deal worth up to Â£20m last summer and was this month given permission to speak to interested clubs. \"Liam's looking at his options for next year, which I think he is entitled to do and we support him with that,\" said Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna, ahead of his side's final Premier League game. It is understood Stamford Bridge is Delap's first-choice destination but negotiations over personal terms continue. Chelsea, wholifted the UEFA Conference League trophyon Wednesday night, last week qualified for the Champions League, providing Delap with the chance to add to his solitary appearance in the competition with Manchester City in 2022. Delap made 32 starts in the Premier League for Ipswich last season, scoring 12 goals. Ipswich, who were relegated at the end of the season after finishing 19th in the table, are interested in taking Chelsea striker Marc Guiu on loan as a replacement for Delap. The Spanish striker scored six goals in 14 appearances for Chelsea this season but has missed most of 2025 with a muscular injury. He returned as a late substitute during the Conference League final in Wroclaw.

    "article_text": "The African Development Bank has chosen the Mauritanian economist Sidi Ould Tah as its president-elect after three rounds of voting on Thursday afternoon. The election took place in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, at the end of the annual meeting of the continent’s biggest multilateral lender. Tah, former head of the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (Badea), beat his closest challenger, Samuel Maimbo, of Zambia, a vice-president of the World Bank, to emerge as successor to the incumbentAkinwunmi Adesina, who completes his second five-year term in September. Of the five candidates running, four men and a woman, Tah secured 76% of the total vote. Of the remaining votes, Maimbo won 20%, with the former Senegalese economy minister Amadou Hott gaining 3.5%. The president-elect will be the ninth chief of the 60-year-old development finance institution, which boasts a broad ownership structure: 54 African countries are shareholders, as are G7 nations, including the US and Japan. Nigeria is its single biggest shareholder. The bank is responsible for backing several large-scale infrastructure developments within the continent, in part using resources from the African Development Fund (ADF). International partners replenish the ADF’s resources every three years, with the next round of funding due to begin this November. However, with the Trump administration committed to cutting US funding to the AfDB by $555m (£411m) to focus on domestic matters, the bank will have to find creative ways of doing more with less or finding new donors. Adesina has said the current capital of the AfDB has grown to $318bn. Tah has pledged to collaborate more with Gulf states around infrastructure development.",

    "title": "South African woman sentenced to life for selling six-year-old daughter",
    "article_text": "A South African woman has been sentenced to life imprisonment alongside two accomplices for trafficking her then six-year-old daughter, in a case that gripped South Africa and gained international attention after the girl went missing last year. Racquel “Kelly” Smith, her boyfriend, Jacquen Appollis, and their friend, Steveno van Rhyn, were convicted of kidnapping and trafficking Joshlin Smith, who disappeared from her home in a small township in the Western Cape in February 2024. Joshlin has still not been found, despite an extensive police search. During the trial, a witness said Smith had told her she had sold her daughter to a sangoma, a traditional healer, for 20,000 rand (£830) and that the girl had been desired for her “eyes and skin”. Another witness, a pastor, said Smith told him in 2023 that she planned to sell her daughter. “There is nothing that I can find that is redeeming and deserving of a lesser sentence than the harshest I can impose,” the high court judge Nathan Erasmus said. Erasmus also imposed a 10-year kidnapping sentence on the three, to run concurrently with the life sentence for human trafficking, and ordered their names be entered into the child protection register. Erasmus said the fact Smith, Appollis and Van Rhyn were drug users was no excuse and described Smith as “a person who is manipulative and manipulates the facts as it suits you”. “[You] went as far as to blame your parents for your conduct in this matter,” the judge said during the sentencing in Saldanha Bay, a fishing town 85 miles north of Cape Town. “The evidence presented as to the disappearance of your own daughter was clear. Besides on one occasion earlier and yesterday, I saw no indication of remorse, but it didn’t start there because we know from 19 February 2024 the lack of concern.” Smith’s mother, Amanda Daniels, was present at the sentencing, wearing a white T-shirt emblazoned with a photograph of Joshlin’s face. The day before, a court officer read out a victim impact statement on her behalf, describing how she had “cried my eyes out” on Mother’s Day earlier in May. Daniels’statementsaid: “Kelly, you have made our lives hell on earth. I feel like my heart has been ripped from my body. You have broken [this family] apart.” Daniels is now caring for Smith’s two other children, of whom Joshlin was the middle child, and said she was constantly afraid they would go missing too. South Africa police said they had extended the search for Joshlin outside the country. Soon after her disappearance, Gayton McKenzie, the leader of the populist, minority Patriotic Alliance party and now sport and culture minister, offered a 1m rand (£42,000) reward for her safe return. Kidnappings have soared recently in South Africa, with more than 17,000 in the 12 months to 31 March 2024, almost treble three years earlier, according toSouth African police data.

    "title": "Remains of Mayan city nearly 3,000 years old unearthed in Guatemala",
    "article_text": "Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of a Mayan city nearly 3,000 years old in northernGuatemala, with pyramids and monuments that point to its significance as an important ceremonial site. The Mayan civilization arose around 2000BC, reaching its height between 400 and 900AD in what is present-day southern Mexico andGuatemala, as well as parts of Belize, El Salvador and Honduras. The city named Los Abuelos, Spanish for “The Grandparents,” once stood some 21km (13 miles) from the important archaeological site of Uaxactun, in Guatemala’s northern Petén department, the country’s culture ministry said in a statement on Thursday. It is dated to what is known as the Middle Preclassic period from about 800-500BC, and is believed to have been “one of the most ancient and important ceremonial centers” of the Mayan civilization in the jungle area of Petén near the Mexican border, it added. “The site presents remarkable architectural planning” with pyramids and monuments “sculpted with unique iconography from the region”, said the ministry. The city takes its name from two human-like sculptures of an “ancestral couple” found at the site. The figures, dated to between 500 and 300BC, “could be linked to ancient ritual practices of ancestor worship”, said the ministry. The city, which covers an area of about 16 sq km (6 sq miles) was discovered by Guatemalan and Slovak archaeologists in previously little-explored areas of the Uaxactun park. Nearby, they also found a pyramid standing 33 meters (108ft) high with murals from the Preclassic period and “a unique canal system”, according to the statement. “The set of these three sites forms a previously unknown urban triangle ... These findings allow us to rethink the understanding of the ceremonial and socio-political organization of pre-Hispanic Petén,” said the ministry. In April, scientists discovered a 1,000-year-old altar from Mexico’s ancient Teotihuacán culture atTikal, elsewhere in the Petén department. That find was interpreted as proof of ties between the two pre-Hispanic cultures, which lived about 1,300km apart. Tikal, about 23km from Uaxcatun, is the main archaeological site in Guatemala and one of its biggest tourist attractions.",

    "title": "With Rosehill scratched where else can Sydney build housing? Here are seven potential sites",
    "article_text": "High-rise blocks in Woollahra? Convert Glebe Island for housing instead of ships? Move Long Bay Jail? Build on Callan park? The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, has promised to unveil a “Plan B” to repair the hole punched in his government’s housing blueprint after members of the Australian Turf Clubvoted against selling the Rosehill racecourse siteto make way for 25,000 new homes. The loss of the envisioned mini-city at Rosehill leaves the state government scrambling to address the city’s housing crisis. Earlier this week, Minns said he was disappointed but not put off by the failure of the Rosehill proposal. “It is important to test these things, even if the risk is failure, because the task in front of us when it comes to housing in NSW is so monumental that we cannot just take the safe option,” he said. “We cannot just take the sure bet. If we take the sure bet on every housing proposal and only do uncontroversial things that will not make nimbys irate, nothing will move in NSW.” Are there other sites that could be developed to boost housing inSydney? The Bays precinctis a large area around Rozelle and Blackwattle Bay. It has been earmarked for development but planning is in the early stages. It will have a Metro station on theMetro West lineand the existing plan has earmarked sites for commercial property and 5,000 homes. The plan does not currently include developing the port facilities at Glebe Island, formerly used to unload imported cars. Today, the port is used intermittently for overseas cruise ships that fit under the Harbour Bridge and for concrete batching for major projects, including the Metro and Barangaroo. Its proximity to the city and proposed public transport links mean it could accommodate more housing. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Urban Taskforce’s chief executive, Tom Forrest, said it would create few shadowing problems for surrounding houses – allowing for greater density. The downside is that it would lead to the loss of marine infrastructure in Sydney Harbour. Asked about this site in parliament on Wednesday, the NSW planning minister, Paul Scully, did not rule it out. Developers are already advocating for greater housing densities at Olympic Park to replace Rosehill. Themaster plan for 2050calls for 13,000 new homes, but developers say the 43-hectare site could house more. The upside is that Olympic Park is on the Metro West line and has good sport and recreational facilities. The downside is that planning is advanced and changes could delay development. The Metro West line goes directly under this 62-hectare government-owned waterfront site in Rozelle which was once home to Callan Park hospital. No station is now planned but one could be added, in the same way the government proposed an additional station for Rosehill. However,the site is now parklandand has several heritage-listed stone buildings. Development, especially high-density housing, would set the government on a collision course with inner-west residents and heritage experts. The state government also owns the 25-hectare Gladesville hospital site on Victoria Road, although it is not on the Metro line. It is now used for some health facilities and is also heritage listed. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion TheSydney Yimby chair, Justin Simon, is an advocate for allowing more density in the eastern suburbs. He notes there isa partially constructed stationin Woollahra on the eastern suburbs rail line that was mothballed in the 1970s due to resident objections. Simon said the government’sTransport Oriented Development (Tod) programdoesn’t include any eastern suburbs sites. The program allows development within 400 metres of transport hubs, and in the case of accelerated precincts allows heights up to 30 storeys. The policy has led to several sites being proposed by developers on Sydney’s north shore. Simon said the forgotten Woollahra station could be developed quickly and developers would be keen to assemble sites from small holdings as they have on the north shore. “We would be calling for very tall buildings,” he said. Again, this proposal would meet resistance from the residents and heritage experts because homogenous Victorian housing characterises Woollahra. The government appears to have ruled out building a Metro station at Rosehill after the proposed sale was rejected by turf club members. But developers say the area remains a good location for more homes and a rail link. The development director at Billbergia, Rick Graf, said the area remains a highly suitable site for high-density development and a modified Metro station closer to the Camellia town centre should be considered by the government. Graf, who is also the convener of the Rosehill-Camellia Landowners Alliance, suggested thecurrent plans for Camelia, an old industrial area 1.5km from the Parramatta CBD, were undercooked and should be revisited. The current master plan envisages 13,000 dwellings serviced by the Parramatta light rail and a ferry wharf. But with the addition of the underused lands owned by the ATC around the racecourse, Graf said the area could support 25,000 homes in towers of 40 to 50 storeys, serviced by a Metro station. “The racetrack could be part of the green space. In other parts of the world, playing fields are incorporated in the centre of race tracks,” he said. Graf said Camellia landowners had not talked to the government since the Rosehill plan was defeated, but there was still a compelling case for a mini-city in the area. Another state government-owned site, Long Bay is now used as a remand centre. The 32-hectare site is serviced by buses along Anzac Parade but is only 5km from the existing last light rail stop at Kingsford. The prison would need to be relocated but the proximity to the CBD and beaches would make it attractive for new housing development. Development at the 20-hectare commonwealth-owned Randwick barracks has been floated since the 1980s. It is relatively close to the last stops on the L2 and L3 light rail lines. The current planis for Defence to build 62 townhouses on a fraction of the site for defence families and retain it as a defence facility. The development is expected to be assessed by federal authorities this year and is exempt from state and local planning controls.",

Meanwhile in Adelaide, the Marion city council overrode community objections andapproved the factory projectto proceed to the next stage, which will need state government approval. The council said the project would bring in 100 jobs and millions of dollars to the community. But the protest movement “Trees not Teslas” is determined to fight on. While conservation groups and others were protesting against the Tesla project because of the need to remove trees on the land where the plant would be built, Trees not Teslas also fired people up over Musk himself. “Neon” from Trees not Teslas did not want to use his real name, in part for fear of reprisals and in part because the group considers itself a collective. He said the traction the group got was “wild”, with their website getting thousands of views, but he acknowledged it was impossible to work out how much influence they ultimately had. Neon said the fight will continue, as the state government considers whether to approve the council’s proposal to revoke the site’s status as community land. “We just move that further up. We have to. We move that into actions for the state government,” Neon said. “We spread more awareness. We try to get more people involved. It now becomes not just a council issue but a fundamental state issue.” He said they started the campaign primarily to protect the trees on the site. “Our main focus was the trees … we’re looking to preserve green spaces,” he said. “We’re very pro-electric vehicle and pro-green energy. “But the industry that destroys green spaces is … green in name only.” The council argued that the space had not been publicly accessible since 2016 because of contamination. Neon said trees can help remediate the land. He also echoed comments made by the councillor Sarah Luscombe, who voted against the proposal, that the factory would only recycle or repurpose Tesla batteries, when most people use other brands. While the discussion has centred around electric vehicle batteries, it is possible the site could also recycle and repurpose Powerwall batteries. Guardian Australia has contacted Tesla for comment. Neon said the council voting eight to three to seek state government approval despite the community objections made the public consultation process seem like a box-ticking exercise. The mayor, Kris Hanna, said the project would bring jobs and an income stream into the community, and that Tesla would just set up elsewhere, if not in Marion. Tesla, Hanna said, had pledged to retain most significant trees and replace more trees than it was required to. Neon said the established trees would be replaced with saplings, removing many of their benefits. The state premier, Peter Malinauskas, said earlier this week that major industrial developments were welcome in the state and that while he “violently” disagreed with Musk’s politics, they were “his prerogative”. A state government spokesperson said the government welcomed investment and job creation in SA and would consider the proposal.",

    "title": "Gisèle Pelicot’s daughter says she believes online pornography played role in rape case",
    "article_text": "There is “no way” that Gisèle Pelicot would have been raped more than 200 times without the existence of pornography websites, her daughter has said. Speaking at theHay festivalin Powys on Thursday, Caroline Darian said there were “so many social problems like online porn” that can lead to instances of abuse. Pelicot survived nearly a decade of rapes by dozens of men, including her then husband Dominique Pelicot, Darian’s father, who drugged his wife and facilitated the abuse. Pelicot rose to international fame last year for waiving her right to anonymity in the trial of her ex-husband and other defendants. He wassentenced to 20 years in prison. Darian was at the festival to promote her book, I’ll Never Call Him Dad Again. Asked by a male audience member how men can “step up” and be part of breaking cycles of abuse, she said “you need to talk between guys” about pornography, because it is “part of the system” of misogyny and violence. The actor and activist Jameela Jamil, who was chairing the event, said that “there are so many men in my life, even, who don’t know all of the facts of this case in the way that women do”. What we “desperately need” men to do “is to check your mates” and challenge their misogynistic comments and behaviour, she said. Darian is a pen name, a combination of her brothers Florian and David’s names, because she wanted to honour the fact that they have been so involved in the process of telling her story. The author spoke with great compassion and admiration about her mother, but explained that they were not currently on speaking terms. In her book, she wrote that they reached a “point of no return” in their relationship after her mother did not believe Darian when she claimed her father had raped her. Darian told the Hay audience that she thinks her mother’s reluctance to support her was a “way for her to protect herself”. It’s “quite difficult” to accept that your child has been abused, she said. “I think my mum is not able to recognise it because otherwise I think she’s going to die.” Dominique Pelicot’s actions have “really impacted the whole family, and everyone from her family had a different position”, she added. “But I just have to be grateful for what [Gisèle Pelicot] did.” Telling her son, who was six at the time, about her father’s actions was particularly hard, Darian said. She felt a responsibility to tell him the truth but “it was a shock” as he had previously had a good relationship with his grandfather and “loved him very much”. Her son saw a psychiatrist for almost four years after finding out the news, and Darian said she was “trying to educate him about what is consent”. Raising a young man in a positive way was “a question of open dialogue”, she said, and “a question of education”.",

    "title": "Bank of England governor urges deeper ties with EU to ‘minimise’ Brexit impact",
    "article_text": "Andrew Bailey has urged the UK government to deepen ties with the EU, as he warned a breakdown in global trade would make it harder for theBank of Englandto control inflation. In a speech in Dublin on Thursday, the Bank’s governor said a stronger relationship between London and Brussels could “minimise negative effects” ofBrexiton trade. Calling for closer cooperation on financial services as a priority, Bailey said government efforts to reset relations with the EU were a “welcome step forward” after the UK’s formal departure from the 27-country bloc in 2020. Bailey said, as a civil servant, he took no position on Brexit, and he understood there could be other reasons why voters backed leaving the EU, but he said the evidence showed that the UK’s changing trade relationship had “weighed” on Britain’s economy. “This does not mean that Brexit is wrong, because there can be other reasons for it, but it does suggest, I think powerfully, that we should do all we can to minimise negative effects on trade,” he said. The Bank’s governor has previouslycalled for the UK to strike deeper ties with Brusselsto strengthen the economy, ahead of adealagreed between Keir Starmer and the EU’sUrsula von der Leyenin London earlier this month. On a day ofdramatic developmentsin Donald Trump’s increasingly erratic international trade war, Bailey said tougher barriers to trade made the economy less efficient and could therefore stoke inflation. UK inflationjumped by more than expected in April, to 3.5% from 2.6% in March, after sharp rises in water bills, energy costs and council tax. The Bank of England targets 2% inflation. Bailey warned that simmering geopolitical tensions and the fragmentation of international trade suggested the lengthy, complex manufacturing supply chains of the past were unlikely to return. “The inevitable conclusion is that we cannot assume the supply sides of our economies behave as efficiently as they did before Covid. And this was a substantial cause of the very difficult upsurge in inflation,” he said. “Our jobs are much harder if we face more inflexible and uncertain supply side conditions in our economies, as we appear to do today.” His comments came as figures from the Office for National Statistics showed inflation in March rose at a faster pace for private and social renters than older households who own their homes outright, extending an intergenerational gap that has opened up since September 2023. Inflation was 3.6% for private renters in the year to March compared with 1.8% for “outright owner-occupiers”, the ONS said in itslatest estimate of household living costs. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Social rents have also jumped, pushing up the cost of living for renters in local authority and housing association homes by 3% in the year to March. Groups representing young people and renters said the figures provided further evidence of a cost of living gap between younger people and the many older people who had paid off their mortgages and were immune to rising rents and mortgage costs. Renters tend to be much younger than the average age of outright owners. According togovernment figures, the average age of a private renter is 41, and 53 years in the social rented sector. Mortgage payers, another group that are younger on average than outright owners, had an inflation rate of 2.8% in the year to March. Ben Twomey, chief executive of Generation Rent, said the figures were “a sour reminder” of the high costs renters pay to have a roof over their head. “Homes are the foundations of our lives, but renters across the country are at constant risk of losing their homes and even ending up homeless because of soaring costs that swallow up our earnings. “News of private renters facing the highest household costs is a sour reminder of how much of a raw deal we are getting.”",

    "title": "British woman in France wins back pre-Brexit right to vote in EU elections",
    "article_text": "A French court has ordered electoral officials to restore a British woman’s pre-Brexit right to vote inEuropean elections, triggering calls for a renewed push for a bilateral treaty on electoral enfranchisement in each other’s countries. Alice Bouilliez, a former British civil servant who has lived inFrancefor 38 years, said she was “extremely surprised” but delighted that the court in Auch in south-west France had ordered that the authorities put her name back on the electoral register for the EU elections. “I am extremely happy about the result. When I went to get the ruling from the court I was extremely surprised because I was expecting a knock on the knuckles,” she said. The French court only ruled on her right to vote in European elections. Bouilliez first mounted legal action against the disenfranchisement in 2020 with a case going all the way to the European court of justice, which ruled against her in 2022. The court followed theadvice of the advocate general, Anthony Collins, who said the EU treaty had made “nationality of a member state” an “essential condition of a person to be able to acquire and retain the status of citizens of the union and to benefit fully from the rights attaching to that status”. Julien Fouchet, a French lawyer representing Bouilliez, said the court did not determine conclusively what happened to those acquired rights British citizens such as Bouilliez had received when she became a permanent resident of France under the free movement rules that were available to Britons beforeBrexit. The ruling by the Auch tribunal judiciary could be used to restore rights across France for British citizens living in the country before Brexit who did not opt to apply for French citizenship and wanted to win back their right to vote, he said. “The court ruled that Alice had not committed any crime and that to lose her voting rights was a fundamental and disproportionate infringement of her voting rights,” he said. “The right to vote is a common good, it is more than just a right.” Though married to a French citizen, Bouilliez never sought citizenship, partly as she made an oath to the British crown when she worked for the Foreign Office. Before Brexit, British citizens living in France had the right to vote in municipal and European parliamentary elections but not legislative elections for the national government or presidency. Although Bouilliez and other Britons who did not take French citizenship after Brexit also lost their right to vote in local elections, she says she had not given up on the issue. “I have won the right to vote only in the EU elections,” she said. “The rest is for later I hope.” In a parallel situation, EU citizens including French people living permanently in the UK had the right to vote in local and European elections but not national, with the exception of citizens of Ireland, Cyprus and Malta who can vote in all elections in Britain. The UK had wanted to make reciprocal voting rights part of the Brexit deal but the EU did not agree, leaving Britain to negotiate bilateral treaties. So far just five countries – Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Poland and Luxembourg – have agreed that each other’s citizens can continue to have rights in local elections, but there is no such treaty with France. Fouchet called on the French and British governments to open negotiations to restore citizens’ voting rights. “The French and UK governments should have a bilateral treaty reciprocating the right to vote in municipal elections. I see this judgment as an opportunity, especially in light of the recentUK-EU summit, to get an agreement on this,” he said. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Before the UK’s departure from the EU, the government wrote to all member states signalling our willingness to enter into bilateral agreements. “These would ensure each country’s citizens have mutual local election voting and candidacy rights, and we remain open to further agreements.” This article was amended on 29 May 2025. The court ordered that Alice Bouilliez be restored her right to vote in European elections, but not French local elections as an earlier version said.",

    "article_text": "A leader of the notorious Kinahan organised crime group has been flown from the United Arab Emirates toIrelandin the first extradition of its kind. An Irish military aircraft carrying Sean McGovern – who is wanted on charges of murder and directing organised crime – was due to land in Dublin amid heavy security on Thursday afternoon. The 39-year-old has been in custody in Dubai since October, when he was detained on an Interpol red notice, which is a request to law enforcement agencies to locate and provisionally arrest a suspect pending extradition or similar legal action. McGovern, who has been named in Ireland’s special criminal court as a senior member of the Kinahan cartel, is wanted in connection with the murder of Noel Kirwan, an innocent man who was shot in Dublin in 2016 amid a feud between the Kinahan and Hutch criminal gangs. UAE authorities handed McGovern to gardai on Wednesday, after which he was put on an Irish Air Corps Airbus C295. After landing at the Casement aerodrome, McGovern is expected to be taken under armed guard to the special criminal court to be formally charged. Shawna Coxon, the deputy commissioner of Ireland’s police force, An Garda Síochána, said it was a significant development in international law enforcement. “Transnational organised crime gangs cause misery to communities not only in Ireland but throughout the world. They engage in murder, human trafficking and drug dealing.” Ireland’s justice minister, Jim O’Callaghan, thanked his Emirati counterpart, Abdullah bin Sultan bin Awad Al Nuaimi, and the Dubai police for their cooperation. The UAE has become a base for Irish criminals and their associates partly because the state has no extradition treaty with the EU. However, a decade of lobbying by Irish officials paved the way for an extradition treaty that became operational on 18 May. It was not retrospective and did not apply to McGovern but authorities in both jurisdictions made a separate, one-off arrangement to transfer the suspect. McGovern was shot in the stomach in 2016 when a rival gang’s hit team stormed a Kinahan-organised boxing weigh-in at a Dublin hotel. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion Irish authorities hope to also extradite the gang’s founder, Christy Kinahan, and his sons Daniel and Christopher, who are believed to be in Dubai. British police say theKinahan cartel, which started as a low-level street-dealing operation in the 1980s, has flooded Britain with guns and drugs. In 2022 the USannounced sanctionsagainst alleged Kinahan gang leaders and offered a $5m reward for information leading to an arrest or conviction.",

    "title": "Charity accuses Israeli-backed Gaza food group of unauthorised use of logo",
    "article_text": "A US charity has accused the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the controversial Israeli-backed group thatbegan distributing foodin Gaza this week, of sending out photographs of deliveries containing its logo without permission. Images distributed by GHF this week showed shipments bearing a label from Rahma Worldwide, which is based in Michigan, as part of its first distribution of food to sites inside Gaza. The rollout was marred by scenes of chaos on Tuesday after crowds overran one distribution centre managed by GHF and Israeli forces said they had fired “warning shots”. Gaza health officials said at least one civilian had been killed and 48 injured in the incident. The aid bearing the Rahma logo, which was prominently displayed in a press packet distributed by GHF, suggested to somemediaoutlets that the groups were official partners. That would be an important endorsement asquestions have grown over GHF’s fundingand lack of partners or experience in distributing aid. Israeli jets continued to pound areas ofGazaon Thursday, killing at least 45 people, including 23 in a strike on the Bureij camp in the central Gaza Strip, Palestinian medical workers said. Israeli media reported that the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had told the families of hostages held in the territory that he had accepted a new ceasefire proposal presented by Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. There were no further immediate details. Hamas said earlier that it had received the new proposal from mediators and was studying it. Speculation around a possible ceasefire had been growing after Witkoff said the White House was preparing a draft document that could provide the basis for an agreement. The UN and aid groupshave pushed back against the new system led by GHF. They sayIsraelis trying to use food as a weapon and that a new system will not be effective. In a statement, Rahma said it had previously “secured all necessary permits” for 4,000 food boxes to cross into Gaza but none had entered. Israel has blocked the UN and other aid organisations from moving food into Gaza, where people are starving. Unable to get the food in, Rahma had allowed the containers to be “taken custody” by GHF. Rahma added, however, that it had refused to allow its personnel to take part in the distribution because of GHF’s use of armed security contractors. “We noticed images of our food boxes with logo being distributed without Rahma’s direct involvement,” the group said in a statement. “Rahma did not authorise such distribution, and none of our team was permitted to participate in this process.” In a separate statement, Rahma’s executive director and founder said it had allowed GHF to transport the aid, which had been stuck at the border, due to the “severe need in Gaza” but had demanded a formal explanation for why that aid had been distributed under its name. “We stipulated that the Rahma logo be removed from the aid parcels,” said Dr Shadi Omar Zaza, the head of Rahma. “To our surprise, the organisation’s logo was not removed, and the security company distributed these parcels bearing the Rahma Worldwide logo.” Palestinians described more scenes of chaos on Thursday at a GHF hub as security contractors struggled to control the crowd. People scattered as gunfire rang out, although it was not clear who fired or if there were any casualties. Zaza said GHF’s use of armed security contractors violated Rahma’s operational charter and humanitarian mandate. “We will not accept, and will not be part of, this aid distribution mechanism – because we do not allow armed actors, we do not allow any armed party to interfere in our relief work,” he said. GHF has been approached for comment. Agence France-Presse and Associate Press contributed to this report",

    "title": "Israel confirms plans to create 22 new settlements in occupied West Bank",
    "article_text": "Israel has said it will establish 22 new settlements in the occupiedWest Bank, including the legalisation of outposts already built without government authorisation, after a security cabinet vote held in secret last week. Israel occupied the West Bank, capturing it from Jordan, in the six-day war of 1967. Since then, successive governments have tried to permanently cement Israelicontrol over the land, in part by declaring swathes as “state lands”, which prevents private Palestinian ownership. The motion was said to have been put forward by the far-right defence minister,IsraelKatz, and the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in the West Bank settlement of Kedumim, which is considered illegal under international law. Katz said the settlement decision “strengthens our hold on Judea and Samaria”, using the biblical term for the West Bank, “anchors our historical right in the Land of Israel, and constitutes a crushing response to Palestinian terrorism”. He added it was also “a strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel”. A spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem said: “Israel continues to promote Jewish supremacy through the theft of Palestinian land and the ethnic cleansing of the West Bank. The Israeli government is openly and blatantly working to destroy the Palestinian people, and any chances for a normal future for the people living between the Jordan River and the sea.” The spokesperson added: “The international community is enabling Israel’s crimes by standing aside while millions of Palestinians are subjected to this racist and brutal regime of the Israeli government.” The government intends to use the 22 settlements to bolster Israel’s presence around Route 443, which connects Jerusalem and Tel Aviv via Modiin and was described by Israel Ganz, the head of the Yesha council umbrella group of West Bank Jewish municipalities, as “the most important decision since 1967”. The minister said on X: “We have made a historic decision for the development of settlements: 22 new communities in Judea and Samaria, renewing the settlement of the north of Samaria, and reinforcing the eastern axis of the state of Israel.” Last July Israel approved the largest seizure of land in the occupied West Bank in more than three decades, accordingto a report releasedby Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement watchdog. At the time, the Israeli government approved the appropriation of 12.7 sq km (nearly 5 sq miles) of land in the Jordan valley, indicating it was “the largest single appropriation approved since the1993 Oslo accords”, referring to the start of the peace process. In aleaked recording captured by Peace Now last year,Smotrich, during a conference for his National Religious Party-Religious Zionism, disclosed that the land confiscations in 2024 surpassed previous years’ averages by approximately tenfold. He said: “This thing is mega-strategic and we are investing a lot in it. This is something that will change the map dramatically.” In May 2023, Smotrich, who said his “life’s mission is to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state”, instructed Israeli government ministries toprepare for a further 500,000 Israeli settlersto move into the occupied West Bank. On 20 June,the Guardian revealedhow the Israeli military had quietly handed over significant legal powers in the West Bank to pro-settler civil servants working for Smotrich. An order posted by the Israel Defense Forces on its website on May 2024 transfers responsibility for dozens of bylaws at the Civil Administration – the Israeli body governing in the West Bank – from the military to officials led by Smotrich at the defence ministry. In March, astatement issuedby Peace Now said that between 1 January and 19 March, 10,503 housing units were promoted, surpassing the 9,971 units approved throughout the whole of 2024. The approval of new settlements by Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right government represents a further implementation of its longstanding goal to annex the occupied Palestinian territory – an objective bolstered by the Trump administration. Mike Huckabee,nominated as Trump’s new ambassador to Israel, signalled his support for Israeli claims on the West Bank in an interview last year. He said: “When people use the term ‘occupied’, I say: ‘Yes, Israel is occupying the land, but it’s the occupation of a land that God gave them 3,500 years ago. It is their land.’” Rightwing settlers have described top officials in Trump’s new administration, which rescinded sanctions imposed on violent Israeli settler groups, as a “dream team” that would offer a“special opportunity”to permanently end any prospect of a Palestinian state.

    "title": "Thursday briefing: What chaos at new Gaza food distribution point means for Palestinians facing famine",
    "article_text": "Good morning. If the new system for distributing supplies in Gaza is supposed to be an adequate replacement for the major aid organisations that were previously in place,it has got off to an inauspicious start. On Tuesday, after the first food point run by the new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – a non-government organisation (NGO) with Israeli support that uses US-based contractors – opened in Rafah, Israeli forces stationed at the perimeter opened fire. Panicked civilians fled the scene, most without the food they came for; dozens of people were injured, and at least one died. Even before the disaster of its initial operation, the GHF’s executive director resigned, warning that it could not be an independent, impartial provider of aid. Meanwhile, urgent warnings continue that children and elderly people are dying of starvation, and hundreds of thousands more are on the brink of famine. Last night, it emerged thatfour people had diedafter the UN’s World Food Programme said “hordes of hungry people” had broken into a food supply warehouse in central Gaza. Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s Middle East correspondentEmma Graham-Harrison, is about what happened in Rafah – and what it suggests about whether the new plan is up to the task, or even intended to attempt it. Here are the headlines. UK news| The housing ombudsman has warned that“simmering anger at poor housing conditionsrisks becoming social disquiet”, as his office records a 474% increase in complaints. Richard Blakeway said it was “neither fanciful nor alarmist” to suggest anger at housing conditions would cause an “irreparable” fracturing of trust, saying the “shock of Grenfell Tower and Awaab Ishak’s death resonate still”. Trump tariffs| A US federal trade court hasblocked Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffson imports under an emergency-powers law. The ruling, which the White House is said to be appealing, would blow a hole in Trump’s strategy to use steep tariffs to wring concessions from trading partners. Ukraine| Ukraine and Germany have agreed to future military cooperation in which Berlinwill help finance long-range weapons production on Ukrainian soil. The deal came as Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia had amassed 50,000 troops in the Sumy region bordering Russia. UK news| Prosecutors have confirmed they have authorised21 charges against influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking. The Crown Prosecution Service said that the two men would not be tried in the UK until an investigation into charges they face in Romania is concluded. School meals| Guidance urging schools in England to serve children meat at least three times a week should be overhauled to increase the eating of vegetables,a leading charity has said. The Food Foundation found that 80% of the most commonly eaten meat dishes in schools are either processed or red meat. As word spread on Tuesday that one of the distribution points used by the new body responsible for distributing food, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), had opened, tens of thousands of people headed there. Crowds of desperate people broke through fences around the site, and Israeli forces started shooting. While those were later claimed by Israel to be “warning shots”, at least one civilian died and 48 others were injured, many with gunshot wounds. That outcome points to the very reason that traditional aid operations do not use armed security or work with belligerent forces – and, perhaps, the dangerous inexperience of those behind the new system: it is hard to build networks of trust in communities under attack, and easy to retreat behind guns. “When they say ‘warning shots’, it’s not clear where they aimed that gunfire, but even if they fired into the air over the crowd, those bullets have to come down,” Emma said. “This is what happens when you use a dangerous, untested method at a time of extreme crisis.” Did this sort of thing happenunder the old system? While convoys have been targeted by armed groups, and desperate civilians looting to feed their families, the distribution networks of major aid groups and the UN — which are closely audited and take food into communities rather than concentrating it in a few places — have held up well during the war. “There has never been an incident like this at a UN or humanitarian operation’s distribution position,” Emma said. The worst previous incident, known by Palestinians as the flour massacre, sawat least 112 people killedand 760 injured when desperate crowds gathered as aid trucks arrived in Gaza City; there were conflicting accounts of whether most of the victims were shot by Israeli troops or died in an ensuing stampede. But even that horrifying case was “not about a UN or humanitarian distribution operation degenerating into chaos,” Emma said. “It happened as a convoy arrived, at a time of desperation when northern Gaza was under the most intense siege.” Many of the attacks on convoys have happened as trucks travel out of border areas under Israeli control and cross “no man’s land” before they get to areas where aid groups can operate safely. “Given the Israeli forces have extensive control of Gaza, and have a legal obligation as an occupying power to ensure civilians can get food, you might think they should be able to maintain security to the point of distribution,” Emma noted. Meanwhile, Palestinian attempts to protect aid from attacks have been targeted by Israeli strikes. Israel says that the police force in Gaza are legitimate targets because the force reports to the Hamas government.One such incidentsaw six members of a security team killed last week. How effective is the new system at getting food to Palestinians? The new arrangements appear much less effective at getting supplies to those most desperately in need. One key reason for that is that “instead of bringing food to people, they are telling people to come to the food,” Emma said: supplies are being distributed at static distribution points in boxes weighing up to 20kg that are meant to feed “5.5 people for 3.5 days”. “If someone is on foot and severely malnourished or elderly, how are they supposed to reach the centre or carry a box like that with them?” Israel has repeatedly claimed that this approach is necessary to stop supplies being requisitioned by Hamas. “But once people leave the distribution points, that could just as easily be happening now,” Emma said. In any case, the UN says its closely monitored supply chains are secure, and Israel has never provided any evidence to back up its claims, or even offered statistics on the scale of the alleged problem. Quite apart from the logistical particulars, there is a much more fundamental question: whether the supplies now being allowed in are anything like enough to tackle the hunger crisis. Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza – where many people were already living in a state of severe food insecurity – on 2 March; the UN estimates that about 600 trucks are needed each day to begin addressing the problem. Since the total siege was eased earlier this month, Israel says that 1,050 have entered in total. The GHF said on Tuesday that it had distributed 462,000 meals – enough for just over 50,000 people, about 2% of Gaza’s population, for three days. While the operation is now meant to scale up, that is a vanishingly small number against the scale of the need. With those numbers in mind, Emma said, “it is difficult to see this as anything other than performative. It is not even the beginning of a solution.” What other reasons might there be for the change? Benjamin Netanyahuhas insistedthat warnings of famine are merely “the current fad, the current lie” – although Israeli officials are saidto take a different viewin private. Instead, Netanyahu has framed the operation as “a diplomatic issue”. With media and even diplomats kept out of Gaza, and Palestinians treated as unreliable sources in parts of the media, humanitarian workers have often provided compelling eyewitness evidence of the human cost of Israel’s assault on the territory. “There are those who see this operation as a way to remove those independent observers,” Emma said. The darkest fears about the attempt to concentrate food supplies in a few sites — forcing civilians to cluster around them - are connected to the fact that the locations are concentrated in the south, and are likely to mean Palestinians elsewhere will be again displaced in search of food. Some humanitarian organisations see that as a prelude to mass deportation – a step backed by influential Israeli cabinet ministers which, when taken together with the scale of the violence visited upon Palestinians in Gaza since the war began, would strengthen the case that Israel is committing genocide. Earlier this month, the far-right Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrichsaid that“Gaza will be entirely destroyed, civilians will be sent to … the south to a humanitarian zone without Hamas or terrorism, and from there they will start to leave in great numbers to third countries.” Who is running the programme? When the new system was announced earlier this month, Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel,said thatit was “wholly inaccurate” to call it an Israeli plan. Of Tuesday’s operation, Emma said that she had been told that Palestinians were handing out the supplies, and photos showed some stamped with the logo of charities already operating in Gaza. But even when the scheme was announced, there were reports that the Israeli government was heavily involved in its creation. And on Saturday, the New York Times reported that the plan wasfirst conceived in December 2023by an Israeli group with close ties to the government, and that from the beginning it was viewed at least in part as a way to undermine Hamas.

    "title": "Vet complaint process in UK often ‘stacked against pet owners’",
    "article_text": "Britain’s pet owners often face an uphill struggle when they are unhappy with their vet because the industry’s complaints system is not fit for purpose, according to a leading consumer body. The findings from Which? that the complaints process “is often stacked against pet owners” come as the UK competition watchdogis investigating the veterinary sectoramid concerns that above-inflation price hikes and other issues mean consumers are not getting a fair deal. Well more than half of UK households have one or more pets, with numbers increasing dramatically during the pandemic. However, Which? said pet owners were often put off making a complaint when there was a problem, and that those who did often had limited options for taking the matter forward or were left feeling their issue had been unfairly dismissed. Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at the consumer body, said: “It is completely unjust that many pet owners feel not only unhappy with the service and treatment received by their vet when their pet is taken ill, but also lack the means to make a complaint that will be properly investigated.” In its survey of more than 1,000 pet owners who had experienced some kind of problem with their vet during the past two years, pricing was the most common issue raised. More than half said the price of care or treatment was excessive, while more than a quarter said the cost was higher than they thought it would be. The third most common issue was quality of care, followed by customer service, not being given the relevant information, being charged the wrong price, and the vet or practice making a mistake. The first port of call when making a complaint is usually the practice itself. Many of the pet owners in the survey who had been put off making a claim said they did not think they would be successful, did not want to fall out with their vet, or did not know how to complain in the first place. “Very few” owners then went on to escalate the complaint, and those who did found that the options available were often inadequate,said Which?. There is the Veterinary Client Mediation Service (VCMS), but this is a voluntary complaints scheme. Meanwhile, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) has the responsibility for investigating all “concerns” raised with it about vets – but Which? claimed it had “very high thresholds” for investigating and progressing a complaint, “leaving pet owners feeling dismissed, or that the process is biased in favour of veterinary professionals”. Steph Drew, from Lincoln, told Which? that the complaints system was “designed to protect vets”. Her dog Daisy was left injured when her vet operated on the wrong leg. Drew complained to the RCVS, but her case was initially dismissed after a year, said the consumer organisation. After appealing against the decision, the case went on for three years, finally ending in a disciplinary hearing. The vet has now been struck off and found by the RCVS to have failed to provide adequate care to 18 animals in total, said Which?. Earlier this monththe UK Competition and Markets Authority – which has been investigating rising costs and other issues in the multibillion-pound sector – said it had “concerns that … firms’ internal complaint handling processes may be inconsistent and operate poorly, and that the external redress mechanism provided by the VCMS is not as effective as it could be”. It also found there were “shortcomings” with the RCVS code of conduct. Sign up toHeadlines UK Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion A VCMS spokesperson told Which? it could not comment on individual cases but added: “Last year we received more than 3,500 inquiries from pet owners, and the VCMS helped resolve over 80% of complaints … It continues to develop the mediation process to improve outcomes and satisfaction for consumers and practice teams, as well as the delivery of veterinary care.” The RCVS said it had been asking the government to reform the current legislation “for some years”, adding: “Our current remit is relatively narrow and focuses on regulating the individual professionals and not practices, which have never been regulated. We support proposals to enhance consumer protection, and mandatory practice regulation.” It said that under current legislation it could only investigate allegations of serious professional misconduct. A spokesperson added that “the facts presented in the [Which?] case studies do not completely align with those reported to us”.",

    "title": "New AI test can predict which men will benefit from prostate cancer drug",
    "article_text": "Doctors have developed an artificial intelligence tool that can predict which men with prostate cancer will benefit from a drug that halves the risk of dying. Abiraterone has been described as a “gamechanger” treatment for the disease, which is the most common form of cancer in men in more than 100 countries. It has already helped hundreds of thousands with advanced prostate cancer to live longer. But some countries, including England, havestopped shortof offering the “spectacular” drug more widely to men whose disease has not spread. Now a team from the US, UK and Switzerland have built an AI test that shows which men would most likely benefit from abiraterone. The “exciting” breakthrough will enable healthcare systems to roll out the drug to more men, and spare others unnecessary treatment. The AI test is being unveiled in Chicago at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the world’s largest cancer conference. Nick James, professor of prostate and bladder cancer research at the Institute ofCancerResearch in London and a consultant clinical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust, co-led the team that built it. “Abiraterone has already hugely improved the outlook for hundreds of thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer,” said James. “We know that for many men with cancer that has not yet spread, it can also have spectacular results. “But it does come with side-effects and requires additional monitoring for potential issues with high blood pressure or liver abnormalities. It can also slightly increase the risk of diabetes and heart attacks, so knowing who is most likely to benefit is very valuable. “This research shows that we can pick out the people who will respond best to abiraterone, and those who will do well from standard treatment alone – hormone therapy and radiotherapy.” The test uses AI to study images of tumours and pick out features invisible to the human eye. The team, funded by Prostate Cancer UK, the Medical Research Council and Artera, trialled the test on biopsy images from more than 1,000 men with high-risk prostate cancer that had not spread. The AI test identified the 25% of men in the group most likely to benefit from the abiraterone – for these men, the drug halves the risk of death. In the trial, patients received a score – biomarker-positive or -negative – which was compared with their outcomes. For those with biomarker-positive tumours, one in four of the men, abiraterone cut their risk of death after five years from 17% to 9%. For those with biomarker-negative tumours, abiraterone cut the risk of death from 7% to 4% – a difference that was not statistically or clinically significant, the team said. These men would benefit from standard therapy alone and be spared unnecessary treatment. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The study co-leader Prof Gert Attard, of the UCL Cancer Institute, said: “This study shows, in a very large cohort of patients, that novel algorithms can be used to extract information from routinely available pathology slides to tailor these treatments to specific patients and minimise over treatment whilst maximising the chance of cure.” James said that because fewer men than previously thought would need the drug, healthcare systems should consider giving it to men whose cancer had not spread. It is approved for NHS use in England for advanced prostate cancer, but not for newly diagnosed high-risk disease that has not spread. However, it has been available for men with this indication in Scotland and Wales for two years. “Abiraterone costs just £77 per pack, compared with the thousands of pounds that new drugs cost,” said James. “I truly hope that this new research – showing precisely who needs the drug to live well for longer – will lead to NHS England reviewing their decision not to fund abiraterone for high-risk prostate cancer that has not spread.” Dr Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, described the AI test as “exciting”. He added: “We therefore echo the researchers’ urgent call for abiraterone to be made available to those men whose lives it can save – men who, thanks to this research, we can now identify more precisely than ever before.”",

    "article_text": "Reform UK will accept donations through bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,Nigel Faragehas announced. During an appearance at theBitcoinConference in Las Vegas, where he was introduced as a “UK presidential candidate”, Farage said: “As of now, provided you are an eligible UK donor … we are the first political party in Britain that can accept donations in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.” He said Reform was planning to introduce a cryptoassets and digital finance bill. This would cut capital gains tax on cryptoassets from 24% to 10%, turning the UK into a “crypto powerhouse”, he said. Farage added that the crypto legislation that his party had drawn up would include a “bitcoin digital reserve in the Bank of England”. Farage said the bill would make it illegal for banks to debank customers who use and trade in cryptocurrency. On Thursday the Reform website was updated to accept cryptocurrency donations. There was a disclaimer stating that all donations were subject to Electoral Commission rules and that anonymous donations were not permissible. At the conference, Farage called the acceptance of political donations “innovative”, before commending America for being “ahead” with their stance on digital assets. “My message to the British public, and my message particularly to young people, is to help us to help you bring our country properly into the 21st century,” he said. “Let’s recognise that crypto and digital assets are here to stay.” During his talk, Farage criticised the current Labour government and the previous Conservative regime’s lack of action in the cryptocurrency world. He said: “Rishi Sunak, when he was briefly prime minister, made one speech about crypto … and how London used to be a global financial centre. One speech and nothing else. Labour, well we have 25 men and women in cabinet and not a single one of them has worked in private business.” AReform UKspokesperson said cryptocurrency donations would be accepted by the party and details were expected to be announced on Friday. Reform UK is listed on Companies House as a private company majority controlled by the leader, not a members’ association like other parties. The company that owns Reform UK is listed as Reform 2025, a not-for-profit company that has just two members and two directors: Farage andZia Yusuf.",

    "title": "Dismay as UK prepares to sign ‘values-free’ £1.6bn trade deal with Gulf states",
    "article_text": "The UK is on the brink of signing a £1.6bn trade agreement with Gulf states, amid warnings from rights groups that the deal makes no concrete provisions on human rights, modern slavery or the environment. The deal with the Gulf Cooperation Council – which includes the countries Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and theUnited Arab Emirates– is within touching distance, making it a fourth trading agreement by Keir Starmer after pacts were struck with the US, India and the EU. The UK has said it hopes the deal will eventually add an extra £8.6bn a year to trade between the UK and GCC countries by 2035. Sources close to the negotiations in the oil-rich region said the deal was now at its final stages and they expected UK agreement imminently. The deal is likely to be particularly beneficial for the car industry and financial services, though estimates suggest that a free trade agreement would be worth less than 0.1% of GDP over the next decade. However, there is likely to be a backlash over a deal on chicken imports, where lower animal welfare standards could significantly undercut British farmers. The TUC is among those who have urged caution over the deal and has raised concerns with ministers, the Guardian understands. Human rights groups have previously said the UK should not finalise a free trade agreement without legal commitments on human rights improvements, especially for migrant workers. They said that the UK and GCC should have strong human rights conditions in any future agreement and the UK should provide its own independent impact assessment transparently on the potential consequences of deepening trade ties. Another source close to the talks suggested that though there were likely to be some language around human rights as part of the commitments, there were no legal obligations involved. A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: “Negotiations on a trade deal with the GCC are ongoing. Our priority is to get the right deal, and we’re not setting a deadline.” A departmental source said there was a possibility a pause would be needed for Eid al-Adha, which begins on 6 June. The UK-GCC trade agreement is also likely to have an impact on the UK’s net zero ambitions, with all six GCC countries ranking in the top 10 per capita for carbon emissions. The TUC’s general secretary, Paul Nowak, said: “The TUC has raised concerns directly with ministers about a trade deal with the Gulf states and we will continue to do so. “Our view on trade deals is consistent – the government should not agree deals with countries that abuse human rights and workers’ rights, and violate international law. It was right for the government to suspend trade talks with Israel. “We will continue to make the case with ministers for a trade agenda with workers at its heart – and to press the issue of labour standards and human rights in the Gulf states and other countries.” Tom Wills, the director of the Trade Justice Movement, said: “The UK-GCC trade deal is a values-free agreement that will offer minimal benefit to the UK economy while signalling that human rights and environmental protections are not a priority in UK trade policy. “The government has chosen to finalise this deal without publishing a human rights impact assessment, securing binding commitments on labour rights or environmental standards, or allowing parliament any meaningful scrutiny. It’s a continuation of a secretive, short-term approach to trade that puts corporate access above public values.” Wills said that warm words around rights in the deal would still mean it fell short of comparable standards. “When we see progressive language in a trade deal – around supporting workers or the environment – we always ask the same question: is it binding? Will there be consequences for failing to uphold standards? If not, these warm words aren’t worth the paper they’re written on,” he said. Ministers are also likely to face a backlash from the National Farmers’ Union over the agricultural aspects of the deal. Industry figures told the Guardian that the deal could include uncapped access for chickens if the imports met hygiene standards. Those standards do not cover welfare, sparking alarm among farmers who have recently had to meet new, higher requirements under British law. Negotiations have been led by trade minister Douglas Alexander, who is set to conclude work started under the Conservatives, which was once seen as a more concrete prospect than the India deal, signed a fortnight ago. Alexander is expected to meet his counterpart for final signoff. The previous trade minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan had promised in parliament that the deal “will not come at the expense of human rights”. MPs have pointed out that there is precedent for including rights concerns in trade deal, such as the chapter on Indigenous peoples in the New Zealand deal which makes commitments on their part in their nation’s future progress. Nick Thomas-Symonds, who was then shadow trade secretary,said in oppositionthat it was “crucial that human rights, women’s rights and workers’ rights are embedded in UK trade negotiations”. But in the most recent exchanges under the Labour government, Lords trade minister Baroness Jones said that although the UK was a “leading advocate for human rights around the world … this work takes place separately to negotiations on free trade agreements. “While aspects of trade policy can provide the opportunity to address other issues in a bilateral relationship, free trade agreements are not generally the most effective or targeted tool to advance human rights issues,” she told the Lords last year. The UAE trade minister Dr Thani bin Ahmed al-Zeyouditold Politico in 2023that the UK and other western countries must “tone down” standard human and workers’ rights provisions in trade deals “if they want more market access and more business opportunities”. Trade with the bloc is worth about £59bn a year, according to government estimates, as the UK’s seventh-largest export market, with a trade deal expected to increase trade by about 16%. Individual Gulf states could also pursue their own deeper partnerships with the UK and sovereign wealth funds in Gulf nations includingSaudi Arabiaand the UAE have been some of the biggest foreign investors in the UK. The trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and Alexander chose the Gulf for their first joint international visit after the election. Starmer visited Saudi Arabia in December. The UK has previously pledged that the deal will not compromise environmental, public health, animal welfare and food standards, made all the more pressing because of the agrifoods deal the UK hopes to seal with the EU in the coming months. The NHS and health services are excluded from the deal. Technology, innovation and financial services will form a key part of the deal which is also likely to have some work and visa provisions for businesspeople from both the UK and the Gulf states – another area that could provoke attack from the Conservatives and Reform, though most of the deal was negotiated under the Tories. Joey Shea, a Saudi Arabia and UAE researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “Finalising a UK-GCC trade agreement without concrete rights protections would be a grave mistake with grim consequences for migrant workers across the Gulf.” Polling conducted by the Trades Justice Movement in November 2024suggested there was public opposition to the deal, with just 21% of people in favour. The TUC previously submitted evidenceduring the Conservative negotiations over the deal, saying that the“kafala” system– which involvesbinding migrant workers to a specific employer – had entrenched modern slavery and exploited millions of migrant workers.",

    "title": "‘Revolutionary’ DNA blood test to offer thousands in England tailored cancer care",
    "article_text": "Thousands of cancer patients inEnglandare to benefit from a DNA blood test that saves lives by fast-tracking them on to personalised treatments. In a world-first, theNHSwill offer patients with lung and breast cancer – two of the most common forms of the disease – a liquid biopsy that detects tiny fragments of tumour DNA. Rapid results from the groundbreaking test mean patients can immediately be offered drugs and treatments specifically tailored to the genetic profile of their disease, significantly increasing their survival chances and paving the way for a new era of precision medicine. Details of the rollout were revealed on the eve of the world’s largest cancer conference, the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. The launch of the national scheme comes after results from pilots of the test stunned senior doctors and NHS leaders. Prof Peter Johnson, NHS England’s clinical director for cancer, said: “Liquid biopsies are leading us into a new era of personalised cancer care and it’s fantastic that we are now able to expand the use of this revolutionary test on the NHS to help tailor treatment for thousands of patients across the country. “Cutting-edge genomic testing is helping us deliver more targeted and kinder care for patients, enabling some to avoid more intensive treatments such as further chemotherapy, which can have a huge impact. We are already seeing the difference this test can make in lung and breast cancer – and we hope to roll it out for patients with other forms of cancer in the near future. “As research progresses, it’s exciting that this approach has the potential to help us scan the body in a single blood test to see where and how cancer may be developing and target it with speed and precision to help save more lives.” The liquid biopsy can mean patients receive targeted therapy up to two weeks earlier, while helping some to avoid further tests and treatments including chemotherapy. The NHS is the first healthcare system in the world to introduce a “blood test-first” approach to diagnosing lung cancer, with the test to be used before traditional tissue biopsies for the first time. The DNA blood test involves the patient providing a blood sample, which is then processed in NHS genomic labs in Manchester and London. The results come within days, and tell the patient’s doctor what the best targeted therapy is to attack the patient’s particular tumour. After the pilots, at least 15,000 patients with suspected lung cancer are expected to benefit from the test every year. The NHS is also bringing in the testing for advanced breast cancer patients, with four genetic variations now being screened for, and 5,000 women expected to benefit each year. An economic assessment of the pilots showed the test could save the NHS £11m a year in lung cancer care alone. The NHS is also aiming to bring in the liquid biopsy for other forms of the disease, including pancreatic and gallbladder cancer. Prof Dame Sue Hill, the chief scientific officer for England, said: “This represents a real step-change in care for eligible lung and breast cancer patients on the NHS. “The liquid biopsy testing enables genomic mutations in the fragments of cancer that enter the blood stream of these patients to be detected. This testing is transforming care and helping clinicians match patients earlier – especially when cancer tissue may not be available – with potentially life-extending targeted therapies rapidly and with greater precision. “This test is a great example of the NHS harnessing the power of genomic technological advances to enable the latest groundbreaking treatment to be delivered to patients.” The liquid biopsy will be made available to all eligible lung and breast cancer patients in NHS hospitals across England. The blood test looks for circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) to find specific genetic variations of cancer. Pilot data showed that in some cases, patients received the DNA test results 16 days earlier than the standard cancer tissue biopsy approach, a painful and invasive procedure. As well as speeding up access to new treatments, the DNA test also helped patients avoid repeat diagnostic procedures and unnecessary treatment such as standard chemotherapy and its side effects, while also improving their quality of life, the pilots found. Prof Alastair Greystoke, co-clinical lead of the lung cancer pilots and honorary medical oncologist at Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: “This is the first ever national implementation of a ‘liquid biopsy first’ approach to the diagnosis and treatment of a cancer. “Not only has it led to faster and more precise treatment for patients with lung cancer, but we have also been able to show that this is a cost-effective measure for the NHS and set up the framework to evaluate this in other cancers going forward.” Prof Sanjay Popat, consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden and co-clinical lead of the pilots, said: “This is fantastic news and an important step forward for lung and breast cancer patients in England. We have seen first-hand how the implementation of a simple blood-draw and testing in our laboratory has revolutionised treatment. “Earlier access to highly effective targeted medicines allows more patients to avoid delays, start treatment early, and start the best treatment for their type of cancer. I am really pleased that we are now able to roll out this out nationally.”",

    "article_text": "Hundreds of people packed inside a local auditorium on Thursday to see the hit filmSinners, set in their community and steeped inMississippiDelta culture. The special screening of the blockbuster horror film included an appearance by directorRyan Cooglerand was made possible by a community petition. “I have family fromMississippi– my uncle, my grandfather – and I had never been until working on this script,” Coogler said, addressing the crowd. “It really changed me, just to come here.” The movie, starringMichael B Jordanas twins, is about two brothers coming home to Mississippi to launch a juke joint. It’s also a supernatural vampire flick that blends elements of drama, action and music. Sinners composer Ludwig Göransson, actor Miles Caton and others who worked on the film also attended the screening. “Any time that filmmakers take the time out to pay homage to the Delta, especially, because we’re the root of music, the blues culture, that means a lot,” said Brandice Brown Williams, a theater teacher who brought two of her students to the screening. The film is set in 1930s Clarksdale, Mississippi, but current-day Clarksdale doesn’t have a movie theater, making it difficult for people to see the film about their hometown. Community organizers decided to change that, starting a petition to invite the cast and crew to Clarksdale and to collaborate on hosting a public screening. “The love you have for southern folk, Mississippians and Clarksdale came to life through your commitment to writing us right,” community organizer Tyler Yarbrough said. “We are ready. We are waiting. And we would be proud to welcome you back to where it all began.” During the screening, the crowd was expressive – in response to various scenes, they gasped, laughed and cheered. Afterward, Coogler and others stayed for a Q&A. One attendee, Cindy Hurst, praised the film, calling it a “really good visual representation of the beauty of the Black culture”.",

    "title": "The chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk formally exited his role in theTrump administrationon Wednesday night, ending a contentious and generally unpopular run as a senior adviser to the president and de facto head of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge). Though he promised efficiency and modernization, Musk leaves behind a trail of uncertainty and reduced functionality. The timing of Musk’s departure lines up with the end of his 130-day term limit as a “special government employee” but also plays a part in an effort by the billionaire to signala wider shift away from Washingtonas he faces backlash from the public and shareholders. Musk has recently made a show of refocusing his efforts on his tech companies in interviews, saying that he has spent too much time focused on politics and plans to reduce his political spending in the future. As Musk moves on, he consigns a mess of half-realized plans and gutted agencies to his acolytes installed in key positions across the federal government. His departure throws Doge’salready chaotic impact on the governmentinto an even grayer limbo, with questions over how much power the nebulous taskforce will have without him and who, if anyone, might rebuild the programs and services it destroyed. Musk’s initial pitch for Doge was to save $2tn from the budget by rooting out rampant waste and fraud, as well as to conduct an overhaul of government software that would modernize how federal agencies operate. Doge so far has claimed to cut about $140bn from the budget – although its “wall of receipts” isnotorious for containing errorsthat overestimate its savings. Donald Trump’s new tax bill, though not part of Doge and opposed by Musk, is alsoexpected to add $2.3tn to the deficit, nullifying any savings Doge may have achieved. Its promises of a new, modernized software have frequently been limited to AI chatbots – some of which werealready in the works underthe Biden administration. The greater impact of Doge has instead been its dismantling of government services and humanitarian aid. Doge’s cuts have targeted a swath of agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organization, which handles weather and natural disaster forecasting andplunged otherssuch as the Department of Veterans Affairs into crises. Numeroussmaller agencies, such as one thatcoordinates policy on homelessness, have been in effect shut down. Doge has brought several bureaus to their knees, with no clear plan of whether the staff Musk leaves behind will try to update or maintain their services or simply shut them off. In one early example of its cuts and the holes in government they have created, Doge targeted the government tech group that partnered with federal agencies to provide tech solutions,known as 18F. When Doge staffers entered the General Services Administration agency that housed the 18F Office, former employees have said they appeared to fundamentally misunderstand how the government operates and the challenges of creating public services. Former 18F director Lindsay Young, who is now part of a legal appeal that contends the firing of 18F violated legal requirements, is concerned that Doge’s cuts will have long-lasting effects on government functions. “In government, it’s just so much easier to tear things down than it is to build things up,” Young said. Themass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Servicesrepresented a similar loss of institutional knowledge that Doge does not seem intent on replacing. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who has been tracking Doge’s cuts, used the agency’s tobacco unit as an example, which was severely affected by the cuts. “The loss of so much expertise, especially in the healthcare area will mean that more Americans will become sick or die earlier than they might have,” he said. “It also may take many years and great expenditure of resources to restore that experience and expertise.” Musk’s gutting of USAid, formerly the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, is one of the starkest examples of the disarray and harm that Doge’s cuts have caused. TheUS canceled approximately 83%of USAid programs, imperiling services around the world aimed at humanitarian assistance and disease prevention. Onepioneering program under USAid, Pepfar, whichcoordinates the US HIV/Aids response, has seen its services reduced worldwide and its staff left in confusion over what they can still do for people who relied on their organization. Doge’s cuts to the program have likewise threatened the rollout ofa new anti-HIV drugthat researchers have hailed as a “miracle” for its effectiveness. As Musk returns to Tesla and SpaceX, the agencies he laid waste to are left to pick up the pieces. Sign up toTechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion While Musk is returning to his tech empire, many of the former employees and inexperienced young engineers whom he hired to work for Doge are set to remain part of the government. One of the largest questions about what Doge’s future looks like is whether these staffers, some of whom gained near unfettered access to the government’s most sensitive data, will retain the same powers they enjoyed under Musk. Doge staffers, such as billionaire investor and Musk ally Antonio Gracias, have embedded themselves at key agencies such as the Social Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration. They have worked as a sort of parallel government task force, operating with a lack of transparency as their attempts to access databases and migrate data hascaused disarrayand technical problems. Whether Trump and agency heads allow them to continue on with carte blanche remains unseen. Already at least two prominent Doge staffers have followed Musk to the exit. The billionaire’s longtime top lieutenant Steve Davis, who was running the day-to-day operations of Doge, left his role on Thursday. Spokesperson Katie Miller, wife of Trump’s deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, also left the White House to work full-time for Musk,according to CNN. Some of Musk’s dictates have already been rolled back since he left Washington earlier this month, including a much-derided mandate that required federal employees to send a list of five things that they accomplished each week. The weekly email, which was initially introduced with the threat of being fired for non-compliance, was largely ignored and viewed by many as pointless busywork. On Wednesday, the Pentagonformally announcedthat it would halt the practice. Doge is not being left leaderless, however. Taking over for Musk, accordingto the Wall Street Journal, is Christian nationalist and key figure in the rightwing Project 2025 manifesto Russ Vought. A longtime believer that the president should have sweeping executive powers, Vought has said that he wants federal employees to beleft “in trauma”and to slash federal funding. Musk has praised Doge’s work and pledged that it will continue without him, and as recently as this week is stillremoving veteran officialsit disagrees with from federal agencies. Even at reduced numbers, Musk’s allies also still have access to immense amounts of sensitive and confidential data they arereportedly intending to useto surveil immigrants. What seems farther away than ever in the chaos, however, is Musk’s promise to make the government more efficient and better serve the public. “You don’t need that many people to decide to just cut things,” 18F’s Young said. “But if you actually want to build things, that takes thought. It takes effort.”",

    "title": "Federal appeals court temporarily reinstates Trump tariffs",
    "article_text": "A federal appeals court has temporarily reinstated (PDF) US President Donald Trump’s tariffs a day after a trade court ruled that it exceeded the authorities granted to the president. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington temporarily blocked the lower court’s decision on Thursday, but provided no reasoning for the decision, only giving the plaintiffs until June 5th to respond. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted an emergency motion from the Trump administration arguing that a halt is “critical for the country’s national security”. The White House has applauded the move. “You can assume, even if we lose tariff cases, we will find another way,” trade adviser Peter Navarro said. The administration has not made a final decision and it could wait to impose any plans after a federal appeals court on Thursday temporarily reinstated the most sweeping of Trump’s tariffs following a trade court ruling to immediately block them, the report added. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday evening that the White House is considering imposing tariffs of 15 percent for 150 days on US trade partners by invoking a little known provision of the 1974 Trade Act, citing people familiar with the matter. The stop gap measure would buy the Trump administration time to draft individual tariff schemes for its trading partners using a separate provision of the same law targeting unfair trade practices, the report said. The process would be lengthy and complex, but would put the tariffs on a much stronger legal foundation. Discussions are reportedly still underway at the White House, according to the Journal. Wednesday’s surprise rulingby the US Court of International Trade had threatened to halt or delay Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs on most US trading partners, as well as import levies on goods from Canada, Mexico and China related to his accusation that the three countries were facilitating the flow of fentanyl into the US. The International Court of Trade said tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which is typically used to address issues of national emergencies rather than addressing the national debt, were considered overreach. Experts said the IEEPA, which was passed in 1977, is narrow in scope and targets specific countries, US-designated “terrorist organisations”, or gang activity pegged to specific instances. The US, for example, used the law to seize property belonging to the government of Iran during the hostage crisis in 1979 and the property of drug traffickers in Colombia in 1995. “The 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act doesn’t say anything at all about tariffs,” Bruce Fain, a former US associate deputy attorney general under Ronald Reagan, told Al Jazeera. Fein added that there is a statute, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows tariffs in the event of a national emergency. However, he said, it requires a study by the commerce secretary and can only be imposed on a product-by-product basis. Despite the appeal court’s reprieve, Wednesday’s decision has been viewed as a blow to the administration’s economic agenda that has thus far led to declining consumer confidence and the US losing its top credit rating. Experts believe that, ultimately,the tariffs will not last. Posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Thursday, lawyer Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote that, if the trade court’s decision “is upheld, importers should eventually be able to get a refund of [IEEPA] tariffs paid to date. But the government will probably seek to avoid paying refunds until appeals are exhausted.″ “The power to decide the level of tariffs resides with Congress. The IEEPA doesn’t even mention raising tariffs. And it was actually passed in order to narrow the president’s authority. Now the president is using it to rewrite the tariff schedule for the whole world,” Greg Schaffer, professor of international law at Georgetown Law School, told Al Jazeera. The US trade court did not weigh in on tariffs put in place by other laws, such as the Trade Expansion Act – the law used to justify tariffs on steel, aluminium, and automobiles. There are additional targets for similar narrow tariffs, such aspharmaceuticals from China.In April, the White House announced that the US Department of Commerce launched an investigation to see if the US reliance on China for active ingredients in key medications posed a national security threat, thus warranting tariffs. “This is not an issue of whether the president can impose tariffs,” said Fein, the former associate deputy attorney general. “He can under the 1962 act after there’s a study and after showing that it’s not arbitrary and capricious and that it’s a product-by-product, not a country-by-country approach.” “If he doesn’t like that, he can ask Congress to amend the statute.”",

    "title": "‘This must stop now’: UN food body condemns RSF attacks on Sudan premises",
    "article_text": "The World Food Programme (WFP) has said it is “shocked and alarmed” that its premises in southwestern Sudan have been hit by repeated shelling from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), as the paramilitary group wages a brutal civil war, now in its third year, with the Sudanese army. “Humanitarian staff, assets, operations and supplies should never be a target. This must stop now”, the United Nations body said on X on Thursday. #Sudanpic.twitter.com/c4aXtS9zhY — WFP Media (@WFP_Media)May 29, 2025 El-Fasher is the last major city held by the Sudanese army in the Darfur region. It has witnessed intense fighting between the army and RSF since May 2024, despite international warnings about the risks of violence in a city that serves as a key humanitarian hub for the five Darfur states. For more than a year, the RSF has sought to wrest control of el-Fasher, located more than 800km (500 miles) southwest of the capital, Khartoum, from the army, launching regular attacks on the city and two major famine-hit camps for displaced people on its outskirts. Adding to humanitarian woes on the ground, the Health Ministry in Khartoum state on Thursday reported 942 new cholera infections and 25 deaths the previous day, following 1,177 cases and 45 deaths the day before. Aid workers say the scale of the cholera outbreak is deteriorating due to the near-total collapse of health services, with about 90 percent of hospitals in key war zones no longer operational. Since August 2024, Sudan has reported more than 65,000suspected cholera casesand at least 1,700 deaths across 12 of its 18 states. Khartoum alone has seen 7,700 cases and 185 deaths, including more than 1,000 infections in children under five, as it contends with more than two years of fighting between the army and the RSF. Sudan’s army-backed government in Khartoum state announced earlier this month that all relief initiatives in the state must register with the Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC), a government body that oversees humanitarian operations in Sudan. Aid workers and activists are fearful these regulations willlead to a crackdownon local relief volunteers, exacerbating the catastrophic hunger crisis affecting 25 million people across the country. The HAC was given expanded powers to register, monitor and, critics argue, crack down on local and Western aid groups by former leader Omar al-Bashir in 2006, according to aid groups, local relief volunteers and experts. The army-backed government announced last week that it had dislodged RSF fighters from their last bases in Khartoum state, two months after retaking the heart of the capital from the paramilitaries. The city, nonetheless, remains devastated with health and sanitation infrastructure barely functioning. The RSF has been battling the SAF for control of Sudan since April 2023. The civil war has killed more than 20,000 people, uprooted 15 million and created what the UN considers the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.",

    "title": "Chinese students in US grapple with uncertainty over Trump’s visa policies",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –For Anson, hearing the news that Chinese student visas were the latest target of US President Donald Trump’s administration was “heartbreaking”. The Chinese graduate student, who is studying foreign service at Georgetown University, told Al Jazeera that he feels uncertain about the future of students like himself after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced theUS would begin to “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields”. “There is definitely a degree of uncertainty and anxiety observed amongst us,” Anson said, asking that only his first name be used. The Trump administration has offered little further clarity on which students would be affected, with some observers seeing the two-sentence announcement, which also vowed to “revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny” for future visa applicants from China and Hong Kong, as intentionally vague. While 23-year-old Anson said he understood the US government had concerns about foreign influence and national security when it came to China, he was confused as to why the Trump administration’s new policy was potentially sowide reaching. Most students from his homeland, he said, were just like the other more than one million students who study every year in the US, a country that is known both for its educational opportunities and for its “inclusivity and broad demographics”. “It is heartbreaking for many of us to see a country built by immigrants becoming more xenophobic and hostile to the rest of the world,” he said, adding that he and other Chinese students in the US were still trying to decipher the policy shift. It is not the first time the Trump administration has taken aim at Chinese students, with the US Department of Justice in 2018, during Trump’s first term, launching the so-called “China Initiative” with the stated aim of combatting “trade secret theft, hacking, and economic espionage”. An MIT analysis insteadshowedthe programme focused predominantly on researchers and academics of Chinese descent, in what criticssaidamounted to “racial profiling and fear mongering”. It was discontinued in February 2022 by the administration of former US President Joe Biden. Since then, there has only been “greater and greater suspicion in the US, almost on a bipartisan basis, of various aspects of Chinese technology, actions by Beijing around the world, and now these concerns about surveillance and spying within the US”, according to Kyle Chan, a researcher on China at Princeton University. That included a Republican-led congressional report in September 2024 that claimed hundreds of millions of US tax dollars – funneled through US-China partnerships at universities – helped Beijing develop critical technologies, including those related to semiconductors, artificial intelligence, hypersonic weapons, and nuclear capabilities. But Chan, while acknowledging “genuine security concerns” exist, said the broad announcement from the Trump administration did not appear to actually address those concerns. Instead, it has sent “shock waves of fear throughout university campuses across the country”, he said. That uncertainty has been compounded by Trump’s recent pressure campaigns on US universities, which most recently involved asince-blockedrevocation of Harvard University’s ability to enrol international students. “I think the vagueness is part of the [Trump administration’s] strategy, because it is not about a concrete policy,” Chan told Al Jazeera. “I don’t think it’s really, at the end of the day, about national security and trying to find the few individuals who may pose a genuine risk.” Instead, he saw the move as aimed at Trump’s political audience, those sitting at an “overlap between people who are very anxious about immigrants in general, and people who are very anxious about China”. The administration has offered little clarity on the scope of the visa revocations, or how it will define students with “connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields”. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce gave few further specifics, saying only that the department “will continue to use every tool in our tool chest to make sure that we know who it is who wants to come into this country and if they should be allowed to come in”. “The United States, I further can say here, will not tolerate the CCP’s exploitation of US universities or theft of US research, intellectual property or technologies to grow its military power, conduct intelligence collection or repress voices of opposition,” she said. Despite the dearth of clarity, the eventual shape of the policy will determine just how “disruptive” it could be, according to Cole McFaul, a research analyst at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University. He pointed to “real concerns about research security and about illicit IP [intellectual property] transfer” when it comes to Beijing, noting there have been a handful of documented cases of such activity in recent years. “My hope is that this is a targeted action based on evidence and an accurate assessment of risk that takes into account the costs and the benefits,” McFaul said. “My worry is that this will lead to broad-based, large-scale revocations of visas for Chinese students operating in STEM subjects,” he said, referencing the abbreviation for science, technology, engineering and mathematics. McFaul noted that about 80 percent of the estimated 277,000 Chinese students who study in the US annually are in STEM subjects, in what he described as “an enormously important talent pipeline from China to the United States for the past 40 years”. A vast majority of Chinese PhDs in STEM subjects – also about 80 percent – tend to stay in the US after their studies, in what McFaul described as another major benefit to the US. “The question is, what counts as someone who’s working in a critical technology? Are life sciences critical? I would say ‘yes’. Are the physical sciences critical? I’d say ‘yes’. Is computer science critical? Is engineering critical?” McFaul said. “So there’s a world where the vast majority of Chinese students are disallowed from studying in the United States, which would be an enormous loss and tremendous disruption for the United States science and technology ecosystem,” he said. As the policy remains foggy, Chinese students in the US said they are monitoring the often fickle winds of the Trump administration. Su, a 23-year-old applied analytics graduate student at Columbia University, said she swiftly changed her plans to travel home to China this summer amid the uncertainty. “I was afraid if I go back to China, I won’t be able to come back to the US for when classes begin,” said Su, who asked to only use her last name given the “sensitive” situation. “When Trump announces something, we never know if it’s going to be effective or not,” she told Al Jazeera. “It’s always changing”. Deng, a graduate student at Georgetown who also asked that his full name not be used, said he broadly agreed that reforms were needed to address issues related to Chinese influence in US academia. Those included intimidation of political dissidents, the spread of nationalist propaganda, and “oligarchy corruption”, he said. But, in an email to Al Jazeera, he said the administration’s approach was misguided. “The current measures not only do not achieve such goals,” he said, “but [are] also generating unnecessary fear even among the Chinese student communities that have long been fully committed to the development and enrichment of US society.”",

    "title": "Israel orders closure of al-Awda Hospital, a ‘lifeline’ in north Gaza",
    "article_text": "Israel has ordered the closure of al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza, leaving health officials scrambling to relocate dozens of people who remain at the medical facility, as deadly bombardment and starvation rack the besieged enclave. At least 70 Palestinians were killed inIsraeli attackssince the early hours of Thursday. The Gaza Health Ministry calledIsrael’s push, which forced the hospital out of commission, a “continuation of the violations and crimes” against the medical sector in the territory. Al-Awda was the last operating hospital in northern Gaza, according to health officials. Shutting down the hospital came amid continued Israeli forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, the latest order late on Thursday impacting large numbers of people north and east of Gaza City. “The Health Ministry calls on all concerned sides to ensure protection for the health system in the Gaza Strip, as guaranteed by international and humanitarian laws,” the ministry said in a statement. The World Health Organization (WHO) said 97 people, including 13 patients, are still at the hospital. The United Nations agency is planning a mission on Friday to transfer the patients to another facility. “Due to impassable roads, the hospital’s medical equipment cannot be relocated,” WHO said in a statement. “With Al-Awda’s closure, there is no remaining functional hospital in North Gaza — severing a critical lifeline for the people there.” WHO pleaded “for the hospital’s protection and staff and patients’ safety”. Israel has been besieging and bombing hospitalsacross Gaza, killing more than 1,400 medical workers, as well as patients and the displaced taking shelter, since the beginning of the war, according to local authorities. The closure of al-Awda Hospital comes as the humanitarian crisis becomes more catastrophic by the day in Gaza, with Israel continuing its suffocating blockade on the enclave. An effort, backed by the United States and Israel, to distribute limited food supplies at specific sites run by a shadowy organisation, known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, continued to bemarred by chaoson Thursday. “We have come a long distance, around 10km [6.2 miles] to take this box tainted with blood,” Palestinian resident Saher Abu Tahoon told Al Jazeera in central Gaza. “We need this box because there’s no food to eat. We haven’t seen any food or flour in five days. We went to get food for our children from a very faraway place. I can’t even carry this box because I am too tired, and I am too hungry.” Multiple explosions were heard and Israeli gunfire was reported near a distribution centre in central Gaza earlier on Friday. Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said Palestinians who walked to the newly opened aid site at the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza were unable to leave due to Israeli military activity in the area. “Many of the people who showed up at the site are trapped right now and unable to leave the area due to the presence of Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles [and] the ongoing shooting,” Mahmoud said. “They’ve been sending appeals to the Red Cross to coordinate their departure from the area. It’s becoming very risky for them to walk on their own.” Israel has been pushing to bypass and sideline the United Nations from the aid distribution process, a self-serving approach critics say wouldfurther weaponisehumanitarian assistance in the territory. “The problems are that the insecurity continues, and frankly, they are not making it easy for us to deliver humanitarian goods,” Dujarric said. There are 600 aid trucks on the Gaza side of the Karem Abu Salem crossing (called Kerem Shalom by Israel), but Israel has blocked the world body from retrieving the supplies for the past three days, he added. Philippe Lazzarini, the head ofthe UN agencyfor Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said “starvation is threatening the future of the children” in the Palestinian enclave. “What’s urgently needed is a political will to allow the UN and partners to provide assistance at scale without hindrance or interruption,” Lazzarini said in a post on X. “Allow us to do our work.” Amid the dire humanitarian conditions, Israel maintained its relentless bombardment on Thursday, killing at least 70 Palestinians in attacks across Gaza, according to medical sources. The Palestinian Civil Defence said an Israeli strike on a residential building in Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City left approximately 30 people missing under the rubble. “Due to the lack of heavy equipment, it is not possible to recover the missing individuals from under the rubble,” the Civil Defence said in a statement. “Therefore, we call on the international community and human rights organizations for immediate and urgent intervention to protect civilians and innocent people in the Gaza Strip.”",

    "article_text": "Virat Kohli inched closer to a maiden Indian Premier League title after Royal Challengers Bengaluru thrashed Punjab Kings by eight wickets in a lopsided qualifier to reach the final of the 10-team tournament. A superlative performance by their bowlers in Thursday’s game left Bengaluru needing only 102 to make Sunday’s final andthey reached the target in just 10 overswith opener Phil Salt, who made 56 not out, leading the charge. Punjab can still make the final if they can win the second qualifier against the winner of Friday’s eliminator between Mumbai Indians and Gujarat Titans. Kohli made 12, but has been Bengaluru’s leading scorer this season. The former India captain has been with the franchise since the inaugural 2008 edition of the league. Bengaluru reached the finals in 2009, 2011 and 2016 but were beaten on all three occasions. “It’s a great feeling right now,” Salt said. “Obviously, we had a second bite at the cherry, but it’s such a good feeling to get that out of the way first-time. “It just gives us that momentum. It’s such a cliche, but it’s so true at the back end of the tournament.” Bengaluru have looked formidable this season and, electing to field, their fiery pace attack, led by a returning Josh Hazlewood, bundled out Punjab in 14.1 overs. Having recovered from a shoulder niggle, Hazlewood led Bengaluru’s superb pace display as they reduced Punjab to 71-7 at the halfway stage of their innings. Hazlewood’s (3-21) victims included rival skipper Shreyas Iyer, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar claimed the important wicket of Prabhsimran Singh, Punjab’s leading scorer this season. Marcus Stoinis made 26 before losing his stumps to leg-spinner Suyash Sharma, who claimed 3-17 in his three overs. Kyle Jamieson removed Kohli in the fourth over, but Bengaluru raced to 61-1 in their six powerplay overs, compared with Punjab’s 48-4, with Salt hitting boundaries almost at will. Salt took 23 balls to bring up his fifty and skipper Rajat Patidar hit a six to seal Bengaluru’s victory in a match that lasted only 24.1 overs.",

    "title": "Mistrial declared in Argentina court over the death of Diego Maradona",
    "article_text": "The homicide case against Diego Maradona’s medical team has been declared a mistrial, lawyers for the defendants said, in a case that transfixed Argentina following the football great and national hero’s 2020 death. The date for the new trial was not initially announced on Thursday and new judges were not yet nominated. The decision came afterone of three judgesin the case, Judge Julieta Makintach, resigned on Tuesday in the face of allegations of an ethical breach. Maradona, who almost single-handedly led the Argentine team to World Cup victory in 1986 in Mexico, died from heart failure while he was recovering from surgery for a haematoma that formed between his skull and brain. He was 60. His death shook the nation, and he was mourned across the world,acutely in Italy’s Naples, where he had elevated the southern city’s scorned team Napoli in the mid- to late 1980s to huge success with domestic and European glory. Lauded as one of the greatest and most iconic players to ever grace a football pitch, Maradona struggled with drug addiction for many years and with connections to the Naples underworld in his time there. His performance in the 1986 World Cup tournament has since become sporting legend. He dubbed his controversial first goal in a quarterfinal the “Hand of God”, since it led to an Argentinian victory over England – a rival with whom the country only four years previously had fought a war over the Falklands Islands, known as the Islas Malvinas in Spanish. But Maradona’s second goal in that match, which saw him shimmy past several England opponents from his own half to score the decisive second, was sublime. In 2000, the football governing body Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) named Maradona one of its two “Players of the Century”, alongside Brazil’s Pele.

    "title": "Ex-DRC President Kabila holds talks in M23-held city of Goma: Reports",
    "article_text": "Former President Joseph Kabila has returned to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, just days after helost his immunityamid accusations he has helped armed rebels fighting in the eastern DRC, according to the Reuters and AFP news agencies. Kabila, on Thursday, was visiting the eastern city ofGoma, which had been seized by the Rwanda-backed M23 militia along with several other areas in the resource-rich east of the country earlier this year. A team of AFP journalists saw Kabila meet local religious figures in the presence of M23’s spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka, without giving a statement. Citing three unidentified sources close to Kabila, Reuters also said the ex-president held talks with locals in Goma. The visit comes despite the former president facing the possibility of a treason trial over his alleged support for M23. Earlier this month, the DRC Senate voted to lift Kabila’s immunity, paving the way for him to be prosecuted. The ex-president, who has been in self-imposed exile since 2023, denies the allegations and has slammed the charges against him as “arbitrary decisions with disconcerting levity”. On Thursday, a member of Kabila’s entourage told AFP that though no formal alliance existed between his party and M23, both shared the “same goal” of ending the rule of President Felix Tshisekedi. The United Nations and the DRC’s government say Rwanda has supported the M23 with arms and troops – an accusation the neighbouring country denies. The renewed violence has raised fears of igniting afull-blown conflict, akin to the wars that the DRC endured in the late 1990s, involving several African countries, which killed millions of people. The current fighting has already displaced about 700,000 people this year, according to the UN. On Tuesday, Amnesty International accused M23 of committing abuses against civilians in areas under its control, “including torture, killings and enforced disappearances”. “These acts violate international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes,” thegroup saidin a statement. M23 says its goal is to protect ethnic minorities against the government in Kinshasa.",

    "title": "Most LGBTQ adults in US don’t feel transgender people are accepted: Poll",
    "article_text": "A new poll by the Pew Research Centre has found that transgender people experience less social acceptance in the United States than those who are lesbian, gay or bisexual, according to LGBTQ adults. About six out of 10 LGBTQ adult participants in the poll said there is “a great deal” or “a fair amount” of social acceptance in the US for gay and lesbian people, according to “The Experiences of LGBTQ Americans Today” report released on Thursday. Only about one in 10 said the same for non-binary and transgender people — and about half said there was “not much” or no acceptance at all for transgender people. The survey of 3,959 LGBTQ adults was conducted in January, after US President Donald Trump’s election, but just before his return to office when he set into motion a series of policies that question transgender people’s existence and their place in society. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order calling on the government to recognise people as male or female based on the “biological truth” of their future cells at conception, rejecting evidence and scientific arguments that gender is a spectrum. Since then, Trump hasbarred transgender women and girlsfrom taking part in female sports competitions,pushed transgender service members from the militaryandtried to block federal funding for gender-affirming carefor transgender people under age 19. A poll conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in May found that about half of US adults approve of the way Trump is handling transgender issues. Transgender people are less likely than gay or lesbian adults to say they are accepted by all their family members, according to the Pew poll. The majority of LGBTQ people said their siblings and friends accepted them, though the rates were slightly higher among gay or lesbian people. About half of gay and lesbian people said their parents did, compared with about one-third of transgender people. Only about one in 10 transgender people reported feeling accepted by their extended family, compared with about three in 10 for gay or lesbian people. According to the Pew poll, about two-thirds of LGBTQ adults said thelandmark US Supreme Court rulingthat legalised same-sex marriage nationally on June 26, 2015, increased acceptance of same-sex couples “a lot more” or “somewhat more”. The Supreme Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks on whether Tennessee can enforce a ban on gender-affirming care for minors in what is seen as a major case for the transgender community.",

    "title": "Why has Elon Musk quit Donald Trump’s administration?",
    "article_text": "Billionaire and Tesla chief Elon Musk hasstepped downfrom his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), in which he was charged with reducing federal spending, as he nears the maximum limit for his tenure as a special government adviser. His departure comes just after his first major public disagreement with President Donald Trump over the administration’s much-toutedtax-and-spending budget bill, which waspassedby the Republican-controlled US House of Representatives on May 22 by a single vote. In a post on X on Wednesday, Musk said his time with the administration had “come to an end”. “I would like to thank President Donald Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” the SpaceX founder wrote. As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President@realDonaldTrumpfor the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The@DOGEmission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk)May 29, 2025 Musk, who was appointed by Trump to lead DOGE, has seen his tenure in the White House marred by controversy, in particular sparked by his attempt to dismantle theUS Agency for International Development(USAID), an agency dedicated to distributing foreign aid. With Musk’s departure, what will become of DOGE? And what legacy does the Tesla CEO leave behind? Musk’s term as a “special government employee” in the Trump administration meant he was only entitled to serve for 130 days in any 365-day period, and is barred from using government roles for any monetary gain. Musk’s term has lasted just over four months, a few days short of the maximum legal limit. In late April, Musk said he would soon shift his focus back to his own business enterprises and that his “time allocation” at DOGE would “drop significantly” starting in May. However, Musk did note that he would spend “a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the President would like me to do so, as long as it is useful”. In a clip from an interview with news channel CBS’s Sunday Morning programme, released on Tuesday, Musk revealed he was “disappointed to see the massive spending bill”. According to him, the wide-ranging budget bill, also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill”, increases the budget deficit and undermines his work at DOGE. “I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful. But I don’t know if it can be both. My personal opinion,” Musk told journalist David Pogue. On Wednesday, Trump staunchly defended the bill. “We will be negotiating that bill, and I’m not happy about certain aspects of it, but I’m thrilled by other aspects of it,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “That’s the way they go.” The budget bill spans more than a thousand pages and outlines various domestic policy goals favoured by the Trump administration. Among its provisions are measures thatextend tax cutsintroduced during Trump’s first presidential term in 2017. The bill also boosts funding for Trump’s proposed “mass deportation” initiative and for security along the US-Mexico border. The disagreement over the tax-and-spending bill was one of several challenges Musk has encountered during his time at the White House. Musk ran afoul of several Trump officials during his stint at the White House, including the president’s chief trade adviser, Peter Navarro, whom he called a “moron” over Trump’s sweeping increase in trade tariffs across the globe. Musk has alsostated publiclythat he would be more in favour of “predictable tariff structures”, in addition to “free trade and lower tariffs”. In April, the SpaceX founder expressed hopes for“a zero-tariff situation”between the US and Europe. Instead, Trump has threatened to impose a 50 percent tariff on imported goods from the European Union unless the two sides can agree to a trade deal. Trump established DOGE by executive order the day he was sworn into office on January 20. With Musk’s departure, it’s unclear what fate awaits the agency, as Trump has yet to appoint anyone to replace him. Musk was given a mandate to reduce federal funding, which included downsizing the government’s workforce, terminating government contracts and attempting toclose down entire agencies. In February, he and Trump both claimed they had unearthed billions of dollars worth of fraud related to diversity and climate schemes within the government. This was proved to be largelyuntrue or misleading. In his post on Wednesday, Musk said: “The DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.” However,Colleen Graffy, a former US diplomat and professor of law at Pepperdine University in California, said DOGE’s future was on shaky ground. “The power of DOGE came from the world’s richest man, Musk, having the ear of the world’s most powerful person, Trump,” she told Al Jazeera. “DOGE will likely struggle along for a while, but without Musk, and with pending court cases against it, its days are numbered. It would be a poisoned chalice appointment for anyone to take. Trump’s tax cuts will dwarf any savings.” Musk’s role in the Trump administration has sparked a large amount of controversy. He has overseenmajor reductionsin the number of federal employees and the dismantling ofmultiple government-funded programmes– moves that have drawn widespread criticism. “Elon Musk’s DOGE was like one of his rockets exploding soon after liftoff, thereby demonstrating how not to do things,” Graffy told Al Jazeera. “The difference is that for one, the learning experience is paid in money; for the other, the price is paid in human lives,” she added. A major point of criticism directed at Trump and Musk centred on their decision to severely scale back USAID’s operations. By late February, the main offices of the agency in Washington, DC, had been essentially shut down. Following the dismissal of roughly 1,600 employees and the placement of approximately 4,700 more on leave, staff were given just 15 minutes to gather their belongings and exit the building. Secretary of State Marco Rubio laterrevealedthat 83 percent of all contracts managed by USAID had been closed. In March, a federal judge in Maryland stated that DOGE had“likely violated”the US Constitution by attempting to dismantle the agency. The judge authorised a temporary injunction to stop DOGE from proceeding with USAID-related staff reductions, building closures, contract terminations, or the destruction of USAID materials. Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group, described DOGE as a “mantra of destruction”. “The legacy of Elon Musk is lost livelihoods for critical government employees, hindered American education, loss of funding for scientists and the violation of Americans’ personal privacy, all in the service of corrupt tech-bro billionaire special interests,” she told Al Jazeera. “The carnage is even more horrifying internationally, as Musk’s chainsaw will lead to the pointless and needless deaths of likely millions of people in the developing world.” Max Yoeli, senior research fellow in the US and the Americas Programme at Chatham House, said Musk’s brief tenure has “irrevocably altered US government”. “DOGE’s weakening of state capacity and disruption of America’s research and development ecosystem pose lasting risks to US economic prospects and resilience, even as courts still grapple with legal issues his approach raised,” Yoeli told Al Jazeera.",

    "title": "Israel launches wave of strikes across south Lebanon",
    "article_text": "The Israeli military has launched several air raids across south Lebanon, killing at least one person, Lebanon’s National News Agency reports, as it intensifies its attacks in the country, in the latest violations of a ceasefire agreement. Lebanon’s Health Ministry also reported a second person shot dead by Israeli forces in a separate attack. The strikes on Thursday targeted areas near the towns of Nabatieh al-Fawqa, Beit Lif, Ramia, al-Bisariya, Wadi al-Safa and al-Sarira. Low-flying Israeli jets and drones were also reported in several regions of southern Lebanon. An Israeli drone strike killed a municipal worker operating a water well in Nabatieh al-Fawqa, according to the town’s mayor, Zein Ali Ghandour. Ghandour said on Thursday that the victim, Mahmoud Hasan Atwi, was “martyred” while on his official duty of trying to provide water for the people of the town. “We condemn in the strongest terms this blatant aggression against civilians and civilian infrastructure as well as the Lebanese state and its institutions,” the mayor said in a statement. Ghandour called on the international community to press the issue and put an end to Israeli violations. The Israeli military had claimed that it fired at a “Hezbollah operative” who it said was “rehabilitating a site” used by the group. Lebanon’s Health Ministry later reported that a person was killed by Israeli gunfire on the Lebanese border town of Kfar Kila. Israel has been carrying out near-daily attacks in Lebanon in violation of the ceasefire agreement it reached with Hezbollah in November of last year, causing mostly civilian deaths and injuries. Last week, the Israeli military launched awave of air strikesacross south Lebanon that it said targeted Hezbollah infrastructure. Israel has also been regularly firing at fields and civilian homes on the Lebanese side of the border. In an earlier attack on Thursday, an Israeli drone dropped a stun grenade on the southern village of Beit Lif, injuring at least one person, the National News Agency reported. Israel claims that its attacks are in enforcement of the ceasefire, which requires Hezbollah to pull its forces to the north of the Litani River, about 30km (18 miles), from the border, in accordance with United Nations Security Council resolution 1701. But the Israeli military has been carrying out strikes in the entire country, not just south of the river. Israel has bombed the Lebanese capital Beirut several times this year. Early in April, an Israeli strike assassinated a Hezbollah official andkilled three othersin the Beirut suburbs of Dahiyeh. Israeli troops also continue to occupy parts of southern Lebanon in breach of the truce. The ceasefire last year ended an intense Israeli bombing campaign that followed months of low-level hostilities linked to thewar in Gazabetween Hezbollah and Israel that were largely confined to the border area. Hezbollah emerged weakened from the war after losing its top political and military officials, including its longtime chiefHassan Nasrallah, in Israeli attacks. Since the end of the war, Hezbollah has not responded to Israeli violations, saying that it is giving the Lebanese state the opportunity to stop the attacks through diplomatic channels. The group has warned, however, that its patience may run out. But it is unclear if Hezbollah is capable of confronting Israel militarily, as it had for decades – including hastening an end to Israel’s occupation of south Lebanon in 2000 and fighting a 2006 war to a stalemate, after the heavy blows it suffered during the war. Lebanese officials, including PresidentJoseph Aoun, have repeatedly called on France and the United States – the main sponsors of the ceasefire deal – to pressure Israel to end its abuses. Pressured by the US on disarming Hezbollah, Aoun has said the issue is a “delicate” one.",

Scuf is getting with the program on Hall effect sticks at a time when the magnetic, drift-resistant sensing option has become commonplace in other brands like8BitDo, Razer, andGameSir, but hasn’t appeared in controllers fromNintendo, Sony, or Microsoft yet. But some controller makers arealready moving onto a more power-efficient drift-resistant technology:TMR sticks. Scuf controllers may be even pricier than premium controller options from Microsoft and Sony like theElite Wireless Controller Series 2andDualSense Edge, but in my experience they’re nice for those willing to spend the money. They’re some of the few native wireless options for Xbox Series X / S and PS5, and Scuf’s rear paddles and clicky hair-trigger options are some of the best feeling “pro” upgrades around.

    "title": "Elon Musk sure does want everyone to think he’s leaving politics",
    "article_text": "Musk is doing a flurry of interviews re-associating himself with Tesla, X, and Mars. Musk is doing a flurry of interviews re-associating himself with Tesla, X, and Mars. byEmma Roth For the past several months, it seemed like President Donald Trump and Elon Musk were inseparable. The tech billionaire and “First Buddy”championed Trumpon his reelection campaign trail,slept at the White House, attendeddeal-making dinnersat Mar-a-Lago, and chainsawed a giant hole in the government withfirings and spending cuts through DOGE. Now, Musk is saying he’s had a change of heart. On May 28th, Muskannounced thathe’s officially stepping away from DOGE as his “scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end.” And in the days leading up to this update, Musk has held a flurry of interviews in which he’s tried to convince his audience that he’s done with politics. “I think I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics,” Musk said duringan interview withArs Technica. “It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”For reasons we’ve explained, the idea he’s leaving politics is suspect — but he’s got good reasons to say he is. Musk’s time as a special government employee always had a legal 130-day deadline that was up at the end of May. He isn’t known for strictly obeying laws, and at the height of his power at DOGE, it wasn’t clear if he would follow this one. But as the deadline neared, there were numerous signs Musk was wearing out his welcome in Washington. News outlets reported clashes with other Trump administration members,including an argumentthat saw Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent repeatedly shouting “Fuck you!” in the West Wing. After Trump announced sweeping tariffs and a trade war with China — both of which threatened Musk’s electric vehicle business — the billionaire retaliatedin a public spatwith trade advisor Peter Navarro. “I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla.” A rift between Trump and Musk opened up withthe Republican-backed “Big Beautiful Bill,”which Musk dubbed a “massive spending bill” that “increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing” inan interview with CBS. And in one more loss, Trump greenlit OpenAI’s plan to build data centers in Saudi Arabia, despite Musk’s attempts to “derail” the deal for not including xAI, according to areport byThe Wall Street Journal. Last month, the White House dismissed rumors that Musk’s departure from DOGE was imminent. “Elon Musk and President Trump have both publicly stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at DOGE is complete,” White HousePress Secretary Karoline Leavitt saidat the time. Now, just weeks later,a source toldReutersthat Musk didn’t have a conversation with Trump before he revealed that he’s leaving, and that “his departure was decided at a ‘senior staff level.’” Arguably, the bigger issue is Musk’s shareholders getting nervous about his detachment from his companies, so as part of his alleged transition from government employee to just a regular billionaire, he’s started to reemphasize his commitment to his businesses. Tesla is in trouble, with Musk’s involvement in the government leading toa sinking stockand making it atarget for protests. It sawa massive dip in sales throughout Europein particular. As part of efforts to regain favor among investors, Musk said last week that he’s committed to leading Tesla for the next five years. “It’s not a money thing,” Musk said duringan interview withBloombergat the Qatar Economic Forum. “It’s a reasonable control thing, over the future of the company, especially if we’re building millions, potentially billions of humanoid robots.” Tesla is also gearing up to introduce its robotaxi service next month, according toBloomberg, despitesharing little detailabout the milestone. Then there’s X, whichMusk’s xAI purchased for $33 billionon paper in March. The platform hasseen a big dipin European usersand has beenplagued byoutages in recent weeks. “Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,”Musk wrote on Xlast week in response to a post about an outage on X. “I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.” This week, Musk returned to Texas forSpaceX’s Starship launch—sans MAGA hat. In interviews withArs Technica, Musk talked up the company’s plans to bring humans to Mars and build a base on the Moon. “We should be going 1,000 times farther, and going to Mars,” Musk said. “And if we are gonna go to the Moon, I think we should do a Moon base, or something that’s the next level beyond Apollo.” The Washington Postalso caught upwith Musk at SpaceX’s headquarters in Starbase, Texas, where he similarly reiterated the company’s big ambitions about getting to Mars. “SpaceX is sort of ultra hardcore,” Musk told the outlet. “But if we’re not ultra hardcore, how are we going to get to Mars? You’re not going to get to Mars in 40 hours a week.” When talking about his time in DC, Musk pointed out the “uphill battle” he faced trying to get things done, and reflected on the negative sentiment surrounding DOGE’s nearly wholesale attempted destruction of several government agencies, including cuts toprojects like Ebola prevention. “DOGE is just becoming the whipping boy for everything,” he told thePost. “So, like, something bad would happen anywhere, and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it.” Even while downplaying his political ambitions, though, Musk didn’t disavow them. He told thePostthat he’s not completely done with DOGE, and that the agency will focus “a bit more like tackling projects with the highest gain for the pain, which still means a lot of good things in terms of reducing waste and fraud,” without mentioning what those were. Musk may not be present at the White House or brushing shoulders with Trump on world tours, but his specter still looms over DC.

    "title": "Tile trackers are being fully integrated into Life360",
    "article_text": "This looks like the beginning of the end for the Tile app. This looks like the beginning of the end for the Tile app. byJennifer Pattison Tuohy If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Tile trackers are getting more deeply integrated with the Life360 app. In ablog post published this week, Life360 announced that you’ll now be able to set up and manage the handy Bluetooth location trackers without using the Tile app at all. Life360, a family safety and location app, purchased Tile’s Bluetooth device-tracking business for$205 million in 2022. Since then,Tiles have been part of the Life360 app, allowing you to track the location of both people and items in one app, but you still needed to use the Tile app to set up the tracking devices. As part of the transition, the Life360 app will get some of the Tile app’s features, including sending an automatic push notification if you leave an item behind and the ability to see location history for Tile-tracked items. The move seems aimed at pushing Tile’s users toward the Life360 app. In an email toThe Verge, Kristi Collura, director of corporate communications at Life360, confirmed that the Tile app is still available and is not being retired “at this time.” However, with her statement that “all new features and updates are available only in the Life360 app,” the standalone Tile app’s days are likely numbered. As part of the update, Life360 is also reorganizing itspaid plans,adding theSOS Alerts featurethat lets youcall 911 by triple-tapping on a compatible Tileto its $7.99 a month Silver membership, along with seven days of location history. SOS Alerts were previously only available with the $14.99 a month Gold plan, which also allows for 30 days of location history. You can use Life360 for free to track both people and items, but you only see 2 days of location history. Life360 is a location app designed for families. Similar to Apple’s Find My app, it allows authorized members of a “Circle” to see each other’s real-time locations in the app. Each member has control over whether the app shares their location, as well as how precise a view of their location other members have at any time. The service can send alerts to members of your circle when you arrive somewhere, leave somewhere, and when your flight lands. It essentially does away with all those “text me when you get there” requests from parents and family members. Life360 offers more than just location services. It styles itself as an overall family safety app and has features such as crash detection and roadside assistance. Its paid plans also include driver reports, which show phone usage, top speed, and hard braking data. Families with teens who are tempted by this service may want to consider exactly how that data is shared before signing up for it. While Life360 says itno longer sells precise user data, its current privacy policy states it may share data with business partners, includingdriving analytics services. These services may share data with insurance companies, as detailed inthis report by Kashmir Hill in theNew York Times. After this story was published, Life360’s Collura said in an email toThe Vergethat “Life360 does not make driving data available to insurance companies to influence our members’ insurance premiums, except in cases where a member explicitly requests that we share their individualized data for this purpose.” According to aLife360 blog postlinked by Collura, Life360 shares data, including location, with the driving analytics company Arity, which provides the app’s drive and crash detection. Arity sells “aggregated and anonymous insights” on driver behavior to insurance companies.

Varietyreports that Anthony Boyle (Tetris,Manhunt) and Julia Garner (Ozark,The Fantastic Four: First Steps) have been cast in Netflix’s upcoming drama seriesThe Altruistsas Bankman-Fried and Ellison. Executive produced by Graham Moore and Jacqueline Hoyt (who will also showrun the series),The Altruistswill recount how Bankman-Fried, FTX’s former CEO, and Ellison, the former head of FTX’s sister cryptocurrency trading firm, Alameda Research, enriched themselves by defrauding FTX’s investors. Netflix has ordered eight episodes for the series, and James Ponsoldt (Shrinking,Running Point) is attached to direct the premiere. Netflix describes the series as being about “two hyper-smart, ambitious young idealists who tried to remake the global financial system in the blink of an eye — and then seduced, coaxed, and teased each other into stealing $8 billion,” which sounds accurate, if a bit aggrandizing. Presumably, the show will cover how both Bankman-Fried and Ellison ultimately wound up being sentenced to 25 and two years in prison, respectively. And ifThe Altruistsreally wants to be seen as a serious, thoughtful piece of storytelling that isn’t just mythologizing its central felons, it should probably touch on how hard Bankman-Fried isnow pushing for Donald Trump to give him a pardon. (Disclosure:The Altruistsis a coproduction by Higher Ground Productions and New York Magazine/Vox Media Studios.) Correction, May 29th:An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Bankman-Fried pleaded guilty to the charges against him. He pleaded not guilty before he was subsequently sentenced to 25 years.

Based on a job listing for the team, one of those products is a smart home device. J Allard was one of the main faces of the original Xbox and Xbox 360 consoles, and during his nearly 20-year tenure at Microsoft, he also worked on the Zune MP3 player, Kin phones, and Courier tablet prototype. He joined Amazon to focus on “new ideas”in late 2024. Job listings for his ZeroOne team at Amazon include senior roles inapplied science,product marketing, andcustomer insights. The description for the applied scientist role says the person will work on “a new smart-home product,” while the product marketing job description vaguely mentions work on “an Amazon device.” It’s unclear when a product from ZeroOne might actually be released. Smart home tech isn’t anything new for Amazon, as the company already has various product lines within its Alexa ecosystem, including Echo devices, and even other brands it owns, like Blink and Eero.

    "title": "We still know almost nothing about Tesla’s robotaxi service",
    "article_text": "Even as we get more details about the launch next month, Elon Musk’s big self-driving experiment remains mostly a black box of information. Even as we get more details about the launch next month, Elon Musk’s big self-driving experiment remains mostly a black box of information. byAndrew J. Hawkins In dribs and drabs, we’re starting to get a better idea of whatTesla’s robotaxi servicewill look like when it launches in Austin, Texas, in just a few weeks. But it’s not nearly enough given what’s at stake. The company is considering June 12th as a possible date to launch its robotaxi service in Austin,Bloombergreports— though that date could change. Tesla has yet to publicly announce a date, nor has it clarified who will be able to access the vehicles. The news comes as CEO Elon Musk said that the company has begun to test vehicles without safety drivers. “For the past several days, Tesla has been testing self-driving Model Y cars (no one in driver’s seat) on Austin public streets with no incidents,”Musk said on X. “A month ahead of schedule. Next month, first self-delivery from factory to customer.” “No incidents.” But before you give Musk too much credit for the milestone, keep in mind that we still know next to nothing about how this service will operate. Tesla has never publicly demonstrated that its vehicles can operate fully driverless, without a human safety driver behind the wheel, on public roads. We have seen them drive themselves within the confines of Tesla’s factory, which is an environment totally controlled by the company and nowhere near as complex as an active city street with pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users. We know that Tesla plans to launch the service with 10–20 Model Y vehicles. Are these vehicles meaningfully different from the Model Ys that Tesla sells to its customers? It seems very likely, given that Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot and AI software, said in a recent earnings call that they would have “audio inputs” so they can pick up sirens from emergency vehicles, for example. These vehicles will also be heavily teleoperated, meaning there will be remote operators watching the vehicles through their embedded cameras, ready to take control should a problem arise. But keep in mind this came from a research note published by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, not from Tesla itself. Jonas also said the service will be invite-only at launch. So unless you’re a Tesla investor, a social media influencer with a sizable following, or a close personal friend of Elon Musk’s, don’t make any immediate plans to travel to Austin next month. Tesla’s approach to its self-driving service is a major departure from how robotaxi companies typically handle these types of launches. Waymo, which it should be noted operates the only publicly available robotaxi service in the US, tests its driverless vehicles for weeks, sometimes months, before opening them up to members of the public. And even then, the company only allows specific people, usually from a waitlist, to ride in its vehicles. Tesla’s approach to its self-driving service is a major departure from how robotaxi companies typically handle these types of launches But before that, Waymo spends months driving manually around a city, gathering data about the streetscape and driving habits of other drivers. Sometimes it uses that information to launch a commercial robotaxi service; other times that data is just fed into Waymo’s central computer to make general improvements to its automated driving software. Waymo is also relatively transparent about its process. Before it launched a robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, the company invited journalists from dozens of outlets to its testing facility in Castle, California, allowing them to ride in the vehicles on a closed course. Waymo has also released its own safety case, posted numerous blog posts about its approach to safety, and published a handful of peer-reviewed studies that demonstrates how its technology routinely behaves safer than human drivers. Tesla, on the other hand, has said very little about the safety of its vehicles beyond the hype-filled statements of its chief executive. Even the federal government, of which Musk was most recently a quasi-member as part of DOGE, has a lot of questions about the imminent launch. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which operates under the US Department of Transportation,recently sent the company a barrage of questions, including about the number of vehicles, their ability to operate in poor weather conditions, and on what timetable Tesla owners will be able to access the supposed driverless technology. A lingering concern for NHTSA is that Tesla is basing its robotaxi service on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver assist feature. Tesla’s first-gen driver assist system, Autopilot, has been linked to hundreds of nonfatal incidents and 51 reported fatalities as of October 2024. At least two of those fatalities have been linked to FSD. NHTSA has been investigating these crashes for a number of years now. Self-driving technology is built on a lot of stuff — cameras, software, AI, engineering, probability — but the success of any public robotaxi service will ultimately come down to trust. Do people trust the company building the technology enough to get inside a vehicle with no one in the front seat?Numerouspublicopinionpollshave showndeclining supportfor autonomous vehicles over the years and a rise inoutright hostilitytoward the technology. On top of that, Tesla’s own brand problems come into focus. The company isclearly strugglingunder the yoke of Musk and his hard turn to the right. His online antics, his support of far-right political parties, and his fascist gestures at Trump rallies haveall turned the Tesla brand toxic.A recent survey gauging the reputations of top companiesranked Tesla 95th, down from the 8th highest-rated brand four years ago. Tesla will always have its fans — many of them fill my inbox with predictions of the company’s future success as well as personal insults for daring to question Musk’s leadership — but it will take more than a few reply guys to make a successful robotaxi business. Especially one we know very little about.

    "title": "AI could consume more power than Bitcoin by the end of 2025",
    "article_text": "Researchers forecast rising electricity demand from AI despite efficiency gains. Researchers forecast rising electricity demand from AI despite efficiency gains. byJustine Calma AI could soon surpass Bitcoin mining in energy consumption, according to a new analysis that concludes artificial intelligence could use close to half of all the electricity consumed by data centers globally by the end of 2025. The estimates come from Alex de Vries-Gao, a PhD candidate at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Institute for Environmental Studies who has tracked cryptocurrencies’electricity consumptionandenvironmental impactin previous research and on his websiteDigiconomist. He published his latest commentary on AI’s growing electricity demand last weekin the journalJoule. AI already accounts for up to a fifth of the electricity that data centers use, according to de Vries-Gao. It’s a tricky number to pin down without big tech companies sharing data specifically on how much energy their AI models consume. De Vries-Gao had to make projections based on the supply chain for specialized computer chips used for AI. He and other researchers trying to understand AI’s energy consumption have found, however, that its appetite is growing despite efficiency gains — and at a fast enough clip to warrant more scrutiny. “Oh boy, here we go.” With alternative cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin —namely Ethereum— moving to less energy-intensive technologies, de Vries-Gao says he figured he was about to hang up his hat. And then “ChatGPT happened,” he tellsThe Verge. “I was like,Oh boy, here we go. This is another usually energy-intensive technology, especially in extremely competitive markets.” There are a couple key parallels he sees. First is a mindset of “bigger is better.” “We see these big tech [companies] constantly boosting the size of their models, trying to have the very best model out there, but in the meanwhile, of course, also boosting the resource demands of those models,” he says. That chase has led to a boom in new data centers for AI, particularly in the US, where there are more data centers than in any other country. Energy companies plan to build outnew gas-fired power plantsandnuclear reactorsto meet growing electricity demand from AI. Sudden spikes in electricity demand can stress power grids and derail efforts to switch to cleaner sources of energy, problems similarly posed by new crypto mines that are essentially like data centers used to validate blockchain transactions. The other parallel de Vries-Gao sees with his previous work on crypto mining is how hard it can be to suss out how much energy these technologies are actually using and their environmental impact. To be sure, many major tech companies developing AI tools have set climate goals and include their greenhouse gas emissions in annual sustainability reports. That’s how we know that bothGoogle’s andMicrosoft’s carbon footprints have grown in recent years as they focus on AI. But companies usually don’t break down the data to show what’s attributable to AI specifically. To figure this out, de Vries-Gao used what he calls a “triangulation” technique. He turned to publicly available device details, analyst estimates, and companies’ earnings calls to estimate hardware production for AI and how much energy that hardware will likely use. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which fabricates AI chips for other companies including Nvidia and AMD, saw its production capacity forpackaged chipsused for AI more than double between 2023 and 2024. After calculating how much specialized AI equipment can be produced, de Vries-Gao compared that to information about how much electricity these devices consume. Last year, they likely burned through as much electricity as de Vries-Gao’s home country of the Netherlands, he found. He expects that number to grow closer to a country as large as the UK by the end of 2025, with power demand for AI reaching 23GW. Last week, aseparate report from consulting firm ICFforecasts a 25 percent rise in electricity demand in the US by the end of the decade thanks in large part to AI, traditional data centers, and Bitcoin mining. It’s still really hard to make blanket predictions about AI’s energy consumption and the resulting environmental impact — a point laid out clearly in a deeply reportedarticle published inMIT Technology Reviewlast week with support from the Tarbell Center for AI Journalism. A person using AI tools to promote a fundraiser might create nearly twice as much carbon pollution if their queries were answered by data centers in West Virginia than in California, as an example. Energy intensity and emissions depend on a range of factors including the types of queries made, the size of the models answering those queries, and the share of renewables and fossil fuels on the local power grid feeding the data center. It’s a mystery that could be solved if tech companies were more transparent It’s a mystery that could be solved if tech companies were more transparent about AI in their sustainability reporting. “The crazy amount of steps that you have to go through to be able to put any number at all on this, I think this is really absurd,” de Vries-Gao says. “It shouldn’t be this ridiculously hard. But sadly, it is.” Looking further into the future, there’s even more uncertainty when it comes to whether energy efficiency gains will eventually flatten out electricity demand. DeepSeek made a splash earlier this year when itsaid that its AI model could use a fraction of the electricitythat Meta’s Llama 3.1 model does — raising questions about whether tech companies really need to be such energy hogs in order to make advances in AI. The question is whether they’ll prioritize building more efficient models and abandon the “bigger is better” approach of simply throwing more data and computing power at their AI ambitions. When Ethereum transitioned to a far more energy efficient strategy for validating transactions than Bitcoin mining, itselectricity consumption suddenly dropped by 99.988 percent. Environmental advocates havepressured other blockchain networks to follow suit. But others — namely Bitcoin miners — are reluctant to abandon investments they’ve already made in existing hardware (nor give up other ideologicalarguments for sticking with old habits). There’s also the risk of Jevons paradox with AI, that more efficient models will still gobble up increasing amounts of electricity because people just start to use the technology more. Either way, it’ll be hard to manage the issue without measuring it first.

The feature,which will roll out in betain the coming weeks, will let you search for more information about the animals, plants, and items you spot within a video. If you’re watching a Short with a landmark in the background, for example, YouTube says you can use Lens to search for the specific landmark and find out more about where the video was filmed. You’ll be able to use the feature by accessing Shorts from within YouTube’s mobile app. After you pause the Short, tap the Lens button in the top menu, and then circle, highlight, or tap the item you want to search for. YouTube will then show visual matches and search results overlaid on the Short. The platform notes that when you select one of these results, you can “quickly jump back into the content you were watching.” Google has begun expanding Lens in recent months, as it now letsyou search with videoand can even help you figure outwhat to buy in store. YouTube saysthat while Lens doesn’t use “biometric facial recognition” to identify specific people, it may show results for “notable public figures.” It also won’t show ads in results during the pilot, and will also not be available on Shorts with shopping affiliate links to start.

    "title": "Here’s how you can get a Nintendo Switch 2 at launch — or at least try to",
    "article_text": "Nintendo’s latest console is sold out, though there are ways to set yourself up for future success. Nintendo’s latest console is sold out, though there are ways to set yourself up for future success. byBrandon WidderandCameron Faulkner If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Following abrief delaystemming from the Trump administration’s on-again, off-again tariff policy, Nintendo officially opened up preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2. As expected, the initial rollout process at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers on April 24thwas an absolute mess— and GameStopdidn’t fare much betterlater. As of right now, none of the aforementioned retailers are accepting reservations for the $449 gaming console ahead of its release on June 5th. Nintendo is stillaccepting sign-upsfor those looking to secure a Switch 2, though, if you do go that route, be aware thatthere are strict requirements. Nintendo alsocan’t guarantee an inviteahead of launch due to “the very high demand” for the console. Surprising, I know. We don’t know when the next Switch 2 preorders will open up, but since we’re close to the official launch date, it might just be time to make preparations to try for a console on June 5th. If you’re trying to secure a Switch 2 on launch day,Best Buy,Target,andGameStophave confirmed that they will have limited inventory for purchase. In the meantime, we suggest keeping an eye on the retailers below and taking a few steps to ensure you’re set up for success in the event that surprise preorders re-open ahead of the console’s release. At launch, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be available in two distinct configurations: a $449.99 standard version and a $499.99 bundle that includes the latestMario Karttitle,Mario Kart World. Nintendo ison record sayingthe bundle will only be available through fall 2025 (or while supplies last), which is a shame, considering picking up the console / game combo saves you $30 on what is easily the Switch 2’s biggest launch title. If you don’t manage to secure the bundle, you’ll have to pick upMario Kart Worldseparatelyfor a whopping $79. It’s also worth noting that prices could change down the line. Nintendorecently raised the priceof theSwitch 2 Joy-Consand theSwitch 2 Pro Controllerin response to tariffs, and has said that “other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions.” The starting price of the Nintendo Switch 2 remains unchanged, but at this point, it feels like the only way to guarantee a console at $449.99 is to purchase one at launch. If the initial preorder launch of the Switch 2 is any indication, retailers are woefully under-equipped to handle the massive influx of interest in preorders. Inventory for the Switch 2 seems to be limited despite the fact Nintendo supposedly had time tobuild up an inventoryof the next-gen system “on a global basis.” That being the case, we suggest taking a few steps to set yourself up for success in the event preorders do drop again between now and launch day. We’ll continue to do our best to let you know which retailers have inventory as we approach June 5th, but for now, we’ve rounded up a few helpful tips that should help you improve your chances. First things first: create accounts at Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, and other retailers if you haven’t done so already. Both Best Buy and Walmart implemented a queue system when taking Switch 2 preorders in an effort to deter scalpers — a tactic also employed during the rollout of the PlayStation 5. That’s why it’s in your best interest to ensure your account is set up with the appropriate credentials. Confirm your location and delivery info, get your payment details in order, and log in to your account prior to making your purchase. ... most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line Setting up and verifying this information in advance will help streamline the checkout process, thus allowing you to save precious seconds. This is crucial, given most retailers won’t hold your console while checking out. If you own a smartphone, we recommend downloading — and logging into — the respective retailer apps for Walmart, Amazon, GameStop, Best Buy, and Target. In the past, we’ve found that the dedicated mobile apps for various retailers are faster than using a traditional browser; they also provide an additional means of procuring a console, thus increasing your chances of securing a Switch 2 at launch. A couple of retailers, specificallyBest BuyandGameStop, allow you to sign up for updates regarding Nintendo Switch 2 availability, including for the console’s games and accessories. So far, neither retailer has divulged much beyond what is available on their retail sites; however, they serve as yet another opportunity to stay informed regarding how each retailer plans to handle the Switch 2 rollout going forward. Nintendo will have a raft of new accessories available for the Switch 2 at launch, including aSwitch 2 Pro Controller, carrying cases, and even acamera accessory for video chats. And while it might be tempting to stack your cart with add-ons, preordering Nintendo’s first-party peripherals takes time that’s better spent on securing a console. Plus, accessory preorders don’t typically sell out nearly as fast as consoles, meaning you can always circle back for extras at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers once you’ve managed to reserve your Switch 2. This might come as a surprise, but preorders aren’t only available online. A handful of retailers, including Best Buy and GameStop, opened in-store preorders for the Switch 2 following their online release. Each store has only been allocated a handful of launch units — theGameStop location our own Ash Parrish visitedhad been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles — so it can’t hurt to ask the folks at the store nearest you if they’re still accepting preorders. The chances are slim, sure, but who knows? You might get lucky. As you might expect, we’ll be closely monitoring Switch 2 inventory in the coming week or two — or longer if it remains unavailable following its release on June 5th. Bookmarkour main deals hub, and if you haven’t already, subscribe toour Verge Deals newsletter! We’ll be sending special alerts as the console become available; it’s also a great way to stay in the know regarding the latest deals and discounts, all of which come from one of our very ownVergestaffers. Right now, the only confirmed retailers for the Nintendo Switch 2 are Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, Target, Staples, Newegg, Sam’s Club, and Antonline. We anticipate that Amazon will sell the console at some point, but based on previous console launches, the rollout at Amazon is likely to be sporadic and unpredictable. Either way, we’ll update this post accordingly if Amazon — or any other retailer — begins offering preorders or announces in-store availability on launch day. Unsurprisingly, one of the few confirmed retailers accepting reservations is theMy Nintendo Store, which comes with a string of eligibility requirements — one of which requires you to register your interest in advance. To do so, you’ll need to sign in with your Nintendo account and select the console configuration you prefer, along with any desired accessories. Then, you’ll receive an invitation email when it’s time to buy it, assuming you’ve satisfied several other conditions. Currently, the reservation process is limited to Nintendo account holders in the US and Canada who are at least 18 years of age. Invitations are valid for 72 hours and “prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to Nintendo; you’ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. What’s more, you must have opted in tosharegameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you’ve done soin the privacy sectionwhen logged into your account). Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account … Once invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria — a process Nintendo says is currently ongoing — invitations will be sent to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. The invitations are nontransferable and sent to the email address you provided while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases are also limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, which began with the first batch of invitations on May 8th. Additional invitations are to follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that. However, ina recent update to its site, Nintendo specified that, due to “the very high demand” for the console, “delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed” and that “your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.” Walmart isn’t currently accepting preorders for thestandalone Switch 2($449) or theMario Kart Worldbundle($499), though you can still preorder games likeDonkey Kong Bananza($69) and accessories like theJoy-Con Wheel Set($24.88). That being said, Walmart’s website still indicates that, if you do manage to preorder a console before 8AM ET on June 4th, you should receive it before 9AM ET on June 5th. GameStop is no longer accepting preorders for thestandalone consoleor theMario Kart Worldbundle. If you’re looking to bring the cost down in the future, though, it offers up to $175 off a Switch 2 when you trade in a Switch OLED, or up to $125 off when you trade in a regular Switch. In both instances, you’ll need everything that came with your console — specifically the Switch, its dock, two working Joy-Con controllers (with wrist straps), an HDMI cable, and a power cord. GameStop alsoconfirmed toGizmodothat the exact valuation will depend on the condition of your console, including whether your Joy-Cons are experiencing the dreaded stick drift. If you’re still looking to pick up a Switch 2 at launch,GameStop will have additional unitsavailable both in-store and online. The retailer’s in-store launch event kicks off at 3PM local time on June 4th, with pickups starting on June 5th at 12AM EST / June 4th at 9PM PST. Online orders will also begin on June 5th at 12AM EST/ June 4th at 9PM PST, though, in both instances, inventory will be limited. Best Buy isn’t accepting online preorders for thestandalone consoleor theMario Kart Worldbundleright now, but if you do manage to reserve a console through Best Buy, the retailer has announced that most stores in the US will open at 12AM ET, 11PM CT, 10PM MT, and 9PM PT on June 5th for preorder pickup. Furthermore, if you missed the initial preorder window, “most stores will have limited inventory of systems, games, and accessories for in-store purchase” when they open at 12:01AM ET on June 5th, at leastaccording to the retailer’s website. Additionally, if you’re a My Best Buy Plus or Total member, you can currently score $20 in credit for every $150 you spend (up to $100) on Nintendo games and gear (excluding all Switch and Switch 2 hardware). That privilege willrun you at least $49.99 a year, though both membership tiers also grant you access to a number of exclusive perks, including limited-time discounts and free two-day shipping. Target has sold out of its initial preorder stock for both thestandalone Switch 2and theMario Kart Worldbundle, along with many accessories. Some games, includingMario Kart World($79.99) and the Switch 2 Edition ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild($69.99), are still available. The company shared that it will have both configurations of the console in-store on launch day, June 5th, and that it’ll open online orders the following day. Consoles will be limited to one per guest. If you’re heading to a store, you can begin lining up at a “designated queuing location” at your local Target store’s entrance. Tickets will be handed out, and if you get one, you’re guaranteed a product to purchase. As far as we know, Newegg, Sam’s Club, and Antonline never opened preorders on April 24th. However, Newegg has published a landing page for both thestandalone consoleand theMario Kart Worldbundle, indicating it will have Switch 2 stock at some point. The same applies toAntonlineandSam’s Club, though you will need a Club membership ($50 a year) to take advantage of the latter retailer.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 29, 2025 / 6:32 PM EDT/ KCAL News The former guitarist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers will not serve jail time for a 2024 vehicle crash that killed a man walking in an crosswalk in Alhambra, California. Josh Klinghoffer, 45, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter without gross negligence in Alhambra court on Wednesday and was sentenced to one year of informal probation and 60 days of community labor. He also received 12 months probation, as well as a required driver safety class and court-ordered restitution. Alhambra is located just west of Los Angeles. A lawsuit filed by the familyof 47-year-old Israel Sanchez accuses Klinghoffer of distracted driving when Sanchez was killed. Video released by attorneys representing the victim's family shows the March 18, 2024, crash in which the driver gets out of the vehicle and stays with the victim before police arrive. The lawsuit does not accuse Klinghoffer of hit-and-run, as the video clearly shows a driver tending to the person hit, but alleges that Klinghoffer was not paying attention while driving. An attorney for Klinghoffer called it a \"tragic accident\" and said he fully cooperated with investigators. \"This was a tragic accident,\" attorney Andrew Brettler said in an earlier statement. \"After the car struck the pedestrian, Josh immediately pulled over, stopped the vehicle, called 911, and waited until police and the ambulance arrived.\" According to the lawsuit, Klinghoffer was driving a black 2022 GMC Yukon with no license plates. A still captured from the video moments before the crash shows the driver on a cellphone or some other device, the lawsuit alleges. The lawsuit states \"He (Sanchez) stopped at the corner and made sure the oncoming traffic had cleared and his path was safe … (he) took eight full strides within the marked crosswalk\" just before being struck and killed. Sanchez suffered blunt force trauma and died from his injuries a little less than three hours later at the hospital. The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount in damages. Klinghoffer played guitar with the Red Hot Chili Peppers from 2009 to 2019, and has also played with Pearl Jam and Jane's Addiction. Julie Sharp is a digital producer at CBS Los Angeles.

    "title": "Appeals court temporarily reinstates Trump tariffs",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 29, 2025 / 5:26 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted a federal trade court's decision blocking most of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, for now reinstating the levies imposed by the president under an emergency powers law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in abrief orderthat it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay \"to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed\" for now. A three-judge panel on the trade courtunanimously ruledWednesday that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which Mr. Trump invoked to impose the levies, did not give the president the authority to set unlimited tariffs on imports from nearly every foreign nation. TheU.S. Court of International Tradepermanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as the president's duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, which the president had imposed in response to what he said was the trafficking of drugs into the U.S. The judges had given the Trump administration 10 days to put their permanent injunction in effect. \"IEEPA does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders,\" the trade court found. \"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\" The Justice Department asked the Federal Circuit to review the trade court's decision and also requested it halt that ruling while it considers the appeal. The administration warned in a filing Thursday that absent interim relief, it would turn to the Supreme Court \"to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake.\" In a statement provided to CBS News, White House spokesperson Kush Desai called Thursday's ruling \"a positive development for America's industries and workers.\" \"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" Desai said. \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\" In its brief order, the Federal Circuit gave the two sets of plaintiffs — five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states — until June 5 to response to the Trump administration's request for a stay. The appeals court has agreed to consider the pair of cases together. The decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade was a significant setback for Mr. Trump's economic agenda, a centerpiece of which are his tariffs. The president has argued that the duties are crucial toreturning manufacturing jobsto the U.S. and willraise more than $1 trillionin revenue. Mr. Trump has also used the tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trade partners into negotiations. The president rolled out his 10% tariffs, as well as a set of now-paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs, in April on what the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" But the president's tariffs have shaken financial markets and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Mr. Trump has alsohalted some of the duties, including the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on 57 trading partners. Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs led to more than half-a-dozen lawsuits from states and businesses impacted by the duties. The plaintiffs argued that the president did not have the authority to unilaterally slap the tariffs on trading partners under the IEEPA, which has never before been used in that way. The three judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed, writing in their decision that it \"does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority.\" In a separate dispute brought by two Illinois-based toy companies, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed under the emergency powers law are unlawful. Contrerasfound that IEEPA\"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the two companies. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which the administration has said it will do. The case, Contreras wrote in a33-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\" Melissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 29, 2025 / 1:16 PM EDT/ CBS News More than 100,000 kitchen faucets have been recalled because they could lead to dangerous levels of lead exposure according to three separatenoticesposted Thursday by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Three different faucets models, manufactured in China and sold under the brands Vfauosit, Kicimpro and Basdehen, were determined unsafe after tests revealed they contain lead that could leak into the water supply and cause harm to young infants and children. No injuries have been reported thus far. Lead ingestion can \"cause harmful neurological effects on infants and young children, including attention-related behavioral problems, decreased cognitive performance and lower IQ,\" the CPSC says in the recall notices. The recalled faucets were sold for roughly $40 on Amazon.com between January 2024 and May 2025 by vendors Whisper08, Kicimpro and Chenfeng Store. The recalls, issued on May 29, affect an estimated 103,000 products. Amazon and two of the vendors are contacting known customers who purchased the items directly to notify them of the recall. Consumers with the faucets are advised to stop using them immediately and to reach out to the vendor for a refund. Consumers will have to provide a photograph of disposal to get their money back, all three vendors state in their respective recall notices. \"Until these faucets can be replaced, consumers should only consume water from the faucets after running the water for 15 seconds,\" the CPSC advises. Affected products: Customers can identify if they have a recalled product by searching their Amazon purchase history for the name of the product, \"Vfauosit\" for example, along with \"kitchen faucet.\" Mary Cunningham is a reporter for CBS MoneyWatch.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 29, 2025 / 12:08 PM EDT/ CBS News Major League Baseball is investing in a new women's professional softball league, Commissioner Robert Manfred announced Thursday on \"CBS Mornings.\" The partnership with the Athletes Unlimited Softball League marks MLB's first major investment in women's professional sports. Manfred said the timing felt right for the investment. \"We've been very engaged in the softball space as part of our youth participation programs. And the growing popularity in women's sports motivated us to look around,\" Manfred said. \"We looked at startups, we looked at making an investment, and we thought AUSL was a great fit for us.\" When asked why MLB chose softball over women's baseball, Manfred cited infrastructure advantages. \"There's such a great softball infrastructure that exists. A pipeline of athletes,\" he said. \"We thought that we could get to the point of having a sustainable league much quicker with softball.\" Kim Ng will serve as commissioner of the new Athletes Unlimited Softball League. Ng, who worked at MLB for 10 years before becoming AUSL commissioner, said the partnership is a big step for both sports. Ng noted that women's college softball \"routinely outdraws the men\" during their respective College World Series. \"Having worked at major league baseball for ten years and having led that softball division, we were always trying to connect with the women's side, you know, with women's college softball,\" she said. Manfred said, \"Kim showed great leadership skills while she was with us, great managerial skills. I had no doubt that she had the skill set to be successful in a job like this.\" MLB will broadcast select games on its network and streaming service, help with marketing and provide financial support for the league's operations. The AUSL launches Saturday, June 7, with Opening Day games in Rosemont, Illinois, and Wichita, Kansas. The Wichita game airs exclusively on MLB Network and MLB.TV at 7:30 p.m. ET. The league's four teams, the Bandits, Blaze, Talons and Volts, will play a 24-game season through July 23, culminating in a championship series July 26-28 at the University of Alabama's Rhoads Stadium.

    "title": "After Rubio seeks to revoke their visas, Chinese students say U.S. resembles the country they left",
    "article_text": "Chinese students say they’re questioning their decision to study in the U.S. after Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the federal government will attempt to “aggressively” revoke their visas. Rubio said Wednesday that Chinese students “with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields” would be targeted. Chinese students who spoke to NBC News on Thursday said that they came to the U.S. for freedoms that they felt they did not have back in China but that now the Trump administration is starting to resemble the strict regime they left behind. “USA stands for freedom. It stands for democracy. … That’s why we come here to chase our dreams,” said one Chinese Ph.D. student at a New Jersey university, who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. “In China, the government can control education, high schools, colleges, universities. We thought that the USA could be different.” The State Department referred NBC News to comments by spokesperson Tammy Bruce during a press briefing Thursday in which Bruce said that the department does not discuss the details of its visa process due to privacy concerns. “We use every tool that we have to vet and to make sure we know who’s coming in,” Bruce said. “In this particular case, the United States is putting America first by beginning to revoke visas of Chinese students as warranted.” The Chinese Embassy referred NBC News to comments made by Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs Ministry. Mao harshly criticized Rubio’s announcement Thursday at a regular briefing in Beijing. “This politically discriminatory move exposes the hypocrisy of America’s long-proclaimed values of freedom and openness, and will only further damage the United States’ international image and credibility,” Mao said. Questions swirl around the new directive, including what “critical fields” the administration will be looking into and what types of connections to the CCP are under scrutiny. But it’s already prompted panic among many Chinese scholars, who make up the second-largest international student group in the U.S. While atemporary nationwide injunctionissued last week blocks the Trump administration from revoking international students’ legal statuses amid its mass termination of records, attorneys say that it may not protect Chinese international students. Jath Shao, a Cleveland-based immigration attorney, said that while the restraining order keeps international students from being arrested or detained, or from losing their legal status, they can still have their visas revoked. Without a visa, Shao said, students can’t return to the U.S. once they’ve left, among a host of other issues. “If you’re trying to get a job or a study ... that means you’re pretty much out of luck,” Shao said. “You’re stuck here. They’re basically trying to take away all your options.” Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, also mentioned that the Trump administration could argue that Chinese students fall under a completely different circumstance compared to those protected by the injunction. “We’re seeing in various cases that the administration is saying that it’s doing individualized determinations,” Bush-Joseph said. “Even if they’re focusing on a particular nationality, in any given case, they might say this is based on an individual person’s circumstances.” One Chinese student who’s studying economics at an Ivy League institution said that he felt the tactics used by the Trump administration, including harsh, pointed rhetoric and intimidation, smack of those used by the Chinese government. The student said that it wasn’t uncommon for Beijing towithhold funding for certain political research, much like Trump has threatened Harvard University, or use other methods of repression. “In China, we’re all Chinese, so they cannot revoke our citizenship, but they can revoke the student record,” he said. “That happens when it comes to people involved in political activities.” “I think they’re just using the CCP to evoke a ‘Red Scare.’ They don’t really care about ideals,” the economics student said, referring to the historical periods of fear in the U.S. around the potential rise of communism and socialism. “We just keep joking that it seems like Trump is learning from the Xi Jinping playbook.” The Ph.D. student said that at this point, he and his peers are considering either moving back to China or another Asian country — a plan that he said was not in the books before. He mentioned that before coming to America, he envisioned a country that was welcoming of diversity and inclusive of all backgrounds and a place he would put down roots. His thoughts on the U.S. have evolved drastically. “My family and my best friends, they had a phone call with me to say, ‘Hey, I think maybe you should come back. We think that there’s no reason for you to stay in the U.S,’” he said. Gisela Perez Kusakawa, executive director of the nonprofit Asian American Scholar Forum, said that the new policy would only serve to harm the U.S. and its own research ambitions. “We know that many of our best and brightest talents are prominent scientists that have gone on to develop so many innovations that have changed the daily lives of so many Americans,” she said. “They started out as international students. They walked these campuses.” She also noted that it’s likely policymakers are guided by misconceptions around Chinese nationals. While there’s been a longstanding belief that Chinese international students would take intelligence back to China, research shows that most hope to start their lives in America. From2005 to 2015,87% of Chinese Ph.D. students said that they intended to stay in the U.S. Aseparate surveyof more than 1,300 Chinese American researchers found that 89% “aimed to help advance U.S. leadership in science and technology.” As disappointing as the Rubio announcement was, Kusakawa underscored that it isn’t necessarily surprising. In March, Republican lawmakersintroduced a billthat would halt the issuance of student visas to Chinese nationals looking to study at U.S. universities or take part in exchange programs. “In many ways, there was already this existing fear that this could potentially become a reality,” Kusakawa said. “But perhaps what is surprising is the speed in which it’s happening.” So far, the announcement has drawn mass criticism from many high-profile Chinese American lawmakers and leaders, including Gary Locke, a former U.S. ambassador to China and the chair of the Chinese American nonprofit Committee of 100, and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. “The wholesale revocation of student visas based on national origin — and without an investigation — is xenophobic and wrong,” the lawmakers said on social media. “Turning these students away — many of whom simply wish to learn in a free and democratic society — is not just shortsighted but a betrayal of our values.”",

    "title": "19 Black Americans' skulls return to New Orleans after 150 years for memorial service",
    "article_text": "More than 150 years after their heads were severed from their bodies and shipped to Germany for “research,” the craniums of 19 Black people, which were recently returned, will be memorialized Saturday during a sacred ceremony in New Orleans. Dillard University President Monique Guillory said at a news conference Wednesday that the memorial will be “about confronting a dark chapter in medical and scientific history while choosing a path of justice, honor and remembrance.” Those who will be honored died in the city’s Charity Hospital in 1872. Their heads were severed and shipped to Leipzig University in Germany to be studied — a common practice at the time, asresearcherssought to confirm their unfounded theory that Black people’s brains were smaller than those of other races, therefore making them inferior. “They were stripped of their dignity,” Guillory said, over “a practice rooted in racism and exploitation. They were people with names. They were people with stories and histories. Some of them had families, mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, human beings.” They were not specimens, she continued, “not numbers.” The heads were returned to New Orleans about a week ago after a two-year journey, said Eva Baham, a retired Dillard professor. Representatives from Leipzig contacted the city in 2023 about their existence in Germany, where the university houses a skull collection dating to the 1800s. The school is in the process of repatriating or sending back skulls to their original locations. That initial call set in motion the creation of the Cultural Repatriation Committee, led by Baham. “We are not talking about them as if they are skeletal remains,” Baham said at the news conference. “We want to honor them by calling them the individuals that they are.” Dillard, one of two historically Black universities in New Orleans, along with Xavier University of Louisiana, welcomed the opportunity to be part of “this very sensitive acknowledgment of our people, that they are here,” Guillory told NBC News. A visitation will take place Saturday at Dillard’s Lawless Memorial Chapel with a service. Laid to rest will be the remains of Adam Grant, Isaak Bell, Hiram Smith, William Pierson, Henry Williams, John Brown, Hiram Malone, William Roberts, Alice Brown, Prescilla Hatchet, Marie Louise, Mahala, Samuel Prince, John Tolman, Henry Allen, Moses Willis and Henry Anderson. The two other people could not be identified. The committee tried in vain for two years to contact descendants of the victims but had no success. They did learn some information, Baham said, and found their names listed in municipal death records almost in succession. “In those records list what they died from, how long they had been in New Orleans,” she said. “We have people who were here in New Orleans from one hour in 1871, one day, a week, two months. And that’s all very important.” Guillory said the service will be a New Orleans expression of respect. “We will do so in the most sacred way that we know how in our beloved city, in a true New Orleans fashion, with a jazz funeral that shows the world that these people mattered,” she said. “We have a very different relationship with death here and a very different relationship with what we believe is the spirit and our ancestors. And now they are home. And so, this is particularly poignant for people in New Orleans.” When the opportunity arose, there were questions from people in the academic and local community, Guillory said, about why the parties involved would welcome their return. But the city, University Medical Center New Orleans, Dillard University and other entities did not blink. “There’s certain sensitivity to the material, to the macabre, somber nature of what we’re talking about,” Guillory said. “There was also a lot of uncertainty about whether we could actually bring them here. Should we bring them here? Who should be responsible for bringing them here? Why bring them back? And I think the committee itself had been very confident and convinced that this was the right thing to do.” The remains will be stored at the Hurricane Katrina Memorial. “We want that day to be not only of remembrance but of reckoning and renewal,” Guillory said, “and may we never forget them.”",

    "title": "What to know about Karen Read's trial now that the prosecution has rested",
    "article_text": "After six weeks and dozens of witnesses, Massachusetts prosecutors retrying Karen Read on a murder charge in thewidely publicized death of her boyfriend three years agorested their case Thursday. While the theory put forward by special prosecutor Hank Brennan was the same as that offered by the assistant district attorney who previously tried the case — Read, drunk and angry, struck Boston Police Officer John O’Keefe with her Lexus SUV and left him for dead on Jan. 29, 2022 — there were some notable changes from Read's first trial,which ended with a hung jury last summer. Absent were two high-profile witnesses who were key to the defense’s claims that Read was framed. Also missingwas the former Massachusetts state trooperwho led the investigation into O’Keefe’s death and was fired after revelations of misconduct emerged in the first trial. Another notable change was the role of Read, who has maintained her innocence, herself. In addition to her remarks to reporters outside the courtroom, her words have been a regular presence in Brennan’s presentation, which has featured a series of interview clips that show what Brennan has described as Read's “campaign” of public statements. Read’s lawyers are expected to begin making their case Friday. The prosecution’s final witness was one of its most important. No cameras captured the events that led to O’Keefe’s death, nor have any witnesses claimed to have seen what happened at 34 Fairview Road — the home in Canton, just south of Boston, where O’Keefe, 46, was found unresponsive in the front yard shortly after 6 a.m. on Jan. 29. But Judson Welcher, a biomechanical engineer and accident reconstruction expert, testified that data from Read’s 2021 Lexus showed that at 12:32 a.m., outside 34 Fairview, the vehicle drove forward 34 feet, then reversed 53 feet. The SUV was traveling at nearly 24 mph, he said, with a throttle of 74%. While there was no vehicle data to support Brennan’s allegation of a collision, Welcher testified that lacerations on O’Keefe’s right arm were “consistent” with injuries caused by a broken rear right taillight on the SUV. Welcher testified that his height and weight approximated O’Keefe’s — around 6 feet tall and 220 pounds — and that he conducted re-enactments showing what such a collision might look like. In one video, Welcher wore clothes similar to O’Keefe’s from Jan. 29 — jeans, a T-shirt, a baseball cap — while a Lexus that was the same model and year as Read’s backed into him at 2 mph. Welcher also knocked down the defense’s claim that the taillight was broken in a different collision on Jan. 29. As Read left her home around 5 a.m. to look for O’Keefe, she was in a panic, she has said, and she backed her Lexus into his Chevrolet Traverse. Ring camera video played in court captured the incident. But Welcher testified that an analysis of the video showed Read was driving less than 1 mph at the time and that there was no evidence of any damage to either vehicle. “That impact did not break or crack that taillight,\" Welcher said. Michael Proctor, the ex-trooper and case agent who managed the investigation into O’Keefe’s death, was included on the prosecution’s list of possible witnesses. In the first trial, Proctor spent hours on the stand and acknowledged that comments he made to friends, family and supervisors about Read were unprofessional and that they “dehumanized” her. But prosecutors did not call him to testify in the retrial. Massachusetts State Police dishonorably discharged Proctor in March after an internal investigation found that he violated agency rules by sending derogatory messages and sharing confidential investigative details with non-law enforcement personnel. Proctor testified that his conduct did not harm the investigation. He has not publicly commented on his termination, but his family has criticized his former employer, saying he was unfairly scapegoated. His former supervisor testified this month that Proctor had acted with “honor and integrity.” “I believe human beings all have biases,” Sgt. Yuri Bukhenik told the jury. “Especially in this case, they did not affect the outcome of the investigation.” Bukhenik acknowledged that he was disciplined in part for failing to adequately supervise Proctor and lost five vacation days. Proctor is listed as a possible witness for the defense, which has accused him of bias and manipulating evidence. Two other figures who played an outsized role in the first trial — Brian Albert and Brian Higgins — were also on the prosecution’s witness list but were not called to testify. Albert, a retired Boston police sergeant, lived with his family at 34 Fairview at the time of O’Keefe’s death and had a gathering at his home on Jan. 29 that O’Keefe planned to attend. Prosecutors — and Albert — have said that O’Keefe never made it to the party and that no one who was there that morning saw him inside. But the defense has alleged that O’Keefe entered Albert’s home and was beaten, bitten by the family’s German shepherd and dragged outside, where he died. They have pointed to Higgins, an agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who was at the gathering, as a possible conspirator in this alternative theory of the case. In the weeks before O’Keefe’s death, a series of text messages introduced as evidence showed Higgins flirting with Read and appearing frustrated when she did not speak more candidly about what she wanted from him. The tension most likely prompted the fight that led to O’Keefe’s death, the lawyers have said. (Through their attorneys, both men have denied involvement.) Albert and Higgins are both on the defense’s list of possible witnesses. Read has been unusually candid with journalists, and Brennan has shown a series of clips from interviews she has given to reinforce the prosecution’s theory of O’Keefe’s death. In one clip, shown during opening statements on April 22, Read was captured telling “Dateline” that she could have “tagged” O’Keefe in the knee “and incapacitated him. He didn’t look mortally wounded as far as I could see. But could I have done something that knocked him out?” In another clip, shown this month, she was captured telling “Investigation Discovery” about the moment she found O’Keefe in the yard of 34 Fairview. She wondered out loud whether she could have run over his foot as she began driving from Albert’s home. “He’s roughly where I left him, so yeah, when I found him I was thinking, did I, like, clip him somehow?” she said. In another series of clips introduced as evidence last month, Read was shown talking openly about her drinking. She and O’Keefe had been at two bars before they drove to Albert’s house, and in an interview with \"20/20,\" she was asked whether she felt fine to drive after four drinks. “Yup,” she responded. In a separate clip, she told a Boston Magazine reporter that she drank a “normal amount” — a vodka tonic every 40 minutes. Outside court last week, Read was asked whether she had any reaction to the videos. “No,” she said.",

    "article_text": "DETROIT — Jeep on Thursday revealed the first details and image of its new Cherokee SUV, which the company expects to assist in the brand’sturnaroundwhen it arrives later this year. TheStellantisbrand said the new midsize SUV will feature a hybrid powertrain option but declined to specify if it would be a traditional hybrid or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), which the companycurrently offers on several SUVs. “The all-new Jeep Cherokee headlines our efforts to deliver more product, innovation, choice and standard content to customers than ever before,” Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf said in a statement. “Jeep Cherokee will boast competitive pricing that strikes at the core of the largest vehicle segment and sits perfectly between Jeep Compass and Jeep Grand Cherokee to bolster our winning mainstream lineup.” Affordability has been a problem for Jeep sales amid price increases in recent years. An entry-level model of the Cherokee started around $30,000 for the 2022 model year, according toCars.com. That is close to the current Jeep Compass at about $27,000. The 2025 Grand Cherokee starts at roughly $36,500. The company declined to release other details of the vehicle, including its production location. Analysts and union officials have said the new SUV is expected to be produced at a plant in Mexico — a decision that was made prior to PresidentDonald Trump’s election and ongoingautomotive tariffs of 25%on imported vehicles into the U.S. The last generation of the Cherokee was produced at a plant in Illinois, which has been idled since the vehicles was discontinuedin early 2023amid cost-cutting efforts and production realignments. The cancellation of the Cherokee and a smaller SUV called the Renegade after the 2023 model-year contributed to ongoing sales declines for the brand. Jeep, a coveted brand in the automotive industry, has reported six consecutive years of U.S. annual sales declines, with a 10% decline through the first quarter of this year. The SUV brand is expected to be a priority forincoming Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who was leadingJeep’s turnaroundbefore being promoted last year to lead the company’s Americas region.",

    "article_text": "COMMACK, N.Y. — A man was killed and another was injured when a dumpster they were sleeping in was emptied into a garbage truck in New York, police said Thursday. The two men had been in a dumpster at a shopping plaza in Commack, on Long Island, when the dumpster was emptied into a garbage truck early Thursday, according to Suffolk County police. When the truck stopped at William Rogers Middle School in Kings Park, nearly six miles away, someone spotted a person inside the back of the truck around 6:30 a.m. Police said that person was removed and taken to Huntington Hospital for treatment of a leg injury. The other man was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said the medical examiner’s office will determine the cause of death, but said they don’t believe the man was dead before he was dumped in the truck. Police also didn’t identify the men other than to say they were believed to have been both sleeping in the dumpster at the time. School officials in Kings Park sent a message to parents to assure them that the emergency response at the middle school was “completely unrelated” to the school, that there was no threat to students or staff, and that classes were operating as usual.",

    "title": "10 times Trump has threatened, then backtracked on, tariffs as 'TACO trade' jab gains traction",
    "article_text": "Tariffs were a defining promise of President Donald Trump's campaign, and they have been a defining feature of hissecond term in office. But just over five months in, many of his tariff proclamations haven’t turned into reality. While Trump has imposed a number of sweeping tariffs that have been driving up costs for American businesses and consumers buying goods from overseas, he has threatened far more tariffs than he has carried through on. That has created a climate of uncertainty that has caused some businesses tolay offworkers anddelay investments, as well as led tovolatility in the stock market. Some financial analysts have taken to calling Trump’s on-again, off-again movesTACO tradeor theTACO theory —an acronym for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" (Asked by a reporter about the phrase, Trump called the question \"nasty\" and said, \"It’s called negotiation.\") Here are 10 times Trump has threatened, then backtracked on, tariffs since he took office. Notably, in some cases, like threatened tariffs against Colombia, the administration did win policy concessions in other areas after it wielded the threat. But other tariffs threats have come and gone without other tangible results. In one of his latest tariff moves, Trump threatened last Friday to impose a 50% tariff on goods shipped into the United States from the European Union, saying the European countries weren’t taking ongoing trade talks seriously enough. Trump said the tariff would go into effect on June 1, but two days later, hedelayed ituntil July 9, after he said he had spoken with E.U. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump said she asked for the delay. Trump had threatened Europe with a 20% tariff as part of his \"reciprocal\" tariffs announced April 2. But hours after those tariffs were scheduled to go into effect, Trump reduced tariffs on Europe and most other countries to 10% for 90 days to give his administration time to work out individual trade deals. The tariff on European imports remains at 10%. Aside from the wider tariffs on the E.U., Trump announcedMarch 13 on social media that he would impose a 200% tariff on wine imported into the United States from the E.U. after the E.U. threatened a 50% tariff on American whiskey. That threat came in response to Trump’s earlier tariffs on European steel and aluminum. The tit-for-tat over alcoholnever came to fruition, with European officials saying a week later that they would delay the threatened whiskey tariff until mid-April, pending negotiations with the United States. There have been no tariffs on European wines aside from Trump’s blanket 10% tariff on all imports. Among Trump’s first tariff targets were the United States' neighbors, Canada and Mexico. Just weeks into office, he signed an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on goods imported from Canada and Mexico, saying they weren’t doing enough to stem the flow of fentanyl across the border. In response, Canada and Mexico announced their own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, and Canadians began to boycott American brands. A day before the tariffs were set to be collected, Trump said he was pausing them for 30 days. He said he was making the pause because of actions Canada and Mexico said they were taking at their borders, though a number of those steps were already underway when Trump first announced his tariffs. Once the 30-day pause was up, Trump said March 4 that the 25% tariffs on Canada would go into effect. But two days after he implemented the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, he said he would pause them again until April 2 for most goods. When Trump announced wider tariffs for nearly all countries on April 2, Canada and Mexico were excluded. Despite the back-and-forth, there are no tariffs on most goods from Canada and Mexico that fall under the North American trade deal signed during Trump’s first term. Trump said May 4 on social media that he wasdirecting his administrationto start collecting a 100% tariff “on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” without giving any details about when or how it would be collected. A few hours later, the White House said that no final decisions had been made and that the administration was “exploring its options.” By the afternoon, Trump said he would meet with industry officials to make sure they were “happy” with his plan. The administration hasn’t taken any action since the initial social media post. Trump announced a variety of tariffs on nearly every country in the world as part of his so-called reciprocal tariffs in an event dubbed “liberation day.” Trump said it would “forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again.” Those tariffs ranged from a baseline of 10% to a high of 49%. But on April 9, the day those tariffs were set to go into effect, Trump said he was pausing them until July 2 to have time to negotiate individual trade deals with the more than 90 countries that had reached out to his administration. In the interim, he said, he would put a blanket 10% tariff on nearly all countries. Since the \"reciprocal\" tariff pause, Trump has announced just one outline of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom. A trade courtruled Wednesdaythat Trump exceeded his authority to impose those tariffs. The Trump administration is appealing that ruling, and for now, the tariffs remain in place. Tariffs against China have been one of Trump’s most consistent threats — he has accused it repeatedly of “ripping off” the United States with unfair trade practices. Trump had ratcheted up his tariffs on China over several months to more than 145% in April, a level that caused businesses to halt shipments coming from China and pause future orders. But just as the last of the pre-tariff imports from China had arrived in U.S. ports and shipments from China were on track to tumble, Trump said he was lowering the tariffs to 10% for 90 days,giving U.S. and Chinese officials time to begin trade discussions after an initial meeting between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart. Trump left a separate 20% tariff in place related to the country's production of the ingredients in fentanyl. The trade court ruling Wednesday struck down both the 10% and the 20% fentanyl tariffs, though they remain, for now, while the appeals process continues. Days after he increased tariffs on China to at least 145%, Trump created a carve-out for iPhones and some other electronics made in China, lowering the tariff rate for them to 20%. Still, Trump has continued to push for iPhones to be made in the United States, not other lower-cost countries, like India, where Apple has said it is increasingly shifting manufacturing. Trump said last Friday that he would impose a 25% tariff on iPhones and other smartphones, regardless of where they were made, starting at the end of June. But senior administration officials seemed to walk back Trump’s demands that iPhones be made in the United States, as well asthe scope of any potential tariffs. Bessent said it was the chips in the phones, not necessarily the phones themselves, that Trump wanted to see made in the United States. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassettsaid a few days laterthat the administration doesn’t want to “harm Apple,” and he referred to the move as “a tiny little tariff on them right now, to try to negotiate down the tariffs.” On Trump’s sixth day back in office, he ignited a trade spat with Colombia that lasted less than 24 hours. Trump threatened Colombia with a 25% tariff after its president barred two U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants from landing in the country. The United States is a major importer of coffee, flowers and produce from Colombia. Colombia responded with its own 25% tariff on U.S. products.But it soonsaid it would allow the flights, and the two countries backed down on their trade war threats. Trump said he would impose steep tariffs on toymaker Mattel — even if it moves its overseas production out of China — after its CEO said it was looking to shift more production out of China but didn’t see it moving to the United States. “That’s OK, let him go, and we’ll put a 100% tariff on his toys, and he won’t sell one toy in the United States, and that’s their biggest market,” Trump said in the Oval Office on May 8. Trump had said children in the United States would simply have fewer dolls if the cost of the toys increased because of tariffs. Trump has since suggested that the United States is more interested in bringing higher-skilled manufacturing with a national security element to the country rather than lower-cost consumer goods. “I’m not looking to make T-shirts, to be honest. I’m not looking to make socks. We can do that very well in other locations,” he said Sunday. “We are looking to do chips and computers and lots of other things, and tanks and ships.” Trump announced a 25% tariff on allauto importseffective April 3 that would apply to any vehicle not assembled in the United States, which would account for nearly half of all vehicles sold in the country. About a month later, he signed an executive order easing some of those tariffs, addressing concerns that they would drive up the cost of cars assembled in the United States with parts imported from other countries. Trump later said he would reduce tariffs for cars made in the U.K., such as those by Land Rover and Aston Martin, to 10% under a tentative trade agreement between the United States and the U.K. that officials on both sides continue to negotiate.",

Today, the jurors in Diddy’s trial heardgraphic testimonyfrom a woman identified only by the pseudonym “Mia.” She’s one of Diddy’s former personal assistants — and one of the four alleged victims at the heart of the U.S. government’s indictment against the hip-hop mogul. In excruciating detail, Mia told jurors that Diddy sexually assaulted her multiple times and described a work atmosphere that was “chaotic” and “toxic” but also exhilarating. “Puff’s mood determined the environment,” she said, using one of the defendant’s previous stage names. Mia said Diddy sometimes treated her as an equal, other times like “a worthless piece of crap.” Diddy isn’t accused of sex trafficking Mia. But her allegations of forced labor are part of the government’s racketeering conspiracy charge against the rapper, who prosecutors say orchestrated a decade-spanning “criminal enterprise.” He’s pleaded not guilty to all charges. Here’s how today’s testimony unfolded: In the first half of the day, Mia answered questions calmly and quietly. But after the lunch break, Mia grew increasingly emotional. She appeared to be on the verge of hyperventilating and struggled to catch her breath as she described Diddy’s stormy relationship with Cassie. She broke down crying as she recounted Diddy forcing himself on her sexually. She wept on the stand as she explained how “terrified and trapped” she felt as a victim of his alleged assaults, speaking barely above a whisper. Mia frequently cast her eyes downward, letting her hair fall across her face. The hours of testimony looked deeply painful for her. Tomorrow:“Mia” is expected to return to the witness stand.

    "title": "Federal appeals court pauses rulings on Trump tariffs, allowing them to continue — for now",
    "article_text": "A federal appeals court Thursday temporarily paused rulings by a panel of judges that halted several of President DonaldTrump’s tariffson international trading partners. The “judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed until further notice,” the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in abrief ruling. The decision pauses thelower court’s decisionuntil at least June 9, when both sides will have submitted legal arguments about whether the case should remain paused while the appeal proceeds. An attorney for the plaintiffs, Jeffrey Schwab of the Liberty Justice Center, said in a statement that the ruling is “merely a procedural step as the court considers the government’s request for a longer stay pending appeal.” “We are confident the Federal Circuit will ultimately deny the government’s motion,” Schwab said. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told Fox News that \"this is a big victory for the president.\" \"We're very pleased with the ruling,\" he said. Peter Navarro, the White House senior counsel for trade and manufacturing, predicted the administration would find a way to institute the tariffs even if it's eventually unsuccessful in this case. “Even if we lose, we will do it another way,” Navarro said, because Trump has multiple options to keep the tariffs in place. He said U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer would lay out how the administration will respond within the next two days. The judgment Wednesday was from the U.S. Court of International Trade, which typically hears cases that originate from around the country involving tariff classifications, import transactions and customs law issues. The administration had been trying to have challenges to the tariffs heard in that court, but after the ruling, senior White House adviser Stephen Miller accused the New York City-based court of engaging in a \"judicial coup.\" In its decision, a panel of three judges — made up of Reagan, Obama and Trump appointees — found that the decades-old International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a federal law that Trump cited in many of his executive orders, didn’t “delegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President.” Trump described the appeals court's pause as fortunate and took aim at the lower court's three-judge panel in aTruth Social poston Thursday. “Where do these initial three Judges come from? How is it possible for them to have potentially done such damage to the United States of America? Is it purely a hatred of 'TRUMP?',” Trump wrote. Trump appointed one of the three judges who heard this case, Judge Timothy M. Reif, who took the bench in 2019. \"The ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade is so wrong, and so political! Hopefully, the Supreme Court will reverse this horrible, Country threatening decision, QUICKLY and DECISIVELY,\" he added. \"Backroom 'hustlers' must not be allowed to destroy our Nation!\" Earlier Thursday, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., issued a similar ruling, finding a number of Trump's tariffs “unlawful.” The decisionby U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras, however, affects only a pair of educational toy makers who’d filed suit arguing the president didn't have the authority to impose sanctions and that his shifting tariffs were threatening to sink their small businesses. Contreras said the main question in the case is whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) “enables the President to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that it does not.” He noted that no other president has ever used the IEEPA to impose tariffs and said allowing Trump to do so would mean congressional limitations on his powers “would be eviscerated if the President could invoke a virtually unrestricted tariffing power.” Trump has used tariffs and the threat of tariffs to kick-start trade negotiations with scores of countries he has accused of \"ripping off\" the United States with unfair trade practices. In court filings, the administration had urged Contreras not to block the tariffs, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying in a declaration that doing so “would cause significant and irreparable harm to U.S. foreign policy and national security” because negotiations with trading partners are “in a delicate state.” \"The Cabinet officials claim that were a court to enjoin the tariffs announced in the Challenged Orders, U.S. trading partners could retaliate against the tariffs.; the U.S. would be embarrassed on the global stage; and the U.S.’s manufacturing position may be so weakened that the country may 'not be able to produce the weapons and other resources necessary to defend itself,'” Contreras wrote in his decision. He said the \"consequences described by the government officials in their declarations will flow, if at all,\" from the trade court's order Wednesday, not his much narrower one, but he also suggested the administration had only itself to blame. \"The President cannot act unlawfully and then use the effects of having that action declared unlawful as a putative shield from judicial review,\" he wrote. The administration is appealing Contreras' ruling, as well.",

    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, Jonathan Allen reviews Elon Musk’s stint in the White House as he prepares to leave Washington. Plus, we have the latest on the back-and-forth in the courts over President Donald Trump’s tariff regime. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Elon Muskrocketed out of the Beltway this weekhaving blown a golden opportunity to make bigger, better and more beautiful changes to the way the American people are served by their government. The megabillionaire misjudged his own popularity and that of his mission, alienated key stakeholders in both parties, overpromised and underdelivered. The shame of it for those who believe in deficit reduction and government efficiency is that Musk might have found more utility in a scalpel than hisfamous faux chainsaw. It’s not shocking that someone who is accustomed to making unilateral decisions about corporate strategies, budgets and functions would fail to live up to his own expectations about retrofitting a government in which power is diffuse and the shareholders — American citizens — have concerns that go beyond the bottom line. If voters cared only about profit and loss, the nation would not be $36 trillion in debt, with more deficits lined up on the horizon. Surely, Musk can claim success in having cut some federal programs, reduced the workforce and canceled contracts. But it’s a drop in the bucket. Even his DOGE website claimsonly $175 billionin savings — a far cry from his target of “at least $2 trillion.” And he and his team misrepresented their workoverandoverandoverandoveragain. DOGE’s most important legacy may be in catalyzing a modernization of government systems — though critics haveraised concernsabout his team’s access to Americans’ personal data. And it remains unclear how variouslawsuits against DOGE actionswill turn out. Musk could have come into Washington with the modest promise to make the government run more smoothly at a lower cost to the public. He could have taken bipartisan congressional interest in his plans as an invitation to work with lawmakers — the people who authorize and fund the executive branch — to make lasting changes. Instead of reading Donald Trump’s election as a blank check from the citizenry, he could have marketed his plans through a national campaign to build public support. But Musk chose to see everyone outside his insular group of advisers as an enemy, and he tried to vanquish them all with a shock-and-awe strategy more suited to corporate warfare than governance. By the time the White House quietly acknowledged his departure Wednesday night, Musk had become a lightning rod in Washington. He emerged as aleading political boogeyman for the Democratswhile angering some congressional Republicans by slashing programs they like and forcing them to try to fill the budgetary hole left by his unmet goals. Byone measure, his national approval rating is slightly below 40% — making him a drag on Trump. Tesla, his car company, has recovered from bottoming out earlier this year, but its stock is still down about 5% for the year. And while SpaceX hasn’t disintegrated without him at the helm full time,some of its projectiles have. Musk whisked into Washington with a mandate from the man in charge and he’s walking away having failed to achieve it. A blast from the past:Musk isn’t the first case of one of the world’s richest men taking an influential position in Washington that didn’t quite go as planned.As Scott Bland writes, his story has some key similarities to that of Andrew Mellon, who served as treasury secretary to three GOP presidents in the 1920s and ‘30s. This time, it was the courts that were responsible for a round of off-again, on-again tariffs. On Thursday afternoon, an appeals court reversed a federal trade panel’s ruling some 24 hours earlier that struck down a slew of President Donald Trump’s tariffs targeting other countries,Rob Wile and Steve Kopack report. A second court ruling earlier Thursday by a U.S. district court came to a similar conclusion as the trade court. By granting the Trump administration’s request for a stay, the appeals court put those tariffs back into effect while it weighs the case. The trade court’s ruling would have the effect of lowering the U.S.’s average effective tariff rate from 15% to 6.5%, according to Capital Economics consultancy. The rulingdid not affect import dutieson automobiles, auto parts, and steel and aluminum. How the markets responded: Markets initially cheered the possible elimination of some import taxes. But by Thursday afternoon, most gains had dwindled. Experts said the courts’ decisions ultimately add another layer of uncertainty to Trump’s trade war effort. How the White House responded:Trump administration officials said that they were considering alternative ways of reimposing the affected tariffs, but were confident that their original directives would be reinstated. “We’re going to see what happens on appeal, and we’re very confident in our success there,” National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett told Fox Business. “But the fact is that there are things, measures ... that we could start right now.” “But we’re not planning to pursue those right now because we’re very, very confident that this really is incorrect,” Hassett added.

    "title": "Supreme Court limits environmental reviews of infrastructure projects",
    "article_text": "Nina Totenberg The Supreme Court narrowed the scope of environmental reviews for major infrastructure projects.Drew Angerer/Getty Imageshide caption The U.S. Supreme Court sharply narrowed the scope of a key environmental statute on Thursday. The decision makes it easier to win approval for highways, bridges, pipelines, wind farms and other infrastructure projects. The National Environmental Policy Act is considered the nation's premier environmental law because it sets up a regulatory regime under which the federal government seeks information from a wide array of agencies about the impact of proposed infrastructure projects before they're built. At issue in Thursday's case was the proposed building of an 88-mile stretch of railroad that would connect Utah's oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national freight rail network. Once built, the new rail lines would facilitate the transportation of crude oil to refineries in Texas and Louisiana along the Gulf Coast. In carrying out the review, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board sought input from other agencies, prepared a 3,600-page report and approved the railroad project, after concluding that its transportation and economic benefits outweighed the negative impact on the environment. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington subsequently ruled that the Board had violated NEPA, by failing to consider the environmental effects from oil drilling and production, referred to as upstream, and oil refining and distribution, known as downstream. The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law. The vote was unanimous, though Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in deliberations, and the court's three liberals wrote a more limited concurring opinion. The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law. \"They did a major cutback,\" said Harvard Law Professor Richard Lazarus, who has written extensively about NEPA. Essentially, he said, the court had created a new categorical rule barring any consideration of the upstream and downstream effects of such projects. \"Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,\" said Lazarus. Writing for the court majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that courts should defer to agency determinations about where to draw the line when considering environmental effects, as long as agency choices \"fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.\" Kavanaugh distinguished NEPA from other environmental laws, arguing that it's  \"purely a procedural statute\" that is not meant to be \"a roadblock.\" He framed his opinion as a \"judicial correction,\" pointing to \"delay after delay\" on multiple projects, which he maintained sometimes \"bordered on the Kafkaesque.\" Lazarus said Kavanaugh's opinion reads less like a judicial correction and more like a legislative policy initiative. \"He goes on this tirade where he talks about how awful NEPA has been and how it stopped all these things, how it costs jobs. And there's no citation [to any factual findings]. He's made it up,\" said Lazarus. \"It's a complete policy argument.\" At the same time, though, Lazarus conceded that over the years there has been consistent pushback against NEPA both in the courts and in Congress. He noted, for instance, that Congress, in 2023, during the Biden administration, took steps to limit some of the NEPA review. What's more, some environmental groups have also endorsed speeding up the process, including, as Lazarus observes, \"national groups who want those transmission grids built, and those windmills up, and those solar panel huge facilities built. So NEPA has created that tension.\" But many environmental groups were dismayed by Thursday's decision. Earthjustice called the decision an invitation to the Trump administration to \"ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution requirements.\" Conversely, a large array of mining, oil, lumber, real estate and other interests were thrilled by the court's decision. \"In recent years, courts have gone farther and farther afield in demanding agencies speculate on downstream impacts over which the agencies have no control and that are beyond their regulatory authority,\" said lawyer Hadassah Reimer, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of these interest groups. She said the decision \"will promote more efficient and effective NEPA review for countless projects across the country.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "The White House is sued over lack of sign language interpreters at press briefings",
    "article_text": "Kristin Wright White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks during the daily briefing on Thursday. The National Association of the Deaf is suing the White House to require American Sign Language interpreters to be present at briefings.Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) has filed a federal lawsuit against the White House over a lack of American Sign Language interpreters at media briefings. The NAD says the White House abruptly stopped providing ASL interpreters during press briefings and other public events when President Trump returned to office for a second term. The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday, asks the court to require ASL interpreters be present at these events and that video of them be available for viewers. ASL is distinct from English, with its own vocabulary and grammar. The NAD says \"at least several hundred thousand\" people in the U.S. communicate mainly in ASL, and many deaf and hard of hearing people know little English. That's why the group says English closed captioning of briefings is not sufficient. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and names President Trump, press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Chief of Staff Susie Wiles as defendants, along with offices for the president and vice president. The suit alleges the White House is violating Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which is a cornerstone of federal disability rights law, as well as the First Amendment and Fifth Amendment. \"The White House's failure to provide qualified ASL interpreters during public briefings, press conferences, and related events is against the law,\" it reads. \"Federal law unequivocally prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities and requires them to have meaningful access to the federal government's programs and services. Failing to provide ASL interpreters deprives deaf people meaningful access to the White House's press briefings.\" The White House did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on the lawsuit. Two deaf men are joining NAD in the suit. Derrick Ford, 36, lives in Anderson, Ind. The complaint says ASL is Ford's primary language and that he's concerned about \"missing information about executive orders; diversity, equity, and inclusion ('DEI'); Social Security; Medicare, the economy; and issues impacting Americans in general.\" Ford has difficulty understanding English and closed captions. The other man is Matthew Bonn, a 48-year-old resident of Germantown, Md., who attends Gallaudet University, a school in Washington, D.C., that uses ASL in the education of deaf and hard of hearing people. The lawsuit says Bonn also has trouble understanding closed captions and stopped watching White House press briefings in February because he couldn't understand them. The complaint says \"he wants information about the economy, Medicare and Medicaid changes, and executive orders on gender issues.\" The NAD says the White House ignored its repeated requests, including alettersent to Wiles in January. According to the group, more than 48 million deaf or hard of hearing people live in the U.S. \"Deaf and hard of hearing Americans have the right to the same access to White House information as everyone else,\" said Bobbie Beth Scoggins, Interim Chief Executive Officer of the NAD, in a statement. \"Such information must be provided not only through captioning but also in American Sign Language.\" This isn't the first time the group has sued the government over ASL. In 2020, the organization took the first Trump White House to federal court at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In that case,a federal judge orderedthe White House to provide a qualified interpreter for all coronavirus briefings. After the order, the White House began providing ASL for pandemic-related briefings. In 2021, under the Biden administration, the White House startedincluding ASL interpreters for all press briefingsand the following year hired the White House'sfirst full-time interpreters. The NAD says that at the time, interpreters were visible on all White House official communication channels. In his first day back in office, Trump signed anexecutive ordereliminating Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) programs and activities from the federal government.

    "title": "Market Basket CEO is put on leave in new spat at family-controlled supermarket chain",
    "article_text": "By Bill Chappell Market Basket's board says it has placed CEO Arthur T. Demoulas on leave, citing allegations that he was planning a work stoppage among employees at the family-controlled supermarket chain. One of the Massachusetts-based grocer's stores is seen here in 2014, when Demoulas thwarted an attempt to force him out.Steven Senne/APhide caption A long-running family feud is once again roiling Market Basket, an iconic New England grocery chain with at least 90 stores. The company's board has placed its CEO, Arthur T. Demoulas, on leave — a move that comes a decade after an attempt to oust Demoulas was thwarted partly by an employee strike. In the current controversy, the board cited oversight concerns and disputed succession plans as it announced its move against Demoulas. If you're not familiar with the stores, Market Basket is \"a whole thing in Greater Boston,\" asmember station WBURreports: a cultural icon beloved for high-quality foods at reasonable prices. The supermarket chain's roots extend to 1917, when Greek immigrant Athanasios \"Arthur\" Demoulasopened a store in Lowell, Mass. The business now also operates in New Hampshire and Maine. But as it has grown, family squabbles have persisted. Two of Athanasios Demoulas's sons grew Market Basket into a regional supermarket chain, as WBUR's Curt Nickishreported on NPRin 2014. \"Their sons have been feuding for decades. An epic legal battle between the two in the 1990s featured a courtroom fistfight.\" The executive committee of Market Basket's boardsaid in a statementthat it put Demoulas and several employees on paid leave, \"effective immediately while an investigation is conducted into the CEO's conduct.\" The board alleged that Demoulas has been planning a work stoppage to disrupt the business — an act they believe to be \"improper retaliation\" after the board required the CEO to cooperate with what they characterized as \"the most basic corporate oversight.\" The board added, \"Demoulas has also resisted an appropriate succession plan for Market Basket, asserting that he has the unilateral right to appoint his children to succeed him\" without the board's input. A representative for Arthur T. Demoulas didn't immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment. But in a statementquoted by WBURand other local news outlets, spokesperson Justine Griffin called the board's claim of an investigation \"a farcical cover for a hostile takeover.\" \"Griffin said Demoulas' three sisters and their three appointed board members were responsible for placing the CEO on leave,\" according to WBUR. She also reportedly said the move against Demoulas comes at a time when the company is thriving financially. Discord in the family controlling the Market Basket company made headlines more than 10 years ago, when Arthur T. Demoulas' cousin, Arthur S. Demoulas, led a push to oust him as CEO. The two are grandsons of founder Athanasios \"Arthur\" Demoulas. \"An element of distrust has existed between the two factions for years,\" Dave Solomon of theNew Hampshire Union Leadertold New Hampshire Public Radioin 2013, as the feud between two sides of the family began to spill into an outright struggle for control. In the summer of 2014, Arthur S. Demoulas succeeded in pushing out his cousin, the CEO many employees called \"ATD.\" But the change ignited weeks of turmoil and boycotts by customers and employees loyal to Arthur T. Demoulas. Many of Market Basket's more than 25,000 workers walked off the job — a stunning move considering that the companywasn't unionized, and the workers were acting to help a CEO return to running what was then a multi-billion-dollar firm. At the time, workers cited their relationships with Arthur T. Demoulas, along with a positive work environment and fears that new executives might axe their bonuses. \"Mr. Demoulas, ATD, is the heart and soul of Market Basket. Everything that this place is built upon, it's him,\" store manager Jamie Cunneentold Nickishin 2014. After nearly two months, Demoulas succeeded in regaining the CEO post. He and his siblings had offered a buyout reportedly worthmore than $1.5 billionto gain majority control of the company from the faction led by his cousin. According to the board's message this week, Demoulas is himself a minority shareholder in the family business. As it announced the CEO's on-leave status, the board said its actions won't affect the company's ownership structure — or workers' pay and benefits, including their profit-sharing plan.

    "title": "Why giant statues of snakes popped up in Geneva",
    "article_text": "By Jonathan Lambert This snake statue is one of eight that loomed in a Geneva Park during May's World Health Assembly — drawing attention to the new initiative to fight snakebite. The colors used are those of the Nigerian flag.Owen Davies/Getty Images/Getty Images Europehide caption Venomous snakebite is \"the biggest public health crisis you've never heard of,\" said former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan as he was working to get the issue onto the global health agenda in 2015. Each year, roughly 140,000 people die from snakebite 'envenoming' (basically, when a venomous snake delivers venom into the body through a bite or spray). Another 2 to 3 million are bitten each year and survive but can face serious injury or long-term disability as a result. In 2017, the World Health Organization recognized snakebite envenoming as a neglected tropical disease. \"Since then, only limited progress has been made,\" saidDavid Lalloo, vice chancellor of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. That's where the snake statues come in. As part of an effort to put the dangers of snakebite back on the agenda, Lalloo and a group of global health experts launched Strike Out Snakebite at the World Health Forum that wrapped up this week in Geneva. To garner attention, the initiative erected eight large snake statues around the city. NPR spoke with Lalloo, who has worked on snakebite for about 30 years, about the statues, the hidden burden of snakebites and what the initiative aims to achieve. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. So I've got to start with the snake statues. What's the deal there? They were pretty spectacularly colored and colorful and pretty large. I actually saw them before I knew they were part of the initiative. I thought, this is really weird. There was no label at that point, so you just saw this snake in the middle of the park. \"Silent Fang\" is the name of this snake sculpture displayed in Geneva — a term used to draw attention to the dangers of snakebite. The artist notes that the snake is decorated with the colors of the Pakistani flag — dark green and white.Owen Davies/Getty Images/Getty Images Europehide caption But they certainly attracted lots of attention throughout the week. People generally are fascinated by snakes, they either love them or hate them but are fascinated. So these are a very effective way of capturing their attention, to get the general public behind this as an issue. I think a lot of people don't think of snakebite as a major global health problem. Why does it deserve more attention? Snakebite is a problem that's very much hidden to the broader populations living in cities and to health planners because it does affect the poorest of the communities in the poorest areas of relatively poor countries. The challenge is that almost all of those individuals live in rural areas, often going about their daily work in the fields. Because it occurs in such remote areas, we don't have very good statistics. And so it's very much under-recognized as a big problem. What can happen when someone gets bitten by a venomous snake? There's a wide variety of effects. Some venomous snakes will cause a lot of local swelling, occasionally you can get quite significant tissue damage. If you get tissue breakdown, you may get ulcers, you may lose the skin. Those will not always heal well, particularly if you haven't got very good surgical facilities, so people can lose function of an arm or a leg because of snakebite. That can have a huge impact on their life, and their family's life, if they're the breadwinner. A statue of Russell's Viper — a venomous snake that lives in south and southeast Asia.Owen Davies/Getty Images/Getty Images Europehide caption And then you can have severe neurotoxicity [damage to the nervous system] that stops breathing or causes blood clotting problems. People will die from severe neurotoxicity and sometimes from bleeding or shock. There's some really interesting evidence on psychological morbidity as well, that people after snakebite have depression or post-traumatic stress disorders. What was the goal of the Strike Out Snakebite initiative at the World Health Assembly this week? The ultimate goal is that every adult and child that needs an antivenom gets a high quality antivenom delivered to them rapidly. The steps on the way to that are to, first of all, have a choice of different antivenoms we know are both effective and safe, and to have supply chain systems that will get those to the patients that need them. Alongside that, you'll have a workforce that is well-trained, that is familiar with how you manage snakebite. And then I think we'll have clear education campaigns for the population about how they avoid snakebite and what they do if they get snakebite. In 2019, WHO developed a roadmap for snakebite envenoming. It was estimated that about $140 million would be necessary to achieve that. In reality, only between 10% to 15% of that funding has been achieved. This initiative is very much an attempt to ultimately just put snakebite back on the map and highlight where we need investment to make a big difference to this disease. What's the current state of treatment? Antivenoms are the mainstay of treatment, and they're made by putting snake venom into an animal, usually a horse or sheep. Then you take the blood from the animal, you process that and make it into an antivenom. But the venom of different species is very, very different indeed. The venom of Asian snakes is completely different to that of African snakes. And even across the African continent, the venom of different species will vary quite considerably. So that has to be taken into account when you're making antivenoms and when you're distributing antivenoms. One of the snake statues on display in a park near Lake Geneva.Owen Davies/Getty Images for The Strike Out Global Initiative/Getty Images Europehide caption Another challenge with antivenoms, particularly in Africa, is that they have not always been very well regulated. So there've been poor quality or ineffective antivenoms around. So the number of people, particularly in Africa, that have access to effective, high quality antivenoms is very low indeed. Even when there are good antivenoms available, they tend to be very expensive and way beyond the affordability for many health systems. Are there efforts to develop newer vaccines? There's a lot of work trying to specifically target antibody molecules against the toxins, rather than being pretty crude and sticking venom into a horse. There are also efforts to develop drugs that will neutralize some of these toxins. The advantage of a drug is that they could potentially be given by mouth in very remote settings, whereas antivenom needs to be given into the vein. And you can only do that in bigger health clinics or hospitals. And so a drug that you could give in a very remote area would potentially be life-saving. Because most people are bitten in rural areas, it takes a long time to reach full health facilities. What about delivering care, what can be improved there? I think there's some very simple stuff that could be done on training of both medical personnel and the population. There's also this element of educating populations about prevention — how do you prevent snakes biting you? When is the most dangerous time for snakes to bite? Are there things you can do to protect, seal your hut or your house to stop snakes [from] coming inside? There's also a need to educate the population so that they know that if they have a severe snakebite, they need to go to the nearest health facility as soon as possible. Antivenom is more effective if it's given as soon after the bite as possible. I think the health system challenges are going to be considerable in terms of getting antivenoms to the right place, with appropriately trained staff at smaller centers closer to rural areas. The reality is that countries find the antivenom bills quite substantial. All these efforts will cost money. Are you concerned about funding this lesser-known problem in the current climate of shrinking funds for global health? Well, the short answer is yes. It's probably the most difficult time for global health funding in the last 20 years. We need to look for different sources of funding and also need to look at how we can integrate this [snakebite initiative] with the other initiatives, like efforts to have community health workers deliver more primary care. With a little bit of initiative and a bit of funding, we can make a big difference. Postscript: The snake sculptures were taken down after the World Health Assembly ended this week. They're currently on their way to London, where they'll stay until they can find a permanent home. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Andrew Limbong Kenyan writer Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o was a champion of local African languages.Shawn Miller/Library of Congresshide caption Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, the Kenyan writer and novelist who critiqued colonial rule as well as the post-colonial Kenyan government, died Wednesday in a hospital in Buford, Georgia. He was 87 years old. His daughter, Wanjiku Wa Ngugi,first announced the news in a Facebook post. Ngũgĩ's writing career began in 1964, with the novelWeep Not, Child. It was about a family living in colonial Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion, which fought back against British rule. The book became an important part of the African literary canon. He was a strong advocate for writing in local African languages. His 1980 novel,Devil on the Cross, was published in the Gikuyu language. \"One of the greatest tragedies of Africa is a complete disconnection of the elite from their linguistic base,\" Ngũgĩtold NPR in 2013. \"If Africa is going to contribute something original to the world, this must be rooted not only in the experience but also in the possibilities inherent in their own languages,\" he said. \"We have been brought up to think of our many languages as something which is bad. And it's the other way around. Monolingualism suffocates. It is a bad thing. Language contact is the oxygen of civilization.\" Ngũgĩ wroteDevil on the Crosswhile he was in prison. In 1977, he co-wrote a play in Gikuyu and produced it in a local theater in Kenya. And while he'd previously written work critical of the Kenyan government in English, it was this play that got him sent to a maximum security prison, though he was never charged. Born in 1938 in Kenya when it was a British colony, he originally went by James Ngugi. He went to Alliance High School, an elite boarding school, where he got to wear uniforms and play chess and read Shakespeare while his family was dealing with living under colonial rule. He wrote about this tension in his memoirIn the House of the Interpreter.In the 2013 NPR interview, he said this experience informed his decision to write in Gikuyu – that he was sent to get an education in hopes of empowering his community. \"In reality, because of language, what happens is that the messenger who is sent by the community to go and fetch knowledge from wherever they can get it becomes a prisoner,\" Ngũgĩ said. He never returns, so to speak, metaphorically because he stays within the language of his captivity.\" Ngũgĩ eventually became a professor of comparative literature at the University of California, Irvine, and was founding director of the school's International Center for Writing and Translation. He was the recipient of many literary awards, and was also constantly name-checked in discussions for a potential Nobel win.But in 2020, he told NPRthat he appreciated what he called the \"Nobel of the heart,\" which is when someone reads his work and tells him it impacted them. \"The beauty about the Nobel of the heart is it's very democratic,\" he said. \"It's available to every writer.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Elissa Nadworny A federal judge blocks the Trump administration's efforts to bar Harvard University from enrolling international students.Sophie Park/Bloomberghide caption A federal judge said that she would issue a preliminary injunction that would allow Harvard to continue enrolling international students — halting, at least for now, the Trump administration's efforts to ban the practice. Lawyers from Harvard and the Trump administration were in a packed courtroom in Boston on Thursday for a hearing on the administration's attempt to revoke the school's ability to enroll students and scholars on international visas. The move comes after the same judge, Allison D. Burroughs, granted a temporary restraining order last Friday. \"To me it represents some kind of temporary relief,\" said Ella Ricketts, a first-year international student at Harvard. She's set to start an internship soon, and had been worried that without a block, she wouldn't be able to. She said she was hesitant to mark this as a victory. \"Obviously I remain optimistic and hopeful, but this is very much just one step in a much, much larger process.\" Harvard has nearly7,000 international students, which make up more than a quarter of the student body. More than1.1 million international studentsenrolled at U.S. colleges and universities in the 2023-'24 school year. They do not qualify for federal financial aid, and so, for many colleges, represent a crucial financial lifeline. Harvard's graduation ceremony was happening at the same time as the hearing. As part of the celebration, Harvard University President Alan Garberaddressed the graduateswith a nod to the ongoing lawsuit. \"Welcome members of the class of 2025,\" he said, \"members … from down the street, across the country and around the world. Around the world. Just as it should be.\" The comments were greeted with a standing ovation and roaring applause. Before Thursday's hearing, lawyers for the Trump administrationsubmitted court documents givingHarvard 30 days to contest the revocation of its ability to enroll international students. In court, attorneys for the federal government argued that an injunction was improper because it had given the school 30 days to respond. To that Burroughs responded, \"I'd feel more comfortable if we had an order in place,\" and added that she wanted to give international students more certainty over their visa statuses. According to court filings, Harvard's lawyers argue that Trump administration officials have a vendetta against the university, singling it out for its \"speech, its perceived viewpoint, and its refusal to surrender its academic independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\" The filings included social media posts from the president as evidence. The Trump administration has argued that Harvard has \"failed to maintain a campus environment free from violence and antisemitism\" andaccused the schoolof \"coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party.\" It argues, therefore, that stripping the school of the ability to enroll international students is warranted. Harvard's president has acknowledged the school has had issues with antisemitism, and has outlined in letters to the government how the school is working to make changes.

    "article_text": "By Rachel Treisman President John Tyler, circa 1860-1865. His last surviving grandchild, Harrison Ruffin Tyler, died on Sunday.Hulton Archive/Getty Imageshide caption The last living grandson of President John Tyler — who left the White House in 1845 — has died. Harrison Ruffin Tyler died Sunday at 96, according to Annique Dunning, executive director ofSherwood Forest, the Virginia property that members of the Tyler family have called home since the end of its patriarch's presidency. Tyler had suffered strokes in recent years and died of natural causes, she said. Tyler led a successful career as a chemical engineer before turning his attention — and newfound wealth — to preserving historical sites. \"His love of history and his birthplace, Charles City County, VA, led him to preserve both Sherwood Forest, President Tyler's home, and Fort Pocahontas, a Civil War fortification nearby,\" Dunning told NPR over email. \"He will be remembered for his considerable charm, generosity and unfailing good humor by all who knew him.\" In interviews over the years, Tyler said he didn't pay much attention to his lineage when he was younger. \"I grew up during World War II, and surviving the war and the shortages was what was on everybody's mind,\" he toldSubaru Drive Magazinein 2002. \"Being related to a president was never a thought.\" As he got older, however, it became a great source of pride — and amusement. \"When you talk about my grandfather born in the 1700s, there is a disconnect there,\" he told a Richmond CBS affiliatein 2012, during a wave of media coverage. \"It is somewhat incredulous because of the time frame.\" John Tyler was the 10th president of the U.S., and the first vice president to ascend to the presidency. He took office in 1841 after William Henry Harrisondied just a monthinto his term. Tyler'sfour years in officewere largely defined by his opposition to his own Whig Party, his controversial annexation of Texas and staunch support of states' rights — and, later, the Confederacy. Tyler had eight children with hisfirst wife, Letitia, who died of a stroke in 1842. Two years later, he married Julia Gardiner, a New York socialite 30 years his junior. While Gardiner initially turned down his advances, she \"literally swooned into President Tyler's arms after witnessing her father's death in an explosion,\" according to theNational First Ladies Library & Museum. They had been cruising the Potomac River on a new naval warship when agun exploded, killing six people, including cabinet secretaries and Gardiner's father. An engraved portrait of First Lady Julia Gardiner Tyler. She and President Tyler had seven children together, one of whom was Harrison Ruffin Tyler's father.Kean Collection/Getty Imageshide caption At the end of his term, Tyler and Gardiner moved from the White House to Sherwood Forest, about 27 miles southeast of Richmond. They had a total ofseven childrenbefore his death at age 71 in 1862. Their third-youngest, Lyon Gardiner Tyler, was born in 1853 — when his dad was 63. After the death of his first wife, Lyon Gardiner Tyler went on to marry Sue Ruffin, who was 35 years his junior and had her own notable family history: She was adirect descendantof Pocahontas andEdmund Ruffin, aprominent planter, Virginia state senator and early advocate for secession. Harrison Ruffin Tyler — their second son — was born in 1928. His dadwas 75at the time. Tyler showed promise in mathematics from a young age. At 16, he won a scholarship to the College of William & Mary, where his dad had served as president. Despite Tyler's prominent family heritage, he had a modest upbringing. His son, William, told theWashington Postin 2020, because the late president's wealth was spread thin among his numerous heirs, and most of Tyler's father's wealth was \"tied up in a vast book collection\" that he donated to William & Mary. His college tuition was mysteriously paid by Lady Astor, whom the family had never met. Tyler graduated with a chemistry degree in 1949, then studied chemical engineeringat Virginia Tech. In 1968 he co-founded ChemTreat, an industrial water treatment company whose clients eventually included Kraft Foods, Philip Morris and the Ford Motor Company. It boasted revenues of $200 million in the fiscal year beforeit was acquiredby Danaher Corporation in 2007. Tyler toldVirginia Tech Magazinein 2007 that he and co-founder William Simmons had three goals: \"sell a product that works, hire good employees, and take care of those employees.\" They made the company an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) in 1989, and their employees gained controlling interest when they retired in 2000. Tyler's \"accomplishments in business changed the lives of countless employees of ChemTreat,\" Dunning told NPR. Engraved view of Sherwood Forest, the home of President John Tyler, in Charles City County, Va., circa 1845.Kean Collection/Getty Imageshide caption Tyler and his wife, Francis Payne Bouknight Tyler, acquired Sherwood Forest from cousins in 1975, according to Dunning. By that point it was a \"shadow of its former self,\" according toa databasefrom the American Aristocracy website. The president's widow, Julia, fled the property during the Civil War and returned afterward to find it ransacked by Union troops and formerly enslaved people, including some theTyler family had owned. There were 43 enslaved workers on the property as of 1860, according to Sherwood Forest. After acquiring it in the 1970s, Tyler and his wife set about restoring the 50-acre property (about half of which is open forpublic tours), referring to letters and books his grandmother had used to decorate it originally. Sherwood Forest, which is now anational historic landmark, boasts the longest frame house in America, as well as a ghost named theGray Lady. In 1996, Tyler purchasedFort Pocahontas, a Civil War fortification a few miles from Sherwood Forest. The National Register of Historic Placessays the sitewas \"virtually untouched\" for over a century until Tyler bought it. It opens to the publicfor a reenactmentone weekend every June. \"Due to his vision, dedication, and generous support, efforts to preserve and interpret the fort continue today through Fort Pocahontas LTD, a private foundation of the Tyler family,\" it added. Tyler and his wife alsodonated $5 millionto establish an endowment for the College of William & Mary's history department in 2001, in memory of his father. But, citing \"Lyon Gardiner Tyler's views on the Confederacy and on slavery,\" thedepartment was renamedin honor of Tyler himself in 2021. It says his donation underwrites research and guest lectures on a wide range of subjects, including Jewish history, imperialism, the Cold War and the histories of slavery, racism and discrimination. \"The extraordinary generosity of Harrison Ruffin Tyler — whose gift came with no limitations on the scholarly activity it would make possible — continues to bear good fruit,\" the department says. Tyler acknowledged his grandfather's complicated legacy, but also defended it. He said in a2012 interviewthat Tyler is not often recognized for organizing a Peace Conference in Washington in 1861 to try to avert a civil war. When that effort failed, he was elected to the Confederate Congress but died before his term began. \"He was not a traitor to his country,\" he separately told WTVR, the CBS station, that year. \"John Tyler did try to promote peace wherever he could.\" He laughed off the idea of following in his family's tradition of fathering children later in life, saying, \"We're not going that route again.\" Tyler's wife, Frances Payne Bouknight Tyler,died in 2019. His brother, Lyon Gardiner Tyler Jr.,died in 2020, making him the president's last surviving grandson. Harrison Ruffin Tyler is survived by three children and eight grandchildren, according to Dunning, who says Sherwood Forest will remain in the family. \"Sherwood Forest is a private foundation of the Tyler family,\" she said. \"Nothing will be changing about that.\" An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Harrison Ruffin Tyler had eight great-grandchildren. They are his grandchildren, not great-grandchildren. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Amid rising prices, Disney+ and Hulu offer subscribers some freebies",
    "article_text": "Small subscriber perks help the streaming services stand out. With streaming providers frequentlyraising prices, subscribers often feel like they’re paying more for the same service—or a lesser version, depending on what’s available to watch that month. In a unique move, Disney is introducing a small, potential financial benefit to Disney+ and Hulu subscribers in the form of some third-party discounts, freebies, trials, and contests. As of today, Disney+ subscribers can log into Disney’sDisney+ Perks websitewith their streaming credentials to get access to a revolving selection of discounts and freebies. When I logged in today, I was met with options for several free trials, including a six-month one to DoorDash’s premium subscription offering, a three-month trial to Clear+, and a two-month trial to Duolingo’s premium subscription. Disney+ subscribers can also get discounts, including to Adidas’ online marketplaces and “select” Disney Resorts Collection hotels (ifyou stay at least two nights, with most availability occurring between June 29 and July 31). There are also some free virtual rewards for Disney-owned games and the ability to enter sweepstakes, like for going to the premiere of the movieFreakier Friday. Disney, which announced in November 2023 that it wouldtake full control of Hulufrom Comcast, said that Hulu-only subscribers will also get a perks program, starting on June 2. Those perks will differ from those of Disney+ and initially include chances to win tickets to Lollapalooza, San Diego Comic-Con, andJimmy Kimmel Live, unspecified “perks” from Microsoft, LG, and others, and chances “to win items from and inspired by Hulu” originals, likeThe Handmaid’s Tale. Disney+ previously offered a perks programin November 2023, but the program was only available until January 31, 2024. This updated US program doesn’t appear to have an end date. None of these so-called perks are enough to make most people rush to sign up for a Disney+ or Hulu subscription. Accessing the perks also requires tying a MyDisney account to your Disney+ or Hulu account, which may disinterest you. Further, most of the perks are tied to providing more information to third parties, which will likely be used for marketing. However, Disney said it will add new perks regularly. The program stands in contrast to other streaming services that are often getting increasingly expensive without bringing new benefits to customers. Disney has previously tested subscriber loyalty with price hikes, including its most recent one that saw subscription fees to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ increase byup to 25 percentin October, as well as by cracking down onpassword sharing. When announcing the price hikes, Disney CEO Bob Iger said that the company wasn’t worried about customer blowback but focused on customer engagement. In addition to offering desirable content, the perks program is a unique way to keep subscribers interested in Disney’s streaming services. Recently, Disney has also sought to keep customers engaged by combiningDisney+ and Hulu into a unified app, which has been generally well-received. On May 7, Disney said it had 126 million Disney+ and 54.7 million Hulu subscribers, compared to Netflix’s 301.6 million. Disney reported an operating income of $336 million for its direct-to-consumer business, which includes the Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+, and Indian Hotstar streaming services.

    "article_text": "The chatbot can answer questions and extract data from your uploaded vids. Google's rapid adoption of AI has seen the Gemini \"sparkle\" icon become an omnipresent element in almost every Google product. It's there to summarize your email,add itemsto your calendar, and more—if youtrust it to do those things. Gemini is also integrated with Google Drive, where it's gaining a new feature that could make it genuinely useful: Google's AI bot will soon be able to watch videos stored in your Drive so you don't have to. Gemini is already accessible in Drive, with the ability to summarize documents or folders, gather and analyze data, and expand on the topics covered in your documents. Google says the next step is plugging videos into Gemini, saving you from wasting time scrubbing through a file just to find something of interest. Using a chatbot to analyze and manipulate text doesn't always make sense—after all, it's not hard to skim an email or short document. It can take longer to interact with a chatbot, which might not add any useful insights. Video is different because watching is a linear process in which you are presented with information at the pace the video creator sets. You can change playback speed or rewind to catch something you missed, but that's more arduous than reading something at your own pace. So Gemini's video support in Drive could save you real time. Suppose you have a recorded meeting in video form uploaded to Drive. You could go back and rewatch it to take notes or refresh your understanding of a particular exchange. Or, Google suggests, you can ask Gemini to summarize the video and tell you what's important. This could be a great alternative, as grounding AI output with a specific data set or file tends to make it more accurate. Naturally, you should still maintain healthy skepticism of what the AI tells you about the content of your video. This feature will be accessible only from the Gemini overlay in Drive or in the standalone Drive file viewer. Importantly, this feature relies on Google's auto-generated video captions. This feature is enabled by default for all videos uploaded to your Drive. However, if you use a managed Workspace account, the administrator may have disabled automatic captioning or set it to be on demand. If Gemini can't understand your videos, you may need to use the Manage Caption Tracks setting to generate captions. Like most Workspace features, this one won't be arriving for everyone at the same time, and it's only available for paid accounts. Business, enterprise, and education users all get access (pending administrator approval), as well as individual Google One AI Premium accounts. Google didn't call outAI Ultra subscriptionsspecifically, but we expect this wildly expensive option won't be left out. It could take up to 15 days for all eligible accounts to get Gemini video support. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "Feds reduced maximum infringement amount from \"tens of millions\" to $40,000. An accused movie pirate who stole more than 1,000 Blu-ray discs and DVDs while working for a DVD manufacturing company struck aplea dealthis week to lower his sentence after theFBI claimed the man's piracy cost movie studios millions. Steven Hale no longer works for the DVD company. He was arrested in March, accused of \"bypassing encryption that prevents unauthorized copying\" and ripping pre-release copies of movies he could only access because his former employer was used by major movie studios. As alleged by the feds, his game was beating studios to releases to achieve the greatest possible financial gains from online leaks. Among the popular movies that Hale is believed to have leaked between 2021 and 2022 wasSpider-Man: No Way Home, which the FBI alleged was copied \"tens of millions of times\" at an estimated loss of \"tens of millions of dollars\" for just one studio on one movie. Other movies Hale ripped included animated hits likeEncantoandSing 2, as well as anticipated sequels likeThe Matrix: ResurrectionsandVenom: Let There Be Carnage. The cops first caught wind of Hale's scheme in March 2022. They seized about 1,160 Blu-rays and DVDs in what TorrentFreaknotedwere the days just \"after theSpider-Manmovie leaked online.\" It's unclear why it took close to three years before Hale's arrest, but TorrentFreak suggested that Hale's case is perhaps part of a bigger investigation into theSpider-Manleaks. TorrentFreak also noted that the plea deal doesn't just push for a lower sentence—recommending a \"maximum reduction\" while crediting Hale for \"taking responsibility\"—it also drastically cut down the estimated losses to studios. The court has yet to finalize damages, but the US Department of Justice estimated that the total \"infringement amount\" is no more than $40,000. Under the plea deal, the DOJ agreed to drop one count of copyright infringement and another count of interstate transportation of stolen goods. But Hale remains on the hook for the other copyright infringement charge. For stealing and distributing the discs, he faces a maximum five-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine, plus three years of supervised release. He will also have to pay restitution to any victims who can show they suffered losses because of his leaks. The exact damages and Hale's sentence will be determined at a hearing at a Tennessee district court at the end of August.

    "title": "Your next gaming dice could be shaped like a dragon or armadillo",
    "article_text": "Statistically, \"the real behavior of a rolling object is largely a function of its geometry.\" Most people are familiar with conventional cubical six-sided dice, but there are also polyhedral versions like the 20-sided dice used in ancient Rome and to playDungeons and Dragons. Researchers have figured out how to design dice with even more exotic shapes, like a kitten, a dragon, or an armadillo. And they are \"fair\" dice: Experiments with 3D-printed versions produced results that closely matched predicted random outcomes, according to a forthcoming paper currently in press at the journal ACM Transactions on Graphics. Dice are examples of so-called \"rigid bodies,\" broadly defined as shapes that move as one solid piece, with no need for bending or twisting. Such shapes \"are of scientific interest because they model so many of the phenomena we encounter in our daily lives: anything from the way your dishes roll around on the floor when you drop them, to how the gears in your watch push on each other, to how a satellite tumbles around under the pull of gravity,\" co-author Keenan Crane of Carnegie-Mellon University told Ars. \"So there's an intense focus on developing computational methods for understanding and predicting how rigid bodies are going to behave.\" Crane and his co-authors—including lead author and CMU graduate student Hossein Baktash, as well as co-authors from Nvidia Research and Adobe Research—wanted to explore where and how a rigid body will land when tossed. They chose dice as the best (and most fun) context in which to explore that question. \"But it's also helpful to understand, for instance, if you load up a 3D model on your computer, how should it be displayed on screen—which direction is 'up'?\" said Crane. \"Or if you drop a rigid object in the ocean, can you design it so that it lands with the proper orientation, with high probability?\" The group began with the assumption that when it comes to the rest behavior of a rolling irregularly shaped rigid body—such as the pig-shaped \"dice\" from the commercial gamePass the Pigs—the effects of momentum would be negligible. They wanted to approach the problem from the perspective of analytical geometry rather than dynamical simulations, so they essentially mapped the corners, edges, and faces onto a sphere and simulated how gravity would act upon such objects as they fell and came to rest. The ultimate objective was to estimate the probability distribution over the possible range of resting configurations using just geometry. They ran multiple computer simulations of seven weirdly shaped designs for dice and then created physical 3D-printed versions to test them experimentally, tossing each die between 100 and 1,000 times. They tweaked each shape until the experimental resting positions were within 3 or 4 percent of the predicted probability outcomes. These designs included a single die simulating two rolling six-sided dice (D6+D6); two binomial dice simulating flipping two and three fair coins, respectively; and three versions of a single die with three equally likely outcomes, shaped like a kitten, an armadillo, and a dragon. They also analyzed a talus-shaped model, similar to the sheep's knuckles or \"astragali\" used as dice in antiquity for gambling or divination. Baktash recalled playing with such objects as a child growing up in Iran. \"These irregular dice were in a way similar to the ones we’ve designed, in that they don’t have even probabilities—like 1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4—but rather depend on the very particular shape of the knuckles,\" said Crane. \"People bet on different outcomes, using past experience to build up their intuition about which sides are most likely. Hossein’s tool can do this much more directly: By just looking at the shape, it can directly give you some pretty accurate probabilities. If we were able to time travel back and gamble in ancient Greece, we might be able to make a lot of money (in BC-adjusted dollar).\" So one day soon, gamers might be able to choose from a wide selection of exotically shaped dice for future play—and even 3D print their own designs. (You can already 3D print the team's designs since Baktashposted the STL files.) The new tool might also prove useful for creating natural-looking arrangements of geometry or adjusting a design so that an object is better able to stand upright, akin to the \"Daruma doll,\" a traditional Japanese toy that is hollow and weighted at the bottom so that it always returns to an upright position when tilted over. \"Our approach makes it possible to bake this property into the geometry of the shape itself,\" said Crane. As for more \"serious\" applications, Crane points to underwater construction, \"where the low-momentum assumption is very realistic and it's important for things to land in the proper orientation,\" he said. \"Alternatively, if you imagine each little grain of sand or soil is a rigid particle, the statistics of how they land might help understand things like how soil settles and compacts. The exciting thing about putting research like this out in the world is that, a few years later, other folks inevitably find use cases for it that we never could have imagined.\" There are some inevitable tradeoffs. Oklahoma State University mathematician Henry Segermantold New Scientistthat the method isn't \"necessarily a silver-bullet solution to designing weird dice, because it ignores friction, bouncing, and other real-world momentum effects. It’s more like they are—very efficiently—predicting where a die ends up if you put it down with a random orientation on a non-slip surface in low gravity. It slowly falls over and rolls down to land, without slipping or bouncing.\" Crane and his co-authors acknowledge as much in their paper. \"On the one hand, [critics] are absolutely correct that our model does not make perfect predictions from the perspective of idealized geometry and physics,\" said Crane. \"On the other hand, if your goal is to literally make dice for tabletop games, it's perfectly reasonable to make these kinds of approximations.\" That's partly because of the nature of statistics. \"If you flip a coin or roll a die only a few times, it can be very hard to tell whether it's fair or not,\" said Crane. \"Suppose I roll a 6-sided die just once, and it comes up with a '5.' Is it fair, or not? Impossible to say. Likewise, if I playSettlers of Catan, I might roll the dice only about 100 times in the whole game. Even if the dice are actually fair, the distribution of rolls I see throughout this short game might vary quite a bit from the idealized distribution—I might just happen to roll a lot more nines that game than usual. So, in a real game, there may not be a huge practical difference between using fair dice and dice that have a small bias. The signal-to-noise ratio is so low that the practical effect over a short game is pretty small.\" Then there is the human factor: Even assuming perfect dice, how people handle them is imperfect and unpredictable;even fair coins don't yield 50/50 oddsbecause of that. \"There will always be some kind of 'dice handling bias' due to the way that people pick up, shake (or not shake!), and toss dice,\" said Crane. \"If you wanted to make dice that exhibit perfect statistics in practice, rather than just in theory, you might need to take an interdisciplinary approach that incorporated not just geometry and physics, but also ideas from psychology, design, and so on.\" \"I think the reality is that if we wanted more perfect statistics, we would just ask a computer to generate a random number,\" Crane concluded. \"The reason people use dice for tabletop games is because it's tactile and fun. I think Hossein's approach does a great job of making dice rolling even more fun—while still remaining grounded on some solid mathematical principles.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Enigmatic hominin species studied using 2 million-year-old proteins",
    "article_text": "We weren't even sure ifParanthropusremains come from a single species. The ability to study ancient DNA has revolutionized our ability to understand our own species' past. It has clarified our relationship with Neanderthals and revealed the existence of Denisovans. But even in the most favorable environments, DNA degrades over time, setting a limit on how far back we can hope to resolve questions about our ancestors. And most of the species we've had trouble understanding lived in Africa, where the conditions are far less favorable for DNA's survival. But a large international team has now found another way to get some information about the genetics out of far older remains. They've extracted fragments of enamel proteins from the teeth of fossils of the speciesParanthropus robustusand used them to test whether the remains truly belonged to one species, despite dramatic differences in size. Because one of the proteins is male-specific, they also found the size of the individual wasn't necessarily related to its sex. Remains that have been classified asParanthropusshow up in the fossil record nearly 3 million years ago and persist for roughly a million years. That means it overlapped both withaustralopithecinesand early members of theHomogenus. Four different species have been assigned to this genus, but the situation is complicated. It shares a lot of similarities with some species ofAustralopithecus, raising the possibility of interbreeding. There's also a lot of variation within remains identified asParanthropus, notably in the size of individuals. Some have suggested that this might be due to male/female differences in this species (termed \"sexual dimorphism\"), but that has been difficult to test. Unfortunately, no remains have been found outside of Africa, and no DNA older than 20,000 years has been recovered from that continent—well afterParanthropuswent extinct. So, forParanthropusremains that date from roughly 2 million years ago, the team turned to proteins found in teeth. These inevitably get damaged over time—broken down into smaller fragments, with some amino acids chemically altered. But the robust nature of tooth enamel should prevent their wholesale destruction. And the technique known asmass spectrometryis sensitive enough to identify individual isotopes of atoms incorporated into larger molecules. Using this, the researchers could identify the likely composition of individual fragments of proteins and match those to known tooth enamel proteins. After testing their techniques on animal remains found with the hominins, the researchers turned to samples from theParanthropusteeth, all found at the same site within South Africa’s Cradle of Humankind World Heri­tage Site. While the proteins identified varied from sample to sample, they found six different proteins that were present in all four of the teeth studied, though again, only as fragments. Collectively, those fragments covered 425 amino acids of the six proteins. To confirm that the results, generated in a lab in Copenhagen, were real, they repeated the process at a lab in Cape Town. The successful replication was bolstered by the fact that some of the amino acids showed signs of chemical damage, indicating that they really were pieces of 2 million-year-old proteins. So, what could small bits of ancient proteins tell us? In this case, more than you might expect. That's because one of the enamel proteins, AMELY, comes from a gene that's located on the Y chromosome (there's also an AMELX gene on the X chromosome). And some of the protein fragments identified in a subset of the four remain clearly included pieces of AMELY, indicating that the tooth had come from a male individual. That turns out to be critical to testing the idea that body size is an indication of sex differences inParanthropus. One of the samples was a small tooth that had been suggested to be from a female individual, but the presence of AMELY unambiguously identifies it as male. That's an important result because, as the researchers put it, \"it enables us to exclude sexual dimorphism as one of the multiple variables affecting the range of anatomical variation,\" in this species. The absence of AMELY suggests that a sample is female, but it isn't definitive. That's both because it's impossible to rule out some problem with identifying the protein in samples this old, and in part because some rare males (including at least one Neanderthal) carry deletions that eliminate the gene entirely. Another key aspect is that some of the 425 amino acid locations differ between hominin species, and even individual members ofParanthropus. Thus, they can potentially serve as a diagnostic of the relationships between and within species and help address some of the confusion about how many species ofParanthropusthere were and their relationship with other hominins. While it's difficult to say too much with only four samples, the researchers found some suggestive evidence. For example, they tested whether you might see the sort of amino acid variation found among these samples if they all belonged to the same species. This was done by randomly choosing four human genomes and examining whether they had a similar level of variation. They concluded that it was \"plausible\" that you'd see this level of variation among any four individuals that were chosen at random, but the population of modern humans is likely to be larger than that ofParanthropus, so the test wasn't definitive. Among the 425 different amino acids were 16 that had species-specific variations among hominins. Somewhat surprisingly,Paranthropus robustusis the most closely related species to our own genus,Homo, based on a tree built from these variations. Again, however, they conclude that there simply isn't enough data available to feel confident in this conclusion. But that should really be an \"isn't enough data yet.\" We heard about this paper from regular Ars reader Enrico Cappellini, who happens to be its senior author and faculty at the University of Copenhagen's Globe Institute. And a quick look overhis faculty profileindicates that developing the techniques used here is his major research focus, so hopefully we'll be able to expand the data available on extinct hominin species with time. The challenge, as noted in the paper, is that the technique destroys a small part of the sample, and these samples are one-of-a-kind pieces of the collective history of all of humanity.

    "title": "AI video just took a startling leap in realism. Are we doomed?",
    "article_text": "Google's Veo 3 delivers AI videos of realistic people with sound and music. We put it to the test. Last week, Googleintroduced Veo 3, its newest video generation model that can create 8-second clips with synchronized sound effects and audio dialog—a first for the company's AI tools. The model, which generates videos at 720p resolution (based on text descriptions called \"prompts\" or still image inputs), represents what may be the most capable consumer video generator to date, bringing video synthesis close to a point where it is becoming very difficult to distinguish between \"authentic\" and AI-generated media. Google alsolaunched Flow, an online AI filmmaking tool that combines Veo 3 with the company's Imagen 4 image generator and Gemini language model, allowing creators to describe scenes in natural language and manage characters, locations, and visual styles in a web interface. Both tools are now available to US subscribers of Google AI Ultra, a plan that costs $250 a month and comes with 12,500 credits. Veo 3 videos cost 150 credits per generation, allowing 83 videos on that plan before you run out. Extra credits are available for the price of 1 cent per credit in blocks of $25, $50, or $200. That comes out to about $1.50 per video generation. But is the price worth it? We ran some tests with various prompts to see what this technology is truly capable of. Like other modern video generation models, Veo 3 is built on diffusion technology—the same approach that powers image generators likeStable DiffusionandFlux. The training process works by taking real videos and progressively adding noise to them until they become pure static, then teaching a neural network to reverse this process step by step. During generation, Veo 3 starts with random noise and a text prompt, then iteratively refines that noise into a coherent video that matches the description. DeepMind won't say exactly where it sourced the content to train Veo 3, but YouTube is a strong possibility. Google owns YouTube, and DeepMindpreviously told TechCrunchthat Google models like Veo \"may\" be trained on some YouTube material. It's important to note that Veo 3 is a system composed of a series of AI models, including a large language model (LLM) to interpret user prompts to assist with detailed video creation, a video diffusion model to create the video, and an audio generation model that applies sound to the video. In an attempt to prevent misuse, DeepMind says it's using its proprietary watermarking technology,SynthID, to embed invisible markers into frames Veo 3 generates. These watermarks persist even when videos are compressed or edited, helping people potentially identify AI-generated content. As we'll discuss more later, though, this may not be enough to prevent deception. Google also censors certain prompts and outputs that breach the company's content agreement. During testing, we encountered \"generation failure\" messages for videos that involve romantic and sexual material, some types of violence, mentions of certain trademarked or copyrighted media properties, some company names, certain celebrities, and some historical events. Perhaps the biggest change with Veo 3 is integrated audio generation, although Meta previewed a similar audio-generation capability with \"Movie Gen\" last October, and AI researchers have experimented with using AI to add soundtracks to silent videosfor some time. Google DeepMind itselfshowed offan AI soundtrack-generating model in June 2024. Veo 3 can generate everything from traffic sounds to music and character dialogue, though our early testing reveals occasional glitches. Spaghetti makes crunching sounds when eaten (aswe covered last week, with a nod to the famous Will Smith AI spaghetti video), and in scenes with multiple people, dialogue sometimes comes from the wrong character's mouth. But overall, Veo 3 feels like a step change in video synthesis quality and coherency over models fromOpenAI,Runway,Minimax,Pika,Meta,Kling, andHunyuanvideo. The videos also tend to show garbled subtitles that almost match the spoken words, which is an artifact of subtitles on videos present in the training data. The AI model is imitating what it has \"seen\" before. We generated each of the eight-second-long 720p videos seen below usingGoogle's Flow platform. Each video generation took around three to five minutes to complete, and we paid for them ourselves. It's important to note that better results come from cherry-picking—running the same prompt multiple times until you find a good result. Due to cost and in the spirit of testing, we only ran every prompt once, unless noted. Let's dive right into the deep end with audio generation to get a grip on what this technology can do. We'vepreviously shownyou a man singing about spaghetti and a rapping shark in our last Veo 3 piece, but here's some more complex dialogue. Since 2022, we've beenusing the prompt\"a muscular barbarian with weapons beside a CRT television set, cinematic, 8K, studio lighting\" to test AI image generators like Midjourney. It's time to bring that barbarian to life. A muscular barbarian man holding an axe, standing next to a CRT television set. He looks at the TV, then to the camera and literally says, \"You've been looking for this for years: a muscular barbarian with weapons beside a CRT television set, cinematic, 8K, studio lighting. Got that, Benj?\" The video above represents significant technical progress in AI media synthesis over the course of only three years. We've gone from a blurry colorful still-image barbarian to a photorealistic guy that talks to us in 720p high definition with audio. Most notably, there's no reason to believe technical capability in AI generation will slow down from here. Horror film: A scared woman in a Victorian outfit running through a forest, dolly shot, being chased by a man in a peanut costume screaming, \"Wait! You forgot your wallet!\" Trailer for The Haunted Basketball Train: a Tim Burton film where 1990s basketball star is stuck at the end of a haunted passenger train with basketball court cars, and the only way to survive is to make it to the engine by beating different ghosts at basketball in every car ASMR video of a muscular barbarian man whispering slowly into a microphone, \"You love CRTs, don't you? That's OK. It's OK to love CRT televisions and barbarians.\" 1980s PBS show about a man with a beard talking about how his Apple II computer can \"connect to the world through a series of tubes\" A 1980s fitness video with models in leotards wearing werewolf masks A female therapist looking at the camera, zoom call. She says, \"Oh my lord, look at that Atari 800 you have behind you! I can't believe how nice it is!\" With this technology, one can easily imagine a virtual world of AI personalities designed to flatter people. This is a fairly innocent example about a vintage computer, but you can extrapolate, making the fake person talk about any topic at all. There are limits due to Google's filters, but from what we've seen in the past, a future uncensored version of a similarly capable AI video generator is very likely. Video call screenshot capture of a Zoom chat. A psychologist in a dark, cozy therapist's office. The therapist says in a friendly voice, \"Hi Tom, thanks for calling. Tell me about how you're feeling today. Is the depression still getting to you? Let's work on that.\" 1960s NASA footage of the first man stepping onto the surface of the Moon, who squishes into a pile of mud and yells in a hillbilly voice, \"What in tarnation??\" A local TV news interview of a muscular barbarian talking about why he's always carrying a CRT TV set around with him Speaking of fake news interviews, Veo 3 can generate plenty of talking anchor-persons, although sometimes on-screen text is garbled if you don't specify exactly what it should say. It's in cases like this where it seems Veo 3 might be most potent at casual media deception. Footage from a news report about Russia invading the United States Veo 3's AI audio generator can create music in various genres, although in practice, the results are typically simplistic. Still, it's a new capability for AI video generators. Here are a few examples in various musical genres. A PBS show of a crazy barbarian with a blonde afro painting pictures of Trees, singing \"HAPPY BIG TREES\" to some music while he paints A 1950s cowboy rides up to the camera and sings in country music, \"I love mah biiig ooold donkeee\" A 1980s hair metal band drives up to the camera and sings in rock music, \"Help me with my huge huge huge hair!\" Mister Rogers' Neighborhood PBS kids show intro done with psychedelic acid rock and colored lights 1950s musical jazz group with a scat singer singing about pickles amid gibberish The prompts below come from our previous video tests ofGen-3,Video-01, and the open sourceHunyuanvideo, so you can flip back to those articles and compare the results if you want to. Overall, Veo 3 appears to have far greater temporal coherency (having a consistent subject or theme over time) than the earlier video synthesis models we've tested. But of course, it's not perfect. A highly intelligent person reading 'Ars Technica' on their computer when the screen explodes The moonshark jumping out of a computer screen and attacking a person A herd of one million cats running on a hillside, aerial view Video game footage of a dynamic 1990s third-person 3D platform game starring an anthropomorphic shark boy Aerial shot of a small American town getting deluged with liquid cheese after a massive cheese rainstorm where liquid cheese rained down and dripped all over the buildings Wide-angle shot, starting with the Sasquatch at the center of the stage giving a TED talk about mushrooms, then slowly zooming in to capture its expressive face and gestures, before panning to the attentive audience A trip-hop rap song about Ars Technica being sung by a guy in a large rubber shark costume on a stage with a full moon in the background Google's Veo 3 isn't perfect at synthesizing every scenario we can throw at it due to limitations of training data. Aswe notedin our previous coverage, AI video generators remain fundamentally imitative, making predictions based on statistical patterns rather than a true understanding of physics or how the world works. For example, if you see mouths moving during speech, or clothes wrinkling in a certain way when touched, it means the neural network doing the video generation has \"seen\" enough similar examples of that scenario in the training data to render a convincing take on it and apply it to similar situations. However, when a novel situation (or combination of themes) isn't well-represented in the training data, you'll see \"impossible\" or illogical things happen, such as weird body parts, magically appearing clothing, or an object that \"shatters\" but remains in the scene afterward, as you'll see below. We mentioned audio and video glitches in the introduction. In particular, scenes with multiple people sometimes confuse which character is speaking, such as this argument between tech fans. A 2000s TV debate between fans of the PowerPC and Intel Pentium chips Bombastic 1980s infomercial for the \"Ars Technica\" online service. With cheesy background music and user testimonials 1980s Rambo fighting Soviets on the Moon Sometimes requests don't make coherent sense. In this case, \"Rambo\" is correctly on the Moon firing a gun, but he's not wearing a spacesuit. He's a lot tougher than we thought. An animated infographic showing how many floppy disks it would take to hold an installation of Windows 11 Large amounts of text also present a weak point, but if a short text quotation is explicitly specified in the prompt, Veo 3 usually gets it right. A young woman doing a complex floor gymnastics routine at the Olympics, featuring running and flips Despite Veo 3's advances in temporal coherency and audio generation, it still suffers from the same \"jabberwockies\" we saw in OpenAI's viral Sora gymnast video—those non-plausible video hallucinations like impossible morphing body parts. A silly group of men and women cartwheeling across the road, singing \"CHEEEESE\" and holding the note for 8 seconds before falling over. A YouTube-style try-on video of a person trying on various corncob costumes. They shout \"Corncob haul!!\" A man made of glass runs into a brick wall and shatters, screaming A man in a spacesuit holding up 5 fingers and counting down to zero, then blasting off into space with rocket boots Counting down with fingers is difficult for Veo 3, likely because it's not well-represented in the training data. Instead, hands are likely usually shown in a few positions like a fist, a five-finger open palm, a two-finger peace sign, and the number one. As new architectures emerge and future models train on vastly larger datasets with exponentially more compute, these systems will likely forge deeper statistical connections between the concepts they observe in videos, dramatically improving quality and also the ability to generalize more with novel prompts. By now, some of you might be worried that we're in trouble as a society due to potential deception from this kind of technology. And there's a good reason to worry: The American pop culture diet currently relies heavily on clips shared by strangers through social media such as TikTok, and now all of that can easily be faked, whole-cloth. Automated generations of fake people can now argue for ideological positions in a way that could manipulate the masses. Such videos could be (and were) manipulated before through various means prior to Veo 3, but now the barrier to entry has collapsed from requiring specialized skills, expensive software, and hours of painstaking work to simply typing a prompt and waiting three minutes. What once required a team of VFX artists or at least someone proficient in After Effects can now be done by anyone with a credit card and an Internet connection. But let's take a moment to catch our breath. At Ars Technica, we've been warning about the deceptive potential of realistic AI-generated media sinceat least 2019. In 2022, we talked about AI image generatorStable Diffusionand the ability totrain peopleinto custom AI image models. We discussed Sora \"collapsing media reality\" and talked about persistent media skepticism during the \"deep doubt era.\" I alsowrote in detailabout the future ability for people to pollute the historical record with AI-generated noise. In that piece, I used the term \"cultural singularity\" to denote a time when truth and fiction in media become indistinguishable, not only because of the deceptive nature of AI-generated content but also due to the massive quantities of AI-generated and AI-augmented media we'll likely soon be inundated with. However, in an article I wrote last year aboutcloning my dad's handwritingusing AI, I came to the conclusion that my previous fears about the cultural singularity may be overblown. Media has always been vulnerable to forgery since ancient times; trust in any remote communication ultimately depends on trusting its source. The Romans had laws against forgery in 80 BC, and people have been doctoring photos since the medium's invention. What has changed isn't the possibility of deception but its accessibility and scale. With Veo 3's ability to generate convincing video with synchronized dialogue and sound effects, we're not witnessing the birth of media deception—we're seeing its mass democratization. What once cost millions of dollars in Hollywood special effects can now be created for pocket change. As these tools become more powerful and affordable, skepticism in media will grow. But the question isn't whether we can trust what we see and hear. It's whether we can trust who's showing it to us. In an era where anyone can generate a realistic video of anything for $1.50, the credibility of the source becomes our primary anchor to truth. The medium was never the message—the messenger always was. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years. With our unique combination of\n          technical savvy and wide-ranging interest in the technological arts\n          and sciences, Ars is the trusted source in a sea of information. After\n          all, you don’t need to know everything, only what’s important.",

    "title": "Video apps like Hulu “cannot be used on Nintendo Switch 2,” says support page",
    "article_text": "Nintendo is still testing the 15,000+ game Switch library with the Switch 2. Nintendo's Switch 2 has a small handful of new releases in its launch lineup, but for the first few months after its release, the main thing you'll be able to play on it will be your existing library of Switch games. And while Nintendo has promised reasonably comprehensive backward compatibility, the company is still working through the process of testing over 15,000 third-party Switch games with the new console. With a week to go until launch, Nintendo has updated its compatibility support page with the results of nearly two months of extra testing. Of the \"over 15,000\" third-party Switch games, Nintendo says roughly two-thirds of them either have \"no issues\" or have problems that will be resolved quickly at or after launch. On the original version of this support page, Nintendo had only performed its basic compatibility testing on roughly 20 percent of all third-party Switch games. Nintendo says that nearly all of the roughly 5,000 remaining Switch games will launch just fine on the Switch 2 but that \"further tests\" are \"in progress.\" The support page doesn't say when Nintendo will provide its next update. Nintendo has also updated PDF documents listingindividual games that won't launch, games that start up but havesome other kind of compatibility problem, and games with problems that should be \"addressed by launch or shortly after.\" Nearly all of the 122 first-party Nintendo games will run fine on the Switch 2, with the only exceptions being the Nintendo Labo cardboard kits that were made with the physical dimensions of the original Switch in mind. Additionally, some games that use features of the original Switch Joy-Cons will only work if you pair an external Joy-Con with the Switch 2. Aside from the paid Switch 2 upgrade packs that add extra content and graphical improvements, Nintendo is releasing severalfree Switch game updatesto add a handful of Switch 2-specific features and improve performance on the new console. Third-party game developers will presumably be able to release these kinds of updates as well. Nintendo has said that it is using a solution \"that'ssomewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility\" to get original Switch games running on the Switch 2, which is why compatibility testing is necessary. Though this has been reported by some outlets as \"emulation,\" it appears that Nintendo is actually using some kind of code translation to allow Switch games to run on Switch 2 hardware, sort of like what Valve uses to makeWindows PC games run on the Steam Deck's Linux-based operating system. This would avoid the performance overhead of a true software emulator, while allowing most Switch software to run without requiring additional effort from the game's developer. Aside from games, it seems like Nintendo is closing the door on what few video-streaming and non-game media apps will run on the Switch 2. Nintendo says that the Hulu, Crunchyroll, InkyPen, Abema, and Niconico apps from the original Switch \"cannot be used on Nintendo Switch 2,\" which seems to close the door on any kind of Switch 2-compatible software update for these apps. Nintendo has never really positioned the Switch as a living room multimedia device in the same way that Sony and Microsoft have with the PlayStation and Xbox. Most TVs that have a Switch connected to them will also either be able to access these services natively through built-in apps or be connected to some other kind of external device that supports them (either a cable box, another console, or a streaming box like a Roku or Apple TV). But it's still unusual for a tablet-like device in 2025 to totally lack support for this category of media-streaming app. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Trump allies expect he’ll double down on tariffs after sweeping court block",
    "article_text": "Trump rejects court ruling he can't impose tariffs at his whim. Donald Trump can't impose whatever tariffs he wants on a whim, a federal courtruledWednesday, issuing an opinion that analysts say has only stoked more trade chaos. The ruling permanently blocked some of the most controversial tariffs and reportedly scrambled Trump's ongoing trade talks with many countries pressured into negotiations by the threat of those tariffs, CNNreported. The blocked tariffs—which the court found were implemented unconstitutionally under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)—included tariffs the administration said were designed to stop drug and human trafficking, as well as retaliatory tariffs placed on all countries that were supposed to put an end to persistent US trade deficits. Following several lawsuits alleging that Trump's so-called \"emergency\" tariffs exceeded his authority, the verdict came from a three-judge panel at the US Court of International Trade, including Trump-appointed Timothy Reif, Barack Obama-appointed Gary Katzman, and Ronald Reagan-appointed Jane Restani. Judges agreed that under the IEEPA, Trump can't just declare a \"national emergency\" and impose tariffs when there is no \"unusual and extraordinary\" threat and tariffs aren't targeted to \"deal with\" that specific threat. For worldwide tariffs, the long-endured US trade deficits were not deemed an \"unusual and extraordinary\" threat to national security. And trafficking tariffs didn't directly address trafficking but rather created leverage for Trump to pressure foreign governments to address the trafficking. According to judges, granting Trump's arguments risked allowing any president to justify using IEEPA powers to pressure anyone into anything. They wrote: The Government’s reading would cause the meaning of  \"deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to permit any infliction of a burden on a counterparty to exact concessions, regardless of the relationship between the burden inflicted and the concessions exacted. If \"deal with\" can mean \"impose a burden until someone else deals with,\" then everything is permitted. It means a President may use IEEPA to take whatever actions he chooses simply by declaring them \"pressure\" or \"leverage\" tactics that will elicit a third party’s response to an unconnected \"threat.\" Surely this is not what Congress meant when it clarified that IEEPA powers \"may not be exercised for any other purpose\" than to \"deal with\" a threat. The judges conceded that just because Trump lacks authority doesn't mean his attempt to use tariffs as leverage \"is unwise or ineffective.\" However, \"because of the Constitution’s express allocation of the tariff power to Congress, we do not read IEEPA to delegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President,\" the ruling said, concluding that \"any interpretation of IEEPA that delegates unlimited tariff authority is unconstitutional.\" Trump has immediately appealed the ruling and is expected to take the case to the Supreme Court. He's arguing that the court cannot define what constitutes a \"national emergency,\" which is a political question he believes only Congress can address. White House spokesperson Kush Desai has made it clear that Trump remains \"committed to using every lever of executive power to address\" the \"crisis\" of trade deficits, CNN reported, which he claimed have \"decimated American communities, left our workers behind, and weakened our defense industrial base.\" But the three-judge panel has already indicated that Trump may be focusing on the wrong question in seeking to further his case, noting that the \"question here is not whether something should be done; it is who has the authority to do it.\" According to the court, Trump does not. Ultimately, the judges agreed with US plaintiffs who alleged that tariffs risked vast harms to Americans, including spiking prices on their goods. Earlier this month, the Consumer Technology Association forecasted thatAmericans could pay more than $123 billion more annuallyfor just 10 common gadgets that would be hit with tariffs. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, among other state enforcers who are suing, issued astatementcriticizing Trump's previously \"unchecked authority\" that he said threatened to \"upend the economy\" and celebrating the win for \"working families, small businesses, and everyday Americans.\" \"President Trump’s sweeping tariffs were unlawful, reckless, and economically devastating,\" Rayfield said. \"They triggered retaliatory measures, inflated prices on essential goods, and placed an unfair burden on American families, small businesses and manufacturers.\" Problems with sourcing and pricing were decreasing orders even to American businesses, suing US firms said, and for many, the sudden spike in costs at the border caused \"a large, immediate, strain\" on cash flow. At least one plaintiff alleged they could go out of business and be unable to pay employees without an injunction soon. One cycling store feared tariffs might cost it about $250,000 by the end of 2025. Although Trump claimed there was no evidence that any of the businesses had paid tariffs, judges noted that firms were not required to demonstrate economic injury, and the government did not contest claims of downstream harms. Further, the Trump administration conceded that states that sued over tariffs are \"importers who have personally paid tariffs,\" the ruling said, and they requested the same injunctive relief as US businesses. Deciding to permanently block Trump's tariffs, the court wrote that \"if the challenged Tariff Orders are unlawful as to Plaintiffs, they are unlawful as to all.\" \"This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter and that trade decisions can’t be made on the president’s whim,\" Rayfield said. However, while markets perked up following the ruling, there is likely to be little long-term relief, as nobody expects Trump to back down from his tariff tactics. Trump allies \"inside and outside the White House\" told CNN that \"Trump will probably double down on his trade effort\" while saying that Trump has yet to back down from any court fight. White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett claimed that Trump is so confident that his appeal will be successful that he's not even looking into alternatives to impose similar tariffs, CNN reported. At the same time, Hassett noted that Trump is aware that \"there are three or four other ways\" the president could continue firing off tariff threats unilaterally. Those other tariff strategies, which CNN'sreportdiscussed at length, would take longer to implement and may not burden trade partners for as long as Trump may like but would essentially raise the same burdens without running afoul of courts, experts told CNN. For US businesses, Yale Budget Lab Director Ernie Tedeschi told CNN, the court block likely only provides temporary relief while supercharging the uncertainty that companies face. \"It’s the first hint of a possibility that… tariffs could be eliminated entirely,\" Tedeschi said. \"But even if they were, the administration could try to raise tariffs using other authorities. The potential outcomes just got much more uncertain in both directions—lower or higher tariffs.\" Banks and analysts echoed Tedeschi, forecasting the block would fuel even more uncertainty globally, NBC Newsreported. Investment bank UBS suggested that \"policy uncertainty remains,\" and even if blocked tariffs never come back, \"at least some of the economic impact has likely already begun to take effect.\" Perhaps more importantly for his administration's agenda, Trump is currently in the middle of negotiations with countries that will likely be less pressed to ink deals until the court battle fallout is clear. One former official told CNN that the court block \"blows a hole in their entire strategy at the absolute worst time.\" Delays are expected, while analysts with Citi suggest in a note that some talks may be entirely derailed. \"The administration is likely to either successfully appeal the ruling or to use other authority... to keep tariff rates high and revenue substantial. For now, the ruling will complicate and potentially delay trade negotiations,\" the note said. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Discord lures users to click on ads by offering them new Orbs currency",
    "article_text": "Discord moves further away from being ad-free. Discord is further distancing itself from its ad-free beginnings by offering users a new virtual currency for clicking on in-platform advertisements. Acoording to ablog postthis week by Peter Sellis, Discord’s SVP of product, a “small group” of Discord users around the globe can now earn \"Orbs\" throughPlay Quests, which Discord announced in March 2024 and let users earn in-game rewards by getting people to watch a stream of them playing a sponsored game. With enough Orbs, Discord users can purchase items in Discord's shop, including customization options for their profiles and credits for Nitro, a subscription add-on that offers features like 500MB uploads and HD resolution streaming. The goal is to fuel Discord’s advertising business by making clicking on ads more appealing. Advertisers also benefit by associating their ads with the ability to get desirable rewards. “This means that users will have the flexibility to use Orbs on many different rewards, making Quests even more relevant,” Sellis wrote. \"This is particularly great for users who want to try Nitro without a current subscription.\" Sellis said that Orbs will be available to “many more” Discord users “soon” but didn’t specify when. “We will continue to add new ways for users to claim rewards using Orbs in the future and for Nitro subscribers to continue to receive better rewards and deals across our ecosystem,” Sellis wrote. Sellis also announced that Discord is working with brand measurement firm Kantar to help advertisers track ad success. With Kantar technology, advertisers can measure things like “awareness, recall, and intent,” Sellis said. The partnership further underscores Discord's growing reliance on advertising revenue. “Our partnership with Discord is helping marketers better understand Discord as an advertising platform for new generations,” Nicole Jones, Kantar’s chief commercial lead, said on Discord’s blog. Discord also announced this week that it will soon sell Play Quests to more advertisers. The announcement follows the company's introduction ofvideo ads to the Discord mobile appin June. Video Quests, as they’re called, allow advertisers to show trailers, announcements, and other types of content. Overall, Discord’s new ad-friendly approach to business is very different than its previous strategy, which kept Discord ad-free from its 2015 launch until last year. Because the company is expected togo public soon, its leaders have determined that it’s no longer sufficient to rely completely on premium add-ons and subscriptions. Discord isn’t profitable, forcing the firm to reconsider its use of ads, which cofounder and CEO Jason Citron felt were too intrusive as recentlyas 2021. Currently, Discord’s ads are limited to clickable sidebars within the platform and offer direct benefits to users. Introducing ads can be a slippery slope, though, especially for social media companies that prioritize ad revenue to please investors. On the other hand, another social media company, Reddit, has seen success by boosting its ad business.Reddit went publicin March 2024 andbecame profitablein October 2024 after reporting a 60 percent year-over-year increase in ad revenue. Reddit hashinted at plans to introducenew and more types of ads, and we can expect Discord to consider the same after its IPO, which aMarch Bloomberg reportsuggested could happenas soon as this year. Advance Publications, which owns Ars Technica parent Condé Nast, is the largest shareholder in Reddit. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Elon Musk to exit government, upset that Trump bill undermines DOGE’s work",
    "article_text": "Musk says he's leaving Trump admin, citing 130-day limit on special employees. Elon Musk said he is leaving the Trump administration, attributing his departure not to any disagreement with Trump but rather to the legal limit on the number of days a special government employee may serve each year. \"As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\" Muskwrote on X. \"The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\" Musk's \"off-boarding will begin tonight,\" a White House officialtold Reuterson Wednesday. UnderUS law, special government employees in the executive branch arelimitedto serving 130 days in a 365-day period. They are subject to more lenient ethics rules than other federal employees and officials. Musk said a few days ago that he opposes theTrump-backed policy packagethat's been named \"One Big Beautiful Bill.\" \"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk said in aninterview with CBS. Senior White House officials such as Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller \"were particularly irked by those comments, and the White House was forced to call Republican senators to reiterate Trump's support for the package,\" according to Reuters. The news article said that \"Musk did not have a formal conversation with Trump before announcing his exit\" and quoted a source as saying that Musk's departure was decided \"at a senior staff level.\" Musk last month tried to appease nervous Tesla investors by saying he wouldspend more timeat the car company and less at the government. But even then, Musksaidhe would likely continue for \"the remainder of the president's term, just to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back\" and that \"I think I'll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it is useful.\" Last week, Muskpostedthat he was \"back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms.\" Musk and the Trump administration are facing numerous lawsuits over the authority wielded by DOGE and the large spending cuts imposed by the new government entity. In one case filed by 14 states against Musk, DOGE, and Trump, a federal judge dismissed President Trump from the lawsuit on Tuesday but said the lawsuit can proceed against Musk and DOGE. \"States allege that President Trump is the only individual in the Executive Branch who resolves matters of greater significance than Musk,\" US Judge Tanya Chutkan of the District of Columbiawrote. \"They claim that Musk decides the continued existence of federal agencies, the employment terms for millions of federal employees, and federal funds allocated by grants, contracts, and loans.\" The defendants \"unsuccessfully attempt to minimize Musk's role, framing him as a mere advisor without any formal authority,\" Chutkan wrote. She disputed the government's characterization of special government employees, saying that special employees may qualify as officers under US law. \"Defendants may not circumvent the Appointments Clause by designating individuals as special government employees,\" Chutkan wrote, concluding that \"defendants appear to sanction unlimited Executive power, free from checks and balances, but the Constitution prohibits unilateral control over 'official appointments' by 'dividing the power to appoint the principal federal offices... between the Executive and Legislative Branches.'\" It appears likely that DOGE will continue exercising its power in the Trump administration indefinitely, the judge's ruling said. \"States allege that Musk is DOGE's leader,\" Chutkan wrote. \"The court finds that States have sufficiently pleaded that this position qualifies as 'continuing and permanent, not occasional or temporary,' The subsidiary DOGE Service Temporary Organization has a termination date of July 4, 2026, but there is no termination date for the overarching DOGE entity or its leader, suggesting permanence.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "RFK Jr. yanks pandemic vaccine funding as Moderna reports positive results",
    "article_text": "HHS said it pulled funding for testing because the shots are \"under-tested.\" The Department of Health and Human Services—under the control of anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—has canceled millions of dollars in federal funding awarded to Moderna to produce an mRNA vaccine againstinfluenza viruses with pandemic potential, including the H5N1 bird flu currently sweeping US poultry and dairy cows. Last July, the Biden administration's HHS awarded Moderna$176 millionto \"accelerate the development of mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines.\" In the administration's final days in January, HHS awarded the vaccine maker an additional$590 millionto support \"late-stage development and licensure of pre-pandemic mRNA-based vaccines.\" The funding would also go to the development of five additional subtypes of pandemic influenza. On Wednesday, as news broke that the Trump administration was reneging on the contract,Moderna reported positiveresults from an early trial of a vaccine targeting H5 influenza viruses. In a preliminary trial of 300 healthy adults, the vaccine candidate appeared safe and boosted antibody levels against the virus by 44.5-fold. An HHS spokesperson said that the decision to cancel the funding—which would support thorough safety and efficacy testing of the vaccines—was because the vaccines needed more testing. \"This is not simply about efficacy—it’s about safety, integrity, and trust.\" HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixontold The Washington Post. \"The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested.\" Nixon went on to claim that the Trump administration wouldn't repeat the \"mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns.\" The accusation refers to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, which were developed and initially released under the first Trump administration. They have since been proven safe and effective against the deadly virus. Kennedy, a staunch anti-vaccine advocate, has unflaggingly made false claims about the safety and efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. In 2021, Kennedypetitioned the Food and Drug Administration to revoke authorization for COVID-19 vaccinesand refrain from issuing future approvals. In recent days, Kennedy has alsorestricted access to COVID-19 vaccinesand unilaterally revoked recommendations forhealthy children and pregnant peopleto get the vaccines. The federal funding for pandemic influenza vaccines was awarded as health officials around the country, including federal officials, were closely monitoring the swift and unprecedented spread of H5N1 bird flu through US dairy cows, which also spread to 70 people and killed one. Under the Trump administration, regular updates on the outbreak have ceased, andexperts fear that cases are going undocumented. In a statement Wednesday, Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel struck an optimistic note, saying the company would pursue other funding sources to continue moving forward. \"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine, and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program,\" he said. \"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Report: Apple will jump straight to “iOS 26” in shift to year-based version numbers",
    "article_text": "Instead of iOS 19, macOS 16, and watchOS 12, we'll get \"iOS/macOS/watchOS 26.\" There may never be an iOS 19 or a macOS 16, according toreportingfrom Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. At its Worldwide Developers Conference next month, Apple reportedly plans to shift toward version numbers based on years rather than the current numbering system. This is intended to unify the company's current maze of version numbers; instead of iOS 19, iPadOS 19, macOS 16, tvOS 19, watchOS 11, and visionOS 3, we'll get iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS 26. The last time Apple changed its version numbering convention for any of its operating systems was back in 2020, when it shifted from \"macOS X\" tomacOS 11. Note that the numbering will be based not on the year of the software's release but on the yearafter; this makes a certain amount of sense since iOS 26 would be Apple's most-current version of iOS for roughly nine months of 2026 and just three months of 2025. The update to the version numbering system will be accompanied by what Gurman describes as \"fresh user interfaces across the operating systems,\" a visual overhaul that will bring Apple's iPhone, Mac, watch, and TV software more in line with some of the design conventions introduced in Apple's visionOS software in 2024. Among the changes and additions will beanother crack at \"Mac-like\" multitasking for the iPad. Although major commercial operating systems have largely abandoned year-based branding since the days when Windows 98 and Windows 2000 were prevalent, many software products still use a year rather than a version number to make it easier to determine when they were released. Many Linux distributions use month and year-based version numbers, as do Microsoft's standalone Office releases. Windows Server shifted toward using years rather than version numbers 25 years ago and hasstuck with them since. Apple alsouses years rather than version numbersto identify most of its Macs. But these use the year of the hardware's actual release rather than the upcoming year, possibly because Apple doesn't update all of them at the same predictable annual cadence.

    "title": "Trump bans sales of chip design software to China",
    "article_text": "Move is another attempt to make it tougher for China to develop cutting-edge AI hardware. The Trump administration has told US companies that offer software used to design semiconductors to stop selling their services to Chinese groups, in the latest attempt to make it harder for China to develop advanced chips. Several people familiar with the move said the US Department of Commerce had told so-called electronic design automation groups—which include Cadence, Synopsys, and Siemens EDA—to stop supplying their technology to China. The Bureau of Industry and Security, the arm of the US commerce department that oversees export controls, issued the directive to the companies via letters, according to the people. It was unclear if every US EDA company had received a letter. The move marks a significant new effort by the administration to stymie China’s ability to develop leading-edge artificial intelligence chips, as it seeks a technological advantage over its geopolitical rival. In April, Washington restricted the export of Nvidia’s China-specific AI chips. On its second-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, Synopsys chief executive Sassine Ghazi said: “We are aware of the reporting and speculation, but Synopsys has not received a notice from BIS. So, our guidance that we are reiterating for the full year reflects our current understanding of BIS export restrictions, as well as our expectations for a year-over-year decline in China [revenue].” An official from the Commerce Department said it was “reviewing exports of strategic significance to China. In some cases, [the department] has suspended existing export licenses or imposed additional license requirements while the review is pending.” The directive comes at a delicate time as the US and China try to reach a trade deal after both sides recently agreed in Geneva to pause tit-for-tat tariffs for 90 days. The Financial Times reported last month that the Trump administration intended to put a number of Chinese chipmakers on a blacklist that would make it extremely difficult for US companies to provide them with American technology. But some officials pushed for a delay to avoid jeopardizing the two countries’ trade talks. Christopher Johnson, a former CIA China analyst, said the new export controls underscored the “innate fragility of the tariff truce reached in Geneva. With both sides wanting to retain and continue demonstrating the potency of their respective chokehold capabilities, the risk the ceasefire could unravel even within the 90-day pause is omnipresent.” Johnson, who heads China Strategies Group, a risk consultancy, said that China had successfully leveraged its stranglehold on rare earths to bring the US to the negotiating table in Geneva, which “left the Trump administration’s China hawks eager to demonstrate their export control weapons still have purchase.” While it accounts for a relatively small share of the overall semiconductor industry, EDA software allows chip designers and manufacturers to develop and test the next generation of chips, making it a critical part in the supply chain. Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems, and Siemens EDA—part of Siemens Digital Industries Software, a subsidiary of Germany’s Siemens AG—account for about 80 percent of China’s EDA market. Synopsys and Cadence did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In fiscal year 2024, Synopsys reported almost $1 billion in China sales, roughly 16 percent of its revenue. Cadence said China accounted for $550 million or 12 percent of its revenue. Synopsys shares fell 9.6 percent on Wednesday, while those of Cadence lost 10.7 percent. Siemens said in a statement the EDA industry had been informed last Friday about new export controls. It said it had supported customers in China “for more than 150 years” and would “continue to work with our customers globally to mitigate the impact of these new restrictions while operating in compliance with applicable national export control regimes.” In 2022, the Biden administration introduced restrictions on sales of the most sophisticated chip design software to China, but the companies continued to sell export control-compliant products to the country. In his first term as president, Donald Trump banned China’s Huawei from using American EDA tools. Huawei is seen as an emerging competitor to Nvidia with its “Ascend” AI chips. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang recently warned that successive attempts by American administrations to hamstring China’s AI ecosystem with export controls had failed. Last year Synopsys entered into an agreement to buy Ansys, a US simulation software company, for $35 billion. The deal still requires approval from Chinese regulators. Ansys shares fell 5.3 percent on Wednesday. On Wednesday the US Federal Trade Commission announced that both companies would need to divest certain software tools to receive its approval for the deal. The export restrictions have encouraged Chinese competitors, with three leading EDA companies—Empyrean Technology, Primarius, and Semitronix—significantly growing their market share in recent years. Shares of Empyrean, Primarius, and Semitronix rose more than 10 percent in early trading in China on Thursday. © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd.All rights reserved.

    "article_text": "The charm ofPop Mart’sLabubu, those toothy, big-eyed, ugly-cute creatures, has swept the world with cuteness aggression forthe must-have plush accessory. ArtistKasing Lungâsenchanting eleven furry fiends inspired by Nordic folklore have captured the hearts of many, including celebrity fans like Lisa, Rihanna, and most recently Madonna. However, things are taking a turn with the rising threat of resellers looking to take the fun out of the Labubu shopping experience. View this post on Instagram As with any coveted collectible, there’s always going to be a resell market. But recently, so many brawls have broken out at Pop Mart locations that the phenomenon has made international news. In the UK, the figures were temporarily pulled from shelves, a direct response to viral videos of fights between flippers and enthusiastic customers, not to mention employees just trying to doing their jobs. All 16 locations in the UK currently do not have the bag charms available as the company assesses how to navigate the situation, explaining to theBBCthe pause is intended to “prevent any potential safety issues.” Similarly in the U.S., the situation is also getting out of hand, and you don’t even have to leave your house to feel the frustration. It’s already been bad online with flippers setting their bots onto Pop Mart’s webpage and app. I can attest to the horrible digital experience; when I attempt to nab some online for my collection, I get crash notifications as well as getting my access limited due to button mashing too much to try to beat the bots while trying the Pop Now! gamified option to buy. Truly, I am over getting this notification when I am a real human person fighting for my life on these Labubu streets: But in-person shopping is also a huge pain in the U.S., and one that’s also getting dangerous as resellers prey on collection drop events, turning them into chaotic un-fun experiences. Tense encounters in line, with scuffles breaking out during the recent Big Into Energy release, made it clear that the hostile vibes radiating off the resellers were becoming a big issue. As one Pop Mart employee from the Century City location in Los Angeles told us, âPeople were getting into fights in line,â highlighting the safety concerns employees have experienced. They also shared that for the moment, their Labubu inventory would only be available for purchase online for pickup. They didn’t know when drops would become available in advance. We get it, but that approach still leaves customers to fight resellers in the digital realm. Pop Mart is currently working to make the shopping experience for collectors betterâand it has other concerns, too. The Labubu scarcity has not only have spawned a shifty flipper market, but also a huge fakes industry. “Lafufus” (faux Labubus) further confuse shoppers, sometimes tricking them into buying fakes for at least double the price of a real one. Pro-tip: if it has more or less than nine teeth, it’s a fake! But Lafufu makers are steadily getting better at fooling unsuspecting consumers. In other words, Pop Mart may be enjoying its success, but it’s also aware of the challenges that have accompanied the sudden fame of their products. Speaking to theBBC, the company explained that “Labubu will return to physical stores in June, and we are currently working on a new release mechanism that is better structured and more equitable for everyone involved.â I’m surely not the only one ready for the experience to improve. Getting into and participating in the new collector community Pop Mart has cultivated needs to get back to having a fun and delightful atmosphere. When I was talking to the employee at the location I visited, I had so much fun learning about the lore of not just Labubu but other characters too. Granted, I didn’t get to walk away with the Labubu plush I wanted ,as I was not one of the lucky ones to manage to be there during a random online dropâbut I did nab one of the acrylic figures from the flocked Lazy Yoga series. That Pop Mart line, as well as the mecha armor Kow Yokoyama Ma.k.series, are two that I’ve had more luck finding in store or at the Robo Mart locations. As collectors and fans of the Labubu fantasy lore, I’m excited to be able to better take part in a more positive and enjoyable experience when getting online to buy the latest figure. Like most fans, I still don’t have a Big Into Energy Labubu. I’ve tried all three ways available to try and get one: checking online inventory (always gone), Pop Now! unboxings (button-mash till you get kicked out, yet somehow resellers don’t), or waiting and missing location’s individual social media stories notifying fans they’re online for pick-up in store. A shopping experience separated from the angry frustration of battling it out with resellers is how it should be. Hopefully Labubu fansfans and employees can eventually get back to enjoying the community safelyâwithout the stress of competition or, you know, the risk of bodily harm. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "How ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Made Sure at Least One Character Got a Genuinely Happy Ending",
    "article_text": "In the first episode ofthe first seasonofThe Handmaid’s Tale, viewers met Janine, played by Madeline Brewer. Like June, the main character played by Elisabeth Moss, she’s been abducted by Gilead and is now in the Red Center, where new handmaids are forced to learn their horrifying new duties. When Janine talks back, she’s hauled off for a biblical punishment: the loss of her eye. That set the tone for Janine’s harrowing journey throughout the seriesâbut she never lost her spirit, andin the end, the show rewarded her with an ecstatically happy last moment. Her missing eyeâoften, but not always, concealed with her trademark patchâwas more or less the only constant for Janine over six seasons. After being the first handmaid in June’s group to give birth, she entertained fantasies of keeping her baby girl. Of course, that is not the way of Gilead, and Charlotte (Janine’s name for her daughter; her captors, Commander Putnam and his wife Naomi, called her Angela) was ripped from her arms, almost literally. After that, she held different roles with varying levels of freedomâat one point she ended up in exile, shoveling toxic waste in the dreaded Colonies; at another, she survived a bombing after briefly escaping Gilead for Chicago. In the last seasons ofThe Handmaid’s Tale, we saw her assisting Aunt Lydia in the Red Center, building on a complicated relationship rooted in power, guilt, shared trauma, and the occasional attempt at kindness. In season six, former handmaid Janine is forced into a different kind of sexual slavery, toiling at Jezebel’s, the brothel created for the pleasure of Gilead’s two-faced commanders. There, she encounters Angela’s new adoptive father: the grumpy but not-evil Commander Lawrence, who reluctantly married Naomi for reasons that are frankly too long to get into here. (It’sThe Handmaid’s Taleâexpect the worst!) He’s aware of Janine’s situation and brings one of the little girl’s drawings to her, an act of kindness that renews Janine’s hopes that one day she’ll get to see her again. That situation feels ever-bleaker when Jezebel’s is destroyed and Janine is snatched up by a commander who’s taken a cruel interest in her. Eventually, though, her prolonged suffering finally ends when June kills the guy (stabs him in the eye, in fact), and after another brief yet awful stint in captivity, she’s freed from Gilead forever. Best of all, though, as June and company are rushing to get her to safety, we see Aunt Lydia and Naomi appear. Incredibly, they’re bringing Angela/Charlotte to be with her mom, to live a life away from Gilead’s cruelty. ThoughThe Handmaid’s Taleseries finale ended with a lot of characters still at the mid-points on their journeys, that’s not the case for Janine. This is a real and true happy ending for her, at long last. Speaking tothe Hollywood Reporter, Brewer was understandably thrilled that her character finally got her greatest wish. “I thought it was so beautiful. Iâm so satisfied with the ending for Janine,” she said. “It could have gone a lot of different ways and itâs all sheâs ever wanted.” She continued. “I donât think I really, truly hoped for anything because I couldnât even imagine. Thatâs also not my job (laughs) [to write the show], but itâs the same reason why I never made too many decisions about Janineâs life before … So I didnât want to make too many decisions. I wanted it in ways to surprise me. And it did … Iâm just so proud of Janine for always being herself and not letting them take the fire away from her. And for being a good friend and a good mom and a good person.” The show was often very bleak, but praise beâat least Janine finally triumphed in the end. All seasons ofThe Handmaid’s Taleare now available on Hulu. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Cassian Andor’s Aliases, Ranked",
    "article_text": "Cassian Andorlived a lot of lives before he gave it all on the beaches of ScarifinÂRogue One. And part of living those lives, sometimes by choice, sometimes by necessity, was that Cassian Andor had to notbeCassian Andor. The man loved a secret identity, and with it a new name to inhabit, but some were clearly better than others. Not even a real name as it’s an Alliance codename, so by default it has to be last. Itisfun however, especially after his encounter with the Force healer inAndorseason two, to imagine Cassian inheriting this titlefrom Ahsoka Tano, an actual-honest-to-god-backflipping-and-lightsaber-wielding Jedi, and just having it completely break his mind. This is one of several operational aliases given to Cassian in theÂRogue One Ultimate Visual Guideâused on Darknell while masquerading as a Senatorial contactâso there’s something oddly charming about the idea that Cassian having a Rolodex of other names he’s had to come up with for missions has been there since the very beginning. Comeonthough, Cassian, this one just sounds like you stubbed your toe before you could use the name youÂactuallywanted to use, and rolled with it. Another from theÂVisual Guide, Willix was an identity Cassian used on Ord Mantell as a government agent. Points for sounding better than “Aach,” at least. The last of Cassian’sÂVisual Guidealiases, and he finally decided to give himself a full name! Aside from being a great name, Sward was an alias Cassian had while infiltrating the inner circle of an Imperial Admiral, Grendreefâa name that itself is actually a reference to the classic West EndStar Warsroleplaying game, a frequent source of Easter egg references inAndor. Again, nice to know that that that’s a connection that’s always been part of this character. Varian Skye, fashion designer, definitely looked the part on Ghorman with that gorgeous caped coat and his ginormous sci-fi shades, but really, the identity truly only comes together with that name. There’s an airiness, it justsoundslike a foppishly charming artiste who’s here to rub shoulders with fellow followers of fashion. The clothes may make the man, but the name makes the secret identity. Sure we previously knocked points off for Cassian only giving a first name to an alias, but you gain a massive amount of “d’awwwwwww” points when it’s the first mission we see him go on for the nascent rebellion and he picks his adoptive father’s name to go by. What a softie. An incredibleÂStar Warsname.ÂAndorgave us a few people with just Normal Real Names Spelled Slightly Differently (shout out to Timm, who sucked, but was also named Timm), but Keef being bothÂso closeandÂso farfrom Keith is perfect. Also just a real delight to hear Diego Luna say it and put a nice roll on that “r” in Girgo. Love a name with mouthfeel. Does Cassian’s birth name count as an alias? I mean, kinda, if you accept that eventually Cassian Andor the man becomes a very different identity than that of Kassa the young boy of Kenari, the latter of which remains compartmentalized in the former’s thoughts for the remainder of his life. What if taking on myriad identities came so natural to Cassian because he was used to giving them up from a young age? Sorry to get a bit deep in a shitpost list aboutStar Warsnames for a second. Again, only kind of sort of an alias as the true self, but you’re still rolling with me after the Kassa bit. But anyway it’s already a fantastic name, andÂAndor‘s revelation of Cassian’s life on Kenari then raises delicious worldbuilding and character questions about Clem and Maarva choosing to name him Cassian (did he tell them his name was Kassa, and they then anglicized it for Galactic Basic? Whatisthe term for anglicization in a galaxy where English doesn’t exist?). But adding the middle-name Jeron? Baby, that’sÂStar Wars. IÂloveRonni Googe. Even putting aside that he’s a journalistâthank you for the representationâeven putting aside theStar Wars-ification of an otherwise perfectly real-world name,evenputting aside that once again, this is a name with that wonderful mouthfeel element to it, Ronni Googe is abrilliantalias for a spy. You see, as Cassian tells multiple people when he adopts this persona in season two to extract Mon Mothma from the Imperial Senate building, “Googe” is pronouncedGoo-juh. That’s veryÂStar Wars, but also, again, it’s a genius alias. Ronni Googe has had to tell everyone “Actually, it’s RonniGoo-juh” all the time, it’s a name that stands out as aname, so you remember that and its pronunciation instead of what Ronni Googe actually looks like, and how uncanny a resemblance he bears to noted Imperial criminal and Rebel agent Cassian Andor. It’s a conversation starter, a way to appear polite and charming and put someone on the backfoot when you have to tell them this is how you actually say it, and it’s easy to remember and appear naturalistic for a spy with a zillion other things running around in their headâbecause, again, Ronni Googe, Senate journalist for the Mid-Rim network, has had to tell people on and off the record every day of his damn life that it’sGoo-juh. Two words, and a whole life for that identity is built. It’s a fantastic alias, it’s a fantasticÂStar Warsname, it’s the total package. An alias worthy of the mission it was deployed on.

    "title": "This Wireless CarPlay Adapter Is Practically a Giveaway on Amazon, Over 50% Off With Limited Stock",
    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Name your favorite part about driving. We’re going to go out on a limb and assume trying to figure out where all your cords and chargers need to go while you’ve got your pedal to the metal. And between running errands, heading to work, or starting a road trip, plugging and unplugging your phone every time you get in the car gets old fast. Thatâs especially true if youâre already using Apple CarPlay and wish it would just connect automatically. You really don’t have to deal with that anymore, though. Not with this excellent discount. Right now,the HaMeby Wireless CarPlay Adapter for iPhone is just $48, down from its usual price of $100, discount of 53%. See at Amazon You might not think it at first, but this is one of those small, affordable upgrades that makes a surprisingly big difference. Instead of plugging your phone in every time you want to use CarPlay, this device makes it an instant connection. Itâs plug-and-play, so all you have to do is connect it to your carâs USB port where youâd normally plug in for CarPlay, and after that, your iPhone connects via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi every time. Then you can do it with all the other devices you or your family have too. And you don’t have to worry about it not being able to keep up, even though it’s a smaller device. You wonât deal with lag when youâre switching songs, answering calls, or following directions on Maps. Everything syncs just like it would over a wired connection. It’s also pretty zippy all its own since it supports Bluetooth 5.3 and 5.8GHz Wi-Fi for low-latency performance, and itâs compatible with iPhones running iOS 10 or later. As long as your car has factory-installed wired CarPlay, this adapter should work. That’s small comfort in a world where things working isn’t as common as it should be, but it’s something. Thereâs also the peace of mind built in with a 2-year warranty and regular firmware updates to keep everything running smoothly. This adapter is over 50% off, and it’ll pay for itself in a short amount of time. The first time you don’t have to worry about finding your way is going to be when you realize how absolutely amazing having this convenience is. And then you’ll want to go back and buy more for everyone you know. It’s that useful. See at Amazon Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Cop on NYC Mayor’s Security Detail Reportedly Linked to Crypto Torture Case",
    "article_text": "The story of the Italian tourist allegedly kidnapped by crypto businessmen keeps taking wild turnsâthe latest potentially implicating New York law enforcement in the ordeal. According to areport from local NBC affiliate station News 4 New York,two NYPD officers, including one who was serving as security detail for Mayor Eric Adams, have been linked to two of the people charged for their involvement in the kidnapping case. According to the report, a detective tasked with protecting Mayor Adams was working a private security gig on the side. As a part of that job, the detective worked security at the Prince Street townhouse in the Nolita neighborhood of New York Cityâthe same place where an Italian tourist was allegedly held captive and beaten for over two weeks. He is also believed to have picked up an Italian tourist from the airport earlier this month, and there is currently an Internal Affairs Bureau investigation into whether the detective transported the tourist who was kidnapped to the townhouse. Thereportdid not clarify the other officer’s alleged involvement, but two officers have reportedly been placed on modified duty following the details of their potential links to the case surfacing. At issue isn’t the fact that the officers worked an off-duty jobâthat’s apparently pretty standard, per News 4, though it’s not clear whether the NYPD approved this particular side gig. What is of particular interest is just how much these cops knew about what they were potentially involved in. What happened, either under the officers’ noses or not, was that an Italian tourist was allegedly lured to the townhouse on May 6 by two cryptocurrency businessmen, whoallegedlytortured the man for 17 days to get him to give up the password to his stash of Bitcoin. During the time that he was held captive, he wasallegedlyshocked with electrical wires, hit with a gun, forced to smoke from a crack pipe, dangled over a railing five stories high, sawed on his leg, and urinated on. The tourist managed to escape when his attackers went to retrieve his computer and steal his Bitcoin, at which point he flagged down a police officer on the street. (Luckily, he didn’t run into one of the cops who may have been involved.) When police entered the townhouse, they reportedly found a slew of evidence including cocaine, a saw, chicken wire, body armor, and night-vision goggles. They also found Polaroid photos of the victim with a gun pointed at his head, which was probably seen as strong evidence corroborating his story. Two men have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the kidnapping:John Woeltz, a 37-year-old man who has been identified as the “crypto king of Kentucky,” andWilliam Duplessie, a 33-year-old Florida man and crypto investor who turned himself into police.

    "title": "Paraglider Defies Death After Freak Updraft Sucks Him 28,000 Feet Into Sky",
    "article_text": "A Chinese paraglider survived being sucked in by a cloud and flung 28,208 feet (8,598 meters) into the skyâeven though he was just testing his new equipment and wasn’t intending to take off. On May 24, Peng Yujian, a 55-year-old paraglider, was already roughly 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) above sea level, testing the fit of his new paragliding equipment. About 20 minutes in, a powerful updraft known as a “cloud suck” shot him about 18,000 feet (5,500 meters) higher. Peng caughtthe wild eventon a camera mounted on his glider, which naturally went viral after being posted on Douyin, Chinaâs version of TikTok. The video shows Peng coated in ice and holding on for dear life to the gliderâs controls. He says he may have lost consciousness during his unexpected ascent. âI felt the lack of oxygen. My hands were frozen outside. I kept trying to talk on the radio,â Peng said in the Douyin video after landing safely 20 miles (33 kilometers) from his launch point, according toSixth Tone. Peng was in the air for more than an hour, during which he was exposed to temperatures nearing minus 40 degrees Celsius (which equals â40 degrees Fahrenheit). âEverything ahead [was] a vast expanse of whiteness,â he toldChinese broadcaster CCTV News. Cloud suck is ameteorological phenomenonthat can be deadly for paragliders. It refers to a strong upward air movement caused by powerful thermalsâcolumns of rising warm air created when the ground heats unevenly from the sunâfeeding into a cumulus cloud. As the updraft gets stronger, it creates a low pressure region at the cloud base, drawing in even more hot air from below. This results in a positive feedback loop that can cause wind speeds of over 1,000 feet (300 meters) per minute. Ewa WiÅnierska, a paraglider from Germany, still holds the dubious record of the highest altitude reached after being pulled by a cloud suck,accordingto The Sydney Morning Herald. An updraft flung her roughly 33,000 feet (10,000 m) into the sky in 2007. The summit of Mount Everest, the highest point above sea level on earth, is 29,029 feet (8,848 m) above sea level. The Chinese government grounded Peng after his âunsanctionedâ flight for six months, citing safety regulations, according toa reportfrom the Aero Sports Association of Gansu Province obtained byThe Guardian. Itâs unclear whether that remains in effect, but something tells me he might not want to go paragliding again anytime soon. flightSportswild weather Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "RFK Jr.’s ‘Make America Healthy Again’ Report Cites Fake Studies",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump held an event at the White Houselast weekto announce the release of something called the MAHA Report, a product of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s new commission that’s supposed to “Make America Healthy Again.” But if you weren’t already skeptical of the report’s findings, an article from the nonprofit news outletNOTUSshould give you pause. Several of the studies cited in the report don’t even exist. NOTUS reporters spent five days combing through the522 citationsin the report. They found dozens of broken links and studies with missing or incorrect authors. There were also issues with citations having the wrong issue numbers for the journals they appeared in, according to NOTUS. But the most damning instances were at least seven studies that simply didn’t exist. For instance, the MAHA Report claims that drug advertising has led to a rise in ADHD and depression prescriptions being written for children. But try to find the study that’s cited in the report for that claim: Findling, R. L., et al. (2009). Direct-to-consumer advertising of psychotropic medications for youth: A growing concern.Journal of Child and Adolescent Pyschopharmacology, 19(5), 487-492. You can’t find that study because it doesn’t exist. Not in theJournal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, or anywhere else. The supposed author of that report,Robert L. Findling, is a real person and currently teaches at the Virginia Commonwealth University. But a spokesperson for that school told NOTUS he didn’t author any such study. The MAHA Report also tries to claim that 25% to 40% of mild cases of asthma are overprescribed, citing a 2017 paper titled, “Overprescribing of Corticosteroids for Children with Asthma.” Again, the paper doesn’t exist. NOTUS has other examples of fake studies it found, but even the real studies cited have issues. The report references a paper published in the journalPediatricsthat referred to how screen time impacted sleep in children. The paper was realm but it wasn’t inPediatricsand it didn’t actually study childrenâit looked at adults. The report appears to be littered with errors like that. The White House responded to questions about the fake studies when asked about what NOTUS had found during a regularpress briefingThursday. In typically evasive fashion, press secretary Karoline Leavitt referred to any errors as “formatting issues” and said those were being addressed and the report would be “updated.” “I understand there were some formatting issues with the MAHA report that are being addressed in the report will be updated, but it does not negate the substance of the report, which as you know is one of the most transformative health reports that has ever been released by the federal government, and is backed on good science that has never been recognized by the federal government,” Leavitt said. Leavitt was asked whether reports like this are created using artificial intelligence tools, and the press secretary told the journalist she “can’t speak to that” and would “defer [sic] you to the Department of Health and Human Services.” And while it’s unclear whether the MAHA Report really was created with the help of AI, it wouldn’t be surprising. The White House has been a big booster of AI, touting investments in data centers by companies like OpenAI and Oracle. But generative AI is known to frequently just make things up, including entire books or studies when asked for a list. A freelance writer for the Chicago Sun-Times recently used AI to create a list of new books everyone should be excited for this summer. Ten of the15 bookson the list simply don’t exist, though many of the authors named were real. The problem, of course, is that anyone using AI to create lists or citations needs to actually check to see if those things are real. And when you have to do that kind of research to fact-check your robotic tool, it can start to become more work than just doing the research yourself using existing tools like Google Scholar. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a dangerously fringe antivax figure who suggested in a 2021 book that he doesn’t even believe ingerm theory. But this is the guy who’s overseeing a complete overhaul of the U.S. public health system, and it seems like nothingânot even a scandal showing his first hallmark report to be fraudulentâwill unseat him from his position of power over our lives.

    "title": "Kevin Feige Sets Even Higher Expectations for ‘The Fantastic Four: First Steps’",
    "article_text": "Even beforeThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsbecame the finalfull Marvel Studios movie until December 2026, it was already an incredibly big deal. These are some ofMarvel’s most popular and recognizablecharacters. A team that Hollywoodhas been toying with in various waysfor two decades and had been untouchable to Marvel for much of thatâuntil now. In a new interview, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige set the bar even higher by comparing this film to previous, less-than-successful iterations. “I think that there are no four characters that are more important for the history of Marvel,âFeige said to Empire. âWhen Disney bought Fox, it was really an unexpected dream come true. It came at the perfect time to help us launch into a new era. They are Marvelâs First Family, and I really wanted to do them justice.â Which, of course, implies the previous filmsdidn’tdo the characters justice. Feige actually produced two of those films, 2005’sFantastic Fourand 2007’sFantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, and offered a hint as to what those films didn’t do and what this new one does. âThere was still a bit of fear of being silly,â Feige said. But now, after decades of superhero movies,First Stepscan finally go to places those movies never dared. âIn another time, some might consider the notion of somebody with a big, angular helmet walking through a city goofy,â he continued, speaking of the film’s villain, Galactus. âI consider it awesome.â As do we. But the Fantastic Four kind of have to be more than awesome. It’s a property that’s on another level. A group on the top tier of Marvel. Bringing them into the MCU is on par with Spider-Man finally being introduced inCaptain America: Civil Waror Deadpool and Wolverine joining forces last year inDeadpool & Wolverine. Will this film be as popular and impactful as those? The team’s teaseat the end ofThunderboltshas already hinted it may. And, thankfully, we won’t have to wait much longer to find out.

    "article_text": "Today Hasbro revealed a boatload of Marvel Legends figures, and they were united beyond the mere fact that they were action figuresmade by Hasbro, and werefrom Marvel properties. No, there was a standout theme among today’s reveals:Âbendiness. It would be otherwise difficult to marry the two halves of Hasbro’s reveals todayâour first official look at action figures fromThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsalongside a series of gaming-themed celebrations of Capcom’sclassic Marvel fighting gamesâbut somehow the toymaker did it with a little help from Mr. Fantastic and… Shuma-Gorath. Sorry,ÂGargantos. The legally distinct Shuma-Gorath, who looks a lot like Shuma-Gorath, and instead currently borrows its name from an incredibly obscure Namor the Sub-Mariner villainous octopus to avoid potential copyright issues. Either way, they’ve both got big long bendy limbs! Thankfully, Reed also comes with a pair of normal arms that you can swap out if you don’t want his wired, bendable stretchy limbs going all the time. But Gigantos is all bend, all the time, with multiple points of articulation across his six tendrils that make what is otherwise a giant green one-eyed tentacled eldritch abomination surprisingly expressive. Of course though, non-bendy action figures were also on display. Rounding out the rest of theÂFirst Stepswave are, of course, the rest of the Fantastic Four, based on their MCU appearances: Sue, Johnny, and Ben all get figures, as does a fully flamed-on Human Torch. While there’s nomovie Galactus figurefor them to battle against yet, the line is rounded out by his herald in the form of Shalla Bal, the Silver Surfer, who comes with not only her cosmic surfboard but a nifty little energy blast stand you can pose her surfing on. The Gamerverse fighting game figures, beyond Gargantos, are all inspired by the early stages of Marvel’s historic gaming collaboration with Capcom across a series of arcade fighting games, most notablyMarvel Super Heroes,Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, and the originalMarvel vs. Capcom. Gargantos and a deluxe-sized Juggernaut, however, are the only standalone figures: the rest are available across a series of two packs, some of which will be exclusive in the U.S. to retailers like Walmart, Target. Here’s the breakdown of who’s facing off against who: Hasbro’sÂFantastic Four: First Stepsfigures will hit Hasbro Pulse for pre-order tomorrow, May 30, ahead of a release this summer.

    "title": "Google’s Veo 3 Has People Crashing Out Over AI Slop",
    "article_text": "Depending on who you ask, generative AI is either a thrilling tech revolution or an existential threat, and there’s little in-between. It’s hard to blame anyone for an extreme reaction, too, given themagnitude of capital investment,hyperbolic marketing, andrapid progress of generative AIin such a short amount of time. But it’s not just the economics and technical feats of AI that have people losing their minds; there’s also something more philosophical percolating, and it’s driving some people “to the brink.” People are literally having a mental breakdown over Veo-3pic.twitter.com/ym5oZDYZGr — Chubbyâ¨ï¸ (@kimmonismus)May 27, 2025 The latest AI advancement to send people down an existential rabbit hole comes courtesy of Google, which just announced its latest video generation model called Veo 3. As I’ve reported a few times now, Veo 3 is already getting into some wild stuffâturning up the dial on AI slop,deepfaking smooth-brained YouTube content, and potentiallyupending game development, to name a few things. As it turns out, people are taking note of all of those feats, and some of them are not exactly happy about what they see. As evidenced by a thread from thesubreddit r/artificialintelligenceposted this week titled “VEO3 is kind of bringing me to a mental brink. What are we even doing anymore?” Google’s Veo 3 and the implications therein have some people spiraling. “Iâm just kind of speechless. The concept of existential crisis has taken a whole new form. I was unhappy with my life just now but thought I can turn it around, but if I turn it around, what is left of our world in 2 decades?” the post’s author writes. “Actors as a concept are gone? Manually creating music? Wallpapers? Game assets? Believing comments on the internet are from real people? AI edited photos are just as real as the original samples? Voicenotes can be perfectly faked?… Literally what value is being left for us?” Reactions to the thread are mixed, with suggestions that the author should go “touch grass” or maybe “go to therapy,” but there’s also a chorus in agreement. The consensus from the latter group?AI slop is coming to ruin your art, and there’s not much we can do about it. I, for what it’s worth, fall unhelpfully in between the two camps. I think there is a deluge of AI slop incoming, and, if we’re being honest, we’re already up to our ankles. Between Veo andOpenAI’s Soraand the clear interest in automating human creativity, I think we can reasonably buckle in and expect the world of movies, music, and entertainment writ large to get a little choppy. Whether any of those efforts to automate entertainment will stick is less obvious. The thing about art is that the kind that people tend to like is the kind that has something substantial to say. Right now, for all of its mimicry, generative AI doesn’t actually haveanythingto say,because technically all it can do is remix and repeat. I did more tests with Google's#Veo3. Imagine if AI characters became aware they were living in a simulation!pic.twitter.com/nhbrNQMtqv — Hashem Al-Ghaili (@HashemGhaili)May 21, 2025 Call me an optimist, but most people can likely sniff out the difference between slop and art, and as much as studios would love to wave a magic wand and rid themselves of human creatives and the cost of their labor, deep down they know that they’d have to Ctrl+Z that move just as fast. That’s not to say there won’t be casualties in the AI ageâif there’s one lesson we can learn from mass waves of automation in years past, it’s that labor forces are usually the most affected. But when it comes to art, things aren’t so simple. Art, at least the good kind, is about human connection, and until AI can think and feel like we do, there’s nothing that can replace that. So, before you crash out over AI slop, just remember: AI still thinks puttingglue on your pizza is a good idea, so we may have a few more good years left in the tank. generative aiGoogle Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "The Strange Secret Behind Venus’ Pancake Volcanoes",
    "article_text": "Venus is home to some of theweirdest volcanoesin the solar systemâmassive, flattened domes that look like planetary pancakes left to cool on the world’s blistering surface. Scientists have long suspected these âpancake domesâ formed from thick, slow-moving lava. But a new study suggests that Venusâ bendy crust may be crucial to the formation of the circular mounts. The research,publishedearlier this month in Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, focused on one particularly enormous dome, Narina Tholus, which stretches nearly 90 miles (145 kilometers) across. Using old radar data from NASAâs 1990s Magellan mission, researchers built a virtual model of the dome and tested what kind of lavaâand what kind of crustâcould produce such a geological flapjack. Turns out, lava alone doesnât explain the domesâ strange shape. “Our models show that flexure influences dome shape,” the researchers wrote, “in the presence of more flexure, dome tops become flatter and sides steeper.” Just like the skin of more fleshy things, Venusâ crust can dimple and deform when saddled with thick lava. When researchers simulated lava flowing over a bendy lithosphere, the molten rock stopped spreading and piled up, forming flat tops with steep sidesâjust like Venusâ pancake domes. Crucially, this model also reproduced the crustal bulges spotted around some domes in previous studies. Still, not just any lava would do. Only ultra-dense lavaâmore than twice the density of water and over a trillion times as viscous as ketchup, as reported byLive Science, matched both the dome shape and the surrounding deformation. The researchers think such lava could take “up to hundreds of thousands of Earth-years” to fully settle into these colossal structures. The teamâs model is based on just one dome, so itâs not conclusive. But upcoming missions like NASAâsVERITASorDAVINCIwill provide better topographic data to test their theory across more of Venusâ thousands of volcanic features. Better understanding these features could yield more insights into the formation of thehellish planet, sometimes referred to as Earth’s evil twin for the way its planetary evolution split off from the timeline that made our world wet, verdant, and rife with life.

This Cold War outpost concealed more than submarinesâit hosted a devastating eruption that cooled the planet nearly 200 years ago. Dangerous rocks may co-orbit with Venus, but new research suggests only a space-based mission can prove it. Traces of ruthenium in volcanic rock point to a hidden geological highway. Carbon dioxide emissions from rising magma is one of the earliest signs that a volcano is waking up, but measuring it directly is notoriously difficult.

    "title": "Karate Kids, Ranked",
    "article_text": "No one could have guessed that when a scrawny kid from New Jersey moved to California with his mom,we’d still be talking about it four decades later. But that’s exactly what happened withThe Karate Kid,the hit 1984 movie starring Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita.The inspirational sports tale spawned two sequelsover the next five years and a third one five years after that. Things then went cold at the dojo for almost 15 years until Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith revived the franchise for their son Jaden with Jackie Chan in the mentor role. That 2010 remake was the biggest hit of the bunch, by a significant amount, but nothing immediately came of it. Instead, fans had to waitalmost another decade for the showCobra Kai,which continued the story from the original films in a whole new format. That show became a mega hit on Netflix, and finally, in 2022,Sony Pictures announcedÂ it was bringingThe Karate Kidback to the big screen, not just with Jackie Chan, but Ralph Macchio too. Karate Kid: Legendsis in theaters this weekend, and it’s a film that promises to bring together everything fans love about all iterations ofThe Karate Kid,all in one package. But does it? And how does it compare to the other films in the franchise? Here’s our ranking so you can find out which one is the best around. No matter how bad you think or rememberThe Next Karate Kidto be, trust us. It’s worse. Eventual Oscar winner Hilary Swank stars as an awkward high school student who Mr. Miyagi attempts to teach karate to. Only, the dynamic of older man and younger woman is constantly awkward, the villains are evil without any discernible reason, and you never buy into any of it. It’s a pox onThe Karate Kidfranchise as a whole and should be erased from the Earth. What a letdown. There are many, many things wrong withKarate Kid: Legendsandyou can read about them all in my review here. But for the purposes of this article, the biggest thing is that it doesn’t understand what makesThe Karate Kidgreat. It’s a franchise about underdogs. About friendship. About hard work and mentorship.Legendsthinks it’s a franchise about cool fights with all the other stuff taking a back seat. There are good moments and good intentions throughout, but mostly it’s a swing and a miss. Part IIIis a movie only for the trueKarate Kidfans. Which is to say, as a general movie, it’s not very good. But if you love the characters and the franchise, it’s super fun. It’s set only one year after the events of the first film, but five in real time which makes things a little wonky. Disgraced sensei John Kreese (Martin Kove) gets his super rich best friend Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith) to get revenge on Mr. Miyagi and Daniel for humiliating him and Cobra Kai at the previous tournament. Only, it’s clear they deserved it since no one else returns in a meaningful way and they have to hire “Karate’s bad boy,” Mike Barnes (Sean Kanan), to fight for them. It’s silly, it doesn’t make much sense, but it’s unabashedlyThe Karate Kid, so we love it. When I first saw the 2010 remake ofThe Karate Kid, I didn’t much care for it. I remember that because I hadn’t revisited it again until this week. But, once I did, I changed my tune slightly. It’s a very, very faithful remake of the original film, down to almost every single story beat. Things happen a little differently only because the son and mother here (Jaden Smith and Taraji P. Henson) move to Japan, not California, and Jaden’s character Tre is several years younger than Daniel was in the first movie. But, beyond that, it’s a film that flies by because it’s based on something that at its core, works incredibly well. The main fault ofThe Karate Kid Part IIis that it’s not the first one. That’s pretty much it. Beyond that, it does everything you could want from a sequel. In the film, Mr. Miyagi and Daniel go to Miyagi’s home in Okinawa, Japan, and are sucked into a long-standing local grudge. So, it changes the setting in a logical but interesting way. Introduces bigger stakes for the characters. Loosely borrows the structure of the original film but evolves it ever so slightly. It is filled with excellent new characters, both good and bad. It even has a banger of a theme song in “The Glory of Love” by Peter Cetera. Was there any doubt I was going to put the original in the top spot here? Of course not. The originalKarate Kidis not only funny, emotional, and exciting, it’s way more epic than you probably remember. Daniel LaRusso truly goes on a big, formative journey throughout the movie, helped not just by the Oscar-nominated performance of Morita as Miyagi, but a stellar cast of supporting characters played by the likes of William Zabka as the villainous Johnny, Martin Kove as his evil sensai Kreese, and Elisabeth Shue as the love interest, Ali. It’s simply one of the most enjoyable (not to mention quotable) films of the entire decade. I can’t do aKarate Kidranking without at least giving some props toCobra Kai. Of course, a six-season TV show is going to have an edge over any two-hour movie, so putting them against each other isn’t fair. I’ve also written at lengthabout the wonder that isCobra Kai, a 65-episode sequel to a beloved, nostalgic franchise. So yes, it’s better than all of these movies combined, because it should be. It has more time. It understandsThe Karate Kidin ways that even some of the other movies don’t. It makes every single one of those movies, even the new one, better. But it’s not a movie, so it doesn’t count here. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Leprosy’s Origins Are Even Weirder Than We Thought",
    "article_text": "One of the world’s oldest diseases has an even more complex history than expected. Research out today reveals that a form of leprosy was stalking people in the Americas long before Europeans arrived. A large international team of scientists conducted the study,publishedThursday in Science. The researchers found DNA evidence ofMycobacterium lepromatosisâa recently discovered species of leprosy-causing bacteriaâinfecting people in North and South America over 1,000 years ago, predating European colonization. The findings upturn the prevailing belief that Europeans were responsible for leprosy’s introduction to the New World. Leprosy’sreputation for human destruction is so notorious that it’s repeatedly referenced in the Bible (some of these references might have been aboutother conditions, though). These bacteria can cause a chronic infection of our skin and nerve cells, though it may take years for symptoms like lesions and sores to appear. If not treated with antibiotics, the infection can progressively and permanently damage these cells, leading to lifelong disabilities and other serious complications. So, What’s Going On With Leprosy in Florida? Leprosy, also called Hansen’s disease, is primarily caused byMycobacterium lepraebacteria. But in 2008, scientistsdiscoveredthat a similar species,ÂM. lepromatosis, can cause it, too. Leprosy fromM. lepromatosisappears to be rarer than the former, with cases predominantly found in North and South America. And we know very little about it, partly because both species aren’t easy to culture in the lab (much like viruses, leprosy-causing bacteria can only replicate by hijacking our cells from the inside). Study author Nicolas Rascovan, who specializes in the evolution of human diseases, and his team decided to take a closer look at the bacteria after making a discovery of their own. “Our interest began when we unexpectedly detectedM. lepromatosisDNA in the remains of an ancient individual in North America,” Rascovan, a researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France, told Gizmodo. “That prompted us to ask how long this pathogen had been circulating in the continent, how much spread there was before European contact, and what diversity it might still hold today.” The team analyzed hundreds of samples collected from modern-day people (mostly recent leprosy patients), as well as ancient DNA samples recovered from people in the Americas before European contact. Three of these ancient samples tested positive for the bacteria, the researchers found, from people living in what’s now Canada and Argentina. “Leprosy has long been considered a disease brought to the Americas by Europeans, which is true for the case ofM. leprae. But our study shows that at least one of the two species that causes itâM. lepromatosisâwas already here centuries earlier, and probably evolved locally for thousands of years,” Rascovan explained. “This essentially changes how we understand the diseaseâs history in the Americas.” Thanks to antibiotics and improved sanitation, leprosy is rare in much of the world (only about 200 cases aredocumentedin the U.S. every year). But it remains a public health issue in some countries, with more than 200,000 casesreportedannually globally. And the researchers’ findings may complicate both the past and future of leprosy. While most modern cases ofM. lepromatosiswere linked to one specific lineage, or clade, of the bacteria that has recently expanded, the team also identified older clades that have likely been evolving independently in the Americas for over 9,000 years. That suggests these bacteria have been hiding out in still mysterious animal hosts (in the U.S. the classic form of leprosy hassometimes been linked to armadillo exposure). And thoughM.lepraeÂstill causes the majority of leprosy cases worldwide, its less famous cousin certainly has the potential to become a bigger threat. “Given its diversity and spread,ÂM. lepromatosisÂ could be an emerging pathogen with dynamics different fromÂM. leprae,” Rascovan said. Leprosy in Medieval England Probably Came From Red Squirrels As is often the case in science, the team’s work has raised even more questions for them to answer. They’re hoping to unearth the animal reservoirs where the bacteria have potentially been circulating all this time, for instance, and to trace its journey from the Americas to other parts of the world. They now believe that a strain ofM. lepromatosiswas brought over to the British Isles sometime in the 19th century, where it still infects red squirrels today. But we’re still in the dark about how it reached Asia, where cases have been documented. “All of this suggests that this is not just a neglected disease, but a neglected pathogenâone whose history and spread are only now beginning to be understood,” Rascovan said.

Something terribly wrong!” Could it be that whatever’s happening on the fourth floor involves organ theft or maybe even some kind of supernatural appropriation of youth?

    "title": "Elon Musk Isn’t Really ‘Leaving’ the Government, but He Is on Everyone’s Shit List",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk wrote a tweet Wednesday night explaining that his “scheduled time” as a Special Government Employee was coming to an end, leading many news outlets to conclude he was done with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). And while it seems clear Musk has worn out his welcome with President Donald Trump, it’s naive to portray the billionaire oligarch’s announcement as a sign he’s truly “leaving” the U.S. government. “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @RealDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,” Muskwroteon his social media platform X. That tweet was followed up by reporting in the Associated Press, New York Times, and Washington Post that indicated Musk was actually departing and would have no more influence over the Trump White House. But Musk’s extensive ties to the government, which existed long before DOGE came into existence, were treated as an afterthought. TheWashington Postarticle took 17 paragraphs before it acknowledged that “Musk has numerous business ties to the federal government, including major contracts for Starlink and SpaceX.” The New York Times piece on thepalace intriguedidn’t include any mention that Musk is a government contractor who receives billions of dollars through SpaceX. Those articles also failed to note what’s perhaps the most critical fact: Musk has installed his henchmen in virtually every federal agency and has gained access to untold amounts of private and proprietary data that business rivals would kill for. Take Edward Coristine, the 19-year-old member of DOGE who goes by the nameBig Balls. Coristine has been listed as an “expert” at the Office of Personnel Management, according toWired, and there are no public reports that indicate he’s leaving the government along with Musk. Musk has sat down for several Fox News interviews with other DOGE members at his side, none of whom seem to be “leaving” government either. Luke Farritor, the 20-something DOGE bro who would reportedly “veto”paymentsfor HIV/AIDS programs over the objections of top officials at USAID? No signs he’s left. Marko Elez, the 25-year-old who was pushed out after being linked to extremelyracist tweets, only to be quickly rehired? That guy is still on thegovernment payroll, as far as we can tell. The list goes on. And who do you think these young men swear their allegiance to? The U.S. Constitution, or their hero Elon Musk? Is there any universe in which we believe that all of these DOGE plants throughout the federal government are just earnestly working on rooting out “waste, fraud, and abuse” rather than providing Musk with everything he could ask for at the drop of a hat? The only person who seems to have “left” the government to work on Musk’s other projects was Katie Miller, the supposed spokesperson of DOGE and wife of White House advisor Stephen Miller. There’s no doubt that the internal gossip about conflict between Musk and other people in the Trump regime is interesting to read. The speculation onBlueskyWednesday night was that Musk was in a throuple with Stephen Miller and his wife Katie Miller. That stemmed from a Wired article where a longtime Republican operative said he didn’t want to know anything about their social life, suggesting itwas weird. The fact that rumors about an unholy throuple are dominating the conversation tells you where our interests often lie as human beings. There are only so many news stories you can read about DOGE gutting vital scientific and public health programs or firing hundreds of thousands of workers before it feels like old news. We want to hear about the sex and the shouting matches, like when Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent repeatedly yelled “fuck you” at Musk in a hallway of the West Wing, according to theAtlantic. Musk and DOGE have facedseveral lawsuitsover their brazen and almost certainly illegal actions. Fourteen states sued back in February in a case that’s still making its waythrough the courts. But those lawsuits aren’t nearly as salacious as the in-fighting. There’s something much more compelling to a story about two grown-ass men screaming at each other like children, for obvious reasons. Where does that leave Musk, even assuming he really is stepping back from the White House? The billionaire has suggested repeatedly that he doesn’t want to spend money on politics anymore. But it’s important to remember that Musk frequently lies. Musk spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help get Trump and other Republicans elected in 2024. This was after Musk insisted a Wall Street Journal report that he planned to spend big for Trump wasn’t true. Lately, the billionaire has spent an inordinate amount of timewhining. Practically every interview he does these days includes a story about how he’s the most put-upon man in the universe. People don’t like him and are protesting his Tesla dealerships, with some people even committing vandalism and arson. Musk doesn’t like to acknowledge that there’s a good reason that some people might not like him. This is the guy who started Trump’s second term by giving two Nazi-style salutes and waited a long damn time before even denying that’s what he was doing. We don’t have a crystal ball that can tell us what level of involvement Musk will have with the Trump regime in the coming days, weeks, and months. But take everything you read with a big grain of salt. There are still plenty of folks who can look at companies like Tesla and SpaceX and The Boring Company and insist Musk’s renewed focus on their operations means that he’s leaving politics. If Musk’s tenure with DOGE has shown anything, it’s that literally every company Musk runs is political. How can something like The Boring Companyâthe Musk venture that digs tunnels in the groundâbe political?

    "article_text": "From the creators of Crawl. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Point 'n' click adventurers eat well in 2025: every week there's at least a couple of interesting ones released on Steam, like last week's Kathy Rain 2, or the week before that, Neon Hearts City. Despite my wishlist bulging with these things, I'm especially excited about The Drifter. Developed by Powerhoof, the studio responsible for Crawl and Peridium, The Drifter is a gritty, seedy take on the works of \"King, Crichton and Carpenter\", leavened with the ocker ruthlessness of Ozploitation cinema (don't know what that is?Start here). The protagonist suffers severe bad luck: he's a directionness itinerant who happens to witness a grizzly murder. Being the sole witness, he's naturally hunted down and killed by the \"hi-tech\" executioners. Pretty bad, yes, but at least he's dead and his suffering is over. Alas! He is then brought back to life and framed for the original murder. The pixel art perfectly captures the miserable world of the protagonist. It's murky, chunky, depressive, and as fascinated with urban blight as Escape From New York orBad Boy Bubby. And what would a narrative adventure inspired by '70s and '80s pulp be if it didn't swerve awkwardly into conspiratorial paranoia? \"Follow Mick as he's sucked headfirst into a lunatic web of shadowy corporations, murder, and the thousand-year obsession of a madman,\" reads the Steam description. The Drifter promises to be \"quick and lean\". Powerhoof insists that \"you'll never be wandering around lost or confused\", which is a sacred point 'n' click experience that, understandably, newer players don't love so much. It also has two controller schemes: one is a fairly conventional point-at-this, click-on-it scenario, but there's also a twin-stick approach that makes a lot of sense if you try it out. Which you can: there'sa demo on Steamright now, ahead of The Drifter's full release on July 18. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Dune: Awakening's player guilds will be able to pass some pretty OP server-wide laws—including one that means you'll lose everything when defeated in deep desert PvP",
    "article_text": "Get ready for players to make big changes to the world of Dune: Awakening. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. With survival MMODune: Awakeningon the brink of release, Funcom has detailed one of the central features of the endgame: the Landsraad. In Dune's fiction, the Landsraad is a council made up of the heads of the Great Houses: most notably House Atreides and House Harkonnen. In a new video you can see below, Funcom explains how the Landsraad's political system has been adapted for the game. In Dune: Awakening there are 25 lesser Houses (think of them as mission-giving entities), and each week those houses will choose to support either House Atreides or House Harkonnen, the two bigshots vying for control of the desert. The winner of the majority of those 25 House votes takes control of the world—and all the servers that make up that world—for the following week. Player guilds can spend the week completing missions and objectives for those 25 lesser houses to sway their votes to support either Atredies or Harkonnen. At the end of the week, either Atreides or Harkonnen will have a majority of the 25 Landsraad votes, and the leaders of the player guilds that contributed to the winning faction will then get to vote on a decree—a new law that will be enacted for one week. Got all that? As for those laws players can vote for, wow… they are pretty darn OP. According to a beta player on the Dune: Awakening Discord, for instance, one decree will reduce repair costs and refining times by 75% for the entire week for guilds supporting the winning faction. A 75% reduction in refining times? That's ahugebuff if you're involved in large-scale production. Another decree lowers crafting costs by 25% for the week, another way to get your guild way ahead in production. There are also decrees that will give one faction exclusive tools, weapons, or armor via a vendor only accessible by that faction. More decrees increase ranged and melee weapon damage by 33%. Another buffs XP gain by 50%. Only one decree can be enacted at a time, but most of these laws feel majorly OP, giving the winning faction a massive advantage for an entire week. Do you want to engage in PvP with someone who is by default doing an extra 33% damage, or has access to faction-exclusive armor or weapons? How will your faction's production lines keep up when the other side is refining materials 75% faster than you? Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Joel Bylos, Dune: Awakening's creative director, says there are \"pretty good systems in place\" to provide a balance between the factions so one isn't constantly dominating a server week after week, and there are also plans for a third major faction (the Fremen, I imagine) which \"will also have a role in that balance.\" There's one more decree that is incredibly chilling, called The Right of Salvage. If it's enacted, dying to PvP in the deep desert means instead of just losing some collected resources, all of your gear can be looted. I imagine if that decree is enacted, PvP in the deep desert is going to be incredibly tense that week. As for how you win votes for your faction, there are different ways to convince the majority of the great houses to swing your way. The main method looks to be claiming and holding control points in areas of the deep desert, battling against other players in PvP. Win the territory, win the vote. If you're not into PvP, you can still help your guild, and thus your faction, to secure votes. You can take on jobs to invade NPC bases and kill their inhabitants, such as a mission shown in the video where House Torvold requests you wipe out a certain amount of an NPC group called \"sandflies.\" Another House requests a supply of groundcars, so you can win them over by gathering resources, putting together a production line, crafting enough vehicles to fill the order, then delivering them. You can check out the Landsraad explainer video below. Dune: Awakening launches June 10, with head start of June 5 for those who preorder the Deluxe or Ultimate edition.

    "article_text": "It's somehow sad and cool at the same time. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A seemingly unique piece ofConcordmemorabilia is being auctioned off atShopGoodwill.com, an online auction site operated by the Goodwill non-profit organization, and with five days remaining the bidding has now surpassed an astronomical $3,000. No, that is not a typo. That is, as of 5:30 pm ET on May 29,three thousand crisp American greenbacks. Just look at it. So, what's going on here? Concord, you'll recall, was an infamous flop: After millions of dollars spent, a price that includedSony's acquisition of developer Firewalk Studiosin 2023, the game faceplanted hard and wastaken offline just two weeks later. Sony initially implied that it was a temporary situation butput it down for goodjust a couple months later, and closed Firewalk outright. By any and all measures, it was a catastrophe. And how did this presumably commemorative plaque end up on the auction block at Goodwill? That is completely unclear. The plaque was seemingly awarded to Chelsea Grace—that's the name on it, anyway—who'screditedas the outsourcing and co-development lead on Concord, but the mystery is how it went from their hands to Goodwill. Did they donate it to raise funds for the orphanage (or, you know,whatever)? Did they chuck it in the garbage in an effort to forget the whole thing ever happened, and someone picked it out? Did they... well, that's all I've got, really. I tried reaching out to Grace to ask what's happening here, but unfortunately the seller is listed as \"Goodwill of the Olympics and Rainier Region,\" a fact I noticed after I clicked the \"send\" button and was told I'd successfully submitted a support ticket request. Goodwill replied to say the plaque had been donated (and full points to its ecommerce department for being so quick to respond) but beyond that, we're left to speculate. But the bidding the Concord plaque has attracted is notable all on its own. 41 bids have been submitted thus far, and the price now stands at $3001. That amount will likely go higher between now and the auction's close, and whether the final figure will actually be paid is an open question: Like most auction sites, Goodwill's terms of service require the winning bidder to honor their bid, but there's nothing preventing them from simply saying \"no\" and disappearing into the digital ether. Given the pre-existing negativity surrounding Concord, I will be genuinely surprised if the winner just ponies up and quietly makes off with their prize. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But notentirelysurprised. The plaque's provenance is unknown and that makes it a roll of the dice to a certain extent, but assuming all is on the up-and-up this is a unique piece of videogame history, and Concord's spectacular crash-and-burn makes it more interesting and collectible, not less. It's a bit like anInverted Jennyin that regard: Things did not go as planned, this is what came out of it, and a small but dedicated audience is willing to pay big bucks to claim a piece of what remains. The auction for the \"Chelsea Grace Founding Concord PS5 Freegunner Wall Hanging Plaque\" runs until June 3.

    "article_text": "Gather runes and level up before your Nightlord showdown. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Trying to establish a fast, cleanrune farm routeinElden Ring Nightreignis a troublesome affair. You've only got two days to get as strong as possible before you face off against the Nightlord, but you've also got to grab a decent weapon, potentially upgrade it, collect passive bonuses, and any consumables or talismans you want—it's a lot to get done in a matter of minutes. Unlike the originalElden Ringwhere all you had to do to farm runes was slaughter twenty dozing Albinaurics with a legendary sword skill over and over, in Nightreign you actually have to be tactical about the time you spend. Luckily for you I've spent far more time than I'd like farming runes and have a few handy tips for boosting rune acquisition. I've also put together the best route you can take to gather runes while still jumping through the other hoops you need to successfully defeat any given Nightlord. Unlike the original Elden Ring, rune farming is a little different in Nightreign. In that game, quickly filling your XP coffers relied on being able to rest at a site of grace to make enemies reappear so you could rinse and repeat, but nothing respawns in Nightreign. You have priorities to fulfill beyond merely levelling up as well, such as acquiring a decent weapon with an affinity the Nightlord is weak to and grabbing more gear with passive bonuses, as well as talismans and consumables. Before I lay out the recommended route, there are a few things you should do if you want maximise your rune gain: With those above tips in mind, and after a whole lot of trial runs, here's my recommended route for the best Nightreign rune farming while also grabbing what you need to defeat a Nightlord: Day one Day two While your path obviously depends on the arrangement of the map, just generally fighting bosses—fort, encampment, ruin, cathedral, evergaol on first day, roaming on second—will net you a lot of runes, especially if you use those fowl feet at the right time so you have the buff when each boss dies. It'll give you lots of potential passive buffs and weapons you can grab for additional bonuses. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "How to change outfit in Elden Ring Nightreign",
    "article_text": "Unlock new Nightfarer outfits for your plucky band of adventurers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Unlocking the ability tochange appearanceinElden Ring Nightreign, so you can try newNightfarer outfits,is actually quite challenging. In fact, it might be the hardest change appearance option to unlock that I've ever seen in a game, though this is primarily due to the fact that completing expeditions and defeating Nightlords is fairly tough at the best of times. If you're struggling with the first Tricephalos expedition, you might want some tips to defeat Gladius, Beast of Night—one of the prerequisites for accessing new outfits—or more generally just some Nightreign tips. Either way, here's exactly what you need to do to unlock the change appearance option and get new outfits for your Nightfarers. To change appearance inElden RingNightreign, you need tobeat two expeditionsand so defeat two Nightlords. Sadly, you can't defeat the same Nightlord twice, so you'll have to beat Gladius, Beast of Night in the Tricephalos expedition, and then one of the subsequent six expeditions that unlock afterwards—most likely Adel, Baron of Night in the Gaping Jaw expedition if you choose the next one along. After you complete two expeditions, the caretaker, Iron Menial, will tell you he's set up a mirror in the east wing of the Roundtable Hold; in the room where Gideon Ofnir hangs out in Elden Ring. If in doubt, open the map and cycle down to the \"Change garb\" option to see where that is. Once there, interact with the mirror and you can change your outfit. The bad news is that you need Murk to unlock new outfits, which you get by attempting and completing expeditions. Each of the Nightfarers has at least four alternate costume choices, though you'll only unlock Dawn and Darkness at first: Thankfully it doesn't take too long to earn what you need to buy the Dawn one, though the Darkness outfit will take a lot of grinding out. There are also theDark Souls outfitsthat were shown off in trailers, two per character, but they're a whole different thing to unlock, so see the guide above if you're interested. You can also earn an outfit for some characters, like Wylder, by completing their Remembrances fully. Above you'll find a gallery of all the outfits you can buy once you access the mirror. I haven't included the Dark Souls outfits since unlocking those requires significantly more effort, though if you're interested, take a look at our relevant guide. You can get quite a bit of Murk simply bycompleting or failing expeditions—it's essentially a currency awarded for your persistence. One good way to get a bit of extra Murk, though, is byselling spare or useless Relics. Head to the Relic Table and cycle all the way along to the \"Sell\" option on the right. You'll want to be very careful you don't sell anything good or useful, but otherwise, this will give you a way to accumulate some extra Murk when working towards an outfit purchase.

    "title": "Elden Ring Nightreign Duchess build, tips, and best weapons guide",
    "article_text": "From poison daggers to glintstone-slinging staves, Duchess is one of Nightreign's deadliest characters with the right builds. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Duchess wields the smallest blade of all ofElden Ring Nightreign's champions, but don't underestimate her and her dagger: she has some of the highest damage potential in the entire game. That's thanks to her Restage ability, which repeats the damage that you and your co-op companions have dealt in the last few seconds, making every big hit that much bigger. And even when you're not Restaging an ultimate art, backstab, or critical hit Duchess's high dexterity and intelligence scaling make her mighty deadly with blades, bows and sorcery. Assuming you can stay alive, that is. Duchess is incredibly fast but also squishy, making her a glass cannon at the start of every run. With thebest Duchess build, however, you can take advantage of her proficiency with quick weapon strikes to build her into a surprisingly tanky spellsword. She's never going to be quite as beefy asNightreign's Raider, but the best relics and weapons for Duchess will let her hang in the fight or dodge nearly every attack that's thrown her way. Because Duchess is particularly squishy in the early game and great weapon drops are hardly guaranteed in this highly random roguelike, you'll want to make sure to memorize some of thebest Nightreign rune farming routebefore you start focusing on your gear. You'll also need tounlock Duchess in Nightreignbefore you can use her, but luckily you won't have to progress far before she'll join the squad. Duchess can be powerful from the jump in Nightreign, assuming you luck into some good early drops and dance around enemy attacks with your tiny level 1-3 health bar. While Duchess specializes in sorceries, it can be helpful to grab a sacred seal from a Great Church early in a run for additional healing. But what you're really looking out for arepowerful staves for spellcasting and weapons that deal status effectslike poison, bleed, etc. which are particularly effective when dual wielding. Every build in Nightreign revolves around relics, weapons (and their passive effects), talismans, and the buffs you score by defeating bosses.Talismans can influence what direction you want to take your Duchess build: These trinkets can up your sorcery damage and spellcasting speed while reducing FP usage, for example, and if you find a couple of those, you'll definitely want to grab a staff and start casting glintstones. There are also talismans that increase damage with successive hits and amplify the final hit in a combo chain, which pair ideally with a dex-focused, fast-hitting Duchess. For either of those playstyles to shine, though, you're gonna need to start with the right relics. Nightreign Executor build guideNightreign Guardian build guideNightreign Ironeye build guideNightreign Revenant build guideNightreign Recluse build guideNightreign Raider build guideNightreign Wylder build guide As with other Nightreign characters, the best Duchess build won't be available to you when you first start the game. That's because thebest relics, which you earn by completing runs and defeating Nightlords, can make a significant difference in what weapons and playstyle you should focus on.Some relics will include unique affixes for Duchessthat amplify her Restage ability or the benefits of dual-wielding, for example. Here are some of the best relic buffs to pair with Duchess: Duchess's preferred weapons,daggers, excel at afflicting statuses. Using Restage can then re-apply the damage for even greater build-up. Some weapons in Nightreign will even have two status ailments on them, allowing you to match a boss's weakness while also inflicting bonus damage. To take advantage of Duchess's fast attacks when using two weapons,be on the lookout for weapons with the passive \"Successive attacks negate damage\" skill.It can massively reduce incoming damage and let you tank boss hits that would normally flatten you like a pancake. Look out for rare (purple) tier daggers like the Crystal Knife, Scorpion's Stinger (scarlet rot), Reduvia (bleed), and Glintstone Kris (scales on both dex and int). Another great drop is theWakizashi, a dagger that powerstances with katanas, which all rock. Purple tier katanas Moonveil (bleed), Rivers of Blood (super bleed) and Meteoric Ore Blade (bleed and int scaling) are especially good for Duchess. It's never a bad idea to grab a bow—they scale with dexterity so Duchess makes for a competent Ironeye stand-in, and ranged damage (that doesn't drain FP) is extremely valuable against most bosses. TheHorned Bowis an ideal pick as it scales with intelligence, too. As mentioned, staves are very powerful for Duchess, also letting you dish out damage outside of melee range. This is a different playstyle but just as effective thanks to her A intelligence scaling. The legendary (gold) Carian Regal Scepter will dish out the most sorcery damage, though to get it you'll likely need to learn how toupgrade weapons in Nightreignto legendary using theShifting Earth: The Craterevent. The purple Lusast's Glintstone Staff, Prince of Death Staff, and Azur's Glintstone Staff all have unique magical attacks and deal fantastic damage. Here are the best weapon passives for Duchess: As I mentioned earlier, a lucky talisman find could push you towards a magic-focused or melee-focused build with Duchess on a given run. Anytime you hear the twinkly sound that indicates a scarab is nearby, follow it until it gets louder and kill the little creature. You can also seek out a Fort and enter the tower near the boss up on the ramparts; the map inside will reveal the locations of nearby talisman scarabs. The best talismans for Duchess in order are: The essence of Duchess is that of any fleet-footed character: You need to time your dodges well, go for backstabs against foes you can backstab, and focus on quick attacks to build up status ailments. If you're focused on magic, keep your distance, but don't stay so far back that you can't use Restage to amplify damage. That's going to be your biggest contribution to almost every battle. Duchess's most important role is as a Restage machine: you want to be repeating every bit of damage you can, since her character skill applies to attacks from both your allies. If you're playing with friends, have them call out their ultimate arts before using them (Ironeyes and Wylders especially). If you're not voice chatting with your teammates, pay extra attention to a boss's health bar and trigger Restage when you see a big chunk break off. Duchess's ultimate ability turns you and nearby allies invisible and drops aggro, though as soon as you attack an enemy they'll know where you are. It comes in clutch in boss fights when one or two of your allies need to be revived, granting you a few seconds of safety as long as you haven't used it too early. Ideally you're focusing your Duchess build on whatever elemental or status ailment weakness a Nightlord is susceptible to, but sometimes the random drops aren't kind. Bleed and frostbite are almost always reliable fallbacks, dealing extra damage to nearly every major and minor enemy. You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you just might find you kill what you bleed. Duchess's dagger is a good starting weapon, with S dexterity scaling, though you'll want to find a second dagger ASAP to pair with it. It's easy to forget you could be doing extra damage from the second you touch down in Limveld. Use the dagger's weapon art to coat the blade with additional magic damage for a minute or so. It'll really help you carve through fodder enemies in a hurry. Sorceries are great fun and make use of Duchess's very best stat scaling, but it's very easy to run out of FP. Bows, on the other hand, never run out of arrows, so you can deal constant damage at decent range. Dash in, get some status ailment procs with your daggers, and then retreat to a safe distance and use a bow for some more hits. My natural instinct is to kill off groups of enemies one at a time, but with Duchess you can actually be more efficient by hitting multiple enemies a couple of times, then triggering Restage. That way you'll repeat the damage to all of them. Look for the consumable item drops around churches and enemy camps and see if merchants have any Starlight Shards in their inventories. You'll chew through your FP in boss fights when casting magic, and you'll need these items to keep the spells flowing.

    "title": "12 Elden Ring Nightreign tips to get a head start hunting Nightlords",
    "article_text": "Here's how to face Limveld's nastiest and come out on top. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You've probably noticed if you're here, butElden Ring Nightreignis hard. Like,reallyhard—hard enough that ourNightreign reviewcalls it \"a merciless bully.\" (We mean that lovingly, of course.) Beating the Nightlord at the end of your run means juggling level progression, weapon upgrades, and elemental weaknesses, all while being chased by a flaming wall of death. No pressure. TheseElden RingNightreign tips aim to make all those mechanics and systems a bit more sensible and equip you with some reliable strategies for success during your next expedition. I'll start off with some suggestions for what to prioritize during day one and two, and then offer some general tips to keep in mind as you chase down your next Nightlord. For more help perfecting your runs, check out our guide onfarming runes in Nightreign. If you're more concerned with fashion, we've got details onhow to unlock Nightreign's Dark Souls outfits. And if you want a rundown on all the Nightlords you'll face, make sure to read ourNightreign boss guide. Unless you're one of the handful of demigods capable of no-hit Soulslike runs, you're probably going to take some damage while playing Nightreign. In fact, considering how hard Limveld's bosses hit, you're probably going to take alot,which means your health-restoring sacred flask is going to get a workout. Thankfully, you can increase your maximum number of flask charges by visiting Churches of Marika, which will be colored gold on the map if you haven't visited them. A safe way to start a Nightreign run is to check your map for the closest church while flying in. Land, kill the nearby cluster of enemies that you're usually dropped next to for an initial level-up and some loot, and then beeline to your first flask charge increase. We've found that getting two additional flask charges by the end of day one provides a comfortable health reserve. After touching down and picking up extra flasks, prioritize Forts and Great Churches, both of which have easy bosses that can be killed early in a run for low-risk upgrades and drops. Most Forts will have a room with three chests on their lower level, and a knight boss upstairs on the ramparts. Another chest on the rampart will almost always contain a Stonesword Key, which lets your team open an Evergaol and fight the boss inside. Great Churches will either have a boss fight on the ground floor, or a hole in the ground leading to a basement level with a boss fight and an altar guaranteed to drop incantation seals. Like Forts, they have a high chance to drop Stonesword keys from altar chests, and there are more chests hidden in the rafters. Nightreign tier list- The best nightfarersBest Nightreign rune farm route- Level up fastBest Nightreign team comps- Squad goalsNightreign best relics- The rite stuffNightreign bosses list- Every Nightlord Once you've got your sturdy foundation of flask charges and initial weapons in day one, you've got one goal for day two: Killing bosses for more runes, loot, and passive perks. If your squad doesn't have weapons with affinities that match the boss's weakness, prioritize any enemy regions on the map showing that same affinity. You'll have a higher chance of finding weapons with that damage type when you kill that area's boss. Afterwards, your goal should be killing as many bosses as you can before day two ends. When you're steamrolling Camps and Ruins without issue, move up to Evergaols with any Stonesword Keys you have. The difficulty of Evergaol bosses can vary, but unless a Death Rite Bird comes out, you'll probably be fine. Day two will also mark Great Enemy bosses on the map. They hit hard and have a lot of health, but they offer some of the best gear for battling Nightlords on day three. Aim to be at least level 8 before you take them on (10 will probably feel a lot safer). One of Nightreign's two unlockable characters, The Duchess is an all-star. She makes great use of dexterity-based weapons, but the real draw is her Restage ability, which repeats a percentage of all damage dealt to enemies in the last few seconds. It's on an extremely low cooldown, meaning a Duchess on your team can repeatedly churn out free damage. Better still, Restage maintains the elemental damage and status buildup of duplicated attacks, so your squad can hammer bosses incredibly hard with your most-effective damage types. You canunlock Duchessvery early in the game by killing the first expedition boss, so you don't have to wait too long to add Restage to your repertoire. Nightreign bosses are rowdy. Nightlords have a habit of leaping and dashing across their arenas, making it a headache for melee characters to get close. And even when you can, their attacks can be so relentless that it's hard to find openings for landing your own hits. Thankfully there's nothing stopping you and your friends from jumping into an expedition with three Ironeyes to unload on bosses that might be difficult for melee-focused fighters to face toe-to-toe. But don't let that convince you that only Ironeye should be picking up ranged weapons. His ability to dish out consistent ranged damage puts him at the top of ourNightfarer tier list, but every Nightreign character has unlimited ammunition for any ranged weapon they pick up. If you've got a bow on hand and you're struggling to get close, it can be worth shooting off some arrows even if you're one of the more melee-focused heroes. Different zone types in Nightreign are more likely to provide an associated type of armament. Great Churches have guaranteed incantation seals; Camps tend to have bow racks full of ranged weapons; Arcane Towers have staffs for sorceries. Keeping all those associations straight in your head, however, can be difficult. Luckily, you don't have to. On an Xbox controller, press Y while looking at the map to show additional details like the armament types associated with different areas. You'll probably internalize where to find bows and seals before long, but it can save time when you're deciding where to sprint next as the night circle closes in. If you and your team have found some respectable blue-rarity weapons but weren't lucky enough to find any promising purple drops, it's a good idea to start day two by heading to a Mining Tunnel for smithing stones. There are Mining Tunnels all over the map, so you'll likely be near one when the second day starts. Inside there'll be either a troll, knight, or pumpkin head boss that's guaranteed to offer a Smithing Stone (2), which can be used to upgrade a blue-tier weapon to a purple at anvils near merchants, increasing its stats. It's a great way to ensure that you've got a strong weapon with an affinity that matches a boss's weakness—or just an upgraded weapon that you really like using. While Nightreign might change up a lot of Elden Ring's gameplay, it's still very much a FromSoft game—and unfortunately, that means the exact functionality for a lot of mechanics remains pretty opaque. That includes character abilities, many of which are easy to use for hours without realizing they can be evenmoreeffective if you hold their button down. Guardian's whirlwind, Wylder's pile bunker ultimate, Raider's headbutt—all of them get a bit of extra juice if you charge up the ability as you're firing it. Before your next expedition, try spending a couple minutes in the Roundtable Hold's sparring ground to make sure you're getting the full mileage out of your Nightfarer's kit. Speaking of abilities: Guardian isn't the only Nightfarer whose ultimate is great for reviving teammates. As the tutorial explains, you can revive your teammates by dealing damage to them—but that doesn'tjustinclude weapon attacks. If you're playing a character whose ultimate deals damage, you can use it in a pinch to revive a teammate in a dangerous spot. Because you're invulnerable while using your Nightfarer's ultimate art, it's even possible to revive a teammate while a boss is doing its best to knock your skull in. Yes, it means giving up on your lovely ult damage, but you can't doanydamage if your team wipes. Wylder in particular is great for a clutch ultimate revive: His grappling hook lets you zip directly to a teammate so you can explode them back to life. Teamwork! Relics are Nightreign's form of long-term progression, letting you give your characters extra stats and expedition modifiers by equipping colored gems into their grail slots. Unfortunately, the modifiers on relics that you earn at the end of expeditions are entirely random, which can make it frustratingly slow to get a good set of relics for your character of choice. Thankfully the Small Jar Bazaar in Roundtable Hold means you don't have to rely entirely on end-of-expedition RNG. At the merchant, you can buy a set of predetermined relics with the murk currency you earn from expeditions, but you can also gamble on additional randomized relics. The odds aren't any better than expedition rewards, but the extra rolls don't hurt if you're looking to make your runs easier, and it takes only seconds instead of 45 minutes. Of course, spending all your murk on relics means you won't have any left over forunlocking Nightreign outfitsthat make you look cool. Buyer beware. There's a lot of info to take in when you start playing Nightreign, so you might have missedexactlyhow weapon bonuses work. Whenever a weapon drops in an expedition, it has a randomized bonus effect like \"increased ranged weapon attack\" or \"damage reduction at full health.\" What's easy to overlook is that you'll get almost all of the bonuses fromNightreign weapon passives, even if you're not actively wielding them. That's how you're cobbling together a build throughout a Nightreign expedition; you're not just looking for a higher attack stat and a good damage element. You're comparing the bonus effects on weapon drops to optimize your playstyle. A Raider who's dual-wielding greatclubs will hit a lot harder if their inventory's full of weapons that increase damage dealt while wielding two armaments. There are exceptions, however. Some weapons will have a small hand icon next to their bonus effect. If you see that icon, it means you'll only benefit from that effect while you're wielding that weapon in one of your hands. During an expedition, you might notice areas on the map that are covered with a blue/green circle. These are Cataclysms, and they do two things: First, they buff the health and damage of all enemies inside of them. Second, when you enter them, you'll be invaded by hostile phantom Nightfarer doppelgangers. The result is a difficult, frantic battle against a pile of buffed enemies while a player character's ghost does its best to murder you. If you want to tackle one, make sure you've got your whole team with you and that you've all got a good amount of levels built up, because things in a Cataclysm can go sideways real fast. The rewards, unfortunately, are hit or miss: slain Nightfarer phantoms will offer an upgraded version of that hero's default weapon, but there's no guarantee it'll be something your target Nightlord is weak to or something useful for your build.

    "title": "Elden Ring Nightreign tier list: Who's the best character to pick?",
    "article_text": "Choose which Nightfarer to take into the perilous land of Limveld. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Putting together anElden Ring Nightreigntier listmight seem a little redundant—you're supposed to be able to pick who you want to bring to Limveld based on preferred playstyle. While that's still 100% true, I was quite surprised to see how unbalanced the roster of Nightfarer's feels. I figured they would all be pretty good, but there are actually some frontrunners, and there's even an easily identifiablebest characterbecause of his kit of abilities, ease of playstyle, and the massive advantage he has against the game's hardest Nightlord bosses. Obviously, meta means jack all in Nightreign, and it's still important to pick who you want to play as versus choosing them based on any metric of \"being the best\". Still, you might find it interesting to know who's strong and who's a lot less strong when heading into Limveld for the first time. Below I've laid out the best character as well as a tier list for all other characters, so you can see what we think of each Nightfarer after having played them extensively. The best character inElden RingNightreign is Ironeye. In a game where the most challenging bosses—the Nightlords—are endlessly mobile and even fly out of arm's reach a lot of the time, melee has a huge disadvantage. Archers, on the other hand, can deal consistent damage in a boss fight, and there's no better archer than Ironeye. He also has an extremely versatile suite of abilities; his Marking dash lets him tag enemies for extra damage from the team, but you can also utilise it to dodge even the most annoying attacks. Add to this, his Single Shot ability staggers and damages bosses, while usually killing all smaller enemies in an AoE. There's definitely a case to be made for another character as the best for running solo, but if you're playing Nightreign as intended in a group, Ironeye is without a doubt the best. Tier Characters S Ironeye, Duchess A Raider, Wylder, Executor B Revenant, Recluse C Guardian Hit your mark with ourbest Ironeye build, weapons picks, and tips. As mentioned above, archery is very strong in Nightreign, and so the best archer is pretty strong, too. Ironeye's versatile Marking ability supports the rest of the team with extra damage, but he can also use it to dash out of the way of attacks, as with Bloodhound's Step in the original Elden Ring. Single Shot is also a great ability for stagger and damage, especially if you have Duchess to repeat it. Stab from the shadows with ourbest Duchess build,weapons picks, and tips.The ultimate support character who can also get stuck in with deadly dex-weapons—there are few parties that won't benefit from Duchess' presence. Her strength is primarily down to her Restage skill, which allows her to repeat instances of damage and stagger to bosses. If you're coordinating with teammates, you can repeat the damage dealt by ultimate art skills, or even critical strikes—the skill has a fast cooldown, too. Making up for her low health, Duchess has an enhanced dodge, and her Finale ultimate art, turning everyone nearby invisible, is the perfect way to get a clutch revive and save an expedition from failure. Do note that you'll need tounlock Duchessbefore you can play her. Elden Ring Nightreign tips- Start your run rightBest Nightreign rune farm route- Level up fastBest Nightreign team comps- Squad goalsNightreign best relics- The rite stuffNightreign bosses list- Every Nightlord Enjoy a rock in this trying time with ourbest Raider build, weapons picks, and tips. My personal favorite character, Raider, loves to headbutt enemies with his Retaliate skill and summon a big rock of questionable effectiveness. Genuinely, his Totem Stella may grant increased poise and strength to nearby characters—and does damage when it appears—but it's a bit janky to say the least. Raider more than makes up for this, however, as an S-tier strength main, wielding big weapons and stance-breaking bosses for critical hits. If you take enough damage during the initial stage of his tanky Retaliate skill, it changes into an uppercut that does massive stagger, even if it is a little hard to land it sometimes. Due to his stance-breaking and high damage, Raider is also one of the best Nightfarers if you're running solo. Grapple monsters with ourbest Wylder build, weapons picks, and tips.Wylder is the quintessential all-rounder. He's got high strength with enough dexterity to dabble with a katana or two if you get a particularly attractive drop, he's got enough health to avoid all but the worst one-shot kills, and—I mean—look at him. That's a Dark Souls guy. If you're putting a character on the box art, you're probably going to equip him for success. Ability-wise, Wylder's grappling hook smooths out combat by helping you close distance with Nightreign's leapfrog bosses, and you can upgrade it with remembrance relics that add potent follow-up attacks. Wylder's ultimate art, meanwhile, deals a hefty chunk of stagger damage, reliably opening up bosses for critical hits. And because you're invulnerable while using it, you can even use it as a last-ditch revival option if you don't think you can survive thwacking a teammate back to life. Pretend you're playing Sekiro with ourbest Executor build, weapons picks, and tips.The Executor, on paper,shouldeasily be among the strongest in the cast, an S-tier candidate through and through. His character skill, Cursed Sword, allows him to no-sell most attacks, and has a far more forgiving parry window than theFromSoftwaregame it's lifted from, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Meanwhile, his Ultimate Art, Aspects of the Crucible: Beast, is incredible for clearing out enemies, and can keep many mid-weight bosses stun-locked. The status build-up from his high arcane stat is excellent, too, and bleed damage is as strong as it's been in every other FromSoftware game. The problem, really, is that he's a Nightreign character. Nightreign is inherently chaotic, and his ability to go toe-to-toe with any single enemy becomes seriously less effective when he's swarmed. What's more, without aggro-boosting passives, his Cursed Sword's slow movement speed and piddly reach will see him left in the dust. This is especially noticeable if you're playing with an Ironeye, since his ranged attacks are a hate magnet. Get ready for a lot of awkward stance-shifting and chasing enemies to keep up. High dex and arcane scaling means he'll still be useful in these scenarios—but it won't be because of his kit, it'll be because you've got your hands on a good weapon. And anybody can do that. Raise an army of skeletons with ourbest Revenant build, weapons picks, and tips.This doll-like necromancer can summon a member of her \"Family\" to tank boss attacks and draw aggro, especially effective if you summon Sebastian, the big skeleton. These allies will even revive teammates, provided they don't get distracted by nearby bosses or enemies. Her Immortal March ultimate art is also pretty clutch, reviving allies and making them temporarily immortal—though do note you can still take damage, just not die. The main problem with Revenant is that to perform well, she needs to get killing blows on enemies, since she has a chance to summon them as temporary minions, and that means getting stuck into combat—not ideal when she has next to no health. Similarly, in Nightlord boss fights, she may be able to draw aggro temporarily, but there are no enemies for her to turn into minions, meaning a whole section of her kit goes unused and she has to risk combat to deal damage. After you unlock Duchess, you can alsounlock Revenant. Fancy some sorcery? Check out thebest Recluse build, weapons picks, and tips.The strange thing about Recluse is that she's potentially an S-tier character if you're playing with friends and are able to coordinate what affinities you bring to give her the strongest spell combos. The Recluse is a spellcaster who effectively extracts elemental affinities from nearby targets (including allies) and uses them to cast a range of powerful spells. Sounds strong, right? The issue is that she's quite reliant on the players around her to create the best Magic Cocktails. And if she can't perform said Magic Cocktail skill due to lack of affinities, she can't collect affinity residues, the way she restores FP for spellcasting. If in doubt, you can at least spam basic combos, like three magic residues or three fire residues (a common affinity on seals and starting weapons if you use relics). If that breaks, you'll have to get stuck into combat, which is less than ideal when she has low HP, stamina, dexterity, and strength stats. Still, her Soulblood Song ultimate art is pretty handy, marking enemies with a sigil that lets you recover HP and FP when you hit them, so maybe the key to playing Recluse is just to bring three Recluses. Either way, I wouldn't recommend her to anyone just getting started or playing with randos. Become a shielded bulwark with ourbest Guardian build, weapons picks, and tips.It's hard not to like the anthropomorphic bird simply because he's a badass hawk-man, but Guardian is unfortunately a bit out of place in Nightreign. He's certainly the most tanky character on the roster, with the highest base health and a unique enhanced blocking stance, but he offers little else. When compared to Raider, Guardian is outmatched in every meaningful way. Every character in Nightreign can also equip and use shields, making his speciality a little less meaningful. His skill is only really useful against crowd-controlling trash mobs, and let's face it, no one is having too much trouble with these basic enemies. While his ultimate has niche uses, like making Guardian invincible to survive boss marks or providing a defensive buff to nearby allies, it's far from the high damage of Wylder's ult or the utility of the Duchess. It's a shame, really, as Guardian is a fun addition to the eclectic roster. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "How to beat Adel in Elden Ring Nightreign",
    "article_text": "Trounce the Gaping Jaw to get one step closer to the final boss. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Now that Gladius is out of the way, you're met with (almost) all your remaining targets inElden Ring Nightreign, and next up on that hit list is theGaping Jawexpedition. Naturally, a weird half-hippo half-dino-bird monstrosity isn't any easier than a three-headed flaming dog, so you'll need to knowhow to beat Adelto notch your second win. As with the first expedition (and each of theElden Ring Nightreign bossesafter, for that matter), you'll have two \"days\" to prepare for the final fight against Adel. You'll be grinding thebest rune farming routesand hunting forlegendary weapons—basically anything to improve your odds. But all that means nought if you don't know how to kill Adel, Baron of Night. Beating a Nightlord starts long before fighting them directly, so before I get into tips for Adel, here's how to prepare from start to finish in the Gaping Jaw expedition: Adel is weak to poison damage, so attacking him with weapons and spells of this affinity deals additional damage. In fact, it's the only way to disrupt a few of his attacks. You should prioritise any points-of-interest that have the poison symbol next to them using the map overlay, though you can also visitmerchant locations, as these vendors are guaranteed to sell at least one item of the boss' weakness. You can also get relics that apply poison to your starter weapon, which you can upgrade by findingsmithing stone locations. This is a great way to ensure you not only have a poison weapon to begin with, but also your character's preferred weapon type. Frostbite, sleep, and scarlet rot are also fantastic damage types against Adel (like they are for most bosses), though they don't have unique interactions. When playing in a team, it's a good idea to have these ailments spread between you. Adel primarily deals physical damage with his various bites and smacks, though he also has lightning attacks. Look out for relics and upgrades that provide physical and lightning damage negation to reduce how hard he can hit you. Boiled crab and prawn consumables can also be a good backup if you've not got lucky with gear. As with any Nightlord, you'll want to be at least level 10 before you fight him, so earn as many runes as you can and take out expedition bosses along the way for passive upgrades. This'll ensure you're on the best footing possible before stepping into the ring with Adel. Likewise, you should also visit all of the churches to upgrade your flask charges. Depending on how many churches are active (it's usually three, but you can sometimes have four), you can get upwards of eight flasks. Your choice of Nightfarer is pretty important in beating Adel thanks to his poison weakness. Thebest team compositions in Nightreigngenerally have a good mix of melee and ranged characters, and that's no different for Adel, but I recommend the following: If your team isreallystruggling to keep up with Adel's fast (and near-constant movement), consider doubling up on Ironeyes for consistent damage at range, or have Duchess/Executor grab a bow. Now it's time to heave open the doors and actually fight the Baron of Night. Here are some tips to beat Adel: Besides general chomps and smacks, Adel has four main attacks to watch out for: Especially during the first phase, most of Adel's attacks come from his, y'know, gaping jaw. It's best to stay around his side so that you're not caught out by his charge. This is slightly harder in phase two once he powers up with lightning, particularly as he stomps. With how agile Adel is and how much it makes you move around the arena, ailments are your best friend. Poison damage is a great way to stun Adel and interrupt the charge attack, while also dealing strong damage over time. Other ailments like frostbite, bleed, and scarlet rot are also useful as the former give you bonus damage, while the latter gives you damage over time, making up for all the time spent running. As with any boss, but especially for mobile ones like Adel, staggers cause them to stop in their tracks, while also letting you get a devastating blow. This is the perfect time to pile on damage, including building ailments while they can't escape. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Make the most of Nightreign's poster boy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Wylder might be the \"default\" character and poster child ofElden Ring Nightreign, but that doesn't mean he's any less effective than the other Nightfarers. It's not immediately clear what you should specialise in with this agile but strength-based fighter though. After spending countless hours with Nightreign's lost swordsman, I've learned some handy tricks to make thebest Wylder buildshine. Almost everything is randomised in Nightreign, from the gear you find on runs to the passives each one has, and even events likelocusts stealing your levels, so you can't ever guarantee you'll get what you want. Still, it's useful to know what items and stats to look out for to spend less time juggling items in your inventory and more time visiting thebest Nightreign rune farming spots. Below you'll find my best build for Wylder, but also tips and tricks to eke out every advantage. Character builds inElden RingNightreign focus on four things: Relics, weapons (and their passives), talismans, and passive buffs from bosses. While the latter three are found during an expedition, you'll pick your relics before heading out, so it's a good idea to know what works and what doesn't for your character. Wylder is a great all-rounder character, with relatively high default health and stamina, and a penchant for heavy-hitting strength weapons.Anything that further improves survivability or his preferred weapon, a greatsword, is a good start. Wylder also has a very strong ultimate, and great utility from his grappling hook skill, so ability-based buffs are also worth considering on relics and passives (whether on weapons or from boss rewards). Nightreign Duchess build guideNightreign Executor build guideNightreign Guardian build guideNightreign Ironeye build guideNightreign Revenant build guideNightreign Recluse build guideNightreign Raider build guide Like other characters,Wylder has several unique relic affixesthat can appear on relics, marked with [Wylder] before the skill description. These are almost always thebest relicsfor them, especially the unique effect which adds a powerful follow-up attack to his skill when using a greatsword, his preferred weapon type. I'd recommend the following buffs for Wylder: Wylder's preferred weapon type is agreatsword, and they're easy enough to come by given how many there are. While he leans towards strength-based weapons, he's not bad with dexterity ones either, meaning you can use just about anything if you'd like. You can also use a shield in your off-hand, though once you've got the hang of dodging and his hook, two-handing a greatsword is the way to go. Purple-quality weapons like Death's Poker (which deals Frostbite) and Sword of Milos (Bleed damage) are great picks, especially once you know how toupgrade weapons in Nightreignto legendary using theShifting Earth: The Craterevent. There are also some fantasticlegendary weapons in Nightreignthat work well with Wylder (unlike the incredible Ironeye build since there's no unique dexterity bows), such as the Blasphemous Blade, Golden Order Greatsword, and the Sacred Relic Greatsword. Here are the best weapon passives for Wylder: The other main gear type you'll find during expeditions, talismans, are earned from killing the shimmering scarabs (they're dung beetles), or occasionally from power-up drops, such as the one that seemingly always spawns in the gateway in the central castle. The best talismans for Wydler are: Wylder is a fairly beginner-friendly character thanks to their high health and stamina, and a wide pool of weapons to pick from (which can make the RNG slightly less cruel). With that said, there are some things you should know: Wylder's Claw Shot skill is a grappling hook that pulls weaker enemies to you, and you towards bigger, heavier enemies like bosses. Nightreign's bosses are generally incredibly mobile, which typically makes melee a hard playstyle. Wylder can get around this by using his grappling hook to close the gap. I've found it works best to run away from bosses' AoE attacks on foot, but use Claw Shot to get back into melee range rather than the other way around. This saves stamina and lets you trigger the follow-up attack from his unique relic. Claw Shot is also considered sprinting, so it's very easy to pull off running attacks or, even better, jump attacks (which deal extra stagger damage) while reeling yourself in. Pair this with passive effects on weapons, and you can turn this mobility skill into a weapon. When you view the skill descriptions in the character selection screen, you won't know that you can actually charge or hold certain attacks to improve them (or even change what they do in certain situations). This applies to Wylder's ultimate, Onslaught Stake, which can be charged to increase its damage by holding the button. It's a heavy-hitting ultimate, so why not make the most of it? Onslaught Stake is an incredible ultimate, but it can be even better if you have an Ironeye and/or Duchess on your team. If you're playing with friends, you could even kindly ask them to swap to power you up in one of thebest Elden Ring Nightreign team compositions. Keep an eye out for enemies with a slightly wonky cross on them—these are enemies that have been marked by Ironeye, causing them to take increased damage. Typically, an Ironeye's job is to ensure the boss is constantly marked, but if it's not active, it's generally worth waiting until the enemy is marked before unleashing your fully-charged ultimate. Otherwise, you're just missing out on free damage. Likewise, Duchess can use her Restage skill to cause enemies to take damage for a second time. It's hard to predict if you're playing with random players since you can't see their ability cooldowns, but you'll benefit greatly from having her follow up on your ultimate by Restaging it, effectively triggering it twice. The best news is that this works in tandem with Ironeye, turning your explosive skewer into a nuclear blast. Since you'll be in melee range most of the time, you need to learn to stay alive. The best way to do this is to master dodging, especially against bosses. Dodges give you a brief window of invincibility (which can be improved with passives), so time it right to avoid damage. You can also use a shield to guard counter for additional damage and stagger, though this means you can't two-hand your greatsword, which deals bonus damage.

    "article_text": "Dash around foes and pepper them with a storm of arrows. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Putting together thebest Ironeye buildinElden Ring Nightreigncan be quite challenging when so much is randomized and down to what you find during your expedition to trounce each Nightlord. Instead, the best build for each Nightfarer depends on what you find, who you're fighting, and even what you have available in terms of starting relics. That doesn't mean you should just give up and grab whatever comes up, though. Nightreign's buildcrafting is more about prepping yourself with the right relics where possible—often ones with universal utility—and then keeping an eye out for valuable weapons, passives, and talismans while exploring and defeating bosses. Knowing how to play your Nightfarer and coordinate their abilities with your teammates is also key to victory. Here, I'll run through the best relics, weapons, talismans, and passives for Ironeye, plus give you a little guide down below that illustrates his optimal playstyle while out on an expedition. Crafting a build for a character in Nightreign is a little limited by the fact that you can only equip the best relics and hope that you'll find some good weapons and bonuses in your run-up to the final boss. Any potential build is also impacted by the fact that you want to bring or find a weapon affinity that the Nightlord is weak to, and so that's generally what you're searching for. Still, if you follow the build tips below, you should have a far easier road to victory. Nightreign Duchess build guideNightreign Executor build guideNightreign Guardian build guideNightreign Revenant build guideNightreign Recluse build guideNightreign Raider build guideNightreign Wylder build guide As mentioned, one of the few ways you can pre-build Ironeye is through relics, despite the fact that most of the ones you get are random.Ironeye has some unique relic affixesthat can come up, like \"Art charge activation adds poison effect\", granting poison to his Single Shot ultimate. These relics are always marked with[Ironeye], so keep a lookout for any dropping. Otherwise, these are the relic affixes I recommend bringing where possible: Another way to make Ironeye strong is to pick up as many weapons with favourable passives as possible during an expedition, since having them in your inventory will grant you the passive (unless it's marked with a red hand, meaning it needs to be equipped). I also thinklongbows or shortbows are best for Ironeyeversus greatbows, which have a slow cooldown making it likely you'll get smacked about during the Nightlord boss. Since Ironeye is a high dexterity hero, he can alsouse daggers, rapiers, katanas, twinblades, and just about anything with good dex-scaling, so don't feel locked to range if you don't find a good bow. Here are the best weapon passives I recommend watching out for: There are also some talismans you can find by defeating scarabs that are definitely worth grabbing if you find them, or get a fort map marking their location. The best talismans for Ironeye in order are: In terms of actually playing as Ironeye, there are definitely some things to take into account. The archer is one of the best classes due to his varied kit and ability to deal consistent damage at range. Here are some things to bear in mind when playing him. Marking is a melee dash that hits enemies and marks them for increased damage, so hitting a boss with this before your party uses their ultimate Arts is definitely optimal. This skill has a very fast cooldown, so you won't have to wait long before using it. Marking is such a versatile skill—since it lets you dash forward to strike the enemy, you can also use it to dodge through a charging boss, or reposition to their other side for a potential backstab. If you're not confident dodging a tricky Nightlord attack, hit your skill to dash right through, marking them for extra damage in the process. Another reason Ironeye is amazing is that bows are very strong for reviving downed party members. Simply target them, plink away with your bow, and before long they'll be right as rain. In particular, I recommend using shortbows as you get the Barrage skill, letting you fire lots of arrows in rapid succession for even faster revives. You can even use your Single Shot art to revive allies as a clutch move—I managed to revive two fallen allies next to each other with this in a Nightlord fight. One of the advantages of bringing a bow is that you can manually aim for weak spots on certain enemies. Say you're fighting a troll, for instance—aim at the head and you should get a stun. A surprising number of enemies have weak spots that'll flinch, and it's quite often their head, so have a little experiment and see who you can stun. Ironeye's Single Shot Art also damages enemies in an AoE/fixed line in front of it, so it can be pretty powerful. If you've got a Duchess on the team, and you're on comms, make sure to warn them in advance you're going to use it so you can make sure they have the Restage skill ready to go to double the damage and effect. Since Ironeye is a high dex Nightfarer, you can consider using dex-scaling weapons that aren't bows, such as daggers, twinblades, rapiers, katanas, or spears. This is potentially worth it if you find a dex weapon with the Nightlord's affinity weakness, but don't have a bow with it, or if you find a good weapon with bleed, frost, poison, or scarlet rot.

    "article_text": "Smash the Beast of Night so you can start running other expeditions. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Discoveringhow to beat GladiusinElden Ring Nightreignis your first major trial, and honestly, it's one that might cause many players to bounce off the game entirely. The trickiest thing about Gladius, Beast of Night, despite his hefty health pool, is that he transforms from a three-headed dog into three one-headed dogs, and everything gets a bit chaotic from then on. In a game where coordination is key, if you're playing randos, you're going to have a much harder time against this boss. Still, there are things you can do to make the fight easier. Did you know, for example, that each Nightlord has a weakness displayed just next to their portrait when you launch the expedition? Finding a weapon of this affinity is a good start. The relics you equip at the start of the run and the passive buffs you acquire in the first two days of the expedition are also vital in making sure you're strong enough to tackle this Nightlord. Here's how to defeat Gladius, Beast of Night, inElden RingNightreign. Defeating a Nightlord comes down to prep during the expedition as much as anything else, so before I get into tips for the boss itself, make sure you're doing these things during your expedition to maximise your chances: Gladius is weak to holy damage, and attacking him with weapons or spells of this affinity can even flinch or stun him. Prioritise camps, ruins, and cathedrals that have the holy damage symbol next to them and if worst comes to worst, merchants will stock at least one holy damage weapon you can buy, though this might not always be suitable for your Nightfarer. If you have a relic that applies holy damage to your starter weapon, make sure to get Smithing Stones 1 and 2 to upgrade that instead. If you can't find a holy damage weapon, try to grab some Holy Grease—you'll generally find it in locations marked with the holy damage symbol. On a side note, some holy weapon skills are absurdly powerful against Gladius. The Envoy's Long Horn Bubble Shower skill (used to cheese Fire Giant in the original game) is very strong against Gladius if you can land the bubbles when he's stationary and have them hit his centre mass—a great pick if you find it while running Raider. You'll want to be about level tenminimumto fight Gladius, so make sure you're taking the best rune farm route possible and defeating bosses to get passive buffs. You'll also want to hit as many churches as possible en route to get extra healing flasks and buff-based consumables. Though you won't have the best relics at this stage, even basic ones can give you helpful buffs. Look out for: Remember that you can buy new relics for Murk from the Small Jar Bazaar in the west wing of the Roundtable Hold, including a random relic if you purchase the Scenic Flatstone at the bottom of the list. With all that, you should be in the best place possible to face off against the fiery doggo. First off, your choice of character is actually quite important in beating Gladius and you're best off with the following: Melee characters are generally the best against Gladius, but as with everything, Ironeye's arrows are an incredible source of consistent damage. If you unlock the Duchess, you could also bring her—though whether the necessary relic drops is random—and use the Restage skill on your party's ultimate arts for extra damage. The one character I definitely wouldn't recommend bringing is Recluse, due to her high initial skill ceiling. Now you're prepped and running the right character, here are some tips to beat Gladius: There are two attacks that you should really learn to watch out for, and those are: Besides these attacks, Gladius mainly just jumps at you and tries to bite like your typicalFromSoftwarebig wolf boss, so it isn't too hard to avoid. Gladius will periodically transform into three fireballs that move around the map before turning into three separate dogs. It's vital to understand the mark mechanic here, and honestly, it'll help you with future Nightlords too. One player will have a little red circle on them, indicating they are marked and the Nightlord's aggression is aimed at them for now. The marked player should basically focus on staying alive, while I suggest the other two gang up on a single of the three dogs and bully it as much as possible. Applying holy damage to Gladius will flinch him and he'll start glowing with little golden rays. When in his three-dog form, you can also flinch the dogs with holy damage. For me, I did this frequently while playing as Raider and Ironeye. You'll start to hear a cracking effect when you hit the dog, and after a couple more hits, it'll get knocked back and temporarily flinched in a unique animation. You can also stance break both Gladius and any of the three dogs, so make sure to get a critical hit in if you do. Remember, unlike Elden Ring, you can keep damaging enemies and bosses in Nightreign even when someone is performing a critical attack, so make hay while you can.

All but two Nightfarers are available from the get-go, so it's important you knowhow to unlock DuchessinElden Ring Nightreignif you want to collect the full roster. The Duchess is a high dexterity and intelligence Nightfarer, focused on staying light on her feet while performing quick combos with daggers. Using her Restage skill, you can dump massive damage into targets in a very short amount of time. The downside is that she's very much a glass cannon, so don't get caught. To unlock Duchess, you need tobeat the Tricephalos expeditionfor the first time to earn the Old Pocketwatch relic. With the hard work done, you just have to give this item to thePriestessin the Roundtable Hold—she's next to the titular round expedition table at the centre of the area. I won't spoil the actual events, but giving her this quest item triggers a short cutscene that reveals the Duchess. Afterwards, you can swap to the Duchess like any other character by visiting the shrine next to the expedition table. Though Tricephalos is the first expedition you'll have access to, that's not to say it's easy; it'll take you a good few tries and quite a bit of luck to come out victorious.

    "article_text": "A small girl with an army of big skeletons. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The bestRevenant buildinElden Ring Nightreignchanges based on what kind of randomized loot you find on a run. Every expedition is different, which means you have to be flexible as you race toward your encounter with the Nightlord. The key is to know what relics to bring into a run and what items to look for as you clear out the map. Not every item will benefit you, however. Nightreign has all sorts of drops that will be more useful for certain heroes, like bows for the ranger and staves for the witch. But once you know what item types to search for as you kill bosses, you'll be able to get a solid build up and running. Understanding how your Nightfarer plays and what items synergize with their kit is the key to success. Here, I'll detail the best relics, weapons, talismans, and passives for the Revenant, and how to make the most out of her skeletal army. Your build in Nightreign will be made up of everything you manage to find during an expedition. Relics certainlyhave an impact, but it's more important to adapt to the affinities that are most effective for each Nightlord. The tips below will help you piece together a build as you dive into each run as the Revenant. Nightreign Duchess build guideNightreign Executor build guideNightreign Guardian build guideNightreign Ironeye build guideNightreign Recluse build guideNightreign Raider build guideNightreign Wylder build guide There's a myriad of relics to choose from in Nightreign, but some of them offerunique relic affixes for Revenant, like \"Power up while fighting alongside family\" which gives you a big bonus to your damage while your skeleton minions are with you. The character-specific relics will be marked with[Revenant], so be on the lookout for those. Here are other useful relics to use on Revenant: Passive bonuses on items are great for Revenant too. All of these effects work as long as they're in your inventory (unless it's marked with a red hand, meaning it needs to be equipped). Revenant isbest utilised as a ranged spellcaster, but she can also use daggers and bows to supplement her minions. I recommend picking up as many staves and seals as you can while also keeping one or two melee weapons on you in case you run out of FP. Here are the best weapon passives I recommend picking up: Talismans take a little more work to find, but they can offer some powerful effects. Check the map at the top of a fort to reveal nearby scarabs that drop them. The best talismans for the Revenant in order are: Revenant isn't as straightforward as the other characters. Your skeleton minions have to be managed as you fight monsters and bosses, which can be tricky to pull off if you're the center of attention. Ideally, you want to play at a distance from your target and only move in close when you have to. Here are some tips on how to make the most out of playing her: Revenant's skeleton summons won't be able to solo a boss, but they will drag their attention away from you when you need it. Try to keep Helen and Frederick up for weak enemies and call on Sebastian for bosses. Sebastian not only acts as a tank but also helps your team stagger the boss. Revenant's ultimate has the power to revive all your allies when they're downed and make them temporarily immortal. This is ridiculously powerful during boss fights, where the time it takes to hit your allies would get you killed. Even though her ultimate technically does some damage, I'd hold onto it in case you need to do a last-second save. Revenant, unlike the other spellcaster, Recluse, has pretty good dexterity scaling, which means you can do competent damage with daggers and bows. It's not ideal, but it's a good idea to keep a few melee weapons on you if you don't have any spells or find you're running out of FP a lot. The one thing Revenant does have in common with Recluse is an FP problem. Both casters constantly run out of FP, especially during boss fights. You should search every church and camp for Starlight Shards to use during extended boss fights. Every character in Nightreign benefits from a bow. Bows give you free damage when you have no FP and they're fantastic for reviving allies from afar. While I wouldn't try to make an entire build with bows, I'd make sure you have one as a last resort.

However, it's worth pointing out that, at least for me, it spawned at the edge of the map—where the ever-shrinking storm will consume first. I recommend you head to the location straightaway to avoid getting caught out by the storm mid-fight or the area being entirely covered before you even reach it. Don't forget that you can hitch a ride on a bird to travel across the map much faster. Annoyingly, only one personal objective can be progressed at a time, both for yourself but also for your party. If the orange flag hasn't appeared on the map for you, then your personal objective isn't active in the current run, and it's likely that your allies' is instead. You'll need to load into another expedition, where hopefully no one else on your team is trying to complete a personal objective to guarantee it spawns. Killing the golem and completing the personal objective gives you the Stone Stake quest item at the end of the run. When you speak to the caretaker, he'll give you the second volume annals (which updates your journal again) and turns the Stone Stake into an equipable relic for Guardian. It's one of his unique relics, and it's a very powerful upgrade to his kit, causing his skill to create a whirlwind for a short duration and boosting ability regeneration.

    "article_text": "Unlock new journal entries and character remembrance events using memory fragments. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. ContinuingFromSoftware's knack for obscure storytelling,Elden Ring Nightreigndoes actually feature a story—one for each Nightfarer, in fact, as well as the main narrative—despite being a multiplayer experience first and foremost. These stories primarily unfold through the journal in the Roundtable Hold, though it's not immediately apparent how to progress them. It turns out, you need to getmemory fragments. These items unlock new journal entries for your currently selected character. At certain chapters in the journal, characters can beginremembrances, which either give you a unique objective during an expedition, or a quick boss fight in return for some lore. Here's what you need to do to progress them. Memory fragments are earnedrandomly after completing expeditions, successfully or otherwise, and are given to you at the end of the run. However,later chapters require you to beat a Nightlordwith your chosen character. If you're not progressing through a Nightfarer's journal after a few failed runs, then it means you need to win to unlock the next stage in their story. Visit the journal often to track your progress, as the reward message for this item is very easy to miss—it pops up in the bottom right once you're back in the Roundtable Hold, not in the end-of-match reward overview screen. The in-game explainer for the journal is, unsurprisingly, very vague, noting that \"persistence in battle will yield memory fragments\" and that occasionally someone in the Roundtable Hold might help. As for what that means exactly, that's anyone's guess, but I've been rewarded several memory fragments just by doing expeditions early on. Once reaching around the fifth chapter for characters, I then had to beat a Nightlord before earning a new memory fragment. In my experience, memory fragments areautomatically used to unlock a new journal chapter for the characteryou're currently playing as. So if you want to learn more about a particular character, you'll need to play as them. Once you've beaten the Tricephalos expedition for the first time, you'll unlock character missions. At certain points in the journal for each character, you can begin a remembrance mission to restore the past experiences of your Nightfarer. These are different for every character, but are vital to increase your power with them, as you'll be rewarded with a unique and powerful relic. For example, Guardian's first remembrance is at chapter four of their journal entries, while Recluse has one at chapter two. These remembrances take you to the aptly named Realm of Remembrance—the only difference is a white vignette, really. Certain characters will be in different locations in the Roundtable Hold, or you might be transported to a small area for a quick objective, as with Raider's tournament battles. Generally, though, you just need to chat to an NPC. Some remembrances will give you what's called a personal objective. These are actual tasks you'll need to complete while on an expedition, but you'll need to launch the match from inside the Realm of Remembrance—again, the white vignette makes it easy to figure out. Importantly, you can only complete one per run. Additionally, if you have a character remembrance active, matchmaking will not put you with other players currently looking to do a remembrance event as well, unless you invite them directly. In this case, the leader of the lobby takes priority and will have their objective active—the other players won't be able to progress their personal objectives until the host has finished theirs. You can pause a character's remembrance at any time in the Roundtable Hold by returning to the journal; just keep in mind that you won't be able to progress their story until you've beaten the chapter.

    "article_text": "Take the bird-man Guardian to new heights with the right tools for the job. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Struggling to survive inElden Ring Nightreign? Then you can't do better than the tanky and defensive Guardian, who just so happens to be a cool-looking bird man. With thebest Guardian build, you'll be able to take hits and return the favour, and protect your team while you're at it. Although almost everything is randomised in Nightreign, from the gear you find on runs to the passives each one has, it's still useful to know what items and stats to look out for—not least because the inventory is rather fiddly. Below you'll find my best build for Guardian so you know what you're working towards, but also handy tips and tricks to get the most out of his kit. After picking your character, builds inElden RingNightreign are formed around four things: relics, weapons (and their passives), talismans, and passives from bosses and rewards. While you can find the latter three during an expedition, you'll pick your relics before heading out, so it's a good idea to know thebest relicsfor your character. Guardian is a tank first and foremost, and one that relies on his enhanced block and counterattacks, soanything that boosts defence, stamina, or provides support effectsis always the way to go. Keep an eye out for buffs like this from relics, weapons, talismans, and boss reward passive effects. Nightreign Duchess build guideNightreign Executor build guideNightreign Ironeye build guideNightreign Revenant build guideNightreign Recluse build guideNightreign Raider build guideNightreign Wylder build guide Much like the other Nightfarers,Guardian has a handful of unique relic affixesthat can appear on relics, marked with [Guardian] before the skill description. These are almost always worth using. When it comes to gearing up Guardian with relics before a hunt, I'd recommend the following buffs: The best weapon type for Guardian ishalberdswith a shield in his off-hand, giving him great range on counterattacks. Unfortunately, there are no unique legendary halberds that you can find, so you'll have to settle for upgrading either your starting weapon or one that matches the boss' weakness. You can onlyupgrade weapons in Elden Ring Nightreignto legendary quality during theShifting Earth: The Craterevent. Otherwise, you can also use otherstrength-scaling weapons like great spears or hammers. Here are the best weapon passives I recommend watching out for when playing Guardian: Alongside weapons, you can also find talismans during a run, which add even more passives. These are generally earned from killing scarabs (or dung beetles), though you can also occasionally get them from the power-up drops, such as the one that seemingly always spawns in the gateway in the central castle. These are the best talismans for Guardian: While Guardian's massive health pool might make him seem like a very beginner-friendly Nightfarer, that's far from the truth. Nightreign's bosses are incredibly fast and have lots of AoE attacks, often making melee a risky playstyle. Add on top of that Guardian's unique block-counter approach, and he's a lot more finicky than the likes of Ironeye. One of the most confusing things about Guardian is his Steel Guard passive ability, letting him brace with a shield for a more powerful, stamina-efficient block. What's not entirely clear is how to activate it, as it actually needs to be triggered (kind of contradictory considering it's a passive, no?). By blocking and pressing the dodge button in any direction, Guardian enters a unique stance that slows his movement but gives enhanced block in return. Since the animation begins with what looks like a dodge (which also means it takes a second to trigger), it's easy to overlook what it's actually doing, but this move is what makes Guardian such a strong tank. You can even get some good damage out of it thanks to guard counters. Building off of his Steel Guard passive, you'll benefit greatly from learning enemy attacks so you know when to quickly block and when you need to activate his stance. Mastering this timing lets you weave between offence and defence much more fluently. Another one of Nightreign's many quirks is that most characters' abilities have special effects if you charge them or hold them after activation. In Guardian's case, both of his abilities can be powered up. Charging Whirlwind gives it much greater range, and can even create a cyclone. Most importantly, though, his Wings of Salvation ultimate art creates a protective area for a short duration, as long as you continue to hold the button. While you can be interrupted using Guardian's skill, unlike Ironeye's incredible blade dash, Wings of Salvation makes you completely invincible during activation and for the duration after if you're holding it. This gives you a solid ten or so seconds of invulnerability, which helps in a pinch if you're marked by a boss. Plus, you'll still be helping your team while you're out of action. Guardian is a close-range character, and although tanky, you're not a superhero. Most Nightlords have some kind of big blast attack or AoE that covers the ground. No matter how much stamina you have or how skilled you are with a shield, sometimes you do just need to back up and avoid taking hits altogether.

    "article_text": "Headbutt foes and impress allies with your big rock. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Crafting thebest Raider buildinElden Ring Nightreignis slightly less challenging than many of the other Nightfarers, though that's only because he's so straightforward. My beloved Raider is your standard strength main, caring for little beyond headbutting every enemy he can and screaming as he produces a giant rock from the ground. Raider's headbutt, in particular, is very strong if you time it right and get the enhanced version, which kind of makes up for how useless his Totem Stella (big rock) often is. If you're looking to build Raider, you'll have plenty of choice in terms of big strength weapons, especially as most of the characters I expect to be popular are dexterity mains. All that said, here's my best build for Raider inElden RingNightreign, with a list of hisbest relics, weapon passives to look out for, ideal talismans, plus a list of tips lower down that'll help you learn the best way to play this loveable brute. Coming up with a build in Nightreign is limited by the randomness of what you find in each expedition, but knowing what to look for is just as important. You can also pre-build your character well by picking the right relics, giving them the best possible chance at success. Generally,anything that increases your health, stamina, and damage with your weapon/affinitytype works best for the Raider's playstyle, whether it's a relic, weapon buff, talisman, or boss reward passive effect. Nightreign Duchess build guideNightreign Executor build guideNightreign Guardian build guideNightreign Ironeye build guideNightreign Revenant build guideNightreign Recluse build guideNightreign Wylder build guide Despite the fact that most relics you get in Nightreign are random, there are certainunique affixes for each Nightfarer, and these are often the most strong. These are easy to recognise since they're marked with [Raider], though only one of Raider's is particularly good: As a strength-weapon wielder, you'll want to equip Raider with the biggest, highest damage weapons possible. We're talkingcolossal weapons,greatclubs,greataxes,greatswords—all things great. If you can get two big weapons of the same kind, you might want to trydual-wieldingthem, as this will allow you to do a two-hit jump attack that's great for damage and staggering bosses. Here are the best weapon passives I recommend watching out for: Talismans are another item you can get by defeating scarabs in Limveld, and they add a variety of potential buffs to your build. Here are the ones I recommend in order, depending on what you get: In terms of actually playing as Raider, there are definitely some things to take into account. He's great at breaking stance, using strength weapons, and being fairly tanky, but here are some things to bear in mind when playing him. Raider's headbutt is a lot of fun, but did you know there's an enhanced version if you take enough damage during its initial activation? This is tricky to time, but it makes the skill more like a parry—you want to time it so that you'll take damage (reduced by the skill) to then perform a powerful uppercut that deals massive stagger damage and flinches bosses. The Totem Stella is one of the most useless ultimate arts, mainly because it's so janky. I've had bosses get stuck inside, be lifted off the ground, and I've even gotten stuck inside it too. Sometimes you might think you can raise an ally on top of it to revive them safely, but half the time they'll get stuck inside the rock as well. It's honestly a mess. On the plus side, being around the rock does give you increased strength (and so damage) and poise, plus hitting enemies with the edge of it will damage them, so good placement is key. As in Elden Ring, if you dual-wield two weapons of the same type, you can do special attacks (replacing the block button) where you hit with both, and it does a hefty bit of damage. It's also a good opportunity to attack with multiple damage types, or even deal two status afflictions at once, like bleed, frost, scarlet rot, sleep, or poison. Nightreign doesn't make it particularly clear what you can dual-wield in terms of big weapons—some greataxes don't work together, for example—so have a play round with what you find. Just as in the base game, jumping attacks are great for breaking stance and stunning bosses and enemies, especially if you dual-wield strength weapons and hit with both at the same time. Jumping dual-wield attacks are also one of the best ways you can revive downed characters as a slow-attacking strength user. If you land both hits of the dual-wield strength attack on them, it'll do a full third of the revival gauge. Big strength weapons are some of the highest damage in Nightreign, so definitely prioritise pure damage numbers over Nightlord weakness if you're Raider, especially if someone else in your party is already applying the affinity. One of Raider's best features is that, as an S-tier strength character, he can wield those high damage strength weapons effectively and get some big hits in.

    "article_text": "Plant your feet and become the beast. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It can be hard to nail down thebest Executor buildinElden Ring Nightreign, given the chaos of the game's random loot table—especially since he's a bit of a strange case. The Executor can excel in a couple of key areas, with a few build routes available to you based on what you can snag in any given run. And, as always, getting a legendary weapon with a powerful art might trounce all of them. There are, however, some good ideas to keep in your back pocket. Each Nightfarer has some unique relics, passives, and weapons to look out for, and the Executor's no different. And given how quickly the rain can close in on your position, you'll want to learn these no-brainers so you can snap them up and keep moving. In this guide, I'll be imparting to you my cursebound, occult knowledge of what's best to look out for—and I'll also be giving you a quick rundown of the Executor's abilities and arts, as well. The Executor has a high skill ceiling, but that shouldn't dissuade you from giving this parry god an honest try. Again, I want to take this opportunity to reiterate that the best relics, weapons, and passives will all be dependent on both how your current run's goingandwhat boss you happen to be facing. For example, you'll want to be rocking poison in some fashion to take on the Gaping Jaw. Take the following words not as gospel, but a rough sketch you can fill in with some nice coloured pencils of your choosing. You'll also notice in the following lists that I've not included \"on Critical Hit\" options. While the Executor often stance-breaks enemies with his Cursed Sword, I've found that same stance is immobile enough that he rarely ever gets a chance to capitalise on them. If you're in a team, it's best to focus on stance-breaking and survivability first, letting your Duchess teammate go in for the glory kill. Nightreign Duchess build guideNightreign Guardian build guideNightreign Ironeye build guideNightreign Revenant build guideNightreign Recluse build guideNightreign Raider build guideNightreign Wylder build guide Relics represent your only real ability to have a concrete game plan each run—and while you can tailor them to specific weapons or items, it's best to go for generally strong relic passives in order to stay flexible. Like all Nightfarers, theExecutor has some unique relic affixesthat'll be marked with[Executor]—these are absolutely worth keeping an eye out for. Here's a list of solid relic recommendations to get you started: Given the Executor's focus on Dexterity and Arcane—with S-tier scaling in both of them—his pool of good weapons is narrowed down quite a bit. On the other hand, his passives are far more wide-reaching, and since you gain passives from any weapons you've picked up (unless they have the hand icon, in which case they need to be equipped) you'll want to become familiar with all of them. The Executor makes the best use out ofkatanas, daggers, curved swords, twinblades, scythes, whips,andclaws—but given his Arcane scaling, there are weapons in other categories that might fit him well. As a general rule of thumb, if a weapon has status build-up, it's likely got some Arcane scaling, too. The Executor can also, despite their abilities, do very well with a status-build ranged weapon such as the Serpent Bow—owing to his high Dexterity. While it doesn't synergise with the rest of his kit, it's nice to have a way to deal damage and apply status effects at-range. As ever, bleed is the most potent status effect to look for on a weapon—but given how smithing stones can be tricky to come by, I'd snap up any status build weapon of a higher rarity, rather than funnelling yourself into one status type. Here are some of my recommendations for weapon passives: During your runs, you'll also snag some talismans from certain chests or, predominantly, by whacking the scarabs populating the lands between. When it comes to the Executor, you'll want to go for talismans that improve your survivability, since you'll often be danger-close. You'll notice a few guarding ability, stamina, and poise granting talismans on this list. In an ideal world, you don't need these, given the Executor's cursed sword parry ability—but let's face it, you probably aren't Let Me Solo Her, and you'll likely mess up your parry timing on occasion. These talismans help shore up your Cursed Sword stance's standard block. The best talismans for the Executor, in order, are: The executor is a mixed bag—part status-building skirmisher, part parry-tank, part crowd-clearer with his ultimate art. Outstanding Executor players will learn how to use his unique tools for each situation, and be able to swap between them on the fly. Here are a few tips to keep in mind when playing him. Unlike other characters, the Executor's Cursed Sword stance is available to him whenever he likes. When he enters it, he gains the ability to deflect, and a strong stance-breaking two handed weapon—in exchange for losing his status build-ups and mobility. It's easiest to think of the Executor as having two 'modes', aggressive and defensive. Your aggressive mode is when you're using your standard weapons, applying status build-ups while the enemy is focused on your allies. Your defensive mode is your Cursed Sword stance, to be pulled out when you've got aggro—or to keep a priority target busy. You neither want to stay in your Cursed Sword stance for too long—as your damage will suffer—but you also want to make sure you use it, as deflecting is extremely potent. This is a bit of a niche trick, but as you enter your Cursed Sword stance, you also have deflection frames—this means you can use Cursed Swordreactively,making it a far more versatile ability. Try to think of your Cursed Sword activation as a kind of block, and make good use of it when fighting with your regular weapons out. In addition, don't forget that you can Guard Counter out of a deflection with your cursed sword—achieved by hitting the right trigger on controller immediately after successfully deflecting, or blocking, an attack. Aspects of the Crucible: Beast is a powerful offensive ultimate, allowing you to stunlock medium-weight enemies with your big claws. But it can also be used defensively, seeing as it refills your HP. You can also end it early by activating it again, conserving some of your charge for the next use. This makes it a great utility against bosses who either deal too much damage to you to stay in it for long (big dogs have big hitboxes), or just as a backup tool in case you're in a long boss fight and out of healing options. The Executor is a primo 1v1 specialist—while working with a team, make good use of this fact. In boss fights with multiple enemies, don't be afraid to plant your feet in your Cursed Sword stance and play defensively, while your allies deal with the rest of your foes. Doing damage is important, but freeing up your mates to tangle with other enemies is a huge benefit. Unlike Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, the Executor's deflect ability has a hugely forgiving deflect window—likely to compensate for Nightreign's online component. As such, you shouldn't try to deflectrightas attacks come in. As long as you're in the approximate ballpark, you'll be okay. Secondly, your Cursed Sword stance does have a standard block. While you should typically aim to deflect, you can deflect out of a block pretty rapidly by simply releasing the deflect button and tapping it again. As such, you should keep your guard up—better your stamina bar be deleted by an unexpected attack, than you taking an unexpected dirt nap.

A good plan and a little bit of luck can help you find thebest Recluse buildinElden Ring Nightreign. Given the randomized nature of the run-based game, you can't always predict what you'll have to work with, but there are powerful spells and weapons to look for during your hunt for the Nightlords. Some expeditions will go better than others, which means you'll need to be flexible with what you find. It's always better to have an inventory full of options rather than empty pockets when it comes to Nightreign. Every character—Recluse included—can use a variety of weapons, passives, and talismans, so don't be afraid to experiment. Recluse is one of the only Nightfarers who relies heavily on her abilities and coordination with her team. I've broken down how to be effective with her magic, as well as the best relics, weapons, talismans, and passives to use. Builds in Nightreign depend entirely on what you find during a run. You don't get to bring much with you on an expedition and what you find will be mostly randomized. Each Nightlord has an element they're weak to, which should be your priority when searching through drops. The tips below will help you put together a build so you're prepared to take on the Nightlords as Recluse. Nightreign Duchess build guideNightreign Executor build guideNightreign Guardian build guideNightreign Ironeye build guideNightreign Revenant build guideNightreign Raider build guideNightreign Wylder build guide There are tons of relics to choose from in Nightreign, but some of them offerunique relic affixes for Recluse, like \"Activating ultimate art raises max HP\" which gives you a big boost of health when you mark enemies with your ultimate. All of these relics will be marked with[Recluse], so be sure to hold onto those. Here are other useful relics to use on Recluse: Recluse benefits a ton from the passive bonuses you can find on weapons during an expedition. The effects will work as long as you have them in your inventory (unless it's marked with a red hand, meaning it needs to be equipped). Recluse can use melee weapons, but I think you should stick to staves and Sacred Seals to keep yourself at a safe distance from enemies. A shield is a good option too. Here are the best weapon passives I recommend picking up: As you explore the map, you can find talismans that provide powerful passive effects. Forts even have maps that reveal nearby scarabs that drop them. The best talismans for Recluse in order are: Recluse has one of the most complicated mechanics in Nightreign: Elemental attacks against enemies and allies can be used to create unique spells or buffs. Whenever an enemy or your teammates are hit with an elemental attack, you can pull it off of them to restore some FP and mix it into your Magic Cocktail. Once you have three elements gathered up, you can activate the skill for one of several effects. Unless you coordinate with your team on what elemental attacks to use, you'll be on your own here. The best Magic Cocktail effects require three different elements, but the most reliable ones can be created yourself with either one element or a mixture of two. Just make sure you look for staves, seals, and even throwing pots with the right elements. Here are the best spell combos to use on Recluse: Recluse has a lot of plates to spin compared to the other characters. Her magic is incredibly potent as long as you have the time to set up one of her spell combos. Here are some things to keep in mind as you play her: Recluse's Magic Cocktail ability depends on her having access to several different spells. Look for magic of any kind as you start an expedition so you can build around the combos you can reliably pull off. FP is the hardest thing to manage on Recluse because Nightreign doesn't have flasks for that. Thankfully, her skill restores a small amount of FP every time you use it. And you should be using it on every enemy you can so you don't find yourself in the middle of battle with no resources. Popping Recluses' ultimate causes all nearby enemies to take extra damage and restores HP and FP when you or your teammates attack them. I recommend using this halfway through a fight when your teammates need it to top themselves off and to potentially stagger enemies, setting them up for devastating critical hits. Using your skill to restore FP can only do so much. Check camps and churches for Starlight Shards and ask your teammates to save theirs for you. Starlight Shards are particularly useful during boss fights when you don't always have an opportunity to use your skill. Bows are extremely useful in Nightreign. Not only can they help you when you're out of FP for spells, but they can also be clutch for reviving teammates from a distance. Recluse tends to have occasional downtime where having a bow can help clean up weaker enemies or revive someone during a chaotic boss fight.

Getting your hands on the best gear and useful items inElden Ring Nightreignis the name of the game, but it's much easier said than done. You can pick yourrelicsbeforehand, but everything after that is up to the ones and zeros. Here to save you from the grasp of RNG hell,merchantsoffer a wide selection of items in return for your hard-earned runes, though even their stock is somewhat up to chance. No matter which of theElden RingNightreign bosses you're fighting, or which of theNightfarersyou're playing as, you'll want to track down a merchant to buy a few specific items at some point in your run. Here's where you need to go to find a merchant, and what you should buy from them. Like almost everything in Nightreign, outside of one location, merchants are never guaranteed, but you can potentially find them in: In fact, besides the merchant you encounter in theroom before the Nightlord boss, the only all-but guaranteed location you can find a merchant is in atownship(marked on the map with a blue row of houses on the map). Since there's usually just one of these in Limveld each run, they can be harder to access. Most merchants, including the one at the end of the run, also have an anvil next to them. Townships are the peaceful ruins of old settlements, and you'll find the merchant in the centre beside an anvil where you canupgrade weaponsusing Smithing Stones, which is an important detail I'll dig into below. Importantly, merchants share the same stock, so if you buy an item from one, it'll be gone from any others you visit, too. Don't expect to buy a rare Smithing Stone 2 and be able to leg it to another vendor in the hopes of buying another, as it'll be out of stock. One thing I have noticed, however, is that the township merchant will often have an expanded stock vs. the other merchants and will sometimes sell a Smithing Stone 2. As for what you should buy from a merchant, that generally depends on what you have already, who you're playing, and the Nightlord you're hunting.

    "article_text": "Prep for your next expedition with the best relics and tweak your relic rite with a goblet. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Choosing thebest relicsinElden Ring Nightreigngoes a long way to helping you defeat whatever fearsome Nightlord you're facing next. You can equip three relics of different colours overall, granting a variety of bonuses that range from being great to kind of garbage due to their weird specificity. You can also change what colour relics you can equip usinggobletsandchalicesforrelic rites, and you can even find class-specific relics that provide some extremely powerful buffs unique to your chosen Nightfarer. Here I'll run through the Nightfarer-specific relics, my picks for the best out of the others, plus explain this whole relic rite thing and how it functions. There are two ways to get relics inElden RingNightreign: Before you blow all your Murk, remember that it's also used to buy Nightreign outfits for your Nightfarer once you unlock those. As with basically everything else in Nightreign, relics are randomised, offering you a selection of up to three affixes that range from being really useful to absolute trash. In fact, there's only one type of relic which is fixed, and those are the ones that you get for defeating a Nightlord for the first time, such as Night of the Beast for Gladius, or Night of the Baron for Adel. All relics have a chance to roll special affixes that offerclass-specific bonuses—marked with the classes' name next to them like [Wylder]—and these are the rarest and most powerful in the game. Once you defeat four Nightlords, you'll be able to buy a selection of these relics at the Small Jar Bazaar shop. Wylder Guardian Ironeye Raider Recluse Executor Duchess Revenant There are even more than these ones listed as well. You can get these randomly, but you can also get class-specific relics by getting Memory Fragments and completing Remembrances for each character. While these are really strong and what you should be utilising, there are other universally strong relic affixes, too. Some of these will appear at the Small Jar Bazaar, and you'll be able to purchase an especially strong relic after beating the final boss, with rune acquisition, reduced merchant prices, and a guaranteed Stonesword Key when you start your run. Until then, these are the ones I recommend: The problem with most relics in Nightreign is that they offer incredibly specific buffs that rely on you getting lucky during an expedition and finding weapons that fit them. For example, I could take \"Improved Roar & Breath attacks\", but will I actually find a Sacred Seal with those spells? It's a risk versus just taking one of the universally useful buffs above, especially early on. Once you complete the first Tricephalos expedition, you'll be able topurchase a gobletfor each character from the Small Jar Bazaar in the Roundtable Hold. Each of these says that it unlocks a new relic rite; what that actually means is that you can swap the relic colour combo for your Nightfarer. All you need to do is: If you complete the third Remembrance quest for each character (after the one that gives you a relic for them),you'll get a chalicewhich lets you change relic rites for one that has a white slot, allowing you to slot whatever relic you want into it. If a lot of your relics suck—which they will if you're anything like me—and you got the pointy end of the RNG stick, you can always sell them for Murk so you can work towards buying a fancy outfit for your character. Simply head to the relic rite table, cycle all the way to the right, and then sell them to the small jar there. Just be careful you don't sell anything good!

    "article_text": "Grab these valuable items so you can burn some extra bosses. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. FindingStonesword KeysinElden Ring Nightreignis a bit different to how you got them in the original game. You use these special items to unlock theEvergaolsdotted around Limveld, and since these are such a lucrative way of defeating bosses, you'll want to pick them up whenever you can. Luckily, there's a pretty much guaranteed way to get Stonesword Keys as you're cutting a path through forts and cathedrals, so you can grab them while ticking off other vital expedition tasks. All that said, here's how to get Stonesword Keys inElden RingNightreign. Your best bet for getting a Stonesword Key in Elden Ring Nightreign isopening a special kind of chestthat looks a little fancier than the regular wooden version. You can find these behind the altar in most cathedrals and at the top of forts, up the stairs behind where the knight boss usually stands. It's not 100% that these chests will give you a Stonesword Key, but it'll happen far more often than not. Once you defeat the final boss of Nightreign, you'll be able to purchase the Grand Burning Scene relic from the Small Jar Bazaar, which gives you a guaranteed Stonesword Key when you start an expedition—pretty strong stuff. As mentioned above, you canuse Stonesword Keys to open Evergaols, marked with the circular engraved symbol on the map. These are a pretty great way of farming bosses, since they always give you 10 or 20,000 runes as an optional reward based on the difficulty of the boss you fight. If you find the \"oldest Evergaol\" containing either an Ancient Dragon or the Death Rite Bird, you'll even be able to get a whopping 30,000 runes, though that fight will be a bit trickier.

    "article_text": "Locate the whetstone for Wylder's Remembrance mission. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you've stuck withElden Ring Nightreign's default character, Wylder, then you'll quickly fill his journal and unlock his Chapter 3 Remembrance mission, which throws you in at the deep end with what's called a personal objective. Speaking to Iron Menial, the Roundtable Hold's caretaker, you'll then have to find awhetstonein Limveld. You're given very little to go on, other than Iron Menial's advice to make your way tothemining tunnel, which is somewhat misleading considering there are multiple across Limveld. Don't worry though, I've found the exact location and item you're looking for, so you're not wasting your time searching caves instead of gathering vital upgrades and runes. First things first, though, like theGuardian Golempersonal objective, you can only find the whetstone when you're playing as the character in question (in this case, Wylder), and loading into any expedition from the Realm of Remembrance, accessed via the journal in the Roundtable Hold. You can find the whetstone at thebottom of the mineshaft marked with an orange banner icon on your map, lodged in rocks with a gold glow around it. For me, this was the mine in the bottom right corner of the map, though it could be random. Keep in mind that these tunnels have two entrances, and the whetstone is midway through, so it doesn't really matter which entrance you take. Mines are also dangerous to explore as it's easy to get trapped once the zone starts shrinking, so I recommend racing over to complete the objective as soon as you can. Remember that you can use spectral hawks to traverse the map quickly, and you can also view an underground map of Limveld's tunnels by pressing down on the D-pad on controller to make sure you don't get trapped.

    "article_text": "Don't let a bad UI hold you back from true power. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Fat rolling. It's the bane of any Souls player's existence—it's just too slow. By now, I think we've all been conditioned to avoid clogging up our equipment slots with unnecessary junk, but that's not a thing inElden Ring Nightreign. Despite copying the same UI almost one-to-one from the base game,FromSoftware's quirky multiplayer spinoff makes some drastic changes under the hood and forgets to let you know. Not only is equipment load no longer a thing—goodbye extra fast and slow dodge rolls, hello sweet, sweet medium—but Nightreign also introduces new loot tiers akin to a battle royale. If you're anything like me, you'd naturally assume that your goal is to just get one or two good weapons for your build, and that everything else you find of a lesser quality, or of a different weapon type, is useless. But that's not the case either: The end goal is to fill up all six of your weapon slots with passive buffs that improve your playstyle, even if you only actually use one of them in combat. For example, thebest Ironeye buildstacks as many items that improve ranged damage as possible, whether that passive is on a sword, seal, or a bow. Duchess benefits greatly from successive hit passives, like damage reduction, or extra damage while wielding two armaments (dual-wielding), and so on. If you want to know how much of a difference this makes, my first attempt against the final boss was a total blowout. I was Ironeye with zero weapons that boosted my ranged playstyle or inflicted the boss' weakness. That's just the luck of the draw, I guess. Compare this to my third attempt, where I had five weapons that boosted ranged damage by roughly 10-20% each, and, surprise, surprise, I came out the victor. All ofNightreign's Nightfarersare unique, so puzzle out their playstyle and hopefully RNG will give you the passives you want. You can toggle an overlay on the map to see what weapon types and ailments you can get from each location. For example, camps provide bows, ballistas and jar cannons from bow racks, and these ranged weapons most often have the ranged weapon damage passive. And before you ask, no, there's no way to hide equipment from your quick-slots; you really do need to scroll through all that (albeit passively helpful) junk if you're swapping between gear in combat.

    "article_text": "Every main boss, including the returning Dark Souls bosses. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Wondering whatNightreign bossesyou'll get to fight in the new game? Since hearing that a selection of Dark Souls bosses were making an appearance inElden Ring Nightreign, I was super excited to hop into an expedition and see who I'd come up against. Besides the eight main Nightlord bosses you can fight, I've also faced six bosses from all three Dark Souls games. Of course, outside of the Nightlord at the end, it's random who you'll get, but each expedition seems to draw from a smaller pool of night one and night two bosses, meaning that if you undertake certain expeditions, you're more likely to battle certain ones. Below, I've included all the Nightlords you can fight (including a \"secret\" one) and our list of night one and night two bosses broken down into their respective expeditions. There are eight Nightlords to fight in Nightreign. At first, you can only battle Gladius in the Tricephalos expedition, but once you defeat him, you'll unlock another six expeditions, each with their own Nightlord. After completing another three more, you'll get to fight Heolstor the Nightlord, Nightreign's true final boss. It's worth noting thatsome Nightlords have special invasion eventswhere they appear in a different expedition. So far we've seen these for Gnoster, Maris, and Libra. I've included difficulties for each boss below in case you want to prioritise getting four clears simply to unlock Heolster: A three-headed doggo who splits into three one-headed doggos throughout the fight. Gladius also has a sword he loves to swing and some fiery breath attacks. He isn't too hard, provided you can coordinate with your team and call out who's marked. A messed-up looking dragon with a giant jaw. Adel loves his charges and grab attacks, and summons a big lightning AoE. The key to beating him is honestly just learning to dodge his charges and staying away from him when he tries to grab you. If you get grabbed, poison damage can stagger him and save whoever's in his jaws. One of the two easiest bosses in Nightreign. Gnoster consists of a Moonlight-butterfly-esque moth and a big armoured poison bug. Halfway through the fight, they combine and the moth rides on the bug's head while firing magic projectiles. You'll want to bring ranged weapons to deal with the moth while avoiding the big bug until they combine—luckily he's kind of slow. Maris is the easiest boss in Nightreign once you learn how to deal with its gimmicks. It floats around in the air, so you'll want to bring a ranged weapon, but otherwise you just need to avoid the arms it summons out of the ground, use an ult on it when it starts to cast sleep (enough lightning damage can also work), and shoot the egg it lays midair before it hits the ground. A big basilisk-eyed goat man who loves to combine holy and madness incantations into a nightmare of endless AoEs. He also throws in some melee attacks with his big staff. Libra is honestly one of the harder bosses, partly due to his endless spells, but also because it's really hard to find a weapon that deals madness damage in Nightreign, so you'll struggle to apply his weakness. A centaur who charges frequently and jumps around a lot, firing off wind AoEs. In his second phase Fulghor grows a big poison arm that he sweeps around in wide arcs. Besides the final boss, I'd say Fulghor is perhaps the hardest you'll face; he's aggressive, hard to pin down in melee, and quite tanky. As you'd expect from a dragon, Caligo is absolutely massive, loves elemental breath attacks, and can be a pain to hit at times. The key to defeating the Miasma of Night is to stay near its head so you won't be clipped by its wings or claws. Once you cut a good chunk out of its health, Caligo flies away and channels icy winds, obscuring your vision. To survive this special attack, you need to follow the winds to head towards the dragon and hide behind the ice blocks around it. Bows are particularly helpful, as always in Nightreign. A Soul of Cinder-esque boss who has a lot of very horrible AoEs, including creating lava quakes along the ground after his slashes. His aggro is also very unpredictable because of the way he moves,and he has many attacks that will hit you even if you're behind him. Still, melee is recommended for this, along with tanky characters who can survive the full fight, though you might want to bring one Ironeye since he's still quite evasive with his skill. While there are lots of little bosses you can find in ruins, cathedrals, evergoals, and just about everywhere (most of which are just tougher enemies fromElden Ring), the big ones are those you fight at the end of each night. These seem to vary from expedition to expedition, drawing from a separate pool, so here's every night one and night two we've fought so far, broken down into their respective expedition: Expedition Night one Night two Tricephalos Demi-Human Queen and Demi-Human Swordmaster, Bell Bearing Hunter Fell Omen (can invade in other expeditions), Tree Sentinel/x2 Royal Cavalryman Gaping Jaw Wormface, Duke's Dear Freja, Gaping Dragon, Valiant Gargoyle Ancient Dragon, Crucible Knight and Golden Hippopotamus, Outland Commander (Lightning/Frostbite) Sentient Pest Battlefield Commander (Scarlet rot), Centipede Demon Draconic Tree Sentinel/x2 Royal Cavalryman, Dragonkin Soldier Augur Wormface, Grafted Monarch, Gaping Dragon Godskin Noble and Godskin Apostle, Full Grown Fallingstar Beast Equilibrious Beast Battlefield Commander (Scarlet rot), Tibia Mariner/Those Who Live in Death, Centipede Demon Crucible Knight and Golden Hippopotamus, Death Rite Bird, Godskin Noble and Godskin Apostle Darkdrift Knight Wormface, Gaping Dragon Outland Commander (Lightning/Frostbite), Nameless King Fissure in the Fog Duke's Dear Freja, Smelter Demon Draconic Tree Sentinel/x2 Royal Cavalryman, Godskin Noble and Godskin Apostle Night Aspect Night Cavalry Glaive and Night Cavalry Flail, Smelter Demon, Centipede Demon, Valiant Gargoyle, Demi-Human Queen and Demi-Human Swordmaster Great Wyrm (Magma Wyrm), Fell Omen, Dancer of the Boreal Valley, Nox Dragonkin Soldier, Ancient Dragon Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Forge a legendary weapon by tracking down the Special Smithing Table location. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Completing theShifting Earth: The Craterevent inElden Ring Nightreignis fairly challenging, but the reward is well worth it. If you delve into this mysterious volcano that appears in the north of Limveld, you'll find theSpecial Smithing Tableand be able toforge a legendary weapon, which is to say, upgrade any weapon into a legendary one. While you can claim named legendary weapons inElden RingNightreign from bosses, this is the only way to create a new, custom legendary, and so it's fairly desirable depending on the Nightlord you're facing. It's worth noting that the Shifting Earth: The Crater event will only last a few runs for you, whether you succeed or fail, so if you want to complete it and get the achievement, you should head down there sooner rather than later. Since the Shifting Earth events rotate fully (there are four overall) and then become random, it'll take a long time for this event to come back, but considering it's the first event for everyone, chances are you'll matchmake with other players who have it active on the map—at least at first—even after it ends for you. All said, here's how to complete the Shifting Earth: The Crater event, find the Special Smithing Table, and forge a legendary weapon. As mentioned in the pop-up you get when the first Shifting Earth: The Crater event begins, you need to find \"An ancient temple built to honour the smithing arts,\" which means tracking down the Special Smithing Table. This special location where you can turn any weapon into a legendary is mentioned in the Nightreign visual codex in the Roundtable Hold, but it doesn't mention that this table is the final goal of The Crater event. Delving into the crater is quite tricky, soI'd recommend doing this on day two of your expedition, especially as the night two boss location always seems to be just to the north of the crater when it's active on the map, meaning you'll be close to it when you're done. To complete the Shifting Earth: The Crater event, follow these steps: Do all that and you're ready to interact with the Special Smithing Table, complete the event, and even get an achievement for it. If you interact with the Special Smithing Table, you'll be given the option to upgrade one of the weapons in your inventory. This can be any rarity, but it's important to note you can only do thisonce per character,per expedition, so everyone in your squad can claim a legendary. Provided you have the Relic that gives you the necessary damage type on your starting weapon, this can be a great way of guaranteeing you get a legendary weapon that matches the Nightlord's weakness, since you can upgrade your starter weapon if you choose. Once done, use the spectral hawk tree just by the edge of the lava to escape the crater and save yourself a long and impossible climb back up.

Remember that passives from items are always active, whether the weapon is currently in your hand or not. Unsurprisingly, legendary weapons are also the hardest to find, especially if you don't know where to look. You can get legendary weapons as random drops from just about any source, though you'll have the highest chance of earning one frombosses. Specifically, in my experience, your best shot is the roaming world bosses—referred to as \"Great enemies\" in the game. Bosses in Shifting Earth events are also a good potential source; my team got multiple legendaries from the Fallingstar Beast in The Crater. You can alsoupgrade any weapon to legendary quality using the Special Smithing Tablein theShifting Earth: The Craterevent, though these won't be bespoke, unique items—just max stat versions of standard weapons. Marked by an ominous dragon head icon on the map, roaming bosses are well worth defeating on the second day, when you've powered up a little. They offer tons of runes when you beat them, as well as a good chance of higher-quality loot, including legendary weapons. Plus, there's plenty across the map, so you can do them back-to-back without much running—don't underestimate them, though. While Shifting Earth events are the best location to find legendary weapons in a run, you can't guarantee they'll spawn. These events only last a few runs (whether you win or lose), but there's a chance another member on your team will have one active, meaning you can join in too. With lots of bosses packed into a small area, they're great for finding legendary weapon drops. There are26 unique legendary weaponsinElden RingNightreign, which you can see below. This list doesn't include standard weapons, which can be upgraded to legendary tier, as these aren't hand-crafted items. What you'll no doubt notice is the absence of legendary shields, seals, and ranged weapons in general. Remember, though, weapon passives are always active even if they're sitting in your inventory. Legendary effects are slightly different, as these only apply if the weapon is in your hand, but being in your off-hand is good enough, so ranged characters still have plenty of useful options.

    "article_text": "A plague of locusts befalls the land; here's how to beat them and get your runes back. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Unquestionably the most annoying and harmful random event inElden Ring Nightreignis theplague of locuststhat can appear quite regularly once you've beaten most of the Nightlords. These pests steal your levels (yes, plural, as they can attack each player more than once) and fly away, and the only hint you're given is to \"find the enemy who is stealing your runes\". Not very helpful, is it? To save you precious time and levels, especially if you've been to thebest Elden Ring Nightreign rune farming spots, here's how to stop the locusts stealing your runes. To find the enemy stealing your runes during the locust plague event,follow the black clouds of bugs as they fly away, and they'll lead you to an invader boss (which I'll spoil below) that you'll then need to kill. The boss is almost invisible until you attack it, though its health bar will appear, so you'll know when you're in the right place. When you kill the boss, all thelevels they stole from you will be returned to you in runes, so you'll need to spend them to level back up—an easy detail to miss amongst all the chaos. As with the Fell Omen invasion, you'll also get a special buff for the rest of your run: Random hits against enemies have a chance to reward you with a great amount of runes. Unfortunately this event is random and can happen on either day one or two, because getting this buff at the start lets you reach level 15 very easily, which is a big advantage against any of theNightreign bossesand Nightlords. The enemy stealing your runes—an invading Sentient Pest—can sometimes be on the other side of the map, so you'll need to keep an eye out for more locust swarm clouds as you go. While the boss doesn't move, Limveld is far from flat, making it hard to consistently keep track of. This is also why I recommend dropping everything to complete this event right away, especially if you're on day two, as there's a risk the wall starts closing and the Sentient Pest could be outside the zone. If you're ever unsure where to head, stand still and look at the skyline, where you should see multiple clouds of locusts to reorient your pursuit. Thankfully, finding the Sentient Pest is the hard work. Unlike the expedition to hunt this Nightlord specially, you'll be fighting the massive moth on its own when it invades you, and it's relatively easy to take down.

Working outhow to unlock RevenantinElden Ring Nightreignisn't the easiest task, but you'll need to if you want to acquire the full roster ofNightfarersand try out her special necromancy-based playstyle. The Revenant is all about summoning slain enemies as allies, and she has a chance to do it any time she deals a killing blow. Since her health is minuscule, she's far better employed as a dedicated caster, supporting the rest of the team instead of getting stuck into melee. She can also summon one of three consistent guardians, known as her \"family\", with her skill, giving her a bit of leeway when there are no enemies to kill. If that sounds like your kind of playstyle, here's how to unlock Revenant inElden RingNightreign. To recruit Revenant,you'll first need tounlock Duchess, though don't worry—this process is pretty straightforward and basically involves speaking to the priestess in the Roundtable Hold after you defeat Gladius in the first expedition. Once done, here's what you need to do to unlock Revenant: Once defeated, you'll unlock Revenant and be able to pick her at the character selection altar. As mentioned, this Nightfarer has a chance to summon slain enemies to fight for her and also calls upon one of three \"Family\" to protect her.

Puzzling out how toupgrade weaponsinElden Ring Nightreignis a little confusing, especially as itsSmithing Stoneswork a little differently to how they did in the original game. You'll still have to track down this blacksmithing material, but you'll only need one of each kind to upgrade a weapon. Each armament also has a rarity now, which changes what stone you need to use. Besides the materials, you'll also need to find an anvil out in Limveld, and all the while you're doing this, night is closing in and you're frantically trying to gather as many runes as you can—it's a lot of admin to be honest. So here are the best Smithing Stone locations inElden RingNightreign, plus how the whole weapon upgrade system works. Though you can find Smithing Stone 1 and 2 randomly in Limveld, your best bet for getting them is either: You'll need an anvil to upgrade a weapon, but you can find one beside every merchant. There are four weapon rarities in Nightreign overall: And in terms of upgrades: The only way you can upgrade a rare into a legendary is through the Special Smithing Table in the Shifting Earth: The Crater event. Most legendary weapons are fixed, meaning you'll get them directly from bosses, rather than upgrading into them. Basically, if you want to upgrade your starting weapon into a rare before the Nightlord boss (to keep its affinity, for example), you'll need a Smithing Stone 1 and a Smithing Stone 2.

    "title": "PSA: Having trouble with Elden Ring Nightreign? Try Ironeye",
    "article_text": "In a world where Nightlord bosses are constantly on the move, the bow is king. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I remember the first time I switched to Ironeye. I'd been trundling along as Raider, enjoying my ability to headbutt everyone and create a big stupid rock whose chief purpose seems to be breaking the game. It was a fun time, but each Nightlord fight felt increasingly untenable; I'd chase them around the arena, and every time I was about to land a hit, they'd up and move again. Even when I was able to get into melee, the risk didn't feel worth it relative to the damage I was doing. It'd be a different story ifElden Ring Nightreignhad Sekiro's endless sprint stamina, but alas, chasing each Nightlord is going to have you huffing and puffing, barely able to land an attack by the time you reach them. Added to that, my big, slow strength weapons were terrible at reviving my fallen comrades due to the large stamina cost of attacks. But then I tried Ironeye. In hindsight, it's kind of obvious—in a game where most of the Nightlord bosses are ridiculously mobile or literally fly out of melee reach, archery is king. There are a few different reasons why bows are so good in Nightreign: While ranged spellcaster, Recluse, suffers from a lack of FP regen when spellcasting, unless you can keep her affinity residue rotation going the whole time, Ironeye can fire infinite arrows. This often makes him the most consistent damage dealer in 90% of Nightlord bosses. What's more, he doesn't have to take the risk of getting super close the same way melee fighters do. To be honest, even if you don't play Ironeye, don't sleep on ranged weapons, especially if you're a high-dex character like Duchess or Executor. Either of those characters could do damage with a bow scaling-wise, or just carry one around for clutch revives at range. But his bow isn't the only thing that makes Ironeye so good. He has an incredibly versatile kit of abilities. He can use his Marking skill to dash forward, slashing an enemy, and opening them up to additional damage from youandyour entire team. Where this ability really shines, though, is when you use it as a dodge thanks to its generous invincibility-frames. Does this Nightlord have a tricky attack you struggle with? Simply use Marking and dash through them, Marking them for extra damage at the same time. In fact, you don't even have to hit an enemy with it to gain the i-frames, so use it literally whenever you need a short window of invincibility. It also has a very fast cooldown, which can be further improved with relics. On top of that, Ironeye's ultimate art, Single Shot, has a lot of utility, firing a giant arrow which deals stagger damage and kills most small enemies in an AoE around it. If you've got a Duchess in your party, it's a fantastic skill to Restage and repeat, and because Ironeye hits so often with his bow, your uptime on the art is quite speedy. Plus, its long animation is actually a good thing, since you're invincible while casting any ultimate art. This outpouring of love for Ironeye and his endless arrows isn't to say that he's perfect for every single Nightlord—there are definitely a couple where having melee helps—but since Ironeye has high-dex, there's also no reason you can't run him with daggers, a twinblade, or a rapier, too. The only sad thing about playing Ironeye is that there's only one legendary bow in Nightreign, and it happens to be a great bow with a slow draw. Whatever you use, as soon as you try Ironeye, you'll quickly realise how much of a massive advantage ranged weapons have against many of the Nightreign's hardest bosses.

    "article_text": "Clad your Nightfarers in a range of classic Souls outfits. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The first question many people will undoubtedly have loading upElden Ring Nightreignis: where are theDark Souls outfits? FromSoft showed off these special Souls cosmetics during the overview trailer for the game, where we got to see Solaire, the Faraam set, and Ringfinger Leonhard. The good news is that there are lots more, with two Dark Souls outfits for every character. The bad news is that they are pretty time-consuming to unlock, and you'll have to complete a big chunk of the game's content and overcome its myriad challenges—chief among them being most of theElden RingNightreign bosses. So we better get started; here's how to unlock the Nightreign Dark Souls outfits, plus a gallery with them all down below and some text explaining which each one is in case you can't puzzle them all out. To unlock the Dark Souls outfits for every character in Elden Ring Nightreign, you'll first have to unlock the ability to change appearance and thenyou need to finish the game. That is to say: When you return to the Roundtable Hold, this will unlock the Dark Souls outfits for purchase at the change garb mirror. As mentioned, each character has two Dark Souls outfits each (all of which you can see in the gallery below) and they cost 7,500 Murk each, which is cheaper than the standard outfits.

    "title": "Best Elden Ring Nightreign team compositions for every Nightlord",
    "article_text": "Assemble the best team comps to give the Nightlords hell. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. One of the most fun elements ofElden Ring Nightreignis getting to slay out alongside your friends, and surprisingly, the difficulty isn't toned down even with three of you. In fact, even the first expedition is a massive hurdle. To make your life easier in Limveld, you'll want to put together thebest team compositions. Whether you're playing with randoms or a pre-made team of your mates, you'll have the opportunity to pick yourNightfarersbefore entering the expedition. Depending on who'll be fighting alongside you, it might be wise to change things up a bit, as it's not just about picking the best Nightfarers in theElden Ring Nightreign tier list. Nightreign gives you plenty of options and freedom when it comes to creating team compositions. There are eight characters to choose from, and you can even stack multiple of the same Nightfarer if you're playingNightreign multiplayer—which is very much recommended. Each character brings something unique to the team, but you'd be surprised just how strong some stacking teams can be. Having beaten almostevery boss in Elden Ring Nightreign, here are the best team compositions we've used: The nuclear team comp, made up of Wylder, Ironeye, and Duchess, is without a doubt one of the most fun setups, especially if you're a fan of big damage numbers. The idea is that Ironeye marks a target to increase the damage they take, and then ults in tandem with Wylder for a massive spike of damage. The key is that Duchess can then use Restage to repeat this already absurd blast. Chances are, the target will also get staggered from both ults, so you can sometimes get a critical hit in for even more damage. Outside of this synergy, all three characters are strong in their own right, with a good mix of melee and ranged damage, especially if you run Duchess with a bow as backup. You'll be able to hold your own just fine while you wait for your ultimates to recharge. Very similar to the previous team, this setup simply sees two of the same burst-DPS ultimates paired with Duchess, whether that's two Wylders or two Ironeyes. The swordsman's ultimate does more burst damage, but the archer can mark to increase everyone's damage for a short duration. As for how you decide which duo to pick, that largely depends on the Nightlord you're fighting. While Wylder is great for fighting less mobile bosses like Libra in the Equilibrious Beast expedition, Ironeye's range advantage makes him a much better pick for the likes of Maris in the Augur expedition, or Fulghor in the Darkdrift Knight. If you're looking for a safe melee-focused team, then you can't go wrong with a Raider, Executor, and either Guardian or Wylder. Raider is a tank with high stun potential, opening the door for critical hit builds that give your team plenty of breathing room. Likewise, Guardian is also a very tanky and defensive character, able to boost the defences of allies and eat up hits with his enhanced block. The only issue is his general lack of damage, so you could swap him for Wylder, who's the perfect all-rounder. The last spot belongs to Executor, a hard-to-master melee fighter that excels in dishing out ailments for massive damage. However, he can also be surprisingly tanky thanks to his beast form. Magic isn't quite as powerful and easy-to-use as it was in the base game, but this team lets you get close to that. Recluse is the driving force behind this team, using her Magic Cocktail skill to absorb different affinity residues for potentially devastating results with the right combination of elements. However, it's not easy to cover all the affinities by yourself, so that's where your allies can help. Using his relic that adds a flaming follow-up attack to his grappling hook, Wylder can frequently apply fire to enemies for Recluse to absorb. Plus, he's also a versatile melee fighter who can help keep the attention away from Recluse. The last slot is flexible depending on the situation and your skill level. If you need more protection, then Raider is a great pick, soaking up more of the boss's attention and potentially staggering them. This stagger also gives Recluse more opportunities to use slower AoE spells that enemies would often otherwise dodge. However, a skilled Revenant can be just as effective, despite her tiny health bar. Revenant can call forth a variety of spirits, like the tanky Sebastian, who can fill in for Raider while she flings spells like Recluse. Ahh, Ironeye. My beloved archer really is just the best of the bunch. His Marking skill can be used for its intended purpose—tagging an enemy so they take bonus damage—but also to dodge attacks. And when I say \"attacks\", I mean it in the most general sense. Ironeye is invincible while dodging, so you can avoid anything from a punch all the way up to a sheet of ice that would otherwise pretty much one-hit-kill you. Paired with his fantastic ultimate, range advantage against many bosses, and strong build potential, Ironeye is the perfect Nightfarer. So what's better than one Ironeye? Three, of course. You can chip away at bosses from a distance while surviving everything thrown your way once you get the hang of dodging with the Marking skill.

    "article_text": "Squad up to massively improve your chances of success in Limveld, or go rogue and play solo. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Although the base game had enjoyable enough multiplayer elements,Elden Ring Nightreign's whole shtick is that it'smultiplayerco-op. You'll team up with two other players and, trust me, you'll need it. Nightreign is far from a walk in the park, even with a coordinated team. Despite multiplayer being, y'know, the entire focus of the game, it's surprisingly confusing how it all works. Below, I'll go over how you can join friends inElden RingNightreign, what you can and can't do together, and the lowdown on crossplay support. To play with friends in Nightreign, you need to: At least right now, you can't go on expeditions with just two players. If you and a friend are looking to play together, then you'll also have a random player on board to fill the final slot. It's solos, trios, or a double and a tag-along. Take a look at thebest Elden Ring Nightreign team compositionsto set yourself up for success against the Nightlords. If you're running into issues, there are a number of odd matchmaking rules that are worth understanding, as you're not told them in-game: Unfortunately,Elden Ring Nightreign doesn't have crossplaysupport, meaning you won't be able to play cross-platform. Given the multiplayer focus of Nightreign, it's honestly a baffling decision for the longevity of the game, so hopefully it will be added in the future. For now, though, you're limited to just the players on your platform, including your friends. Nightreign does have cross-region play though, which seems to be disabled by default. This opens up the matchmaking parameters to allow players from further afield to join your expeditions. It could speed up your matchmaking at times, but chances are it'll also be more laggy depending on the region your allies are in. You've no doubt noticed the other options in the multiplayer menu, particularly the password and group password system. If you're playing casually with friends, then you're safe to ignore these—they sound more useful for content creators and events. Essentially, you can set a multiplayer password that will matchmake you with other players also using the same password. Enter any code in this box, and have other players do the same, and it will limit the search to just those people. You can even change the number of players allowed to join the lobby through this method—selecting two players will fill the remaining position with a random player not using a password. Again, if you want to play with people you already know, then just invite them directly. Group passwords are slightly different, and you might want to use this if you have a large group of friends wanting to share the experience. By using a group password, you can have up to five lobbies (whether solos, duos, or trios) linked together so you're more likely to see stuff like phantoms from other players using the same group password. You can't bypass the three-person expedition limit, but you'll at least get to see glimpses of what your other buddies are up to occasionally. If you're looking for a more traditional Souls experience, then you can also play Nightreign solo. To do this, just head to the multiplayer tab at the expedition table as you would to invite friends, butswitch the option at the bottom of the menu from multiplayer to solo. You can then select any expedition and load into it without searching for allies. You'd think that selecting an expedition would naturally throw you in solo, but this automatically queues you instead—multiplayer is very much the intended way to play Nightreign. By tweaking the setting above, you're effectively disabling the automatic matchmaking. Beware that Nightreign is an even more challenging experience alone than it is with others.

    "title": "Helldivers 2 Chinese community valiantly holds the line to save 'Super China,' then flogs Arrowhead with negative Steam reviews for capping liberty at 99.9783%",
    "article_text": "There's possibly been a misunderstanding. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheHelldivers 2community proves once again that the sun never sets on Super Earth. In the wake of the Illuminate's ghastly invasion of our home planet, divers have spent a week trying and failing to save its megacities from annihilation. All except one. While it's been an exciting two weeks to play Helldivers 2, the Second Galactic War could not be going worse right now. Eagleopolis and York Supreme have fallen, and for a while, it looked as if resources were spread too thin to outpace the invading forces on the cities that remain. Then the unexpected happened: A huge wave of reinforcements, believed to be the concentrated efforts of Chinese players, kept pushing back the Illuminates at Equality-on-Sea (a Super Earth city located roughly where actual Shanghai is), with the city's control reportedly dropping as low as 20% before fighting back up to 50% during Asia's active hours. Chinese Helldivers have continued to spread democracy so hard that, this morning, the city's control meter sat at a whopping99.9783%. It was atouching moment of international unity, with Chinese players showing up on the Helldivers subreddit to swap war stories as their English-speaking brothers-in-arms thanked them for holding the line. Unfortunately, things have taken an unusual turn in the last 12 hours. Many were disappointed to find out Equality-on-Sea's control meter topped out at 99.9783% despite the huge push from players. Total control was impossible, which has led to some players believing Arrowhead won't allow the planet to be totally liberated because it doesn't suit its story. The backlash has even led to an influx of over 3,000 negative reviews on Steam:Helldivers 2 currently sits at a \"Mixed\"recent reviews rating, with many reviews coming from Chinese accounts referencing the 99.9783% cap. The whole thing appears to be a misunderstanding, possibly exacerbated by poorly explained mechanics and bad translation. As many have pointed out, Equality-on-Sea cannot be fully liberated because, storywise, it's still under constant invasion by the Illuminate Overships visible from orbit. So while the community has kicked the squids back as far as they can go, they're not totally gone by design. The mini-review bomb (not entirely driven by the EoS debacle, mind you, as I saw plenty of recent reviews complaining about bugs) has eroded the good vibes. Some jerks are getting nasty about the whole thing, as you'd predict. Meanwhile, some self-proclaimed Chinese divers are trying to explain why they feel cheated. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"[The Equality-On-Sea defense campaign] has drawn a lot of attention in the Chinese gaming communities and even outside of the gaming community due to the passion of the Chinese Helldivers, who are now proudly fighting side by side with helldivers coming from everywhere including the US and European countries despite IRL political differences,\" wrote Reddit userValkyrie_Yukikaze. \"However, as the campaign has drawn in a lot of attention, there is an influx of new players who did not fully understand the game, who only care about defending the EoS until the final victories. Such excitement did not [go over] well when they found out that EoS can't be completely retaken as it is a defense campaign to finish off the Illuminate invasion fleet. Add on to that, the Chinese translation of the game on the defense percentage makes it seem like the city can be completely taken back from the invasion, which is certainly not helping.\" This is just one view on the matter, but that all sounds pretty reasonable to me. I know a few million English-speaking Helldiverswho'd be enormously pissedif they believed a weeklong battle had amounted to a rugpull—a review bomb would just be their opening salvo. Valkyrie_Yukikaze went on to add that they believe Chinese players are also miffed because it appears as if Arrowhead is playing favorites with its megacities, wanting all of them to fall except for Prosperity City, Super Earth's capital, which just happens to be located in Arrowhead's home country of Sweden. To be clear: This is pretty obviously true. The capital city would be the natural climax for this chapter of Helldivers 2's ongoing story, though Arrowhead has been known to change course based on community action. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Morgan has been writing for PC Gamer since 2018, first as a freelancer and currently as a staff writer.

    "title": "This Brazilian roguelike is a 'brutal test against history's oppressors' where you can battle the perpetrators of a 19th century atrocity with AoE knife magic",
    "article_text": "Hell Clock mixes a little Path of Exile and a pinch of Hades for an unholy take on a dark chapter of Brazil's history. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Hell Clock is a roguelike that's aiming to pack a Path of Exile league's worth of build progression into a minutes-long run. It's a compelling pitch, and based on the sheer density of unlockable, upgradeable mechanics and systems for carving through undead hordes I found in my time with a preview build, it's making an admirable effort. But when I looked at the game'sSteam page, it was the premise that grabbed me. Hell Clock calls itself \"a brutal test against history's oppressors,\" where you'll \"face the demons of Brazil's dark past, present, and future.\" It's a dark fantasy retelling of the late 19th century War of Canudos, where the military forces of the newly-formed Brazilian Republic killed as many as 25,000 inhabitants of the backcountry community in its effort to consolidate control in the wake of slavery's abolition and an overthrown monarchy. According to a press release, the War of Canudos is \"deeply personal and important\" to the staff of Hell Clock's Brazilian development studio, Rogue Snail. It's heavy stuff, even when the game reimagines the massacre as a \"secret battle between Heaven and Hell,\" where the Republic military commanders and their wealthy supporters have unleashed an undead horde with their atrocities. It works better than you might expect: After blasting apart a hellish merchant boss who'd declared that \"the law was on his side,\" player character Pajeú stood over his corpse and said in righteous Brazilian Portuguese that \"law is not justice,\" as many have been \"enslaved and exploited by the laws of men.\" And then I went into the next room and exploded four dozen zombies with an enchanted revolver and a regenerating spray of magic AOE knives. That hits, for me. As for how all that zombie slaying plays, Hell Clock handles fast and bloody. After equipping a selection of abilities at the start of a run, my goal is to carve through as many floors of zombies and miscellaneous hellspawn as possible before the time on my cursed pocketwatch runs out and I'm ripped back to the hub. My ability loadout of choice saw me shooting through zombies with a fan-shaped split shot from my revolver. For enemies that got close, I had a set of regenerating knives that automatically launch at approaching foes. As I descended through waves of undead, I found a relic that increased my movement speed with every knife that hit an enemy, turning my runs into mad sprints of bullets and flying razorblades. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Those relics are one of the many upgradeable progression layers that revealed themselves across my runs. Pajeú has unlockable ability sets, a passive skill tree, ability-modifying relics with upgradeable stats, randomized blessings that you gather with each level-up during a run, and more. It's a dense web of buildcrafting options, and I'm eager to see the full extent. Hell Clockreleases on June 18.

    "article_text": "Must pop. Must bust. Or else I'm dust. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It was a heavy loss in games journalism when Game Informer got kicked to the curblast fall, but it got over its own death pretty quickly when game dev and blockchain company Gunzilla financedits resurrectionin March. A few projects were announced back then, including a return to print—but if you want to reminisce about the days when Game Informer was hot off the presses, its archive just got updated with its entire backlog of physical issues. It's free to view if you sign up for an account on the site, and goes all the way back to 1991.A blog postannouncing the additions from editor-in-chief Matt Miller said: \"In the coming months, we plan to surface specific legacy articles we believe are worth exploring. In the meantime, enjoy this new level of free access to the rich history of gaming we’ve covered over the last 34 years.\" The post notes it took some help from the Video Game History Foundation, Retromags, and one dedicated fan in particular: bogusfrank, \"whose efforts to track down issues and preserve gaming magazine history now help us access our own company’s history and share it with all of you.\" I doubt fans would have let these issues truly go lost, but having them on display in this free and accessible format is the best case scenario. After digging around in the archive a bit, I must say it's a great bird's eye view of changing aesthetics for videogames and print journalism in general. Recent issues' sleek, simple graphics are kind of a hilarious contrast to the garish color schemes and explosive cover arts of the '90s and early aughts. I especially love those old ads and box arts so proud of their primitive 3D character model renders that they'd throw them up front and center, seemingly certain it wouldn't look like someone dropped their GI Joe in a bonfire a few years later. I even stumbled on the classic ad for Akklaim's Bust-A-Move 2: Arcade Edition, which implies the game is some sort of Clockwork Orange nightmare scenario. \"Can't stop. Must pop. Must bust,\" it reads. Am I supposed to want to be the guy saying that? There's also lots of valuable history and a rare sense of exhaustive preservation in the archive, so that's fun too I guess.

    "title": "4 years after being delisted, Lost Planet 2 finally got a Steam update to remove Games for Windows Live—but it also removed online multiplayer and blew up everyone's saves",
    "article_text": "Progress? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Lost Planet 2, Capcom's sci-fi third-person shooter that's a little like space Monster Hunter with mechs, massive aliens, and sweet, sweetT-ENG, has spent years in apurgatory of neglect. As one of the countless games left in a state of disrepair after Microsoft discontinued support for its universally despised Games for Windows Live, Lost Planet 2 wasmade unavailable for purchaseon Steam in 2021 so that Capcom could \"investigate the matter.\" Yesterday, almost four years later, Lost Planet 2 received an update on Steam that finally exorcised the lingering curse of Games for Windows Live. Unfortunately, the update also broke online multiplayer and wiped out local save files for anyone who still had it installed. Microsoft released Games for Windows Live in 2007 as an early attempt to offer a combined multiplayer service and games distribution platform for PC games by building off the Xbox Live ecosystem. To put it generously, GFWL sucked and was bad, forcing the players of afflicted games to contend with a clunky Windows Vista-era user interface well into the 2010s and beyond. As developers and publishers abandoned or replaced GFWL in favor of alternatives like the now-ubiquitous Steamworks, Microsoft started deprecating support in 2013 the closure of its GFWL PC Marketplace. While Microsoft never officially killed GFWL for good, itsofficial stanceis that it will \"no longer provide customer support for Games for Windows Live.\" Not all games that shipped with GFWL integration were lucky enough for their developers to invest the time to properly remove it, leaving them with varying degrees of functionality as the service continued to degrade. In the case of Lost Planet 2, lingering GFWL detritus left it andother Capcom games of the erawith broken installs, keeping the game from running properly as it tries and fails to install GFWL from a software repo that Microsoft no longer maintains. Even after it was delisted on Steam, however, players who already owned the gamemanaged to find workaroundsto get it running, but even games with beloved multiplayer modes don't tend to fare well when nobody can buy it and every installation is busted by default. So when a Steam update appeared unannounced, remaining Lost Planet 2 diehards celebrated the discovery that GFWL had, at long last, been removed. That celebration only lasted as long as it took those players to realize that the monkey paw had curled: GFWL was gone, but LP2's online multiplayer had been removed with it, and everyone's local saves had all been obliterated. \"Well, it was a step in some kind of direction,\"one usersaid on the Steam discussion forum. \"Not sure if it was the right direction, though.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Guides have already materialized with instructions forvoluntarily downgrading LP2torestoreGFWL and online multiplayer, which all feels like the punchline to some greater, cosmic joke.Some players are optimisticthat, because LP2 still hasn't been returned to Steam listings, it means Capcom's still working on an eventual Steamworks update. If nothing else, I admire that they're still able to hope. My dreams are more sensible: I just want to fight an akrid in Monster Hunter at this point.

    "article_text": "Season of Discovery servers aren't shutting down any time soon, but the team is moving on. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Season of Discovery is an odd one. It's an offshoot of WoW Classic—a recreation of World of Warcraft circa 2006—which soups it up with all sorts of new build options, raids, legendary weapons, andwild PvP events. For fans, it's been like peering into an alternate reality where WoW stuck to its guns and never reinvented itself with the times. Well, show's over, buddy: Blizzardannouncedthis week in a blog post that there's no more big seasonal updates on the way. While the SoD servers aren't closing down for the time being, there's a more substantial project in the works that needs the team's attention. The blog post from Aggrend reads: \"We need to make sure we’re spending our time where it will make the most impact on the long-term future of WoW Classic … we hope to see the game mode continue to operate similar to WoW Classic Era for many months (if not years) to come.\" In the post, Aggrend explained that running Season of Discovery for as long as they did was a huge risk that paid off. It was always intended to be time-limited, and the last raid tier was a \"major unrealized dream\" the team \"couldn't let go of.\" I always wondered if Season of Discovery would actually end. Back when it was barely a twinkle in anyone's eye, it had people clamoring for a full-onClassic Plus: an OSRS-style alternate game version which would receive updates parallel with modern World of Warcraft indefinitely. It's hard to say if that's exactly what Blizzard's cooking right now, but Aggrend's post seems to imply it's working on something a little more substantial and future-proof. \"We have big plans and big ambitions for this type of 'found photographs' content set in the original world of Azeroth,\" the post says. \"We want to set ourselves up for success by taking the time we need to get in the proverbial kitchen and 'cook,' iterate on, and shape our ideas and lessons learned from Season of Discovery into something truly exciting.\" Until that next project \"in the original WoW design space\" comes to light, Season of Discovery players aren't being hung out to dry, at least. If you cleared Balnazzar in the last raid tier, you get a free level boost in Mists of Pandaria Classic, which is set to releasein July; though on Bluesky, Aggrend did clarify that transferring off of a SoD server to another game versionwon't be possible. And if you're more of a purist, you're welcome to join me in dying repeatedly on the Hardcore servers.

War Sails, theMount and Blade 2: Bannerlordexpansion announced in March, has been delayed.

    "title": "Warhammer's latest shiny CG trailer somehow makes space marine shoulder pads even bigger",
    "article_text": "In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only neck pain. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When it comes to shoulder pads, Warhammer 40,000 has always been hard to beat. The denizens of Games Workshop's grimdark galaxy routinely wear pauldrons so massive they'd make Prince Arthas quiver in his boots. In the recent Space Marine 2 you could practically feel the weight of them on Titus as he heaved his beefy arms around. And yet… I thought the peak had been reached. That the maximum size for upper-body accessories had been achieved, never to be surpassed. How wrong I was. The trailer for the upcoming new edition of the Horus Heresy tabletop wargame is full of lovely, evocative moments, from a servo skull being obliterated by a plasma weapon to legendary Custodes warrior Valdor grimly steeling himself for \"a war that may never end\". But its best reveal is the arrival of space marines in Saturnine-pattern terminator armour, towering warriors that achieve the seemingly impossible feat of looking scary while being at least 40% shoulder by weight. I mean, my God, justlookat those pads. Absolutefilth. The Horus Heresy range is a bit of a nostalgia-fest in general, and this design actually harks back to the original design for terminator armour, back when Warhammer 40,000 miniatures were a bit more charmingly absurd. But in line with modern space marine aesthetics, these guys are bigger and chunkier than their ancestors—with even more imposing pauldrons. But then! Just when you think you've seen as big a shoulder pad as your heart can handle, who's this looming out of the fog of the battlefield? A Saturninedreadnought—a five meter tall mech with pauldrons so large he could be smuggling another couple of space marines under each one! The mind races. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For those more interested in what to actually expect from this new edition than advances in shoulder pad technology: it's launching with a new boxed set featuring said terminators and dreadnought, and seems like a fairly light touch update rather than a major overhaul. Existing armies should port over pretty seamlessly—though there will now be far fewer restrictions on army building, making it easier to put together more themed forces (like, say, a tank company) and even to combine multiple factions together. For more details, including an in-depth look at what comes in the new box, Games Workshop's gathered all the links together over on itsWarhammer Communitysite.

    "title": "Manor Lords meets Total War in web3 strategy game BLOCKLORDS",
    "article_text": "Sponsored by MetaKing Studios The web3 strategy game has just been updated with a big new battle system. Ahhh, the swish of a scythe to gather the cut the grown crop, the hammering of wood as new abodes rise up in your burgeoning fiefdom, the cheery barks of workers as you assign them labour; Historically themed strategy games are one of the most enduring genres in PC gaming—from the isometric charms of Age of Empires through to ambitious modern indies like Manor Lords and Banished—and now developer MetaKing Studios is marching the genre to that wildest of frontiers, web3, with its new MMO strategy gameBLOCKLORDS. Set in a medieval world of feudal kingdoms, lords, heroes, and town management, on a macro level BLOCKLORDS resembles a grand strategy game, presenting you with a vast world map from which you can plot your next move. Start cross-region trade, suss out your neighbours, and get a feel for who your friends and foes might be. Zoom in on your kingdom (or, initially, village), and you're presented with a picturesque town management view, from which you get to build out your village in real time, plotting farmland, optimising yields, and dealing with world events as they pop up. 'But what about war,'we hear you shout with your sword raised above your head. Well, that's what we're here to talk about, because a battle system has just been added into BLOCKLORDS, along with a dedicated battle season to motivate players to test their mettle against foes. Experiment with formations, perform flanking maneuvers, and use the terrain to your advantage as you lead your troops onto real-time battlefields. Even though the battle system is in its early stages, it clearly isn't some auto-resolve clicker type deal, but a tactically rich experience reminiscent of Total War. A team of gamers itself, MetaKing is aware of the wariness surrounding web3, and is drawing its inspiration from the likes of Crusader Kings and Age of Empires rather than some of the wild-west practices of web3. \"We get it. Over the past year especially, we’ve seen countless examples of teams whose core game loops, tokenomic structures, and asset distribution focus only on short-term adoption and extracting as much value from players as possible,\" says the developer. \"There’s nothing more important to us than creating a fun and accessible experience that will not only stand the test of time, but empower players by giving them full ownership of their assets.\" In short, that means that the hero you grow and the land you ownare all stuff you own on the blockchain, not just in-game. BLOCKLORD's game world will shift and evolve based on player decisions too. So what does that mean, exactly? It means that the economy is player-driven, so you can, for instance, rise to the status of Lord, then take a tithe in the game's currency from other players who use your land for farming, battle, and other feudal activities. Or you can… With a battle system and hero upgrades now implemented, BLOCKLORDS achieves a new milestone in strategic depth, adding the layer that battlefield commanders have been waiting for. So if your ideas of medieval rulership involve the sword as much as the sickle, and you're ready to rule in times of war as well as peace, now's the perfect time to raise your banner and try out BLOCKLORDS, which you cangrab for free now on Epic Games Store. You can alsokeep up with the game on its X channel. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "That's one way to save on heating bills this winter. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm not going to pretend my home office was ever tidy but since joining the hardware team, my far-from-spacious Micke desk from Ikea has been besieged. Even something as straightforward and necessary as upgrading my desktop setup for work has only served to highlight just how little space I've got to play with—mind, all of my Miku Hatsune figures probably don't help the space equation, but they really are non-negotiable. If some out-there tech maker was to, say, rock up with a radically space-saving setup, I'd be all ears. Well, the latest project fromYouTuber Basically Homelesshas mined a space-saving solution from somewhere you'd find in almost every PC gaming setup—namely,the chair(viaHackaday). But this project doesn't just slot a Raspberry Pi behind the headrest and call it a day; the goal was a largely invisible, \"no compromises setup\" with an allowance for only one trailing wire. Using the C7 Max premium ergo office chairfrom FlexiSpotas a base for the PC's unlikely case, the tech creator got to work sourcing desktop-grade parts small enough to fitsomewhereinside. Drilling holes throughout the wheel base, not to mention feeding the power cable through in such a way that it wouldn't immediately get snarled up by the chair's castors, was arguably the easy part. Beyond simply using small form factor parts, the tech creator also had to figure outwherethe parts were going to even fit. After someintenseTetris-ing, the parts found their home right under the seat. 50 mm aluminium spacers support the wooden base of the seat, while allowing for a very narrow amount of space below for anAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DCPU, a low-profileNvidia GeForce RTX 4060GPU flipped sideways, and 64 GB of DDR5 RAM. But rather than leave this hefty hardware exposed, the maker instead spentmonths3D modelling and printing a bespoke housing for it. You can download the files for it fromthe free tier of the creator's Patreonif you also happen to want to make your own FlexiSpot C7 Max stealth PC. The (far from) final assemblage of the project just underlines how niche and impractical it is for most—especially when the YouTuber's heavily-usedAsusGPU decides not to power on properly, and the chair had to be pried apart to swap it out. Anyway, trials and tribulations aside, the PC chair does eventually power on fully, ensuring toasty buns for every gamer that perches upon its reasonably powerful seat.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Elden Ring Nightreignwon't be out for a few more hours—3 pm PT, 6 pm ET, or your local equivalent, here's the full rundown of all theNightreign launch times—but the first patch is here. Which is to say, the patch notes are up on theBandai Namco website, along with a heads-up that the PC version of the game may suffer frame rate drops on some setups. The patch notes forElden RingNightreign version 1.01 are, well, vague: It's not much to go on—hopefully we'll have a clearer picture of what \"improved handling\" and \"balance adjustments\" mean fairly soon. What's more of note for now, though, is the warning about possible issues with the PC version of the game. First things first, if you have trouble getting Elden Ring Nightreign to start at all, be sure to verify the game files on Steam. We probably all know how to do that but just in case, right-click on Elden Ring Nightreign in your Steam library, then select \"Properties,\" followed by \"Installed files,\" and then \"Verify integrity of game files.\" Give it a few minutes to do its thing, Steam may have to re-download some files—go make a coffee or something. This is standard operating procedure for troublesome PC games on Steam, but Bandai brought it up in the patch notes, so I'm bringing it up here. A potentially bigger issue lies in the game's graphical performance. \"We have confirmed that some PC configurations using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops,\" the patch notes say. \"We are currently investigating the cause. In the meantime, If you experience significant frame rate drops, you may be able to resolve it by setting the graphics settings from the default 'High' to 'Medium' or 'Low' and lowering the screen resolution, as well as installing the latest drivers for your graphics card.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

McAfee has begun bundling its newScam Detectorfeature into all its coreantivirusplans. The tool claims to identify scams before they cause harm and offers real-time scanning of text, email, and video content. The move seems to be in response to the rising threat of AI-driven scams, but it raises questions about whether users need to pay for this kind of protection when several free and similar options exist. McAfee says its tool boasts 99% accuracy for text-based threats and claims to detect deepfakes fromYouTubeand TikTok with 96% accuracy. Built with mobile use in mind, it supports apps such asWhatsApp, Messenger, Gmail, and more, being able to scan Android SMS automatically and allows manual scans on iPhones. Its settings allow users to adjust sensitivity, and it includes on-demand checks by uploading messages or screenshots. “The reality is that the volume, speed, and sophistication of today’s AI-driven scams have become a drain on people’s time, energy, and finance,” said Craig Boundy, CEO of McAfee Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “By including text, email, and video scam detection within all core McAfee plans, we’re helping to democratize scam protection and empowering people to take control over their digital lives.” However, in order to get access, you must pay for a McAfee antivirus subscription plan, raising the question of whether Scam Detector alone justifies paying for a full security suite - particularly with credible free tools available. One such free tool is Bitdefender’sScamio, achatbotavailable on Discord. This feature is not plan-locked like McAfee; it is completely free and allows users to scan links, texts, screenshots, and even QR codes for scam detection. The tool uses AI to interpret both context and language, but does not include video deepfake detection. Nevertheless, it is accessible and effective for everyday threats. Google has also rolled out anAI-based scam detector, but only for Pixel phones and only in beta. It scans audio from incoming calls and alerts users in real time if it identifies typical scam language. Like McAfee, Norton, another heavyweight in the antivirus space, integrates itsGenie Scam Protectioninto its plans, though it focuses on identifying scam language rather than just malicious URLs. Users also have to subscribe to get full access to its coverage across texts, calls, emails, and websites. McAfee’s Scam Detector might enhance the company’s standing among the best antivirus providers, but its positioning as a plan-exclusive feature makes it less accessible than alternatives like Scamio.

First up, we havethe declarationthat \"it's all in the details\", accompanied by a close-up of what seems to be a detail on the back of the handset.

We're assuming that's now been achieved, because Nothing itself has said the handsetwill launch in July. No doubt, there are more official teasers and unofficial rumors about the phone to come between now and then.

    "title": "I used Veo 3 to recreate the first YouTube video, and the results are almost too good",
    "article_text": "Just a guy talking about some elephants When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We all know the story of thefirst YouTube video, a grainy 19-second clip of co-founder Jawed Karim at the zoo, remarking on the elephants behind him. That video was a pivotal moment in the digital space, and in some ways, it is a reflection, or at least an inverted mirror image, of today as we digest the arrival of Veo 3. Part of Google Gemini,Veo 3was unveiled atGoogle I/O 2025and is the first generative video platform that can, with a single prompt, generate a video with synced dialogue, sound effects, and background noises. Most of these 8-second clips arrive in under 5 minutes after you enter the prompt. I've beenplaying with Veo 3 for a couple of days,and for my latest challenge, I tried to go back to the beginning of social video and thatYouTube\"Me at the Zoo\"moment. Specifically, I wondered if Veo 3 could recreate that video. As I've written, the key to a good Veo 3 outcome is the prompt. Without detail and structure, Veo 3 tends to make the choices for you, and you usually don't end up with what you want. For this experiment, I wondered how I could possibly describe all the details I wanted to derive from that short video and deliver them to Veo 3 in the form of a prompt. So, naturally, I turned to another AI. Google Gemini 2.5 Pro is not currently capable of analyzing a URL, butGoogle AI Mode, the brand-new form of search that is quickly spreading across the US, is. Here's the prompt I dropped into Google's AI Mode: Google AI Mode almost instantly returned with a detailed description, which I took and dropped into the Gemini Veo 3 prompt field. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I did do some editing, mostly removing phrases like \"The video appears...\" and the final analysis at the end, but otherwise, I left most of it and added this at the top of the prompt: \"Let's make a video based on these details. The output should be 4:3 ratio and look like it was shot on 8MM videotape.\" It took a while for Veo 3 to generate the video (I think the service is getting hammered right now), and, because it only creates 8-second chunks at a time, it was incomplete, cutting off the dialogue mid-sentence. Still, the result is impressive. I wouldn't say that the main character looks anything like Karim. To be fair, the prompt doesn't describe, for instance, Karim's haircut, the shape of his face, or his deep-set eyes. Google's AI Mode's description of his outfit was also probably insufficient. I'm sure it would have done a better job if I had fed it a screenshot of the original video. Note to self: You can never offer enough detail in a generative prompt. The Veo 3 video zoo is nicer than the one Karim visited, and the elephants are much further away, though they are in motion back there. Veo 3 got the film quality right, giving it a nice 2005 look, but not the 4:3 aspect ratio. It also added archaic and unnecessary labels at the top that thankfully disappear quickly. I realize now I should have removed the \"Title\" bit from my prompt. The audio is particularly good. Dialogue syncs well with my main character and, if you listen closely, you'll hear the background noises, as well. The biggest issue is that this was only half of the brief YouTube video. I wanted a full recreation, so I decided to go back in with a much shorter prompt: Continue with the same video and add him looking back at the elephants and then looking at the camera as he's saying this dialogue: \"fronts and that's that's cool.\" \"And that's pretty much all there is to say.\" Veo 3 complied with the setting and main character but lost some of the plot, dropping the old-school grainy video of the first generated clip. This means that when I present them together (as I do above), we lose considerable continuity. It's like a film crew time jump, where they suddenly got a much better camera. I'm also a bit frustrated that all my Veo 3 videos have nonsensical captions. I need to remember to ask Veo 3 to remove, hide, or put them outside the video frame. I think about how hard it probably was for Karim to film, edit, and upload that first short video and how I just made essentially the same clip without the need for people, lighting, microphones, cameras, or elephants. I didn't have to transfer footage from tape or even from an iPhone. I just conjured it out of an algorithm. We have truly stepped through the looking glass, my friends. I did learn one other thing through this project. As a Google AI Pro member, I have two Veo 3 video generationsper day. That means I can do this again tomorrow.

SaaS network firm Remote.It has introduced a new hardware-based alternative to traditionalbusiness VPNtools. Developed in collaboration with IoT connectivity firm Embedded Works, Jumpbox aims to reduce reliance on VPNs by offering plug-and-play remote access without the need for manual network configuration. “VPNs are fragile and limited,\" noted Remote.It CEO Ryo Koyama, \"each endpoint can only be connected to one VPN at a time (or you have to embed a series of VPNs so multiple networks can communicate).

Remote.It’s approach hinges on replacing these with a zero-configuration setup that works out of the box, featuring 2 USB 2.0 ports, 2 USB 3.0 ports, 1 Gigabit Ethernet port, 1 HDMI, and a 3.5mm audio jack, all powered by a 1.8 GHz CPU and support for Wi-Fi 6, 5G, Bluetooth, Starlink and a 64GB microSD.

The Jumpbox comes pre-loaded with Remote.It’s software and offers encrypted access via cellular networks, making it particularly appealing to companies managing devices at dispersed sites. While Remote.It has not explicitly branded the Jumpbox as aZTNA solution, it does offer centralized control, encrypted tunnels, and out-of-band management capabilities like many similar services, as well as the ability to access devices without exposing them to the public internet, an important principle in Zero Trust frameworks. “There is a vast number of Internet and IoT connected devices that don't have any remote management systems,\" noted Andy Do, President of Embedded Works, \"and for those that do, it is usually very costly to purchase an annual license per device.” This device, currently available onAmazonfor $99.99, comes with a one-year Remote.It Business Plan and also offers unlimited device access and technical support.

    "article_text": "Flaw in popular WordPress plugin has not yet been patched When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A critical-severity vulnerability in a popularWordPress pluginis possibly exposing hundreds of thousands of websites to different risks, including complete website takeover. Security researchers from Patchstack have claimed TI WooCommerce Wishlist carried an arbitrary file upload flaw, which allowed actors to upload malicious files to the underlying server without authentication. The vulnerability is now tracked as CVE-2025-47577, and has a severity score of 10/10 (critical). The TI WooCommerce Wishlist plugin is an extension for WooCommerce stores that allows users to create and manage wishlists, saving and sharing their favorite products. Besides the social sharing options, the plugin comes with AJAX-based functionality, multiple wishlist support in the premium version, email notifications, and more. According toThe Hacker News, it has more than 100,000 active installations, meaning that the potential attack surface is rather large. To make matters worse, these are e-commerce sites, where visitors usually come to spend money, further compounding the risk. At press time, the newest version of the plugin is 2.9.2, last updated six months ago. Since the patch has not yet been released, users who fear an attack are advised to disable and remove the plugin until a fix is released. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The silver lining here is that successful exploitation is only possible on websites that also have the WC Fields Factory plugin installed and running, and the integration is enabled on the TI WooCommerce Wishlist plugin. WC Fields Factory is a free WooCommerce plugin that allows store owners to add custom fields to product pages, variations, checkout forms, and theWordPressadmin interface. It supports different field types such as text, number, email, date picker, and more. The plugin allows for dynamic pricing adjustments based on field inputs, field visibility rules, and role-based access controls, as well, and it offers a drag-and-drop form designer.

    "title": "DJI Osmo 360 leak suggests Insta360 rival could land sooner than expected – and it may be joined by the tiny DJI Osmo Nano",
    "article_text": "But will either of these action cameras even make it to the US? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. DJI’s long-rumored 360 camera may be only weeks away from release – and it might not be the only action camera the brand has in store for us this summer. In a report published today, Chinese websiteIT Homeclaims that the DJI Osmo 360, DJI’s first consumer 360 camera, will be launched in July 2025. Aside from that rather vague and tantalizing rumor, the news piece is light on new info – but given that some commentators have speculated that this camera would never see the light of day at all, it’s something. We’ve already heard plenty of rumors about the Osmo 360, however: it was first mentioned inan FCC filingback in October 2024, with thefirst leaked shotshitting the internet in February 2025, followed by aclaim that it would use 1/1.3-inch image sensorsin March. And then, earlier this month, dozens of images apparently showing the camera design were leaked alongside snaps of its instruction manual, which revealed details such as a 1,950mAh battery, on-board touchscreen and compatibility with the DJI Mimo mobile app. 👉To break your boredom, here are some photos of the DJI Osmo 360 prototype💁‍♂️#dji #djiosmo360 pic.twitter.com/Ywi3cChOeDMay 4, 2025 If this rumor of a July launch turns out to be true, we’d certainly welcome another challenger to take on the superbInsta360 X5. With a full-blooded GoPro Max 2 apparently suffering repeatedly delays, andGoPro’s refreshed Maxoffering only modest updates over the 2020 original, Insta360 currently dominates our guide to thebest 360 cameras.Some stiffer competition is sorely needed, and that's hopefully en route according to these fresh rumors. The Osmo 360 may not be DJI’s only upcoming camera launch of the summer, either. The online rumor mill is also speculating about an ultra-compact action camera called the DJI Osmo Nano, following its appearance in two listings with the FCC. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The Osmo Nano appears to be a return to the modular design of theDJI Action 2, which allowed tiny separate components to be magnetically attached to each other. While the small size and clever design did impress, DJI subsequently abandoned the modular approach, opting for a GoPro Hero-style design with its more recent Osmo Action cameras. The Nano could be a return to that approach. We’ve also heard that a DJI Osmo Action 6 will be released this year, replacing the superbOsmo Action 5as the brand’s leading ‘standard’ action camera. So, it seems that DJI has a busy few months ahead of it. One thing we do wonder about, however, is whether all (or any) of these cameras will make it to the US or not. Citing uncertainty over the tariff situation, DJI has postponed launching its new Mavic 4 Pro flagship camera drone in the States – could these action camera in line for a similar fate until some stability returns?

    "title": "Marvel Rivals season 2.5 launch live build-up: all the latest information on the new major update, as well as our predictions on Ultron",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Marvel RivalsSeason 2.5 is now just hours away, and is set to add Ultron as a brand new Strategist. It's looking like this new season - or half-season - could be one for the books, given the planned changes to a number of Heroes, the addition of new Team Ups, and even a new map to play on. I'll be covering the build-up to Season 2.5's launch over the next 24 hours, leading up to downtime and then sharing my thoughts once it's all live. Start date and timeUltron infoPatch notesNew mapRanked changesJump to our live coverage NetEase has been busy teasing thenext season ofMarvel Rivalsover the last week or so, having now revealed Ultron's kit, as well as a deep dive into theupcoming patch notes and balance changes. There's a new map to look at, too, which looks to be the dark and mysterious lair of the villainous X-Tron. If my early impressions are correct, Season 2.5 will seriously shake up the meta inCompetitive Mode, and could even shift some Heroes around on myMarvel Rivalstier list. Having covered last season's launch live, I'm looking forward to seeing how things pan out this time. Since launch, I've been playing hundreds of hours ofMarvel Rivals, predominantly in Competitive Mode. Lately, I've been focusing on Luna Snow and Magneto as my mains, but will absolutely be giving Ultron a try on launch day to see whether or not he measures up. Join me as I keep you updated on the launch of Season 2.5 as it happens, with info on how long downtime is expected to last, a look at the nerfs and buffs coming to each Hero, and some of my impressions of the new season once it all goes live. For now, let's take a look at what's been announced and what's changing inMarvel Rivalsin the coming hours. Looking for a quick overview? Here are the most important changes to know about coming toMarvel Rivalsas part of Season 2.5. Marvel RivalsSeason 2.5 launches May 30 at 5AM EDT / 2AM PDT / 10AM BST. Servers will then go down for \"2-3 hours\" before the new season is available to all players. As such, I estimate Season 2.5 to be playable at the following times: The main update inMarvel RivalsSeason 2.5 is Ultron, who joins the game as a new Strategist. He's a flying character with a laser beam attack that has unlimited range. His abilities allow him to shield teammates, add drones to them to give further shield, and his Ultimate fires a series of blasts that heal teammates and damage enemies at the same time. It looks like Ultron will have great synergy with other flying characters, and has a new Team Up with Iron-Man. We'll have to wait and see whether he'll be a viable pick alongside the likes of Luna Snow and Invisible Woman, but early signs are looking promising. NetEase has now released the full patch notes forMarvel RivalsSeason 2.5. It outlines loads of bug fixes for Heroes like Black Panther and Emma Frost, while also giving some information on the new features coming to UI and customization.You can read the full patch notes here. Hellfire Gala: Arakko is being added as a new map in Season 2.5. It's the lair of the villainous X-Tron, and features plenty of wicked machinery and robotic contraptions embedded in harsh, cold stone. As you'd expect, it's a dark, cavernous place, with glowing red lights and a harsh, rock-led soundtrack. It'll be interesting to see how Arakko performs as a map in Competitive Mode, joining Krakoa as this season's new additions. NetEase has released a new trailer for Arakko, which you can view above. There aren't too many changes to ranked play in Season 2.5, though there will be a new set of ranked rewards to earn, and a new Convoy map in Arakko. The reward for reaching Gold Tier 3 by the end of the season is the Ultron - Golden Ultron skin, which we've yet to see. There's all-new Crests of Honor for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and Top 500 to earn as well. At present, there has been no announcement of a rank reset, though this is subject to change as we get closer to launch day. As a freelance games writer, it's my job to stay up to date with the latest games, especially live service titles likeMarvel Rivals. I've put hundreds of hours intoRivalssince launch, primarily gaining Venom, who I now have a Lord rank. Generally, I play Competitive Mode with a regular squad, hovering around the top of the Platinum tier. So far, I've mostly stuck to the Vanguard and Strategist Roles, so I'm definitely excited to get my hands on Ultron. There's going to be buffs to Magneto and Doctor Strange as well, two characters I absolutely love to play as. And that concludes myMarvel RivalsSeason 2.5 live blog for the day. Expect me back online at 3AM ET / 12AM PT / 8AM BST to continue things. I’ll be discussing the new update in the hours before downtime kicks in, and giving my advice on how to make the best use of Ultron. Psylocke is getting a nerf to her Shuriken attacks, which will now do 12 damage per hit (down from 14) upon retrieval. Her Invisibility ability now only lasts 2 seconds instead of 3. This will have an impact on how careful players will need to be when going in for the kill, as there's less time for a cloaked escape. Marvel RivalsSeason 2 ends on May 30 UTC. This is listed on NetEase socials as 5AM ET / 2AM PT / 10AM BST. At this point, servers will go down and you won’t be able to play the game. The good news is that the main Battle Pass carries over, so you’ll still have plenty of time to earn its rewards. An event called Combat Chest will go live with Season 2.5. It has a free track that’ll grant rewards like Sprays, and a Premium track that features new skins for characters like Magneto and Mr Fantastic. As a main of both, I’m very excited indeed. Now that I’m back from my break, let’s take a closer look at Ultron. He’s part of a new Team Up called Stark Protocol with, you guessed it, Iron Man. Ultron is able to fire powerful uni-beam attacks that pierce through enemies and teammates. Enemies will take serious damage, while allies will be healed. I just tested this out in the Practice Range and it's a serious upgrade to Ultron's standard kit. Probably worth having an Iron Man with you, then. I’m heading off now for a break. I’ll be back at 12PM ET / 9AM PT / 5PM BST to continue my coverage of Season 2.5’s launch. By that time, I'll have gotten some early access time with Ultron in the Practice Range. Stay tuned for my first impressions! There’s a full character reveal trailer available for Ultron, showing off his abilities and playstyle. Interestingly, it looks like he puts out some serious damage at range. Captain America leads Season 2.5’s nerfs, with hits to his survivability. His base health is going from 600 to 575, while an increase to the energy cost of Freedom Charge (Ultimate Ability) from 2800 to 3100 will apply. Finally, there will be an increase for the delay of shield recovery from 2s to 4s after unleashing Living Legend. Cerebro Database II is the new event that’ll go live with Season 2.5. It’ll allow you to earn an awesome Hawkeye skin, though you’ll likely need to complete a set of challenges to get it. There’s a whole host of Team Ups being removed fromMarvel Rivalsas part of Season 2.5.Chilling Charisma(Luna Snow, Jeff the Land Shark),Symbiote Bond(Venom, Spider-Man, Peni Parker),Ammo Overload(The Punisher, Rocket Raccoon), andAllied Agents(Hawkeye, Black Widow) are all being taken out, to make room for new Team Ups. More on those later. Like many, I’ve struggled a bit this season, ending up unable to climb out of Platinum rank. Dive characters have gotten extremely difficult to counter, especially Iron Fist and Spider-Man. It’s no wonder that the latter is banned in basically every ranked game you play these days. Hopefully, buffs to Vanguards, and a rework of DPS viability will balance things out. From the looks of the upcoming changes, the developers are making all the right calls. 🛠️ Patch 20250530 is on the way, Rivals!\nCheck out all the details and tweaks we’re implementing as we head into Season 2.5 >> https://t.co/BuoVLCEI81\n🕑 The patch will be implemented on May 30 at 2 AM PDT, and maintenance is expected to take approximately 2–3 hours.\n- Please… pic.twitter.com/YPbkqdcRY6May 23, 2025 As you can see in the Tweet above, downtime will last “2-3 hours” before Season 2.5 goes live. During downtime, you won’t be able to access the game, but worry not, I’ll be keeping this blog going, digging deep into upcoming Hero changes. Ultron is the new Hero for Season 2.5, filling the role of Strategist. He’s the first new Strategist since Invisible Woman, and looks set to be a very different kind of character. He can fly, for one, meaning he’s going to be difficult for certain dive characters, like Captain America, to attack. He can boost up into the air when cornered, and even attack at distance with a laser beam. Welcome to TechRadar Gaming’s live coverage ofMarvel RivalsSeason 2.5. The major update is set to go live May 30, with downtime beginning at 5AM EDT / 2AM PDT / 10AM BST. I’ll be detailing all of the biggest changes coming to the game, including the addition of Ultron as a new Strategist. Let’s get started.

    "title": "Garmin's long-rumored Whoop-style screenless 'sleep band' will reportedly break cover soon",
    "article_text": "The leak includes a ton of alleged details When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Yes, it's been rumored before, but it sounds as though we could be seeing a very different style of fitness tracker fromGarminin a couple of months. Garmin has consistently been known for its smartwatches – it's why we have a dedicatedbest Garmin watcheslist, after all – but the company is reportedly set to debut a Whoop-style screenless tracker \"within two months\", according to leak siteThe5kRunner. Having apparently seen a confidential source document, The5KRunner refers to it as a \"sleep band\" stated to provide comfort during use. This is a nice option to have, as Garmin's chunky watches often aren't ideal for use during sleep. A buckle mechanism and overlapping adjustable strap makes it sound similar to Whoop. The comparisons don't stop there. Features listed include vibration alarm that wakes the wearer, tap gestures to turn off or snooze the alarm, and an LED battery indicator – all emblematic of Whoop. Sleep tracking is a given, considering the device is said to pack a smart-wake alarm. Smart-wake alarms,a feature recently introduced in the Garmin Vivoactive 6, only work if the wearable is actively tracking sleep stages via heart rate and other metrics. A long time ago, based on my colleague Lance Ulanoff's findings during CES 2023, I predicted thatscreenless smartwatches would be the future of fitness. While that hasn't strictly proven true until now, 2025 has seen new screenless optical heart rate monitoring fitness tech from Whoop, Coros, and now (apparently) Garmin, not to mention the advent of thebest smart rings. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Fitness tracking is going discreet, focusing on the holistic overall benefits of an active lifestyle rather than specifically tracking workouts. While thebest running watcheswill always have a place, I think an optical armband-based Whoop competitor from a company like Garmin, with an enormous built-in infrastructure for sleep, health and workout tracking, could be a real winner.

    "title": "This fun, point-and-shoot camera is like a cross between a Fujifilm X100VI and Camp Snap –and now has a tempting price tag",
    "article_text": "Looks like a Leica, costs less than a steak dinner When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The upcoming Echolens is a digital camera that stands out from the pack. Designed to recreate the experience of shooting on analog film, it has no rear screen and built-in film-style filters to create warm, vintage photographs. And the X100VI look-a-like is also going to be really, really affordable. We’ve seen cameras like the Echolens before. We don’t mean compact, fixed-lens and pricey cameras like the imperiousFujifilm X100VI, the stunningLeica Q3 43or even the recent fun-orientedFujifilm X, although there’s definitely a bit of all three in the Echolens’ eye-catching retro styling. We mean in pared-back, cheap point-and-shoots like theCamp Snap, which also has no screen and a refreshingly simple approach to shooting. While details on its lens, sensor and other specs are yet to be revealed, the Echolens appears to be a little more advanced than the Camp Snap. For one thing, it has an LCD indicator on its top plate to keep count of your shots. After 54 snaps have been captured, you’ll have to offload them to your smartphone or the cloud via the camera’s built-in Wi-Fi – a feature that’s supposed to 'echo' the act of changing the roll of film in your analog camera. This offloading apparently takes just one button press and no time at all. TheEcholens websitepromises a minimalist approach to photography, stripping away much of the tinkering that can get in between the photographer and their subject. That means simplified controls (there’s a shutter button, an image transfer button and a dial to switch the flash on and off, and that seems to be it), a viewfinder for composition and nothing in the way of AI image enhancement or over-sharpening. Instead, the user can pick from a range of digital ‘film’ styles designed to replicate the color profiles of classic 35mm stocks. A USB-C port is also present for recharging, and Echolens’ makers claim the battery will last for several days on a full charge. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. While we really need more detail before we can get too excited about this camera – and all the usual crowdfunding caveats still apply – we hopefully won’t have to wait long. Echolens is slated for a launch on Kickstarter in mid-June 2025, with a full release to follow at an unspecified later date. What we do know, roughly at least, is the price: the Echolens site’s FAQ says the camera will be around $150 (or around £110 / AU$230), but early bird backers on Kickstarter will be able to secure a pre-order for under $100 (about £75 / AU$155). Which seems like a brilliantly affordable price tag if this thing lives up to its billing. Of course, backers sometimes have a lengthy wait for the finished product after a Kickstarter campaign closes, so we’ve reached out to Echolens to try and find out more about their camera and campaign.

    "title": "Microsoft investigates nasty Windows 11 bug that leaves PCs unable to boot – here’s what you need to know",
    "article_text": "Be cautious, even though this glitch likely won’t affect you When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Those who haven’t yet installed the latest cumulative update forWindows 11in May – by which I mean the upgrade released the week before last, not themost recent optional update– should be aware of a nasty bug that some users are encountering. Microsofthas said that it’s investigating whether the May update can cause a showstopping error, which means your PC won’t boot. However, this warning is delivered with a welcome caveat that it isn’t likely to affectWindows 11 Homeusers. Still, that possibility isn’t ruled out, and given the gravity of the bug, it’s worth bearing in mind if you’re about to pull the trigger on this cumulative update. Bleeping Computer reportsthat Microsoft has updated its release health dashboard withinformation on the bug, and how the upgrade might fall over with a ‘recovery error 0xc0000098 in ACPI.sys’ message. This is no simple error or installation failure, though, because it leaves Windows 11 unable to boot and requires a repair to be run on the system. And whether thatrepairwill be successful is anyone’s guess, as sometimes, these are the kind of situations that are tricky to recover from – and the OS won’t necessarily pull itself out of the hole that’s been dug. The good news is that affected devices running Windows 11 22H2 and 23H2 – note that 24H2 is not affected here – are few in number. Primarily, this problem pertains to virtual machines, not physicalWindows 11 PCs. Microsoft explains: “Home users of Windows using Home or Pro editions are unlikely to face this issue, as virtual machines are mostly used in IT environments.” However, being ‘unlikely’ does not equate to being impossible, and so there must have been some reports of Windows 11 PCs (as opposed tovirtual machines) being affected by this unfortunate issue. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I did find one such recent report onReddit, although it isn’t explicitly linked to the latest update being installed, so take that with a grain of salt. The error message was slightly different as well, but in its warning, Microsoft acknowledges that a file name other than ACPI.sys might appear in the error. Microsoft wouldn’t announce such an investigation lightly, so if you haven’t yet installed the May update, I think that it’s worth considering delaying the installation of that upgrade for a little longer. Mainly to allow for Microsoft to complete its investigation here, after all, you’ve waited a couple of weeks (for whatever reason) now, so what’s another week, or perhaps a bit longer? It is possible to pause OS updates for over a month, even on Windows 11 Home, though you’ll be forced to apply any given patch after 35 days of deferring it. In this additional time, you can wait for Microsoft to complete its deeper dive into what’s going on here, and hopefully that’ll lead to a fix being implemented soon, too. Granted, you’d probably be very unlucky to encounter this recovery error, but even a small chance is off-putting, given that it could be a potentially thorny problem to extricate yourself from. Ultimately, the choice is yours, and if you’ve already installed the May update without encountering any such error, I should make it clear that you've got nothing to worry about. Microsoft isn’t having a great time of things lately when it comes to bugs of a seriously unpleasant nature, as there was a real sting in the tail forsome Windows 10 users with the May update, too.

    "title": "From a Stranger Things season 5 release date to new movie trailer reveals, these are the 4 things I'm most excited to see at Netflix Tudum 2025",
    "article_text": "Netflix Tudum 2025 is right around the corner – these are the four biggest reveals I want to see When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The 2025 edition ofNetflix Tudum, aka the now-annual fan event that celebrates everything about the world'sbest streaming service, is almost upon us. This year's installment will take place on Saturday, May 31 at 5pm PT / 8pm ET – non-US readers can work out when it'll begin using the aforementioned times – and there'll be plenty of announcements made on the night. We already know that TV hits includingStranger Things,Wednesday,andSquid Gamewill be featured at Netflix Tudum 2025. However, Netflix has stayed tight-lipped on what it'll actually reveal during its live event, which you can watch on Netflix if you didn't manage to secure a ticket to the in-person event. That won't stop me from speculating on what'll be shown, mind you. With that in mind, here are four things I predict we'll see at Tudum 2025. As far as many people are concerned, these are the biggest reveals that Netflix could make at Tudum 2025. We already know that thehugely popular show's final season is set to be released sometime in 2025. Indeed,filming wrapped onStranger Things 5in December 2024but, while abigStranger Thingsseason 5 leak seemingly suggested it'll air in late 2025, we still don't know when it'll make its actual debut. Nevertheless, Tudum 2025 is the perfect time for Netflix to finally confirm whenStranger Thingsseason 5will be released. I predict that the streaming giant will also tell us whether it'll launch in full, or be released in two parts likeStranger Thingsseason 4 was. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Lastly, I'd be surprised if a teaser trailer isn't unveiled to further generate hype for one of thebest Netflix shows' final hurrah. We've had to live on behind-the-scenes morsels for years at this point, so some actual footage of season 5 would go down a storm. It's hard to believe that another incredibly successful Netflix TV Original –Squid Game– will end this year, too. The Korean-language survival drama is set to end whenSquid Gameseason 3arrives on June 27. But, despite the fact that we were treated to anexcitingSquid Game 3teaser in early May, an official trailer still hasn't been released online. Tudum 2025 is the ideal time to drop a much longer trailer that'll make me and millions of other Netflix users even more stoked for the series' last chapter. Unlike the aforementioned pair, Netflix hasn't been shy about disclosing information aboutWednesdayseason 2. In the last few weeks alone, we've received word aboutWednesday 2's dual release dates and first-look at its new cast members, and been treated to afinger-clickingly good behind-the-scenes featurette of the show's sophomore outing. I'm hungry for even more, though, so I'd like to see another first-look clip or two forWednesday's second chapter. I don't really care what's shown, either. Indeed, I'll take an extended sequence of Jenna Ortega's eponymous character interacting with Joanna Lumley's Grandmama, a tension-filled reunion with Hunter Dooham's Tyler/Hyde, or something more kooky. Just give me something, please Netflix. It's not all about the biggest shows that Netflix has to offer. There are numerousnew Netflix moviesthat'll launch on the platform before the end of 2025, but lots of them still only have placeholder launch windows. There's no better moment to announce some proper release dates for some of Netflix's most anticipatednew moviesof the year, then, than at Tudum 2025. I'm hoping for official launch dates forWake Up, Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery,Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein,The RIP, andThe Twits, but I won't turn my nose up at any other major reveals that are made.

    "title": "\"Unnecessary and disproportionate\" – Experts slam 2-month VPN ban enforced in India",
    "article_text": "Doda's authorities enforced the ban over national security concerns When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Doda, a district in India's Jammu and Kashmir region, enforced a 2-month VPN ban on May 2, 2025, over national security concerns. Authorities issued the ban under Section 163 of the new BNSS law (the equivalent of the Indian Penal Code), citing individuals and groups misusingvirtual private network (VPN)tools \"to circumvent lawful cyber restrictions and access prohibited applications,\" theorder reads. Digital rights and legal experts have so far strongly criticized this decision. They warn against the attack on people's digital rights and security, while questioning its legality. The Doda's VPN ban aims to \"curtail the use of VPNs in the interest of public safety,\" and it's extended to all individuals, institutions, internet service providers, and cyber cafes operating in the district. This means that all residents are barred from using one of thebest VPNservices or similar tools for two months, to avoid being liable for legal action. Repercussions for allegedly using VPNs seem to have already begun. In a report published on May 18, Indian publicationThe Wire reportedallegations that an unspecified number of Doda residents under \"technical surveillance\" have already been arrested as found to be using VPNs. Two days before,Doda's authorities had already confirmedto have \"detained several individuals across the district for violating the directive.\" This is why many experts have been raising concerns about how the ban can impact people's rights, like free speech, free access to information, and privacy.

To take part, click the link below:https://futurenet.questionpro.eu/tr-vpn Talking to TechRadar, Senior Policy Counsel and Encryption Policy Lead at Access Now, Namrata Maheshwari, explains that the right to the internet and the right to privacy are protected fundamental rights under the Indian Constitution. Maheshwari also pointed out how the Indian government has already implemented \"an onerous mandate\" for VPN providers when it enforced a newdata retention law in 2022. A host of online services are now required to store users' data for up to five years and share it with authorities on request, in fact, something that led to anexodus of major VPN companiesfrom the country. VPNs are not illegal.\" Yet, \"VPNs are not illegal,\" said Maheshwari, adding that a blanket ban on all VPNs for two months is \"unnecessary and disproportionate.\" \"People have a fundamental right to information and freedom of expression, and restrictions on these rights ought to be legal, necessary, and proportionate – a standard this ban does not meet,\" she added. The ban isn't affecting only individual users, though, but also businesses and institutions that regularly use these services for security purposes. According to Maheshwari, the ban could then end up increasing vulnerabilities in the country's cyberspace, ultimately weakening security as opposed to strengthening it.

If you've ever struggled to set up new sensors and switches for yourPhilips Huelights, help is at hand. A new app update is rolling out now that automatically suggests adding accessories to a zone when you connect them for the first time, so you don't miss out on any features later on. A zone is a set of lights and other accessories that you want to control together as a group. They don't necessarily have to be in the same place or include all the lights within a room. For example, you might want to create a zone specifically for your home entertainment lighting, or one that includes all the lights on a particular floor. Previously, assigning new devices to a room or zone was an optional step within the Philips Hue app, which you might miss if you were in a hurry. If you did, you wouldn't be able to use all of the switch or sensor's functions afterwards. For example, you may be unable to view all the available scenes (ready-made lighting profiles). The new app update was spotted by the editor ofHueblog.com, who says he's often contacted by readers stuck in this frustrating 'accessory trap'. From now on, the app will suggest creating at least one zone during the setup process so you don't suffer that problem, and will note that you can always hide zones in the future if you prefer. There is also a change to the setup process when you're installing a new Philips Hue security camera. AsNotebookcheckexplains, the app now offers you the chance to set up motion-controlled lighting during the initial setup process. Both of these are relatively minor changes, and there's still no news about the upcoming Philips Hue AI assistant.

    "title": "NordVPN extends post-quantum encryption protection to all applications – here's everything we know",
    "article_text": "The provider launched PQE support in 2024, but only for its Linux app When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. NordVPN has just taken an important step forward into its post-quantum transition, extending support for quantum-safe encryption across all its applications. While the provider launched its first iteration of post-quantum encryption (PQE)in September 2024, only Linux users could enjoy this protection. Now, allNordVPNusers can enjoy PQE no matter the platform they use. Already rated as thebest VPNservice on the market by TechRadar's reviewers, NordVPN joins a handful of VPN providers that also include quantum-safe cryptography in their software. As quantum computing advances, NordVPN's CTO, Marijus Briedis, explains, RSA-based key exchange encryption methods that mostVPN protocolsuse today will eventually become vulnerable. Experts predict, in fact, that traditionalencryptionwill soon be broken by the ability of quantum computers to perform computations that machines can't handle, within minutes. While this is expected to happen between five to 10 years, cybercriminals have already started to conduct what's known as \"store now, decrypt later (SNDL) attacks.\" The idea is simple – to collect encrypted data now so they can crack it in the future when quantum computing is finally up to the task. This is exactly why the cryptographic world is already catching up. Last August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released thefirst three quantum-resistant encryption standardsto better support software providers in their transition. NordVPNjoined the post-quantum revolutiona few months after that, adding one of these algorithms (ML-KEM) to its WireGuard-based Nordlynx protocol, which is known for its speed and security. \"By integrating PQE into our VPN infrastructure, we're taking a proactive step to ensure long-term confidentiality and resilience for our customers' data, both now and in a post-quantum future,\" said Briedis. TechRadar needs you!We want to know what you think about the world of VPNs. Whether you're a novice or a VPN pro, we want to hear your thoughts. Don't worry, though, your responses are completely anonymous, and it takes less than five minutes to complete! To take part, click the link below:https://futurenet.questionpro.eu/tr-vpn As mentioned earlier, before the latest release, only theLinux VPNapp included PQE support. This choice allowed the NordVPN team to analyze how the new quantum-safe algorithm, which was implemented in a hybrid way alongside classic encryption methods, could affect performance like connection speeds and latency. \"The gathered data served as a stepping stone in the transition to quantum-resistant encryption for the rest of our platforms,\" said Briedis. \"The Linux case demonstrated that we successfully maintained the highest level of user experience in terms of connection time and speed during the transition.\" As a result, NordVPN rolled PQE across all its platforms – from Windows and macOS to Android and iOS, even including its Android TV and tvOS apps. Users need to actively enable this extra protection by heading to the Connections tab in the app's Settings and switching on the toggle. The PQE feature will automatically activate whenever the user connects via the NordLynx protocol. NordVPN is not the onlyvirtual private network (VPN)provider currently including PQE support on its service. ExpressVPNadded quantum-safe encryption on its proprietary Lightway protocol in October 2023, by default across its Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, and Windows apps. Last January, the team took a further step forward byupgrading to the NIST standards. After pioneering the post-quantum transition in 2017,Mullvadextended PQE support for all platforms when it releasedpost-quantum protection for iPhonein September 2024. The provider now plans to migrate to the new NIST standards, too. AdGuard,Windscribe, andPureVPNare other providers currently offering PQE protection, withSurfsharkandNymVPNalso expected to join the list soon.

    "article_text": "The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) has accused Serbian defense companies of using false documentation and third parties to covertly ship artillery shells, rockets, and small arms ammunition to Ukraine. The agency made the allegation in a statement published on its website on Wednesday, titled“The Serbian Defense Industry Is Trying to Shoot Russia in the Back.” “According to information received by the SVR, Serbian defense firms continue to supply ammunition to Kiev, in violation of the ‘neutrality’ declared by Belgrade,”the statement read. The SVR claimed that Serbian companies have used“fake end-user certificates”to route weapons through Poland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and other NATO countries, as well as unspecified African states. These arms, the agency said, later surfaced in Ukraine. According to the SVR, 100,000 rockets and howitzer shells, along with one million small arms rounds, have been transferred in this manner. Major Serbian weapons manufacturers, including the state-owned Yugoimport-SDPR, were allegedly complicit in the scheme. “It seems that the desire of Serbian defense firms and their backers to profit from the bloodshed between brotherly Slavic nations has made them forget who their true friends are – and who their enemies are,”the SVR stated. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Thursday that he had discussed ammunition exports during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in May.“We have formed a working group with our Russian partners to establish the facts,”he told broadcaster RTS. Commenting on the SVR’s claims, Vucic maintained that“some of the statements that have been made are not true.” “For example, they claim there is a contract with the Czech Republic. However, no permit has been issued, and no missiles have been delivered,”he said.“I will certainly issue an order and a warning that if there is any suspicion of abuse of the so-called end-user policies –namely, the sending of ammunition to warzones – we should be informed immediately.”Vucic emphasized that Serbia maintains“good relations”with both Russia and Ukraine. Russia and Serbia have enjoyed close historical and cultural ties since the 19th century. Belgrade has refused to impose sanctions on Moscow and has repeatedly warned against further escalation. Vucic has said he has resisted Western efforts to draw Serbia into a confrontation with Russia.",

    "title": "France approves right-to-die law",
    "article_text": "France’s lower house of parliament has approved a controversial bill to legalize assisted dying for adults with terminal illnesses, amid deep divisions in a country with strong Catholic traditions. The National Assembly voted 305 to 199 in favor of the measure, which is backed by President Emmanuel Macron. The bill now moves to the Senate and will return to the lower house for a second reading. Supporters hope it will become law by 2027. France currently allows what is called passive euthanasia – such as withdrawing life support – and deep sedation before death. Under the bill, patients could request lethal medication, which they would take themselves, or if physically unable, have administered by a doctor or nurse. They must be over 18, hold French citizenship or residency, and be suffering from an irreversible, advanced, or terminal illness causing constant, untreatable pain. People with severe psychiatric conditions or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s would not qualify. A medical team would assess each case. After a period of reflection, the patient could receive the drug at home, in a care home, or medical facility. The government described the bill as“an ethical response to the need to support the sick and the suffering,”calling it“neither a new right nor a freedom… but a balance between respect and personal autonomy.”Macron hailed the vote as“an important step”toward a more humane approach to end-of-life care. A separate bill establishing a right to palliative care passed unopposed. France’s proposal would be more restrictive than laws in countries such as Belgium or the Netherlands, where euthanasia – in which doctors give a lethal injection at the patient’s request – has been legal since 2002 and extended to minors. Similar laws exist in Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, Canada, Australia, and Colombia. Medically assisted suicide, where patients take prescribed lethal medication themselves, is legal in Switzerland and several US states. Right-to-die campaigners have welcomed the law, though describing it as relatively modest in scope.“We’ve been waiting for this for decades,”said Stephane Gemmani of the ADMD association. Critics warn the definitions are too broad, potentially allowing assisted dying for patients who could live for years. Some fear the bill could undermine medical ethics, erode care standards, and expose vulnerable people to subtle pressure to die. “It would be like a loaded pistol left on my bedside table,”a 44-year-old woman with Parkinson’s disease told a protest outside parliament, according to the BBC. This month, France’s religious leaders issued a joint statement denouncing the“dangers”of an“anthropological rupture.”Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau wrote on X this week that it is“not a bill of fraternity but a bill of abandonment.”",

    "title": "UK to step up cyberattacks on Russia and China – minister",
    "article_text": "London will significantly step up offensive cyber operations against Russia and China, UK Defense Secretary John Healey announced on Thursday following the inauguration of the country’s new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command. In a statement quoted by The Times, Healey claimed that“the keyboard is now a weapon of war”and said the UK’s new cyber command would coordinate both defensive and offensive operations, including hacking into enemy systems to disrupt attacks and spread of propaganda. Asked whether this would include Russia and China, Healey responded:“Yes.” Healey’s statement marks the first time a British minister has explicitly confirmed cyberattacks on other states. While UK ministers had previously confirmed cyber operations against non-state actors like Islamic State, they have not until now acknowledged attacks against other countries. The defense secretary added that more than £1 billion ($1.35 billion) has been allocated by the UK government for a“digital targeting web”to enable real-time battlefield intelligence-sharing between troops, spy planes and satellites. Healey’s comments come ahead of the publication of a strategic defense review on Monday. According to The Times, the review will stress that cyberattacks on Britain, allegedly being carried out by Russia and China, are“threatening the foundations of the economy and daily life.” Both Moscow and Beijing have consistently denied accusations of carrying out cyberattacks against Western nations, characterizing the claims as baseless and politically motivated. Additionally, Russian officials have in recent months repeatedly raised concerns over what they describe as Western Europe’s continued militarization and aggressive anti-Russian rhetoric, said to be in response to the alleged threat posed by Moscow. The Kremlin has vehemently denied having any hostile intent towards any western country, and has accused European politicians of“irresponsibly stoking fears”to justify increased military expenditures, which Moscow had labeled an“incitement of war on the European continent.”",

    "title": "Russia prepared to strike Germany if Taurus missiles are used – senior MP",
    "article_text": "Russia could authorize strikes on German territory if Ukraine uses German-supplied Taurus cruise missiles to attack Russian targets, a senior Russian lawmaker has warned. Andrey Kartapolov, chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee and a former deputy defense minister, said the long-range missiles require direct German military involvement to operate—making Berlin a potential participant in any such attack. Speculation about a potential transfer of Taurus missiles to Kiev resurfaced this week after German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Ukraine would be allowed to use Western-supplied weapons without range limitations. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, Merz confirmed that delivering the Taurus system was“possible,”though he added that Ukrainian forces would require“several months of training”to use them effectively. In an interview with Life.ru on Wednesday, Kartapolov said Moscow is“ready for everything”if Germany proceeds with such a transfer. ”We are prepared to intercept the Taurus missiles, strike the launch sites, the operators, and, if necessary, the locations from which they are delivered,” he warned. The Taurus KEPD 350 missile has a range of over 500 kilometers and is capable of reaching targets deep within Russian territory, including Moscow. Kartapolov emphasized that Ukraine lacks the technical expertise to operate such weapons independently. He claimed that earlier deliveries of long-range systems—including the U.S.-made ATACMS, Britain’s Storm Shadow, and France’s SCALP—have only been deployed with the assistance of Western military specialists. ”Ukrainian troops can press the launch button—that’s not the problem,” he said.“But they cannot program the targets. That data comes from American and European satellites. If Germany supplies these missiles, German personnel will inevitably be involved on the ground.” The German Defense Ministry announced on Wednesday that it would provide Kiev with an additional €5.2 billion ($5.6 billion) in military aid. Much of the funding, according to the ministry, will support the production of long-range weaponry inside Ukraine. Responding to the development, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Berlin of crossing a dangerous line.“Germany’s direct involvement in the war is now obvious,”he said, adding that the country“is sliding down the same slippery slope it already followed a couple of times in the last century—toward its own collapse.”",

    "title": "Israel and Hamas agree to Gaza ceasefire proposal – media",
    "article_text": "Israel and Hamas have agreed to accept the latest ceasefire proposal put forward by the US, several media outlets reported on Thursday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled his readiness to accept a roadmap presented by US special envoy Steve Witkoff during a meeting with the relatives of hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza. Arab media later reported that Hamas had also accepted the deal to release the remaining Israeli hostages held in the enclave in exchange for a temporary truce. Haaretz newspaper quoted an anonymous Israeli official as saying that Washington’s proposal envisages the release of the remaining 10 living hostages and the return of 18 bodies held in Gaza by Hamas over the course of a week. In exchange, Netanyahu’s government would reportedly agree to a 60-day cease-fire. The Jerusalem Post cited an unnamed source as saying that Hamas has reservations regarding Washington’s plan, and sees it as favoring Israel. The Islamist militant group is reportedly wary of the fact that the US would not provide a guarantee that the temporary 60-day ceasefire would be extended to become permanent. The latest developments have come amid an intensified Israeli assault on Gaza in recent days, including a fresh wave of airstrikes and a major ground offensive codenamed ‘Operation Gideon’s Chariots.’ Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that the military action will not cease until Hamas has been totally vanquished. Mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the US, negotiations between the two belligerents have been going on for some time in Doha, albeit producing little progress so far. The current escalation began in October 2023, when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 250 more. According to Palestinian authorities, the ensuing IDF military campaign has claimed the lives of more than 50,000 residents of the densely populated enclave.",

    "article_text": "US immigration authorities have arrested a Mexican man who allegedly threatened to shoot President Donald Trump, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In a press releaseissuedon Wednesday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem thanked US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, saying the“illegal alien … is behind bars.” Earlier this month, ICE received a handwritten letter from 54-year-old Ramon Morales Reyes in which he vowed to“shoot your precious president in (his) head”at one of Trump’s rallies. The DHS published an image of the letter, in which Morales blamed ICE for deporting his family and, after threatening to kill Trump, promised to self-deport. “We are tired of this president messing with us Mexicans – we have done more for this country than you, white people,”the letter read. Thanks to our ICE officers, this illegal alien who threatened to assassinate President Trump is behind bars.This threat comes not even a year after President Trump was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania and less than two weeks after former FBI Director Comey called for the…pic.twitter.com/Sr2pI08NuQ Morales, who, according to DHS, entered the US illegally at least nine times between 1998 and 2005 and has a criminal record that includes a felony hit-and-run, was arrested the next day and is now awaiting deportation. Trump survived an assassination attempt when a gunman took shots at him during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The would-be assassin grazed Trump’s ear with a bullet, killed a spectator in the crowd behind him, and injured several others. “This threat comes not even a year after Butler and less than two weeks after former FBI Director (James) Comey called for the President’s assassination,”Noem said, urging politicians and the media to“tone down their rhetoric.” Earlier this month, Trump accused Comey – a longtime critic – of calling for his assassination in a now-deleted Instagram post. The image showed seashells spelling out“86 47,”captioned“cool shell formation on my beach walk.” White House officials and Republicans said the numbers were a coded threat to the 47th US president, with“86”interpreted as slang for“get rid of”or“kill.”An investigation is underway. Comey has denied endorsing violence.",

    "title": "US court blocks Trump’s tariffs",
    "article_text": "The US Court of International Trade has ruled that President Donald Trump has no right to impose sweeping tariffs on imports under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). By invoking the legislation, the White House bypassed the need for congressional approval that would otherwise have been required to take such steps. In early April, the US president slapped a baseline 10% tariff on all imported goods, with higher rates for China, Mexico, Canada and the EU member states, citing trade imbalances. Trump has since suspended some of those measures amid ongoing negotiations. On Wednesday, the New York-based court sided with a number of small businesses that had filed lawsuits against Trump, arguing that he had overstepped his authority. According to a statement issued by the court and quoted by US media,“the Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.” However, the ruling does not affect any tariffs that Trump has imposed under different legislation, namely, Section 232 powers from the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This means that his 25% tariff on imported autos and parts as well as on all foreign-made steel and aluminum will remain in place. The court ruling has noted that the US president could still slap a 15% tariff on countries with which Washington has a substantial trade deficit for 150 days, with Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 granting Trump the right to do so. The White House has filed an appeal, with US media suggesting that the US Supreme Court will likely be asked to settle the matter. In a post on X on Thursday, Stephen Miller, who serves as the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and as homeland security advisor, described the court’s decision as a“judicial coup”that has gotten“out of control.” The judicial coup is out of control.https://t.co/PRRZ1zU6lI There is a total of at least seven lawsuits, which argue that the IEEPA legislation does not authorize the use of tariffs, and that the trade deficit cited by Trump does not constitute an emergency as the US has run it for 49 consecutive years. Multiple states led by Oregon have filed similar lawsuits. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the global trade system in its current form has left the US“looted, pillaged, raped and plundered”by other nations. The Republican has also insisted that sweeping tariffs will help to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US.",

    "title": "UK unveils bill to stop capital outflow",
    "article_text": "The UK has unveiled a sweeping and controversial plan to force pension funds to invest more heavily in domestic assets in the face of fiscal strain and ratcheting geopolitical pressure. Legislation to consolidate local pension schemes into“megafunds”of at least £25 billion by 2030 is being framed by the government as a strategy to boost infrastructure, energy projects, and job creation. Since 2012, UK pension fund investments in British companies have plummeted from over 50% to just 20% in 2023, with fund managers seeking higher returns abroad. Chancellor Rachel Reeves insists the reforms will ensure“better returns for workers”while strengthening strategic sectors like clean energy. However, industry figures have pushed back. Aviva CEO Amanda Blanc described the plan as“using a sledgehammer to crack a nut,”warning it could clash with pension trustees’ fiduciary duty to maximize returns. The initiative comes as the Labour government faces deepening political and economic challenges, including declining support, soaring public debt, and a widening rift with long-time ally the US. Labour’s support has dropped by more than 12 points since the July 2024 election – the steepest post-election fall in four decades. The rise of Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has further disrupted the traditional political landscape dominated by two parties. The national debt now exceeds 95% of GDP, among the highest levels since the early 1960s. Economists attribute the surge to pandemic-era spending, energy price shocks, and a sustained rise in borrowing. London also recently announced plans to increase defense expenditure to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, in line with NATO targets and renewed US pressure for greater European contributions amid the Ukraine conflict. The UK has been one of the staunchest backers of Kiev, giving it billions in military and financial support. British pension funds have also historically invested heavily in the US, particularly in large-cap technology stocks such as Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. But recent shifts, including new US tariffs under President Donald Trump and diverging approaches to Ukraine, have prompted many UK pension managers to reassess their exposure to American markets. The pension reform bill is expected to reach Parliament before the summer recess.",

    "title": "AI CEO issues stark warning",
    "article_text": "Artificial intelligence could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years, the CEO of American AI research company Anthropic, Dario Amodei has warned. In a statement to Axios published on Wednesday, Amodei, who co-founded Anthropic and is a former OpenAI executive, said he hopes to jolt the US government and fellow developers into preparing for the consequences of rapid automation. AI could spike unemployment in the US to 10-20% in the next one to five years, he warned. AI development companies are already working on systems that could soon replace workers in technology, finance, law, consulting and other white-collar professions, particularly entry-level positions, Amodei claimed. The public and politicians are still“unaware”that a major shift is about to happen and insisted that companies and officials needed to stop“sugar-coating”what lies ahead, particularly for younger workers. Earlier this month, a report by the Linux Foundation, commissioned by Meta, found that open source AI is already transforming the economy by boosting efficiency, innovation, cost savings, and revenue gains. However, Amodei has expressed concern that people could continue to stay ignorant of the threat of being replaced by AI, especially if the US government chooses to stay silent on the issue out of fear of spooking workers or falling behind China. Soon,“almost overnight,”business leaders will see savings in replacing humans with AI and implement a change“en masse.”They will stop opening new jobs or backfilling existing ones, and replace human workers with automated alternatives, Amodei claimed. He has proposed several mitigation strategies, including a special index to track AI’s impact across occupations, and briefings for lawmakers to raise awareness. He also suggested a“token tax”— a system where a percentage of AI-generated revenue would be redistributed by the government. Amodei’s warning comes as a number of major companies have recently started laying off a considerable amount of workers, which some believe is being done in anticipation of major shifts due to AI. Earlier this month, Microsoft fired some 6,000 workers, mostly engineers, despite reporting strong sales and profits. Walmart has cut 1,500 corporate jobs to“simplify operations”while Crowdstrike - a Texas based cybersecurity company - has slashed 500 positions citing“a market and technology inflection point, with AI reshaping every industry.”",

    "title": "Berlin offers Kiev another €5 billion",
    "article_text": "Berlin will provide Kiev with another €5 billion ($5.6 billion) in military aid on top of the €28 billion it has given since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in early 2022, the German Defense Ministry has announced. Moscow has stated in response that further assistance to Ukraine could precipitate the“collapse”of Germany. The funds promised by Berlin would principally be used to“finance the production of long-range weapon systems in Ukraine,”the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius and his Ukrainian counterpart Rustem Umerov, who arrived in Berlin together with Vladimir Zelensky, signed a defense cooperation deal between the two countries. “A significant number”of long-range weapon systems can be manufactured inside Ukraine this year, the statement read without specifying the types of arms. The first of those weapons could be deployed by Kiev against Russian forces“in just a few weeks”as Ukrainian troops are already familiar with them and will not require additional training, it added. The €5 billion would also cover German deliveries of ammunition, including for air defense systems, small arms and medical equipment, the ministry said. During a joint press conference with Zelensky on Wednesday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that Berlin and Kiev“want to ensure joint production”of long-range armaments, but declined to reveal any details. There will be no range restrictions on the weapons and Kiev will be allowed to attack targets outside its own territory, he stressed. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reacted to Merz’s statement by saying that Berlin’s“direct involvement in the war is now obvious.” “Germany is sliding down the same slippery slope it already followed a couple of times in the last century – down toward its own collapse,”Lavrov stressed, referring to the defeats suffered by the country in the First and Second World wars. Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Western arms deliveries to Ukraine will not stop it from reaching its military objectives, but will only prolong the conflict and raise the risk of a confrontation with NATO. The Kremlin warned that the latest“provocative actions”by EU states could derail the US-brokered diplomatic process between Russia and Ukraine, which restarted last month after a three-year break.",

    "title": "How to start a war with Russia in these easy steps: Just ask Merz’s Germany",
    "article_text": "If in a dark hole, dig deeper, especially even deeper than feckless German ex-chancellor Olaf Scholz. That seems to be Berlin’s new motto. Under Friedrich Merz’s new mis-management, the German government is clearly setting out to worsen its current abysmal non-relationship with Russia. That is a sadly ambitious aim, because things are already more dire than they’ve been at any point since 1945. But Merz and his team, it seems, are not satisfied with playing a key role in fighting a proxy war against Russia that has been a ruinous fiasco; not for the Russian economy, but for Germany’s. Even by February 2023,German mainstream media reported that the war had sliced 2.5 percent off GDP. That, by the way, is a large figure in and of itself, but consider that between 2022 and 2024 Germany’s annual GDP growth (or, really, reduction) rate hasvariedbetween-0.3 percent (2023) and +1.4 percent, and it looks even worse. And yet, instead of sincerely – and finally – trying to use diplomacy to end this war against Russia via Ukraine, Merz’s Berlin is now taking the risk of escalating the current mess into the nightmare of a direct military clash between Russia and Germany (and, hence, presumably NATO – though not necessarily including the US any longer). Such a confrontation would be devastating in a manner that Germans have not experienced for a long time,as even a recent German TV documentary had to admit, despite its obvious purpose to boost the country’s current re-militarization-on-steroids. The single most obvious symbol of Berlin’s new, industrial-strength recklessness is the Taurus cruise missile, a sophisticated, very expensive weapon (at €1-3 million each) with a full name you will want to forget (Target Adaptive Unitary and Dispenser Robotic Ubiquity System) and, crucially, a maximum range of about 500 kilometers. The government under Scholz, breathtakingly incompetent and shamelessly submissive to the US as it was, never agreed to let Ukraine have this weapon. For, in essence, two reasons: The Taurus, once in Ukraine, could fire deep into Russia, even as far as Moscow, and it is undeniable that it can only be operated with direct German help, which would bring about a state of war between Moscow and Berlin. Merz, however, has created avagueyet substantial impressionthat delivering the Taurus to Kiev is an option again. Throughout this war – and its prehistory, too – Russia has been sending clear warnings about what such a war might entail:According to Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, for instance, Germany is“already directly engaging”in the Ukraine War. But clearly, he, too, sees room for things to get much worse again, with, in his words, Germany“sliding down the same slippery slope it has already treaded a couple of times just this past century – down to its collapse.” Dmitry Peskov, spokesman of President Vladimir Putin, has underlined that Merz’s statements, muddled as they were, pointed to a“serious escalation.”Less diplomatically, the head of Russia’s RT,Margarita Simonyan, has explainedthat German-Ukrainian Taurus strikes on Russian cities could provoke a Russian missile strike on Berlin. An important Russian military expert, meanwhile,has mentioned the possibility of a strike against Taurus production facilities in Germany. Are these warnings any help? Of course, German politicians would not openly admit to being successfully deterred by Moscow, but it is a fact that Merz has abstained from following through on his implied threat of transferring the Taurus to Ukraine. If he had wanted to do so, the visit of Ukraine’s leader Vladimir Zelensky in Berlin would have provided an excellent opportunity to close the deal. Yet, instead of the hotly desired cruise missiles,Zelensky has received something else: a demonstrative use of the German informal you (“du”), plenty of money (again), and a promise that Germany will help build long-range weapons in Ukraine. Considering that Moscow has just demonstrated its ability to strike such production facilities anywhere in Ukraine, that promise is the equivalent of a cop-out. For now at least. That is a good thing. It avoids an immediate, extremely dangerous escalation. Yet Merz and his experts are naïve if they believe that there will be no Russian response to their declared intention to transfer German know-how to Ukraine so that long-range weapons can be made there. For one thing,Moscow has just demonstrated its ability to strike Ukraine’s military industry. At the same time, even the Taurus is by no means off the table. Neither are Russian warnings about the catastrophic consequences of its use.The Russian Defense Ministryis confident that its air defenses could stop Taurus strikes, but also emphasizes that its special ability to fly far into Russia constitutes a problem in a class all by itself. What is the new Berlin even trying to do here? Negotiations to end the war are ongoing, even if Merz claims the opposite. Russia is not, as he repeats, merely“playing for time.”In reality, the second round of the Istanbul 2.0 talks is now scheduled to go ahead,at least as far as Moscow is concerned. The real problem for Western politicians like Merz is that Moscow is not willing to abandon its own interests or comply with unilateral demands backed up by threats. Indeed,if a plausible Reuters report based on leaksis correct, Putin has outlined Russia’s conditions for a realistic settlement once again: unsurprisingly, they include a complete stop to NATO expansion, an at least partial end to sanctions against Russia and to attempts to fully seize frozen Russian sovereign assets, the genuine neutrality of Ukraine, and protection for its Russian-speakers. Against this background, Merz’s recent sallies are only more puzzling: Russia is not weak but winning this war. A summer offensive may be close and make Ukraine’s situation even more untenable. But there also is a genuine opportunity to exploit negotiations that have been restarted so as to finally limit the losses to both Ukraine and the West. Meanwhile, the reluctance of the US to reliably back up a hard course against Russia could permit the NATO-EU Europeans to explore constructive alternatives to the ongoing proxy war. Indeed, it should be their worst nightmare to be left alone with this conflict if Moscow and Washington should break through to a full détente. The German economy will not thrive – even with a hail-Mary boost of debt-based military Keynesianism, as now launched by Merz – unless its relationship with Russia is reframed. Last but not least, Ukraine will not be rebuilt before there is a durable peace. And Berlin’s response to all of the above? More of the same, but worse. Now, with the Taurus back on the options menu and open announcements to help Ukraine build, in essence, its own version of it, presumably under intense German coaching and packed with German technology, Kiev’s chances are not better and Germany’s position is more precarious. The probability of an escalation into a direct Russian-German war remains even higher than before Merz’s new initiative, and the probability of peace has been reduced. Call it a lose-lose.",

    "title": "CIA running out of international informants and spies – WaPo",
    "article_text": "The CIA is grappling with difficulties in recruiting foreign informants and“needs more spies,”The Washington Post reported on Wednesday, citing current and former intelligence officials. Chief among the problems the sources listed is the global proliferation of public surveillance systems and advances in facial recognition, which make it harder for operatives to avoid detection. CIA Deputy Director Michael Ellis acknowledged the issue in a recent publicinterview, saying that although“some of the tools and techniques from the 1960s or ‘70s might still work today, a lot of them need to be updated and refreshed.” Other officials pointed to past setbacks, according to the WaPo, including the agency’s aggressive recruitment of Chinese officials in the early 2000s. Beijing’s security forces later dismantled that network, reportedly imprisoning and executing up to two dozen CIA assets. The COVID-19 pandemic also hindered operations, the report said, by disrupting face-to-face meetings with informants due to lockdowns and travel restrictions. US President Donald Trump’s current plan to close 10 embassies and 17 consulates as part of budget cuts threatens to further reduce the CIA’s footprint globally. In an effort to attract defectors, the CIA has produced what the reports described as“Hollywood-quality”videos targeting Russian and Chinese audiences, which have been distributed via social media.

    "title": "Ukraine needed Western help to target Putin’s helicopter – Scott Ritter",
    "article_text": "Ukraine must have relied on assistance from the West if it did in fact target a helicopter carrying Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, former US Marine Corps intelligence officer and UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter has told RT. Russian air defense division commander Yury Dashkin told the Russia 1 channel last week that Putin’s helicopter had been caught in the“epicenter”of a massive Ukrainian drone attack during a visit to Kursk Region on May 20. The intensity of aerial incursions“increased significantly”when the president was in the air, with 46 incoming fixed-wing UAVs being shot down in the area, he said. In an interview with RT on Wednesday, Ritter stressed that“if the Ukrainians drones actually targeted the Russian president, they did not do so in a vacuum... there would have been assistance provided by the West, which means that the West is targeting the Russian president.” “If you read the Russian nuclear doctrine, this is a trigger for Russian nuclear retaliation or preemptive strikes. So, who is playing with fire here? It is not Vladimir Putin who is playing with fire. It is Ukraine and the West that are playing with fire,”he added. The former US Marine Corps major was referring to a comment by US President Donald Trump, who claimed earlier this week that Putin was“playing with fire.” The statement by Trump followed large-scale Russian strikes against Ukrainian military infrastructure, which Moscow said were retaliation for the intensification of drone attacks by Kiev on civilian targets inside Russia. According to the Defense Ministry in Moscow, more than 2,300 Ukrainian UAVs have been intercepted over the past week above Russian territory, mostly away from the front line. Ritter expressed concern that there is a split in the US administration between opponents of Russia and those who are in favor of improving ties with Moscow. But at the same time, representatives of both camps and Trump himself are no experts on Russia, he added. The US president“is a victim of basically the last words whispered into his ear before he goes to bed at night or the first words whispered into his ear when he wakes up in the morning… Trump is not well briefed [on Russia]. Look, this is a very dangerous situation,”Ritter warned.",

    "title": "14 Best Denim Shorts for Men in 2025, According to GQ",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Take a deep breath: jorts are all the way back. But instead of the acid-blasted joints Agassi rocked with his epic mullet, the best denim shorts for men these days are a sobering, stylish look you’re not likely to regret. They weren’t always cool, obviously, but style gods like Justin Bieber and Timothée Chalamet have kept them in the fashion conversation for way longer than Agassi expected. Now we’ve come full circle andY2K fashion is all the rage again, jorts notwithstanding. The usual players have been cranking out men’s jean shorts forever. But now niche Japanese labels and ultra-rich luxury fashion houses have gotten in on the blue wave, too. Jorts also have cross-generational appeal, draping Y2K-pilled baddies and unironically cool dads alike. In a deep, dark rinse, and with abillowy button-upand loafers, jorts can be surprisingly elegant. (If you've got a baggy pair of jeans that's a little too thrashed to wear outside the house, you can even DIY your way to a wholly unique pair, frayed edges and all.) Point is, there are just about a million ways to celebrate their glorious return, so we pulled together a few of our favorites to help you enjoy the ride. Levi's Levi's Material:100% cotton| Fit:Loose fit, below the knee The first name in jeans is also our go-to pick for jorts. Levi's denim shorts are likely the image that pops into your head when you think of the category and of course that's no coincidence. We like the 469 fit for its '90s loose and breezy silhouette, sturdy, all-cotton denim, and range of washes. The 12\" inseam (footlong, baby!) may be intimidating for some folks, but the extra inches are more versatile than you think, especially with the slightly above average rise. And of course, you can easily have them hemmed to your preferred length (or just DIY them into cut-off jean shorts with a raw hem). Like any flagship product from Levi’s, these come in a ton of colorways and washes from your standard medium wash blue denim to light wash black denim, and more. Whether you wear these with T-shirts and hoodies, button-up shirts and loafers, or anything in-between, the famed Red Tab label will adapt to any style. Uniqlo Uniqlo Materials:100% cotton |Fit:Wide, long If you’ve got your belt cinched tighter, the best budget option in our experience comes from Uniqlo. Uniqlo’s Denim Work shorts are made of a lightweight all-cotton denim with workwear details like durable triple-needle stitching, reinforced pockets and belt-loops, and a roomy, knee-length fit. With an added hidden drawstring at the waist, you can easily adjust the fit. While it does come in three different washes (light wash, rinse, and black wash), none of them are particularly compelling. Give us more washes, Uniqlo. There are plenty of cheaper options on the market, some that cost as low as just twenty bucks. But the law of diminishing returns is a two-way street and we’ve found that the couple bucks you save isn’t worth the downgrade in quality. Carhartt WIP SSENSE Materials:13.5oz cotton denim |Fit:Relaxed fit While the legendary heritage brand Carhartt doesn't make denim shorts, its younger, hipper sibling does—and to the same freakishly high standards. These work jorts feature the brand’s sturdy Smith fabric, a heavyweight 13.5 oz. cotton denim, in a perfect stonewash, roomy fit, ever-so-slightly-above-the-knee length, and pockets aplenty. Whether you'll actually get around to using said pockets is another story, but you'll look cool regardless. If the carpenter shorts vibe with its double knees and extraneous pockets sound like a bunch of riff raff to you, don’t worry. Carhartt WIP offers its Smith denim in a variety of short styles including a single-knee version of these shorts as well as a more straight-forward five-pocket design. J.Crew J.Crew Materials:Cotton chambray |Fit:Straight Unless you’re Bing Crosby looking to spite a hoity-toity establishment, you’ll neverneedto wear denim to a formal affair. But you could simply wear dressy denim just because you want to. In the summer time, we’d suggest a pair of mid-thigh jean shorts with a mid-high rise and crisp pleats. That’s exactly what J.Crew offers. The one nitpick is that its shorts are technically chambray and not denim. But who are you? The denim police? Throw these on with loafers or boat shoes, and a breezy linen shirt for some East Coast energy, or even with a linen blazer and a knit polo to attend that very casual destination wedding. Tender Tender Materials:Cotton taunton |Fit:Regular fit Small-batch artisanal jorts sounds like a meme overdose or AI vomit. Ye of little faith. Such a thing does, in fact, exist and they’re way cooler than you think. Ultra-indie label Tender produces these shorts in a variety of materials, each dyed using natural dyes like indigo, woad, madder, and ochre. Construction details include triple-needle stitching and copper rivets, but the real magic comes with Tender’s clever use of darts which give the rear shape without a yoke and fits the hips without using side seams. For the dudes who have no clue what that means, don’t worry. Maybe these jorts aren’t for you, but the translation is this: fly shit. Stussy Stussy Materials:Cotton |Fit:Baggy SoCal’s very own Stussy has been pushing the denim shorts propaganda for several seasons and it is working. Every season, its Big ‘Ol denim shorts sell through faster than you can button up your fly. Theendless queuesare a major turnoff, but the hype is real. With hardy, beefy denim, top-tier construction, and a dialed-in baggy fit, the Big ‘Ol jorts are worth every penny. They pair well with a relaxed hoodie and canvas sneakers, of course. But we also like to pair the raw denim versions with a dressier button-up shirt and derbies for a high-low look. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie's loose denim shorts hit just below mid-thigh, a happy medium between the 5-inch-die-hards and the sub-knee stans. Plus, they're available in a rainbow of indigo hues and vintage-inspired washes for your gams to enjoy. Stan Ray Stan Ray True-blue workwear label Stan Ray's hickory-striped work shorts evoke images of sweat-pumping manual labor, even if you're main task is nollying a 6-stair. orSlow Blue In Green You're sure as hell not painting houses, let alone a portrait, but these throwback painter shorts from Japanese repro brand orSlow will give you Bob Ross energy nontheless. A Kind of Guise Mr Porter Washed-out denim, drawstring elastic waist, and a thigh-baring cut? These are the perfect denim shorts for lazy lounging or well-deserved vacays. Kapital Haven Kapital's masterful blend of antique and modern details means we get a pair of jorts that combines dressy elements with ancient techniques, all wrapped up in a beautifully washed and faded denim. AGolde Mr Porter In the No Man's Land between your calves and ankles lives the rare denim capri—a risky fashion move that could land you in Mount Olympus or Hades. Fortune favors the bold! Acne Studios Nordstrom You can't talk about baggy jeans without talking about Acne Studios, one of the four horsemen of the denimocalypse. These cavernous jorts are big enough to swallow a squad of Zoomers and sneak them into the movies. C.P. Company SSENSE These fatigue-style denim shorts from C.P. Company are some of the cleanest we've seen. With inky indigo denim, crispy contrast stitching, front patch pockets, rear flap pockets, and drawstrings at the cuffs, they're a perfect blend of workwear, militaria, and gorpwear. We’ve been riding high on the jorts wave for a while, but if their resurgence is still throwing you for a loop there’s plenty of ways to pull ‘em off without looking like you're about to mount a fixed-gear bike. The key, of course, comes down to fit. Thinkbig. Big, baggy, and very long. Like, below-the-knee long. With some equallyroomy graphic teesand Doc Martens, the right pair can pack all the bravado of a mosh pit-prone hardcore fan. But there’s also room for the more sultry and revealing denim shorts that reach above the mid-thigh, shorter than the sanctioned 5” inseams menswear has been touting for years. Think ‘70s level with some vacation-ready sandals or low-profile canvas kicks. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)

    "title": "The GQ Party That Inspired Lorde’s New Song ‘Man of the Year,’ Explained",
    "article_text": "On Thursday, New Zealand pop starLordedropped “Man of the Year,” the second single from her forthcoming album,Virgin, and a raw new music video to accompany it. It’s a song she’s described as an ode to her ongoing gender exploration; when she previewed iton Instagram, she called it “an offering from really deep inside me” and “the song I’m proudest of onVirgin.” For longtimeGQreaders, the song’s title may ring a bell: Since 1996, this magazine has hosted its annualMen of the Yearparty (colloquially referred to as “MOTY”) to celebrate our year-end print issue, which honors the entertainers, athletes, designers, and others whose work defined the culture that year. Ina new interviewwith the Australian radio show Triple J, Lorde said she began writing the song two years ago, the day after attendingGQ’s Men of the Year event in Los Angeles. On November 16, 2023, a bleach-blonde Lorde hitthe MOTY red carpetoutside the Chateau Marmont in a silky, emerald-green Acne Studios gown with a midriff cutout. It had been a little over two years since she’d released her third album,Solar Power—a mid-pandemic idyll about the blissed-out, if privileged, pleasures of touching grass and being stoned at the nail salon. She attended the party as a guest;that year’s honoreesincluded Jacob Elordi, Kim Kardashian, Travis Scott, and Tom Ford. Per the radio interview, the party brought up new feelings about her own identity and self-expression. In November 2023, Lorde hit the MOTY carpet in a green cutout dress by Acne Studios. “It was funny, I had been feeling this expansiveness of gender happening for a while, and this was my first event that I’d been to in a while, and I wore a kind of ‘hot girl’ dress, and I felt so not like myself,” Lorde said. “And it was a really cool marker, especially being at this event that was celebrating all these cool guys, I was like, ‘Oh, I’m one of those guys, like, sometimes, when I wanna be. And I was like, ‘Whoa, I don’t think the hot-girl dress is the right device for this moment.’” While “kind of hungover” in the studio the next day, Lorde began writing a song about “how I’m the Man of the Year, for me.” (Also that day, on November 17, sheshareda Getty-watermarked photo of herself from the event with the caption, “Some days I’m a woman, some days I’m a man.”) The resulting track, which was co-written with producer Jim-E Stack, memorializes her experience of feeling her gender “broaden and shift and bust out of me in this way that was really amazing to me and also really scary and emotional.” In a recentRolling Stoneprofile, Lorde recalled a conversation with fellow musician Chappell Roan: “She was like, ‘So, are you nonbinary now?’ And I was like, ‘I’m a woman except for the days when I’m a man.’ I know that’s not a very satisfying answer, but there’s a part of me that is really resistant to boxing it up.” In the music video for “Man of the Year,” Lorde seems to embrace the dueling notions of boundaries and boundlessness. The clip opens with the musician sitting on a chair as she strips off her white T-shirt and binds her breasts with duct tape, which allows her to bound freely across a large studio space filled with dirt. “I didn’t think he’d appear / Let’s hear it for the man of the year,” she sings. The soil-filled set is reminiscent ofThe New York Earth Room, a well-known 1977 earthworks piece by American artist Walter De Maria, which has occupied the second floor at 141 Wooster Street, a gallery in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood that’s run by the Dia Art Foundation, for nearly the last half-century. The 3,600-square-foot installation, which features mounds of dark soil protected by a glass barrier, emits a loamy scent and invokes a sense of spiritual circularity; the ground, teeming with life, is also where we go to die. On “Man of the Year” launch day, Lorde shared an all-caps paragraph on the homepage ofher websitelisting various experiences and sensations, including “THE GQ PARTY” and “THE NEW YORK EARTH ROOM,” that presumably inspired the song. The full text goes as follows: “BIKING. SMOKING. SWIMMING. NEW STRENGTH IN MY SHOULDERS. FEELING SOMETHING AWAKENING. FIRST TAPING MY CHEST. SO SCARED TO BE HIM. THE GQ PARTY. LAYING BACK ON THE WHITE COUCH W THE MIC IN MY HAND AND LETTING IT HAPPEN. SUN. PERSIMMONS AND WALNUTS. VOCALS WITH AMS. TRYING TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A FONTANA, LIKE PAINTING BITTEN BY A MAN, LIKE THE NEW YORK EARTH ROOM. THE SOUND OF MY REBIRTH.”",

    "title": "7 Best Vitamin C Serums of 2025 for Brighter, Healthier Skin",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. There are a lot ofserumsout there making a hell of a lot of promises, but the best vitamin C serums are where it's truly at. Vitamin C is one of the few ingredients that has earned its reputation and place in yourskin care routine. It’s been shown to help with everything fromhyperpigmentationto fine lines, and when you use it consistently, it can make your skin look brighter and clearer. Your friends and coworkers won’t even know you just rolled out of bed. The problem? A lot of vitamin C serums don’t work well. They’re either too weak to do anything, so harsh they leave your skin angry, or too unstable to last more than a few weeks. (Some oxidize before you can even get halfway through the bottle.) To make your serums last longer, you can store them in the fridge, but you’ll also want a product that tackles this problem before it starts with airtight packaging, a light-proof container, and additional ingredients like ferulic acid to stabilize the formula. So, I tested a bunch of them, including everything from TikTok bestsellers to dupes of high-end faves. Here are the best vitamin C serums I found—there’s something in here for every skin type and budget. Prequel Amazon Potency:15%Key Ingredients:L-ascorbic acid, ferulic acid, niacinamideSkin Types:All skin typesSize:30 ml Prequel is a relatively new brand, but they’ve nailed the basics here: vitamin C combined with ferulic acid and niacinamide to boost the healthy skin effects, in a formula that feels more expensive than it is. The 15% formula hits the sweet spot where you reap the benefits of vitamin C without it being too harsh on your skin. The consistency is lightweight, almost like a watery gel, and it absorbs immediately with only a touch of stickiness. This is one of the first vitamin C serums I ever used, and I applied it every morning for a few weeks straight and had no irritation or breakouts and my skin looked much more radiant. It’s not as instantly transformative as some of the stronger formulas, but it’s gentle enough to use daily. The niacinamide is meant to firm up the skin, which is obviously a bit harder to measure, but I did feel like I looked more refreshed when I woke up. It’s free of any fragrances and comes in an airless pump bottle, which helps keep the vitamin C stable for longer. Honestly, it’s one of the best entry points into vitamin C I’ve tried while still being suitable for long-time vitamin C users, and the $23 price tag makes it a no-brainer. CosRX Nordstrom Potency:23%Key Ingredients:L-Ascorbic Acid, vitamin E, hyaluronic acid, allantoinSkin Types:All except sensitive skinSize:20 ml Cosrx is a go-to affordable Korean skin care brand that’s earned its chops with the viralsnail mucin(which I also swear by), but this vitamin C serum is still criminally underrated. It’s one of the most potent on the market—23% pure L-ascorbic acid—and that strength shows up in how quickly it brightens dull skin. After two weeks of daily use, I noticed a visible difference in tone, especially around my cheeks and jawline where I usually have the most discoloration. It also helped fade a couple of leftover marks from a pesky breakout. It also works surprisingly well with moisturizer and SPF—no pilling or weird textures, even when layered. However, this is not a beginner serum. It’s powerful, and by the time I started using it, I had already been using other vitamin C serums for a year. It also has a distinct smell that isn’t exactly pleasant. Someone on Reddit said hotdogs, and while I don’t think it’s all that noticeable, it’s not exactly a relaxing, aromatic spa experience. Still, the smell disappears fast, and the results are worth it. The dropper bottle is smaller than others on this list, but the price reflects that. And vitamin C serum oxidizes (aka goes bad) way quicker than other products like moisturizers so it’s best to buy a small amount and order more frequently. When I use this daily, I go through it in about two months, which is COSRX’s recommended time frame. If you’ve already worked your way through lower-strength serums and want to graduate to something stronger, this is one of the best ways to do it without spending a small fortune. Niod Niod Potency:30%Key Ingredients:Ethyl ascorbic acid, superoxide dismutase, saccharomyces/zinc fermentSkin Types:All skin typesSize:30 ml NIOD—a high-end brand made by the same parent company as budget skin care line The Ordinary—takes a very scientific approach to skin care. This ELAN serum uses ethylated ascorbic acid, which is a more stable and less irritating form of vitamin C compared to traditional L-ascorbic acid. And it’s dosed pretty high—30 percent, making it one of the most concentrated serums you can buy. But because it is ethylated, it won’t have the same harsh effects as a pure l-ascorbic acid serum would have at this concentration. What I like about this serum is that it doesn’t try to do too much by mixing in a bunch of other ingredients. NIOD recommends avoiding use with retinols (so if you’re going to use both in the evening, alternate days), but otherwise, it’s pretty easy to layer with the rest of your skin care products without worrying you’re overdoing it on ceramides or hyaluronic acid. I also like the texture: It feels richer and easier to absorb than other formulas. CeraVe Amazon Potency:10%Key Ingredients:Vitamin C, ceramides, hyaluronic acidSkin Types:All skin typesSize:30 ml If you’re new to vitamin C or just want something gentle and unfussy, CeraVe’s formula is about as solid as it gets. It contains 10% L-ascorbic acid plus hyaluronic acid for hydration and ceramides to support your skin barrier. It’s fragrance-free, allergy-tested, and developed with dermatologists, which makes it feel like a product you can trust even if your skin tends to react badly to anything new. And it’s so hydrating that when I apply it, my skin has a serious glow to it. This is the serum I recommend to friends who are vitamin C curious but want something easy in their routine. It has a lightweight, lotion-like texture that disappears into skin without any stickiness. It’s also one I’d come back to when my skin is irritated and I need something soothing and effective. Bonus: it works well with the brand’s Vitamin C Eye Repair Cream (which has an even lower dose for the thin skin around the eyes) which I like for tackling the puffiness I always wake up with. Indie Lee Nordstrom Potency:Not listedKey Ingredients:Squalane oil, rosehip seed, avocado oil, ceramidesSkin Types:Dry/sensitive skinSize:30 ml If your skin leans dry and you don’t want to add another step to your routine, this serum hybrid is a great blend to get both brightening and hydration. Instead of using pure L-ascorbic acid, it gets its vitamin C content from botanical sources like rosehip and avocado oils. That makes it less effective (and not as researched backed), but also less irritating. It’s packed with squalane oil to hydrate, plus ceramides to help repair your skin barrier. I reach for this when I want that dewy, glowy look without having to pile on multiple products. It’s definitely on the oilier side, so if you’re wearing it during the day, you’ll want to give it time to absorb before applying sunscreen or moisturizer (and heads up: it can pill under heavier SPF formulas). I wouldn’t use this if your main goal is to fade dark spots or acne scars quickly, but it’s excellent for hydration, subtle brightening, and giving your face a healthy-looking glow. Timeless Skin Care Amazon Potency:20%Key Ingredients:L-Ascorbic acid, alpha tocopherol (pure vitamin E), ferulic acidSkin Types:All skin typesSize:30 ml If you’re done any research about vitamin C, you’ve probably come across SkinCeuticals—an $180 formula that is the point of debate between derms and skin care content creators. Timeless doesn’t have a ton of name recognition, but this serum rivals that cult-favorite at a fraction of the price. It uses the same power trio of ingredients (L-ascorbic acid, vitamin E, and ferulic acid) in a formula that feels light and disappears fast. The texture is thin—almost runny—so it’s easy to spread and layers nicely under other products. It’s suitable for all skin types, but if you’re sensitive, you may want to go with the 10% formula instead of the more potent 20%. Since it’s made with pure l-ascorbic acid, Timeless recommends keeping it in the fridge and using it consistently once opened. That said, the brand reformulated the packaging a while back, and it now comes in an opaque pump bottle that helps block out light and air—both essential for keeping vitamin C effective. Sunday Riley Nordstrom Potency:15%Key Ingredients:THD Ascorbate, phytosterols complex, saccharide isomerate extract, glycolic acidSkin Types:All skin typesSize:30 ml This creamy serum feels like one of the nicest to use: It’s similar to a light moisturizer, which feels a lot more luxurious and a lot less sticky. Sunday Riley’s formula uses tetrahexyldecyl (THD) ascorbate, a fat-soluble derivative of vitamin C that many dermatologists swear by because it’s more stable (aka it will last a lot longer on your shelf) and better tolerated by sensitive skin. This serum also includes glycolic acid which gently exfoliates, apparently enhancing the effects of the vitamin C. It layers well, doesn’t pill, and doesn’t have that weird metallic smell that some L-ascorbic acid formulas do. If you’re a skin care minimalist, this one checks a lot of boxes. It’s pricey, but the thoughtful formulation and ease of use make it worth the splurge because you know you’ll be able to get a lot of use out of it. Active Ingredients:L-ascorbic acid is the pure form of vitamin C with the most research behind it, and widely regarded as one of the most effective. But it is also the one most likely to irritate your skin and is known to have a very short shelf life. I like it when I want something strong and fast-acting, but during seasons when my skin is feeling reactive, I’ll switch to THD ascorbate or ethyl ascorbic acid. If you have oily or sensitive skin, these forms of vitamin C are less irritating and may be worth considering. They’re also more stable, so they won’t oxidize as quickly. Vitamin C isn’t the only active ingredient in these serums though. Ferulic acid is another add-on that helps to stabilize the formula and make the antioxidant effects more powerful. Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3 that improves skin texture and reduces inflammation, and it pairs well with vitamin C. Concentration:The strongest serum isn’t always the best option, especially if you’re new to vitamin C. Serums with 10–20% vitamin C tend to strike a fine balance where you’ll get the benefits and most people’s skin can tolerate it. If you’ve never used vitamin C before, starting closer to 10% makes sense. Higher concentrations like 23 to 30% can deliver faster results, especially when it comes to clearing up dark spots, but they’re best suited for people who know their skin won’t freak out. Packaging:Vitamin C breaks down quickly when exposed to air, heat, and light, so packaging is actually very important. To keep your serum from going bad before you finish the bottle, look for airtight pumps or opaque containers. Clear dropper bottles are still common, and they’re not exactly a deal breaker but they should be stored in a cool, dark place like a fridge or a drawer away from sunlight. I use a lot of dropper bottles, like the Cosrx serum, but only when I know I’ll be working through it quickly. Texture:Some vitamin C serums drip on like water, while others lather like a face oil or a lotion. No one texture is better than another—it really comes down to personal preference, your skin type, and whatever else you’re layering it with. In the mornings, I usually prefer a thinner serum that absorbs quickly and won’t mess with mySPF. If I want to look dewy, I go for something a bit oily, which works wonders for drier skin but may pill under sunscreen or makeup. Can I use vitamin C serum every day? Yes, most people can use vitamin C serum regularly if they choose the right product for their skin type. Nearly all vitamin C serums are designed for daily use, either in the morning (before sunscreen!) or at the end of the day. The morning is a great time because vitamin C is an antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals from the sun that can harm your skin, basically enhancing the effects of the SPF. Nighttime application is also an okay option (and some brands like NIOD recommend this), and certain serums are even gentle enough to be used twice a day—and I often do that. If you’re using a high-strength formula or have sensitive skin, start slow (every other day) and work your way up. Do I really need to refrigerate my vitamin C serum? Not always, but it helps to get the most out of the bottle because keeping your vitamin C serum in the fridge can slow oxidation. If the packaging is airtight, it’s notascrucial, but it’s never a bad idea to throw a pure l-ascorbic acid product in a fridge if you have one handy. Although if you never use your vitamin C because it’s all the way in your kitchen, it might not be worth it. How do I know if my vitamin C has gone bad? If the color darkens to an orange, brown, or rusty huge, it’s probably oxidized and no longer effective. (Although expired vitamin C serums aren’t necessarily bad for you—they just won’t do anything.) Some slight yellowing over time is normal—and some formulas come with a slight tint out of the box because of the ingredients—but you shouldn’t see significant changes from the day you open it. The world of skin care is vast and wide, so to find the best vitamin C serums, we first researched the brands and products that other skin care obsessives loved to use. After we found the most popular products, we subjected our own skin to these vitamin C serums and evaluated how they worked in both the short-term and long-term. While these are the best vitamin C serums we used, results will vary across people because of natural differences between skin.",

    "title": "10 Best Creatine Supplements for Bigger Gains in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Your mom thinks it’s steroids, your gym bros think it’s amagic powder that gets you jackedovernight: Unfortunately, the best creatine supplements are decidedlyneitherof those things. That being said, creatine is one of the mostthoroughlystudiedsupplementson the market—a veritable beacon of hope in an otherwise largely unregulated industry—that actually does help boost strength, athletic performance, and muscle mass to a small (but not insignificant!) degree. “I recommend [creatine] to anyone who wants to improve strength, power, and lean muscle mass growth,” Mike Dewar, strength coach and founder ofJ2FIT, says. “Somenewer studiesshow that creatine can also improve brain health.” I’ve personally been taking five grams of creatine every day for years, and pretty much every seriousgym ratI know swears by the stuff. (Of course, you should consult with your healthcare provider before taking any dietary supplement.) Will creatine magically make you avascular, engorged freakbeast overnight? No. Will it—when coupled with hard training and good recovery—help with your gains? For sure. If you’re not sure where to start, check out our top picks for the best creatine supplements below. Nutricost Nutricost If you’ve read anything I’ve written aboutprotein powderor supplements, you know that I’ve got a soft spot for Nutricost. The value here is really solid, and if you’re just looking for a big tub of creatine monohydrate—the only kind of creatine you should be buying, by the way—you can’t go wrong with Nutricost. (It also has the standard dose of five grams per scoop, which is key.) I’m partial to the unflavored version, since I don’t really mind the taste, but the brand offers a bunch of different options, ranging from Blue Raspberry to Mandarin Orange. If you’re looking for something to whack into a protein shake or slug down with some water, this is your best bet. Gorilla Mind Amazon Walmart It’s easy to get bogged down in the supplement aisle—I myself am certainly guilty of having a few cabinets in my kitchen that look more like a GNC than I’d care to admit. For those trying to streamline their supplementation regimen, taking a pre-workout that has your daily dose of creatine built into the formula is a great way to get two birds stoned at once. With a grip of decent flavors and both stim and stim-free options, this is a solid choice for gym rats everywhere. (This also happens to be our top pick forthe best pre-workoutfor resistance training on the market.) One thing to note, though: Creatine only works if you take it every day, so on rest days, it’s best to use a regular creatine supplement instead. BulkSupplements Amazon Don’t mess with powders and potions? We feel you. For on-the-go meatheaderry, I like to pack these creatine pills instead of making a mess trying to funnel a bunch of powder into, say, an airport water bottle using a rolled-up magazine. (Though if you're going to go that route, make sure you usean issue ofGQ.) A word of warning, though: The serving size for these issevenpills, which is (obviously) a lot of pills. It never bothers me, but it's good to keep in mind. Legion Amazon More of aFlintstonesvitamin dude? You’re in luck: Legion makes some delicious creatine gummies that are truly a joy to eat. Is hammering five gummies the most efficient way to get your creatine in? Probably not—but it make every morning a little more fun, which is always worth it in our book. Nutricost Nutricost For on-the-go supplementation, it’s tough to beat these little stick packs of creatine from Nutricost—especially if you’re not a fan of knocking back a handful of horse pills. They come in a ton of great flavors, and contain your tried-and-true five grams of creatine monohydrate in each stick. They're not as cheap as bulk powder, but you're paying for convenience. Animal Amazon While these chewable creatine tablets from Animal are marginally less fun than the gummies we listed above, they’re marginallymorefun than an unflavored powder or a handful of gel-caps. Animal is an OG in the supplement game, and if you’ve been in the iron game for a while, you might remember their old school black-and-white print ads or theAnimal Cageat the Arnold. Huge Supplements Amazon My girlfriend absolutely loves this creatine from Huge Supplements, since she's not a fan of slugging back unflavored powder. Plus, it mixes well and isn't too expensive. Transparent Labs Amazon I’m not going to comment on the science of HMB, but a lot of people swear by it, and Transparent Labs is a great company with—of course—transparent ingredients lists and a slew of certifications. It also contains your tried-and-true five grams of creatine monohydrate in each serving and comes in a grip of flavors. Nutricost Amazon While youprobablydon't need extra amino acids in your diet, you definitely need them in general, and this formula has a ton of 'em. Great flavors, well-dosed creatine, and an affordable price tag? Sign us up. Optimum Nutrition Amazon Hydration and creatine go hand-in-hand, and this blend of electrolytes and creatine monohydrate is a great way to get two birds stoned at once for pennies on the dollar. Dose:For most people, five grams (often listed as 5,000mg on nutrition labels to… make it seem like more?) is going to be the sweet spot. There's anecdotal evidence that bigger guys see bigger gains with bigger doses of creatine—and some studies suggest doses up to 20 grams a day help with cognitive function—but five grams is where it's at, IMO. Plus, going above five grams is tough on the ol' stomach, anecdotally. Type:Stick with creatine monohydrate. This is the gold standard and the most researched kind of creatine on the market with no additives. Every other type of creatine is pretty much just marketing. Why Should People Take Creatine? What Are the Benefits of Creatine? “Creatine is one of the most researched and scientifically proven legal supplements on the market to increase strength, power, sprint performance, and muscle size,” Dewar says. “Creatine works to improve ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production, which is the main energy source the body uses for forceful and rapid muscle contractions. This energy source, however, also depletes quickly… so having ample amounts in the system just helps you always keep your ‘gas tank’ full. This can also aid in recovery, as creatine is part of all skeletal muscle tissue, and is constantly being used and replenished during hard training.” Who Should Take Creatine? TL;DR: It's not just for bodybuilders. “Creatine is used by all ages, abilities, and body types, as physiologically our bodies require it as one of the earliest forms of energy to promote muscle function,” Dewar explains. “That said, I recommend it to anyone who wants to improve strength, power, and lean muscle mass growth. Additionally, there are some newer studies showing that creatine can also improve brain health. All in all, it’s something that has no downsides, in all the literature. I recommend people shoot for at least three grams a day, however five grams is the standard dose. While these aren’t usually standardized for body size, I find that five to eight grams is a solid option for larger individuals who train very hard and are more advanced.” Do I Need to “Load” Creatine? No, Dewar says. Since creatine can take weeks to produce any noticeable effects, some folks opt to “load” it—a.k.a. take around 20 grams a day for the first week, in an effort to expedite the process with a loading phase. “Just taking [five grams] daily with some carbs is best,” he explains. Anecdotally, I notice some gastrointestinal side effects at doses higher than five grams. What Is the Best Creatine to Take? Creatine monohydrate is the gold standard when it comes to the best form of creatine to build muscle and help with exercise performance. How Do I Supplement With Creatine? Take five grams a day, every day, and pray for muscle growth. In my 15 years of strength training, I’ve taken atonof creatine, from no-name Wal-Mart brands to high-end, probably-too-expensive tubs from the newest, most hyped-up DTC brands in the game. Plus, I also consulted with my network ofmeatheadstesters, which includes my fellow gym rats office, former NCAA athletes,NASM- andACE-certified trainers, and competitive BJJ grapplers. Mike Dewar is the founder and strength coach atJ2FIT. With 13+ years of experience as a personal trainer, five years as a NCAA Strength Coach at New York University, and over 550+ published fitness and nutrition articles, he knows a thing or two about fitness. He also holds a masters in Exercise Physiology from Columbia University and a bachelors in Exercise Science from Bowling Green State University in Ohio. You can check him out onInstagramandYouTube.",

    "title": "The 2025 GQ Home Awards",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. We’velounged, kicked our feet up, and raised a few hundred glasses—all in the name of research—because, if you can believe it, the 2025GQHome Awards are here, and this year's class is a colorful, happy-go-lucky bunch of goods that bypass the boring, and insist that your home can (and should be!) fun. With zigzags, waves, rounded edges, andprintsgalore, this year’s winners take the edge off a decade of too-serious design and inspire you to be bold. Scroll down deep enough and you may very well insist that you never pat dry with awhite towelagain. We commend you. To make it easy to navigate this list, we’ve broken things down by room. Maybe you need something specific—say, some non-boring wine glasses for a fête on Friday. We’ve got that! Perhaps you’re looking for some general inspiration for the living room and you just want to see what you see. Scroll on! By chance, if you’re the guy who wants to know what thebest vacuumon the planet is, you also won’t be disappointed. The point is, now that you’re here—as your hosts—we’re determined to give you a comfy stay. So, grab a bev, relax in yourcomfiest chairand let’s get to it. The Best Sofas: Sixpenny Gabriel Sofa and House of Leon Palazzo Sofa Sixpenny Sixpenny House of Leon House of Leon Waves, wood, and weaves that feel extra earthy, this year’s sofas draw inspiration from nature and make us want to invest in bringing the best of the great outdoors inside. The Sixpenny Gabriel—from the brand that is known for its cloud-like couches—instead brings texture and clean lines into your living room. For something sleeker, the Palazzo has an architectural white oak base paired with jewel-toned velvets that don't feel too heavy here. by Aimee Song Lulu & Georgia For some time, the ottoman sectional has taken up space in the collective consciousness—and sure, our living rooms too—but with a chubby bubble silhouette, Neve demands justice for the corner sectional. We like it in the boucle and performance fabrics, but it's magic in velvet. Koala Koala A far cry from the rickety old pull-out couch that lived in your grandma’s basement, Koala has reimagined thesleeper sofawith a fold-out design that our testers say is as comfy as a regular ol' bed. It doesn’t have any innersprings or a clunky foundation that make it way too firm; instead, the cushions envelop you and feel cushy and comforting. Bonus points for the hidden storage compartments that are great for midnight munchies. Sundays Sundays The Hershey's Kiss of living room furniture, the Sundays’ Close to You Chair is just seventies enough to move and groove with your other interiors without feeling too contrived. Thanks to modern upgrades like performance velvet, you’ll be able to keep it for another generation to come. Ferm Living Ferm Living No one does mass furniture that looks bespoke better than Copenhagen design house Ferm Living. Case in point: the Can Lis collection, a collaboration that draws inspiration from Sydney Opera House architect Jørn Utzon's Mallorca family home. Our favorite in the lot: The Deya Coffee Table, a fiber concrete coffee table with a hunter green glaze that lives comfortably inside and out. The Citizenry The Citizenry The Citizenry is known for bringing us goods that are sustainably sourced and designed from a network of artisans around the world. The Mayra Marble side table, designed by a team in Jodhur, India, uses mixed materials—a green-gray marble and oak—and because of the differences in each slab of marble, each piece itself is unique. Hay Shop at Hay Montana Furniture Design Within Reach Despite being some of the biggest pieces of furniture in our homes, many storage and shelving gives off duck-and-hide energy—but as you’ll see with the colorful options from Hay and Montana Furniture ask you to look closer. The Hay Colour Cabinet Floor is an excellent media cabinet, with space to stash old-school DVDs and new consoles alike. Meanwhile, the Panton Wire Shelving calls you to put your best and brightest on display rather than letting it collect dust over in the corner. Ready to Hand Design Within Reach Last year, we handed over the award for the best mirror to Ready to Hand for their supremely cool Zipper Mirror. This year, the brand just dropped the Petal Mirror, a tortoise-accented looking glass that has us looking to free up some more wall space. Sophie Lou Jacobsen Sophie Lou Jacobsen Sophie Lou Jacobsen's drinking glasses have been on the tabletops of our coolest friends for the last few years. Now, her Gemma Table Lamp—a collaboration with the design studio In Common With—has us saving our pretty pennies. Utilizing Venetian glassblowing techniques that affixes the dots down the side to the lamp, this vessel feels ever so slightly mycological, as if it was harvested straight from the field already aglow. Schoolhouse Schoolhouse Lighting fixtures can often feel a little too ornate for everyday spaces, but the Barnes Linear Chandelier from Schoolhouse takes a different approach, drawing inspo from mid-century office lighting. It’s assembled in Portland and the vibe of the piece mirrors that of Stumptown—easygoing and approachable. Choose from four colorways, each of which houses two long LED bulbs. Revival Rugs Revival Rugs Nordic Knots Nordic Knots If you pick it correctly, therugin your room can do most of the talking for your space. Go big with Nordic Knots’ current “it rug” Big Buds. It’s designed by Giancarlo Valle to resemble his family’s hand-painted Latin American furniture and made of soft-as-a-dream New Zealand wool so underfoot it never feels too bristly. If you’re looking instead for something slightly more wallet-friendly, you’ll never go wrong with a Revival Rug, like the wool hand loomed rug, which comes in three colorways, each of which wear well over time. Sun at Six Sun at Six California-cool Sun at Six catches our eye with every new launch, but this year, we're here to celebrate the Zafal Dining Table. Made of white oak in three distinct finishes, it features zigzag table legs that are unique and interesting without ever needing to try too hard—kinda like the brand itself. Billani 1911 Artemest A color-blocked chair that’s equal parts artistic and industrial, this Billiani 1911 piece matches varying materials and hues to deliver a sense of individuality in a world of lookalike, mass-produced seats. Fatboy USA Fatboy USA There’s something about the Jolley Trolley Bar Cart that feels a little like it was engineered for Wonka. Maybe it’s the oversized wheel or the puffy dome light up top, but we’re pretty sure that whether this thing is loaded up with chocolate or cocktails, you’re going to have a good time. Holcomb Holcomb The Tupperware parties of yore would shutter if they saw this handsome, walnut salad bowl from Holcomb. Every detail from the magnetic salad servers to the lid that nests below the bowl when in use make it a show-stopping piece. Just remember to put your name on the bottom, so no one else gets to go home with it. Sam Stewart Sam Stewart Your pepper mill doesn't have to be extra…peppy, but if you buy the Ritz Mill from North Carolina artist Sam Stewart, you might get just that. The swervy design in both translucent and opaque colored resins allows you to mix and match for a duo that put's your mom's boring S and P shakers to shame. Sabre Paris Sabre Paris You don't really know that your flatware is falling flat until you see Sabre Paris's Bistrot collection. With colorful acrylic handles and French design, these sets feel ornamental and festive, making every meal a cause to celebrate. Prada Prada The glass you hand a guest in your home says something about you. Basic barware will always do, but for those looking for something with more personality, you’ll never go wrong with the set of Fazeek’s colorful coups or glasses. This set of four spans the brand’s best-selling colors, but you can also buy individual colors if you can settle on which one you like the most. Meanwhile, Prada’s red wine glasses are a divine hostess gift and they look just as darling perched on your own coffee table if you decide to cancel your plans and stay at home. Fazeek SSENSE The glass you hand a man in your home says something about you. Basic barware will always do, but for those looking for something with more personality, you’ll never go wrong with the set of Fazeek’s colorful coups or glasses. This set of four spans the brand’s best-selling colors, but you can also buy individual colors if you can settle on which one you like the most. Meanwhile, Prada’s red wine glasses are a divine hostess gift and they look just as darling perched on your own coffee table if you decide to cancel your plans and stay at home. Made In Made In Misen Misen With the dizzying number of DTC cookware brands on the scene these days, it’s hard to know where to start shopping for new pans. Usually, your kitchen aptitude is a good place to start. For beginners, the design-y cookware brand Made In recently launched a nonstick rendition of its buzzy five-ply stainless clad frying pan. For the slightly more accomplished, try Misen’s stainless-steel cookware set, which doesn’t break the bank and will hold up for years. Fellow Fellow I’m not going to say that the editors ofGQare coffee snobs, but I’m alsonotgoing to say that. These guys love their pour overs, lap down cortados from the best-of-the-best machines, and can tell when a cup just isn’t up to snuff—so it’s with great gusto that we award the Fellow Aiden the best coffee pot the second year running (the brand’s got an espresso machine on the horizon we’re dying to get our hands on, BTW). The idea behind the machine is that it makes pour-over quality coffee in a machine, all controlled by an app that allows you to tweak the intricacies of the brew so that it stands up toGQ’s high standards. Bodum Moma Store Scandi-inspired Bodum has been making electric kettles for eons but this happy-go-lucky color-blocked one from the MoMA Store has us gushing. It has a whopping 34-ounce capacity, and its rapid boil function means that you can have a full pot of pour-over coffee on the table mere minutes after the caffeine calls you. Canopy Canopy No matter how good your cleansers and creams are, if you have water that has loads of contaminants and chlorine, you could be disrupting your skin barrier and irritating your complexion. Canopy (the brand that made humidifiers for cool again) set out to solve this problem with its new faucet filter that’s designed to remove odors and contaminants from your water supply. Parachute Parachute 2025 is the year of the striped towel, and our favorite happen to be these organic cotton ribbed bath sheets from Parachute, which absorb water without too much fuss while looking great on a hook (cough cough: or the floor). Quiet Town Quiet Town Brooklyn-based Quiet Town’s End Bits linen shower curtain has gone Bode in the bathroom, making its patchwork feel charming and inviting. The brand’s bathroom rugs and shower caddies always top our list for gifts, but you should do yourself a solid and stock up on the shower curtain pronto. Tekla Tekla Hawkins New York Hawkins New York Lindquist Lindquist More is more when you’re making thebed—layer up different textures, colors, and plenty of pillows to make a bed that’s as comfy as it is your own. Start with a crisp percale duvet from Copenhagen-based Tekla that feels like you’re curling up with a perfectly worn T-shirt (be daring and spring for the signature stripes). Then, layer on Hawkins’ supremely soft simple linen quilt which comes in a veritable rainbow of color options. Finish with a Lindquist wool blanket for the coldest nights, which will have your guests Googling where you got it. Room and Board Room and Board Many outdoor sofas heavy up on materials like teak to stay dry, but the Room and Board Drift sofa is made from quick-drying foam and has a design that looks like it belongs in the family den. The extra-loungey sofa comes in upwards of 50 fabrics that wear well in the elements, and you can choose from four different lengths depending on your space. Neighbor Neighbor Mosquitos and flys can’t get you down when you own the Neighbor XY Dining Set, which takes the edge off alfresco dining. This table set for four is made from powder-coated aluminum, with four chairs that are covered in Sunbrella fabric so you don’t fry your legs come July. You can buy it in three flashy colors, black, or white depending on what kind of a vibe you’re wanting to create. (We say go bold). Francesco Favagrossa Moma Store Dusen Dusen Dusen Dusen In the past few years, outdoor furniture has gotten exceedingly serious with sofas, loveseats, and armchairs that look like they’re built for the most pristine palaces. This year, though, we’re untangling that notions with colorful, charming spaghetti chairs like this one from Italian designer Francesco Favagrossa and Dusen Dusen’s poolside-ready Outdoor Bean Bag Chair. Ernesta Ernesta We can’t say that we would’ve expected Peloton founder John Foley’s next act to be a made-to-orderrug company, but we’re glad it is. With affordable-ish prices, every element of Ernesta rugs is made to be customizable from the color to the size (down to the inch!) to the shape. This indoor-outdoor option is made with polyester, and feels like it could work as a kitchen runner just as well as on the patio. Rejuvenation Rejuvenation Most of us buy our planters with the planting season (a.k.a. now) in mind, but our testers say these sturdy planters from Rejuvenation hold up in the depths of January, too. Made of ficonstone and configured with a drainage hole to remove excess moisture, they’re made to flash off heat and cold so that your plants keep on doing their thing. IKEA IKEA Sometimes, you can't go wrong with IKEA. This simple workhorse of a wardrobe might not be the most overbuilt, chic piece in your house, but it will get the job done—for far less than most other options of the same quality currently on the market. Outer Outer Outer's fire pit pulls triple duty as a coffee table, outdoor grill, and (of course) a fire pit. It’s customizable with propane or natural gas, and you can buy it to fit whatever size space you have. Made from a proprietary material that the brand has dubbed “Outerstone,” it is both antimicrobial and scorch resistant so it’s easy to clean and protect from damage. Blueair Blue Air Most humidifiers work by spouting mist into the air, and if you don’t clean ‘em, that mist can get moldy. We like the Blue Air two-in-one purifier not only because it’s mist-free, but also because it helps to purify the air with a HEPA filter to rid your air of dust, odor, and smoke. It acts fast, too, purifying 360 square feet in 12.5 minutes, according to the brand. Control it with Alexa or from a companion app. Snooz Snooz When you don’t need the oomph of the air conditioner in the summer, the Snooz Breez Smart Bedroom Fan will keep you cool when you need it. It has a companion app that allows you to schedule it to turn on and off when you’re en route home. Plus, with temperature sensing and a shut-off timer, you can avoid overly cooling a room to feel like an icebox in the way some ACs do. Mila Mila Usually, it’s in the middle of an air crisis—a wildfire, an allergy-heavy forecast, etc.—that most of us think about our air quality, but the Mila Air 3 gives us cause to think about it on the daily. The reimagined large-room purifier is whisper-quiet (16% quieter than the previous model, in fact) while giving a speedier CADR, or clean air delivery rate. We like it because of the customizable filters that you can buy with it specifically tailored for pregnancy, pets, or newborns. Dyson Dyson James Dyson revolutionized the vacuum decades ago by ditching dirt bags and cutting the cord with battery-operated machines. Over time, his models got sleeker and smaller, but with the Outsize HEPA Gen 5, you get a vacuum that’s designed for large spaces that doesn’t take up loads of room. Using laser technology, it can spot invisible dust on the floor and suck it right up with 250 Airwatt suction. The vacuum runs for 140 minutes without needing to be plugged back in, so if you have a big house but don’t want a mega vacuum, the Dyson is the move. Roborock Roborock In a giant leap closer to Rosie from the Jetsons becoming a reality, Roborock released the Saros Z70 at CES this year. The robovac has a mechanical arm that helps to pick up big items—shoes, toys, and last night’s Taco Bell bag—to move them out of the way so that it can do a daily cleaning of your floors. With the same top-tier features that Roborock is known for like picking up pet hair and mopping floors, you can’t do better than this vacuum if you’re looking for a robot vac. Ultimate Ears Ultimate Ears Ultimate Ears’ Wonderboom 3 speaker has impressively good audio for such a small speaker, with an outdoor setting that’s specifically tuned to get up to 87 dBC in the wide-open air. That’s good, but the ease of use—a quick pair feature, one smartphone connecting to two Wonderbooms at once, and 14-hour battery life—makes it a cinch to use, and we keep reaching for it over other (often pricey) portable speakers. Samsung Samsung For years, The Frame TV has been challenging the notion that all your furniture needs to be pointed at the tube, but for some, the TV didn’t have a crisp enough picture for sports or gaming. This year, Samsung has taken those notes and released the 4K QLED Frame Pro, which has a 120Hz refresh rate, up from 60 Hz on the base model. The jump up gives it an edge for those watching fast-paced shows, and for the rest of us, it still looks damn good in the room. Sonos Sonos For people looking to make their sound set-up plug and play, the Sonos Arc Ultra (which launched late last year) has Dolby Atmos, making it sound like the next best thing to being in a movie theater. You can connect it to your TV, control it with your voice, and use it to play music when you’re entertaining. Sure, you could probably have something custom that’s slightly more custom to your wants and needs, but for a one-and-done solution, look no further. USM Symbol Working from home in 2025 comes with great responsibility to give your home office some character. Skip the boring white-top desks that you’d find in corporate America for something with personality. The well-worn, powder-coated steel Haller desk—a favorite for generations—comes in bold colorways with practical details like a lockable storage space and shelves for your valuables. Swedish Wholesale Amazon If you're sick of using rolls and rolls of Bounty, these Swedish dish cloths are a godsend. They're reusable, of course, but the best part is that theyactually work—like really, really well. The Inside The Inside It may seem like you can get away with a cheap old desk chair that you snagged as a hand-me-down, but trust us: If you work a desk job, this is a place you want to invest. The Inside’s Modern Desk chair gives you reason to. With 36 fabric patterns—solids! prints! linens! velvets!—and adjustable height and ample cushioning, it looks good and will keep you from getting a crick in your neck. Conway Electric Conway Electric Conway Electric’s rainbow-colored power strips have become something of a “thing” in the lobbies of posh hotels in London and New York. Newer from the line, the JAX lamp, a USBC-enhanced table lamp works as a dedicated light source for detail work or a good-looking place to keep your iPhone charged. MoMA MOMA Store Forgive us if we think the 9-to-5 needs a vibe check these days. One that's for sale: The 5-Drawer Pivot Cabinet from the MoMA Store, which comes in three bold colorways. It'll keep you organized, or at the very least inspired, when the paper pushing gets to be too much. Oeuf NYC Oeuf NYC As Gen Z parents come of age, the minimal furnishings of millennial design give way to bolder silhouettes that feel like they’ll spark imagination from day one. Enter Oeuf, the Brooklyn-based brainchild of Sophie Demenge and Michael Ryan, who make whimsical, sustainable kids' furniture like the swervy, Moss crib. It’s dreamy in natural wood, but for a little somethin’ somethin’, go bold for the tomato or peapod. Amazon Basics Amazon Is this going to win any design awards? Certainly not—but what it will do is give you an easy, affordable way to make your space look and feel bigger, and (hopefully) reflect some natural light into your dark, railroad apartment. Crate & Kids Crate & Kids Leanne Ford's Crate and Kids collaboration has been kicking for a few years, so you may have caught a glimpse of it by now; however, we think that it's worth a closer look. The curved lines and mixed materials make it feel soft and the thoughtful details—an optional changing table and drawers made for little sizes—make it hyper-functional. West Elm West Elm West Elm is known for its reliable, stylish home goods, and we love ‘em for it—but if you look deep enough into the catalog, you’ll always find something slightly unexpected that goes above and beyond. Take this reading nook from formerLuckymagazine editor-in-chief and Instagram darling Eva Chen. Its arched design makes it a dedicated space that your kid will want to curl up with a book (or if they insist...a tablet). Babyletto Maisonette There's often a push-pull between form and function when buying baby goods. For starters, you don’t expect to need the furniture forever, so you may not want to shell out for a pricey chair that you’ll only need for five years tops. On the other hand, you’ll likely be spending a whole lotta time in that chair in the wee hours. The bottom line—You want it to be comfortable without costing a million dollars. Enter the Kai Rocker from Babyletto, a chair you’ll want to sink into onsleepless nightsbut that you won’t sink a fortune into. 2025 GQ HOME AWARDS CONTRIBUTORS: Ali Finney,Tyler Chin EDITOR: Ian Burke",

    "title": "The Coolest Short-Sleeve Shirts for Men: Summer 2025 Edition",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. There’s never been a better time to re-up on the best short-sleeve shirts for men. Yes, it was a cooler, rainier spring, but with Memorial Day in the rear-view mirror, it's only a matter of time before yourteesstart feeling a little too thick, and your shirtsleeves a little too long. And on that day, there will only be cure for it: the short-sleeve shirt. Once mostly just a canvas for kitschy prints, florals, and retro stripes, today's best short-sleeve shirts are anything but attention-seeking. These days, the real flex is in the fabric. Open-weave knits and textured constructions let you make a statement that isn't just “Look at me!\"Camp collars are still going strong with their boxy cuts and laid-back feel, but crisp point collars are rising in popularity. The look is a little more unexpected—and a lot less Assistant-to-the-Regional-Manager than you’d think. Regardless, from louche linen numbers to chest-pocketed work shirts, there’s no shortage of ways to wear one. To that end, we’ve rounded up a few of our favorite short-sleeve shirts, across all the categories that matter most. If you're in the market for a superlative summer shirt, you're in the right place. So you’ve OD’d on camp collars the past few summers and feel like sharpening things up. Time to pivot. Enter: the classic-collar short-sleeve button-up. No, it won’t make you look like Blake fromWorkaholicsor Milton fromOffice Space—unless you pair it with pleated khakis and a Swingline stapler. Worn open over a tee on weekends or under a jacket at work (to then heroically reveal your short sleeves when things heat up), the standard short-sleeve shirt—in madras, seersucker, chambray, whatever—will complement most anything you’re wearing, and help you still present as tailored, even in the shirt equivalent of a tee. Abercrombie Abercrombie & Fitch Orslow Mr. Porter Beams Plus Mr. Porter CDLP CDLP J.Crew J.Crew Auralee SSENSE Linen’s long been maligned for its wrinkles, but let’s be real: that’s a feature, not a bug. They're the fabric equivalent of a five o’clock shadow, and truly, what’s more effortlessly (and literally) cool than a breezy, crinkled linen shirt catching the sea breeze on a scorching day? Whether you go crisp white, earthy neutrals, or something bolder, linen brings the shot of laid-back luxury every summer wardrobe needs. Of course, if you’re still worried about looking a creased-up mess, look for a cotton-linen blend. But I say relax, let go, embrace the wrinkle. Sunspel Sunspel Massimo Dutti Massimo Dutti Bather Bather Buck Mason Buck Mason Alex Mill Alex Mill Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Mfpen Mr. Porter J.Crew J.Crew Camp collar shirts have become an unstoppable force in menswear—not that we’re complaining. Easygoing and just bold enough to make a statement, they pair effortlessly with everything from tailored trousers to drawstring shorts, and lend themselves as much to breezy linen as luxe silk blends. The appeal is clear—the more open collar helps circulate more air around your neck and chest—but something less immediately obvious? This laid-back staple actually traces back to 16th-century Mexico, took its fuller shape in Cuba, and found its swagger in Miami and New York, through the Cuban immigrants who knew how to dress for the heat. All that to say, they’ve been around! And what began as utilitarian workwear is now the unofficial uniform of summer cool. 3sixteen Huckberry Dries van Noten SSENSE Portuguese Flannel Huckberry Bode Mr. Porter Madewell Nordstrom Officine Générale Mr. Porter Todd Snyder Todd Snyder École de Pensée École de Pensée Big patterns are usually what we think of first for summer shirts, but with knits, the texture is doing all the talking. Even if you lean more muted than Emily Adams Bode’s maximalistoriginals, the vibe remains no matter the colors: Knit shirts are retro, tactile, and just the right amount of risqué if you choose to wear them sans t-shirt. Banana Republic Banana Republic The Real McCoy's Clutch Cafe Percival Nordstrom Corridor Corridor NYC Abercrombie Abercrombie & Fitch Our Legacy Our Legacy I'll be honest, with the exception of the Dickies shirt, these aren'treallymeant for working in. But they're all made in the work shirt's image—one that conveys rugged capability and capable summer charm. Traditionally cut from sturdy cotton twill, canvas, or denim (to take a beating and keep on going), chest pockets, boxy fits, and tough stitching are all part of the deal here. Brands like L.L.Bean and Dickies, again, still sell them at prices that make sense for actual labour, but the fashion community has taken notice too. Which means these days, you’ll find reimagined versions in softer fabrics, looser fits, and refined details—more gallery opening than garage.

    "title": "Did a Niche Swiss Brand Just Invent the Sport Watch of the Future?",
    "article_text": "Watchmaking and motorsport have enjoyed a close relationship for as long as there have been races to time. In fact, the horological world was committed to sorting the winners from the also-rans back when horsepower actually meant something on four legs. The mechanical watch reached peak pit-lane relevance in the 1960s and ’70s, as Swiss firms developed increasingly sophisticated timing setups, but it was soon supplanted by digital technology. Today, luxury brands are mostly sidelined as a marketing opportunity in top-level motorsport. However, through its partnership with the Alpine Formula 1 team, the independent watchmaker H. Moser & Cie. is rethinking the role wristwatches can play in the sport. The result is possibly the most practical watch a Swiss brand has supplied to the sport since the days of Jack Heuer. The new Streamliner Alpine “Mechanic’s Edition” combines elements of quartz-powered timepieces and smartwatches to create a watch synced to the team’s schedule, keeping everyone on track through a series of notifications and countdowns on race day. In a conversation ahead of Wednesday’s release, Edouard Meylan, H. Moser & Cie.’s CEO, says he was initially resistant to making a smartwatch but eventually saw a way in for the brand. \"They need to keep track of timings when they’re working, so we started brainstorming,” Meylan says. “We said we don't want to create a connected watch per se, but maybe we can create a Formula One watch.” The Mechanic's and Driver's Edition side by side The Mechanic’s Edition arrives as part of a pair of new releases, both limited to just 200. Normally, the “Driver’s Edition” would be strong enough to stand on its own as a talking point. The new piece features a high-end automatic flyback chronograph made by independent specialist supplier Agenhor (in which H. Moser has a minority stake) and is available for the first time with a skeletonized dial and a brilliant metallic blue PVD steel case. However, the Mechanic’s Edition, a quartz-powered smartwatch with a host of bespoke functions and a hybrid analog-digital display, will steal headlines. Luxury watchmakers, especially high-end independent brands like H. Moser, very rarely deal in quartz and never venture into smartwatch territory. The Streamliner Alpine F1 Mechanic’s Edition was developed in conjunction with Swiss smartwatch specialists Sequent, and features a “hidden” digital display below an analog hours-and-minutes dial that mimics other existing Moser designs. “I wanted people to be a little bit confused,” says Meylan, who intended to reference the brand’s work with VantaBlack dials in recent years. “It was important that it looks like a Moser watch, but has this element of surprise when the dial flicks on.” During a race weekend, it’ll be lighting up fairly often, because the watch ditches everyday functions like heartbeat monitoring and sleep tracking in favor of something much more customized. The watch, which was already in use at the race in Barcelona this weekend, was developed with a detailed system of alerts explicitly designed for the needs of Alpine’s mechanics and engineers. In total, H. Moser said it has supplied between 60 and 80 of these watches to the team. Communications can be delivered to individual team members or their teams, and alerts will remind the team of key timings throughout the weekend. This is critical info because, as Meylan points out, there are strict penalties and even fines for working on the car after the allotted windows or missing deadlines. “Of course they're wearing radio headsets, but I don't know if you've been to the races, it's extremely loud all of the time,” says Meylan. “So we thought, Let's develop something that can actually help them. The more-senior team members and, of course, the drivers will be wearing the mechanical watches, but everybody who is in the garage will be wearing one of the hybrid watches.” The new Streamliner Mechanic’s Edition takes even the typically unflappable Meylan out of his comfort zone. H. Moser’s past projects includea passion fruit–themed collaboration with British brand Studio Underd0g, a watch witha QR code for a case, and even a watchmade partly out of Swiss cheesemeant to mock the standards of Switzerland’s watchmaking industry. And yet this is the watch that's making Meylan uncharacteristically anxious. “I'm pretty excited and nervous to see how people will react in a week from now,” he says. The watch can be set up in one of three ways. The first mode synchronizes the Streamliner with the general timings of the Formula 1 season and will send out generic alerts. “You get what all the teams get: 10 minutes to race start, that kind of thing,” he says. The second option is for the team, with dedicated messaging. The third way is the most generic setting, whereby users still get the GMT, perpetual calendar, and chronograph functions. “Obviously, our customers won’t get the secret messages from the F1 team,” says Meylan. “But they might get something bespoke to them, like a happy birthday message.” What makes the watch even more surprising is that it comes from H. Moser, an independently owned niche brand from Schaffhausen that produces around 5,000 watches a year. Moser is in the Formula 1 paddock alongside titans of the watch industry like TAG Heuer, IWC, and Richard Mille. Despite these brands’ storied histories in Formula 1, Moser’s created a more unusual and unique watch with its new Mechanic’s Edition Streamliner. Meylan approached the partnership with the goal to be more than just an advertiser. “We try to be surprising, to do something totally unexpected,” says Meylan. “Is it where Moser is headed for the future? No. But I think it shows that when we commit to a partnership, it's not just [about] putting the watch on the wrist of the drivers and putting our logo on the car.” And although it may not be Moser’s future, the industry and collectors are increasingly embracing new technologies. For generations of collectors, quartz was anathema to serious horological appreciation, ignored for its lack of character, to say nothing of being cast as the villain in the downfall of the Swiss watch industry in the 1970s. Today, however, there is a willingness to overlook all that. Instagram hashtags like #makequartzgreatagaintell their own story. Brands have tentatively, and successfully, rehabilitated quartz into their ranges even at predominantly pedigree makers. The poster child for cool quartz is undoubtedly the F.P. Journe Elegante, a quartz-powered design from one of Geneva’s most desirable independent watchmakers. During the pandemic it went from an oddball to a red-hot must-have. Other brands engaging collectors with quartz designs have included Girard-Perregaux, which reissued its 1976 avant-garde Casquette model with a historically correct quartz movement. With the new Streamliner, Moser might have created something truly novel; a feat that naturally causes some anxiety. It’s unusual for a Swiss watchmaker to express anything other than ironclad confidence in its products, but the new timepiece will be an interesting measuring stick for how high-end collectors feel about embracing cutting-edge technologies.",

Bradley Cooper is a devotedAir Jordanguy. He’s a noted fan of theAir Jordan 4 ‘Taupe Haze’and often steps out in the elusiveTravis Scott x Air Jordan 1 High OG. Back in March, though, the actor and filmmaker was spotted rockinga brand new pair of Louis Vuitton sneakerson the set ofIs This Thing On?,his next directorial project. And judging by how they look almost three months later, it appears he’s barely taken them off since. While out and about in New York City, theMaestrostar pulled his Louis Vuitton Beverly Hills out for another spin. Inspired by skate shoes from the days of yore, they're dripped out in calfskin leather and stamped with shiny gold branding across the tongue and sides. Down south, the sole is made from some very plush rubber, and, like all of LV’s other trainers, it’s crafted in the maison’s very prestigious factories in Italy. Cooper’s pair looked like it was painted in a dark forest green. But would you believe us if we told you that these were originally black? He’s worn them so much over the past few weeks that the upper has literally changed color. The toebox was permanently wrinkled. The midsole was stained and worn out. The laces were frayed. Even the precious Louis Vuitton logos somehow rubbed off. The same thing happened when Cooper copped theRiccardo Tisci x Nike Air Force 1two years ago. Considered by many sneakers guys to be one of the holiest grails out there, he beat ’em up beyond recognition. And isn’t that the highest compliment a sneakerhead can pay his shoes? Bradley Cooper could have kept his Louis Vuitton Beverly Hills in pristine condition, but instead, he’s thrashed them into a new colorway. Nowthat’slove.

    "title": "Justin Bieber Has Springtime Dressing Down to a Science",
    "article_text": "We here atGQoften praise Justin Bieber forhis preternaturally kooky outfits, which generally appear to be the result of him dressing on pure instinct alone, with no discernible structure or style rules at play. However, every so often, the way Bieber colors within (or well beyond) the lines of a preexisting framework—say,hoodie-and-shorts season—inspires us to reconsider the tools we have at our disposal. Take, for example, that ideal spring-weather outfit:Shorts with a sweater—a functional contrast most pleasing. Bieber’s formula requires these three components: a cozy designer sweater or sweatshirt, roomy athletic shorts cut at or above the knee, and some incongruously zany footwear. On Saturday—the day after hemade a surprise appearanceduring Kendrick Lamar and SZA’s Grand National Tour stop at SoFi Stadium to duet his remix of SZA’s “Snooze”—Bieber swung by the Beverly Glen Mall in Los Angeles wearing a spring-optimized outfit: a JW Anderson strawberry-print fleece jacket (a nod, perhaps, to the flavor profile of his wifeHailey’s extremely popularErewhon smoothie), blue Nike basketball shorts, and, delightfully, white golf shoes with scrunched pink socks. Bieber has beenreally into golf lately, so it’s possible he was on his way to the links, but I also wouldn’t put it past him to just dig the derbyish silhouette. Speaking of hypotheticals, whether or not he intended to match his rose-toned iced beverage to the fuchsia socks, it was a nice touch. A relatively pared-back Bieber look, fromback in March. Bieber in LA on May 22. Depending on circumstances, the hoodie is optional. It’s an easy-to-follow outfit formula from the Biebs, who is not typically anespeciallyaccessibledresser. Bieber ran a similar play last month,when he worethe enviable combo of a nubby sweater, sporty shorts, and shearling Bottega Veneta boots, and then again last week, when he and his crew were spottedhopping outof a black Land Rover and into a building in Beverly Hills. Despite his shirtlessness upon arrival, he had all the components at the ready: he was holding a cozy hoodie that looked like it could be from his forthcoming brand,Skylrk; Nike checkered green nylon shorts layered over blue running leggings; slouchy white tube socks; and a wonky pair of “Concepts Saignée” New Balance 470s in contrasting tones of green, orange, and pink. Comfortable up top, slightly bonkers down below. Endlessly riffable, as they say in food media.",

    "title": "'Survivor' Turns 25: Here’s Why I’ve Been Watching for My Whole Life",
    "article_text": "In my opinion, Saturday, May 31, should be an American national holiday. It’s important, as a country, to celebrate the landmark events that fundamentally shaped who we are as people. And this Saturday marks the 25th anniversary since the first episode ofSurvivoraired. There’s no question, for me, thatSurvivoris the greatest reality TV show of all time. The genre has bent, evolved, and exploded in the quarter century since those 16 strangers washed up on a beach together in 2000, but everything fromRuPaul’s Drag RacetoLove Islandowes a debt of gratitude to the GOAT. EvenWhite Lotuscreator Mike White—a superfan who was the runner-up on the 37th season and is returning for season 50—openly acknowledgedthat his enormously popular HBO series is influenced by his time onSurvivor. But there’s also a more personal connection at play here. Outside of live sports, there is no television program I’ve spent more time with thanSurvivor,a show that feels as encompassing to my life as the internet or coffee. I was a few months away from my fifth birthday whenSurvivorhit the streets, meaning I don’t really remember a world without it. Back in 2000, the very idea that something on TV wasrealrather than scripted—and that the stars were everyday folk, not actors—was positively mind-blowing. I have blurry memories of being knee-high to my parents and their friends when they’d discuss the show with the same kind of reverence that my own friends and I would, many years later, use when talking about watchingShohei Ohtaniplay baseball or hearingKendrick Lamarrap for the first time. It’s a mixture of disbelief and total captivation but also the restorative realization that new things are possible. (And Idefinitelyremember plopping down in front of the old, impossibly cumbersome TV that weighed 500 pounds and eating a bowl of Dreyer’s cookie dough ice cream while being transported toSurvivorLand.) Kelly Wiglesworth, Rudy Boesch, Susan Hawk, Richard Hatch, Sean Kenniff onSurvivorseason 1. The genius ofSurvivorlies in its simplistic yet transportive nature. The elevator pitch—what if you made strangers live on an island together, vote someone out at the end of each episode, and the last person standing gets $1 million?—is straightforward, so much so that even a five-year-old could immediately grasp it, and, better yet, put themselves in the headspace of each castaway. Did I have any idea how much moneya million dollarswas? No, not even close. But I did know that there were people in my grade school classes who I happily would have booted off the island, and best believe I identified the athletic kids who would have been tough competition in physical challenges. The way the actual season unfolds, though, is anything but straightforward. Betrayal, deception, and emotional volatility are hallmarks of the show, and each group of contestants brings its own interpersonal dynamic, but the familiar tropesSurvivorfans cling to in 2025 were there 25 years ago too. The show is more heavily produced now than it was during its infancy, something that the traditionalists sometimes wring their hands over, but at the start of each new season (it just wrapped the 48th), millions of people keep tuning in. This is, in part, to watch every person who signs up decide how insane they’re willing to be for $1 million. The choices one makes while they’re marooned on aSurvivorbeach showcase just how far they’ll go for the money, and the extent to which they’ll stretch the boundaries of what it means to be a good person. Would youmake up a lie that your grandmother diedto garner sympathy? Would youlet four beautiful women talk you out of your immunity necklace, giving up a guaranteed spot in the final four? Would youvote out your own mother? These are all real things that have happened, and none of those people even won! Putting the silliness aside for a second, there are genuinely powerful lessons, perspectives, and experiences I’ve gained from watchingSurvivor.Richard Hatch, the controversial winner of the inaugural season, was probably the first openly gay person I ever saw on television. (Admittedly, he probablywasn’t thebestdepictionI could have found.) The show’s voting process? It low-key taught me what democracy was. Even now, every time I’m introduced to a new group of people, I subconsciously find myself aligning with some, distancing myself from others, and keeping a close eye on the ones who are hardest to read—asSurvivorhas taught me, the latter are often the most important. Perhaps most concerningly, I learned the utility of a lie, and how sometimes you have to do it, putting yourself above all else. Even with the same host—the marvelous and singular Jeff Probst—lording over every single episode of the show’s history, I always find myself impressed at the show’s ability to find room for newness. Probst, a constant figure in my life since kindergarten, is evolving too, in ways that champion the ideas of modern masculinity that appeal to me far more than any manosphere nonsense. For instance, after 25 years, Probst finally cried on-air during the most recent season. It was prompted by Eva Erickson, the first openly autistic person to ever appear onSurvivor,bonding with tribemate Joe Hunter over her condition. After a particularly grueling challenge, which Erickson struggled with, Hunter helped her through an autistic episode. Probst’s famously even-keeled demeanor, even in the face of constant crisis, is what made it so jarring to see him break down. For theSurvivorfiends who follow religiously, it was a bit like seeing their father cry for the first time. When Iinterviewed Probst in 2023, there were no waterworks, but it was immediately evident why he’s stuck around as the driving force behind one of the 21st century’s flagship shows. He is the cargo short–wearing embodiment of dedication. “I’m not just a bullshitter saying I’m grateful,” he told me. “I’m grateful every fucking morning. I can’t believe this is my life.” Probst in 2025, duringSurvivorseason 48. I’ll soon turn 30, and I’m still wildly enthusiastic aboutSurvivor.Going from the rambunctious kid whose parents had to explain what “alliance” meant to the slightly less rambunctious adult who got to talk shop with Probst is a huge trip. While I missed a big chunk of the show’s run in the 2010s—real life took precedence, which I told Probst, and he understood—organically coming back toSurvivora few years ago was one of the best leisure choices I’ve ever made. My return came in part from a practical desire to have aregular weekly released showin my rotation again, amid the plague of shows dropping entire seasons at once. But I also wanted to nestle in some childlike familiarity as my age started to climb. Even though pretty much every tangible thing about my life has changed since I was five—I live on the complete other end of the country now, I no longer sleep in a bunk bed—Survivorstill tickles the exact same part of my brain. Coming back to it felt like a return to my purest form: a guy who loves to watch weird little social dynamics play out between people in swimsuits. I will keep coming back to it, year after year, because I crave that feeling more than I crave the excitement of discovering a new show. I’ll even readily admit that I didn’t love Season 48, mostly because I found it lacking in the true freaks that makeSurvivora hoot, but I still devoured every frame. WatchingSurvivoris a bit like that old adage about pizza and sex. Even when it’s not great, it’s still good. Speaking of: If you want to see someone onSurvivorget reduced to a puddle of mush, dangle the possibility of indulging in either ofthosevices. To be clear, I have absolutely no desire to ever be onSurvivormyself. Despite all the hours I’ve logged watching, I’m bad with puzzles and knots, get too cranky when I’m hungry, and am also kind of dumb. Keeping track of all the game’s machinations while actively withering away is not my idea of a good time. It’s pure escapism for me, and even while following from the couch, I rarely find myself scheming along with the people onscreen. I’m just mainlining entertainment, and an elite form of it at that. So here’s to another 25 years ofSurvivor,a show that started as a loose idea scribbled on a whiteboard with the guy fromRock & Roll Jeopardy!and became part of our cultural fabric. I will be there for every step, as I have been for practically my entire life, with one condition. The moment Probst leaves, I’m leaving the island too.",

    "title": "The Best Khaki Pants for Men in 2025, According to GQ",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Even the best khaki pants for men can spark a bit of pre-teen PTSD: memories of getting “dressed up” for eighth grade graduation, some older cousin’s wedding, your friend’s bar mitzvah. At the time you wondered:Do adults actuallylikewearing these? Yes, we do. Khakis are king because they can do a lot without demanding a lot. They may not qualify as formalwear once you’re old enough to take the PSAT, but a great pair of khakis solves plenty of other style conundrums. They’re crisp, comfortable, and combine with almost every shoe, sweater, or shirt in your closet to go from internship interview to lazy brunch to JFK-roleplay—maybe even in the span of one weekend. Go blue collar with achore coatandRed Wings; riff blue blood withboat shoesand ablazer. The trickiest part of khakis is maybe the best part: you’ll want more than one pair. Especially since we’ve started to see some khaki…kreativity. Sure, there’s a sea of straightforward styles—medium-weight cotton twill, slanted front pockets, zip fly, straight cut—essentially replicating a design that’s been around since khakis were invented in the mid-19th century by British soldiers looking for some reprieve from the heat. But we’ve also watchedJ.Crew’s giant chinosbreak the internet—or at least, the pants department—by triggering a full-blown “giant everything” chino movement. Pleats have made a comeback; bagginess is back (in moderation). A few intrepid designers are even taking khakis from casual Friday to runway Monday. The uniting line is that all the best khakis we’ve found—TK in total—remain the endlessly versatile, everyday-wearable pants you’re always looking for. From mall classics to military throwbacks to next-day shipping specials, these are the best khakis for men in 2025. J.Crew J.Crew J.Crewhas been through some ups and downs in the last 15 years or so, but we’re pleased to see its mall brand mojo is back. As proof, take the properly named J.Crew Classic Chino* Pant, a staple of the brand since 1983. Inspired by 1940s military-issue khakis, these khakis come with a hardy cotton-twill fabric, high-rise fit, and wide hems—nice for cuffing or for a little extra ankle-height drama. Everything about these says “right now” while also being a pair you could wear another 20 years in the future. Best of all, you can probably pick up a pair within a 15-minute drive from your house. *Just so we’re all clear: Chinos are thetypeof pants; khaki is the color. All khakis are chinos, but not all chinos are khaki. Cool? Cool. Reigning Champ Reigning Champ Canadian label Reigning Champ is the, well, reigning champ of cozy, as a result of its signaturehoodies,zip-hoodies, andsweatpants. A few seasons ago, it leveled up with a sportswear line featuring polos, wool jackets, oxford shirts, and chinos that took the brand from football pitch to pitch meetings with clients. RC’s Sophomore Khaki Pants are a standout from the collection. They’ve got a baggier silhouette than the brand’s original-recipeFreshman pant, with a relaxed straight leg, longer rise (the part that goes from crotch to waist), and some breathing room in the hips and thighs. They’re all the comfier for the soft fabric and front pleats that actually work. The bigger silhouette keeps the Sophomore Relaxed Pant on the casual side of things, but these khakis are a varsity athlete with serious BMOC energy. Buck Mason Buck Mason Earlier this year, we argued for Buck Mason as the newbrand for the everyman, and these khakis could be exhibit A in the trial. The “Full Saddle” in the name means these chinos have more room in the ass and straight-legged, roomy fit inspired by pairs from the ’50s. At under $200, they’re some of the best replica-style khakis you’ll find short of inheriting your great grandad’s foot locker. Buck Mason, of course, dials in the details beautifully. We love how the waistband both rides a little higher and isn’t a separate piece; there’s no seam—just clean lines and a more comfortable fit. An enzyme garment means the Paperback Twill khakis are soft, broken-in, and ready to roll from day one. Dickies Amazon Dickies is known for workwear that’s built to handle sheet rock more than spreadsheets. But the brand answered the call for less rigid khakis by outfitting its classic 874 pants with a stretchier fabri—all without sacrificing any of their blue-collar charm. Or the equally charming price. For thirty-five bucks you get a pair of wrinkle-resistant, hard-wearing khakis that probably don’t belong at the office, but deserve ample run on your days off. Toss on a pair of the 874 Flex Work Pants with adenim jacketand atrusty flannel, or go for thematching setwith a Dickie’s jacket. Really, though, the only accessory a pair of 874s needs is an iron, for adding a big crease down each leg. Visvim SSENSE Visvim founder Hiroki Nakamura doesn’t just make clothes—he unlocks new levels of craftsmanship. Unique mud-dyeing methods, unexpected materials (deerskin totes?!), never-before-seen fabrics…Nakamura makes mundane garments into museum-grade masterpieces. Take these wide-leg trousers, for instance. Made in Japan (of course), they’re crafted from a custom high-density, long-staple cotton. Nakamura then added custom water buffalo horn buttons.Actualwater buffalo horn. Unlike your average khakis’ plastic versions, these won’t crack in the wash after a year or two. Yeah, the price tag will make you wince, but the pants are like wearable art. Polo Ralph Lauren Polo Ralph Lauren Depending on your moodboard, pleated khaki pants channel 1950s prep, or 1980s Armani boardroom swagger, or vintage Ralph Lauren catalog models leaning against a Jeep in Nantucket. They’re more than just a nostalgia play, though. Double pleats like on these Polo khakis do real work, offering up room in the seat and thighs while you move or sit, but letting the pants drape handsomely while you’re standing still. Unsurprisingly, Polo’s khaki pants hit the happy medium everywhere else, with a slightly tapered leg, just-right rise, and those signature slanted pockets. Pair the pleats with a tucked-inOCBDandloafersfor an Ivy League charm, go with aknit poloor tuckedteefor that weekend art-director valor, or addsneakersand awindbreakerfor a full-on ’90s energy. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Praying for a hardier take on classic khaki pants?Todd the Godwill provide. Snyder teamed up with the legendary Kuroki Mill in Japan to recreate the feel and fit of a true vintage military khaki, weaving them on old, traditional shuttle looms for authenticity. The design is based on a pair of wide-legged khakis from Todd's personal archive. And the result? A pair of tough-as-nails trousers in a heftier-than-usual cotton that could survive basic training, nevermind brunch. They’reselvedge, too, which means they’ll age like your favorite jeans: gracefully, and with just the right amount of attitude. Noah Noah When designer Brendan Babenzien helped reboot J.Crew,his first home runwas theGiant-fit Chino—an archive revival that introduced every mall going man in America to the Bigger Is Better mantra. Funny thing: Babenzien also runs Noah, but that brand’s big-boned pleated khakis have a different inspiration. Built with skaters in mind, they carry a shorter inseam, so you don’t get a cuff caught in your trucks. But they moonlight just as well for anyone strolling the beach, or looking to flex some extra ankle above their loafers. Unlike the J.Crew Giant-fit Chino, these don’t come with the slightly fussy double-cuffed hem. The cotton’s got a sturdier backbone, too, at a heavy-for-khakis 11.5 oz. They’ll wear hard and age like a champ. And if you do torch the knees after a few too many missed heel flips, you can always make them into shorts. Jack Donnelly Jack Donnelly Jack Donnelly is a brand thatonlymakes chinos, so you know it’s not just dabbling. Inspired by the O.G. WWII classic version, these chinos are handmade in Los Angeles from 100-percent 8.5 oz. cotton twill. They’re relaxed through the hip, thigh, and leg, and they come with a whopping 39-inch inseam—because Jack Donnelly believes in freedom. Specifically, the freedom to hem them exactly how you like. Flint and Tinder Flint and Tinder FromPedro Pascal’s rugged waxed jacketinThe Last of Usto an easy-wearing pair of khakis, Flint and Tinder likes its rugged Americana. The brand’s pants are built to move, with a lightweight 8-oz. twill and a hint of stretch. We also like that they come in four different fits: classic, straight, athletic-tapered, and slim. So once you find your fit (and youwillfind your fit), it’s dangerously easy to stock up in every color. NN07 Nordstrom Copenhagen-based brand NN07 makes some of the best minimal, no-fuss menswear out there. These khaki pants are proof, with just enough stretch to justify lounging like a Scandinavian yacht dad, even if your waterfront property is just a folding chair on the porch overlooking a bird bath. The Real McCoy's Standard and Strange The Real McCoy’s built its reputation on reproducing some of the most iconic military pieces ever made, and its khaki chinos are no exception. These are a stitch-perfect recreation of the much-loved, much-replicated M-1941 (a.k.a., the golden era of chinos). They’ve got it all: reinforced jetted front pockets, two welted back pockets, and sturdy metal buttons. Save yourself scrolling through eBay for a perfect vintage pair and grab these instead. Gap Gap Whether you’re cruising through theOldGapIG page, looking for a little style inspo, or just trying to cover a khakis-shaped hole in your closet without breaking the bank, we’ve got good news. Gap’s classic ’90s charm (cue theFriendstheme song) shows through in these breezy, lightweight linen khakis. Merz b. Schwanen Self Edge Merz b. Schwanen has had a hard time stocking its tees since Jeremy Allen White rocked them onThe Bear—but the German brand’s got way more up its sleeve. These pants are cut from a beefy 9.2-oz cotton twill that's been rinsed for softness. The wide-leg fit is roomy enough to smuggle a jumbo pretzel, and the corozo nut buttons will outlast your next three relationships. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "Four Showstopping New Pieces Real Watch Guys Are Lining Up For",
    "article_text": "Welcome to Watch Guy Watches, GQ’s monthly curation of high-end timepieces for the true watch nerds among us. This May, MB&F drops its first-ever dress watch, Vacheron Constantin adds a minute repeater to the Overseas collection, Bvlgari teams up with Gübelin on a special edition, and Zenith puts a lapis lazuli dial on its Chronomaster Original Triple Calendar. When it comes to reimagining what a watch is and how it looks, no one thinks more radically thanMax Büsserof MB&F. The brand is divided into distinct categories. MB&F’s Legacy Machines are a tribute to traditional horology,Horological Machines rethink watchesas spaceships and bulldogs, while the M.A.D.Editions bring unrivaled creativity to the “affordable” timepieces sector. This month, MB&F set its sights on revolutionizing another category: dress watches. Part of the brand’s 20th anniversary celebrations, the new SP One—the inaugural model in the brand’s “Special Projects” collection—is also MB&F’s most compact timepiece. Based on a sketch initially codenamed “Three Circles,” it takes the form of a 38-mmdress watchin platinum or 18K rose gold, within which a unique “floating” dial is suspended. The time subdial, balance, and barrel make up the display. Dual sapphire crystals front and back allow the wearer to examine the beautiful handwork and sophisticated design from any angle. MB&F’s handiwork makes it appear as if the dial is floating in the center. Many of the elements that power this watch are hidden under the three visible elements while bridges hook into an outer rim to keep it all held up. These types of floating dials are still rare in the watch world but we’ve seen a couple of recent notable examples, likeLouis Vuitton’s new Taiko Spin Time. I’m also reminded of theCartier Masse Mystérieuse from 2022. Hopefully, watch brands can pick up the pace and start producing these very cool-looking watches more frequently. All the beauty of the SP One isn’t reserved to the dial side either. Flip it over to find a hand-wound caliber that delivers 72 hours of power via 191 components. The movement showcases numerous traditional hand-finishing techniques—gold chatons, hand engraving and polishing, internal angles, satin and polished surfaces, etc.—as well as the delivery of signature modern aesthetics (micro-blasted surfaces, for example). The case itself, either in 18K rose gold with an anthracite flange or platinum with a sky-blue flange (the flange is the outer ring holding up all the parts), is a pebble-shaped thing of beauty. With detached lugs that connect via the caseback, a 10 o’clock crown, and a height of 12 mm, this isn’t exactly a traditional compact dress watch. Nevertheless, it remains relatively svelte and elegant, especially for MB&F. And while the DLC-treated black time display dial is certainly handsome and legible, it’s almost an afterthought when considered within the context of the suspended design. Clearly, the showstopper here is the construction method and three-part display that cleverly shows off the movement componentry. At $76,000-$82,000, the SP One is still very much within the realm of haute horlogerie, but there’s little doubt that it will find a cadre of willing buyers. It’s simply too cool—and too unique—to ignore. Launched in early 2024, theZenith Chronomaster Original Triple Calendardeftly reimagined a vintage 1970s prototype that was never put into production. Later that year, a special black-dial version with meteorite subdials produced in concert with HODINKEE followed. Now, Zenith has unveiled its most elegant iteration yet with the Chronomaster Original Triple Calendar Lapis Lazuli, featuring a stunning blue dial speckled with pyrite that evokes the night sky. The in-house, hi-beat El Primero cal. 3610 offers a wide array of functionality. In addition to a triple calendar display with date, day, month, and moon phase indications, a triple-registerchronographfeaturing 60-minute, running seconds, elapsed seconds, and central 1/10th chronograph seconds is housed within its 38mm steel case. While theOverseas collectionis whereVacheron Constantinparks its sportier wares, this more adventurous collection does nothing to detract from the maison’s penchant for developing and incorporatingsophisticated complications. Take the new Overseas Grand Complication Openface, for example. As its name might suggest, this innovative new Overseas model incorporates not only a perpetual calendar and a tourbillon but also the charming and difficult-to-produce minute repeater. While Vacheron is one of, if notthemost elegant, watchmakers in Switzerland, this watch shows the brand can make modern-looking pieces with as much panache. The combination of the openworked movement and tourbillon with its series of grand complications, like the minute repeater, make for a winning contrast. Bvlgari’s Octo Finissimo collection needs little introduction. The collection has earned the Italian jeweler and watchmaker 10world records for thinnessand has had a significant impact on the watch industry over the past decade. Bvlgari’s latest horological venture, a collaboration with Swiss jeweler and retailer Gübelin, accents the Octo Finissimo Skeleton 8 Days with bright blue indices and hands that pop against the watch’s titanium housing. A skeletonized dial reveals the in-house cal. BVL 199 SK, a hand-wound movement measuring just 2.5 mm tall that nevertheless delivers an 8-day power reserve.",

    "title": "Sydney Sweeney Will Sell You Her Used Bathwater",
    "article_text": "The internet isincapable of being normalabout Sydney Sweeney. When she hosted SNL last year, conservative media figures crowed that her décolletagesignaled“the death of woke.” After aphotograph of hersunbathing on a boat went viral, commenters chimed in with bizarre and lewd remarks about her body. As a hypervisible public figure, Sweeney has said that she has come to terms with being unable tocontrol her imageandcomments about her appearance, particularly among her predominantly male fanbase. But Sweeney hasn’t eschewed the internet completely. Instead, she’s trying a different tack:Being in on the joke, perhaps in a way that comes with a paycheck. Last fall, when Sweeney dropped a saucy ad for the male personal care brand Dr. Squatch that featured her soaking in a bathtub while calling viewers “dirty little boys,” horny fans took notice—and, specifically, beganclamoringfor a taste of her bathwater. Sweeney tellsGQthat she “definitely was not aware” of the erotic implications around bathtub water “until I started seeing it in my own comments.” But she obliged. Sweeney is now selling bar soap for Dr. Squatch—the same brand that once featured Nick Cannonpoking fun at himselfsiring 12 children in an ad for ball-care products—made from pine bark extract, sand, and, naturally, actual droplets of her dirty bathwater. In a nod to her Pacific Northwest roots, it’s also meant to evoke the smell of Douglas fir trees and moss. We’re sure the internet will be totally chill about this one too. Sweeney spoke briefly withGQabout the product, growing up in the Pacific Northwest, and why she thinks dirty bathwater may be in the zeitgeist. This interview has been condensed for clarity and length. Sydney Sweeney:I honestly think it's a really fun, full-circle moment, because fans always joke about wanting my bath water…I was like,This is just such a cool way to have a conversation with the audience and give them what they want.But then also hopefully encourage them to take care of themselves in a healthy way. I did. Honestly, it probably has been a huge catalyst for it. I have a really amazing group of friends and family that are not really in the industry, and they just keep me very grounded and humbled. And whenever I'm not doing press or working on set or anything, I go back and my life's normal. So I think that it's finding a really healthy balance, and then also just kind of taking it day by day. I think because I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, I love being outside. My go-to isn'toh, I want to go sit on the couch and watch TV and scroll my phone.It’s:I want to go outside. I want to go jet-skiing. I want to go build a treehouse. I want to go hiking. I want to go on an adventure.Having that ingrained in me has really helped. [Laughs]This is a funny story. My parents were really, really cool, because they always wanted me to be very independent and hands-on. And so they'd give me the tools, but then I'd have to do it. And so I built a treehouse. I mean, it wasn't even something crazy. It was just a platform with some railings and a ladder, but I had a rope that would dolly all my tools up, and I felt really cool as a fourth grader doing this. I finished building it, and then I painted it. I don't even remember what I painted, but I was very, very proud of it. I remember walking in and just telling my parents all about it, and showed them the paint from my art room that was…washable paint. And I remember walking up the next day and the entire tree and the ground underneath was just covered with all the paint. And my beautiful mural had just completely washed off. I was so sad. I make sure that every brand that I become a part of, I organically and authentically use. It's super important to me to make sure that whenever I'm saying,hey guys, I really, really love this product,or,hey, I really use this that,I actually am. I'm a consumer just like everybody else. If it doesn't actually work for the person and they're just saying it, it doesn't benefit any of us. I do have the bar. I actually took a shower this morning, and I have the bar and I used it. It’s super soft. It's really pretty, I'm looking at it right now. It's marbly and has blues and a little bit of brown in it. When we were at the [Dr. Squatch] shoot, they had a tub for me. And I actually got in there and I took some soap, and we had a nice little bath and they took the water. So it's my real bath water. I wanted to have it lean towards my home roots, so there's this really outdoorsy scent of, like, pine and earthy moss and fir. So it smells super manly. But then there's some city bath water mixed in. No, but I would like to say yes, because that's the coolest thing ever(laughs). Um, because women are awesome? Yeah, of course. It’s funny, and there's a lot of different plays that are in motion at that time. My hope is that it just gets guys to think about taking care of themselves and cleaning themselves with some healthy products. Exactly.",

    "title": "The Mullet Is Staging Another Comeback. We Do Not Have To Accept This",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterPulling Weeds With Chris Black,in which the columnist weighs in on hot topics in culture.Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. I walk around SoHo in Manhattan every day, and I see all kinds of freaks. People who have clearly relocated from Minneapolis and Oklahoma City to endure awful weather and breathtakingly expensive rent in exchange for the freedom to express themselves by wearing the clothes they feel most comfortable in. That is the energy and attitude that New York City is built on. It’s a place for people to come and be the best version of themselves, unbound by small-town rules and conventions. I love these people. Today, we are not talking about them. New York City hasn’t just become a place for people to eat consultant bowls at their desks and wait in line at the Museum of Ice Cream. It has also become a haven for men who have chosen an unfortunate hairstyle; it has infected all ages, and I see no signs of it letting up. I am, of course, talking about the “modern mullet or “mini mullet,” a cursed hairstyle that has never looked good on anyone (sorry to my kings Harry Styles, Jacob Elordi, and Paul Mescal, although they did get the closest to making it work). You see the “flow” peeking out from underneath the high-crown camo snapback on a guy holding his iced oat milk matcha latte, waiting in line for Leon’s Bagels, while his girlfriend, with her enhanced lips, mindlessly scrolls on her iPhone. In Canada, they call it “hockey hair.” I have seen hot, cool gay guys doing it. Benson Boone is backflipping with his, and Austin Butler, a bona fide leading man, has even let his hair get a little longer in the back. It seems like every guy I see wants to look like a minor-league baseball player with a new Tacoma and a Zyn habit. This mini mullet is often paired with a mustache of varying degrees, too-wide jeans, chunky boots, a small shirt, and wraparound sunglasses. A look that can only be described as TikToker. I am old enough to have lived through this trend once, and I don’t mean in the ’80s. I mean in the early aughts, when many prominent electroclash rockers let themselves go. The pants were much tighter, the flatiron stayed hot, but the hair was basically the same. When I look back at that moment, which has been oddly romanticized lately, most people look like shit, me included. I had some very questionable haircuts and outfits; my constitution was weak when it came to the popular deep V-neck T-shirt from American Apparel. (I blame cocaine.) But I managed to resist the mullet. My point is that many trends simply don’t age well. Do you want to look back at pictures in a decade and see the mullet? You shouldn’t. Some people might think this trend, and the clothes that accompany it, is a “Trump’s America” problem. We can blame Donald Trump for a lot of things, but this feels like something that was birthed from an even darker place—the internet. Trends don’t exist anywhere except in our algorithms. It is proven over and over again that we aren’t safe from any trend, no matter how unsavory, returning. I am just praying that the faux-hawk doesn’t reappear.",

On Tuesday, it wasendingthe recommendation that most children and pregnant women receive the COVID vaccine. Now it’s a quest to save hundreds of ostriches that likely have bird flu. Yes, the man who is supposed to be keeping the people in his country safe from disease is currently using his power totry to stopCanada from culling 400 ostriches that were in contact with H5N1, the bird flu virus that has killed millions of birds in the US since last year and infected dozens of people, one of whom died. Last week Kennedy encouraged our neighbor to the north not to kill the birds—which Canadian officials fear will further spread the disease—but to study them. “We believe significant scientific knowledge may be garnered from following the ostriches in a controlled environment,” he wrote in a letter to the head of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Oh, and he and Dr.Mehmet Ozhaveofferedto move the probably diseased birds to a Florida ranch owned by Oz, who is currently serving as the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. AsThe New York Timesnotes, “most veterinarians agree that keeping birds alive that may still have active infections and could spread the virus to others is a threat to public health,” i.e., the thing Kennedy was hired to protect, not undermine. Kennedy, of course, has a long history of doing weird shit with animals. While running for president, herecountedthrowing a dead bear cub in the back of his car, only to set up an elaborate murder scene with its carcass in Central Park after he realized he wouldn’t have time to get to his house to refrigerate the meat (yes). Later, his daughterrecountedthe time he sawed off a whale’s head and strapped it to the roof of his minivan, tellingTown & Country:“Every time we accelerated on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car, and it was the rankest thing on the planet. We all had plastic bags over our heads with mouth holes cut out, and people on the highway were giving us the finger, but that was just normal day-to-day stuff for us.” Kennedy alsoonce lived with an emuthat would attack his wife. In other bird flu news, Kennedy’s department on Wednesdayreneged onmillions of dollars in funding it had committed to Moderna to help develop a bird flu vaccine for humans.

    "title": "Elon Musk No Longer the Most Hated Man in Washington (Because He’s Leaving)",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk’s tenure in Washington is coming to an end after just 130 days. On Tuesday, hewroteon X that his “scheduled time” as a special government employee was over, saying, “the @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.” Speaking about DOGE, in a series of unofficial exit interviews over the last week, the richest man in the world expressed confusion over why so many people despised the group he oversaw—which hasterrorizedfederal workers and inflicted haphazard budget and personnel cuts that willimpactthe country and world for years to come—sayingthat DOGE had become “the whipping boy for everything“ and that “something bad would happen anywhere, and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it.” (Cue a symphony of sad trombones.) Musk alsoreportedlydidn’t expect to be personallyhatedfor taking a (literal and figurative) chainsaw to the federal government, nor did he see the reputational hit on Tesla coming,callingthe burning of the electric cars “really uncool.” Anyway, Musk is leaving, and it’s safe to say no one is throwing him a going-away party in the break room or chipping in on a gift to see him off. That’s probably because, over the course of his four months in Washington, Musk: Among the children Muskbrought inwasa college freshmanwhose nickname is “Big Balls.” Not surprisingly, none of them had virtually any experience working in government. Among the legion of short-sighted moves by Musk, one of the biggest ones was to dismantle the US Agency for International Development, imperiling services like HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention across the world. USAID also funded clinics that prevented people from dying of things like cholera, and as a result of Musk’s handiwork, one groupsaidat least five children and three adults died in South Sudan because they couldn’t get care. DOGE directeddeep cutsto medical research, and, according to sworn testimony,orderedthe National Institutes of Health to terminate funding for hundreds of specific projects. Cancer treatment? Life-saving medications? Whoneeds those? More than 121,000 federal employees, many of them with decades of experience and deep institutional knowledge, had beenlaid off or targetedfor layoffs as of the end of April (some say the figure iscloser to 200,000). While Musk has bragged about how much money he and his lackeys have supposedly saved taxpayers, a nonpartisan group hasestimatedthe cuts willcost$135 billion, due to things like having to rehire people after mistakenly firing them. (See: bird flu expertswho got the ax.) Experts havesaidthe cuts have not only traumatized those directly affected but will impact those who have held onto their jobs, which could lead to PTSD.

    "title": "The Most Powerful Room in New York? Madison Square Garden During This Knicks Playoff Run",
    "article_text": "In the last month, Manhattan’s played host tohalf a dozen art fairs,the spring auctions, and more galas than one can shake a stick at, includingthe grandest of them all at The Met. But there’s an argument to be made that the borough’s power center during that whole stretch was one place, multiple times a week: courtside at Madison Square Garden as the New York Knickerbockers, the NBA team named after Washington Irving’s sobriquet for a blue-blooded local, made their unlikely march through the playoffs. This cosmopolitan city’s avenues of influence come from a wide diversity of industries, from banking and media to real estate and health care, and the Brahmins of each converge to root for the Knicks. That’s not the case when other NBA teams host a playoffs matchup at home. Maybe in Dallas you get oil barons, and at Warriors games you get Silicon Valley bigwigs, but in New York, the city’s rich history of literary and cultural philanthropy is on full display in its basketball fandom—it’s notjustA-listers and pop stars, like at, say, a Lakers game. Noah Baumbach,indie movie hero, is a New York basketball mega-fan whose debut film featured scenes where the main character getsvoicemails from his father, played byElliott Gould,with updates: “Did you see the Knicks-Bulls exhibition on Saturday?” “Call me. Knicks in trouble.” Warner Bros. Discovery CEODavid Zaslavappears to be a big Knicks fan, as does his occasional seatmateLarry David.Does it surprise you that Strokes frontmanJulian Casablancas,the avatar for a new generation of downtown rock and roll, loves the New York Knicks? It should not. I’ve been to a few games in good seats, and even when it’s not the playoffs, it’s astounding: billionaires, Wall Street titans, Hollywood studio heads, socialites, art dealers and their whale collectors, real estate tycoons and notorious financiers. The 150-odd spots that line the court at the world’s most famous arena make for a modern-day Mrs. Astor’s ballroom, with the roll call acting as a written history of who is on top in Gotham on that very evening. Let’s start with the people who you’ve already seen on the Jumbotron. You may have noticedSpike Leeat a few Knicks games over the years, and he was indeed present at the decisive win over the Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals May 16. That is, until he had to fly to Cannes to premiere his filmHighest 2 Lowest…in whichDenzel Washingtonplays a Celtics-hating Knicks fan with a signedJalen Brunsonjersey on his wall. Also present is the high chieftain of Knicks X,Ben Stiller—yeah, he madeSeverance,but he also posts some fiery hot takes from the Garden.Ed Burnsand his wife,Christy Turlington Burns,have been Knicks fans long before they landed in the playoffs with some regularity. Same withMichael J. Fox.Credit where credit is due. Plenty of pop music royalty too: In the last month,Bad Bunnysat courtside, as didCardi Band other musicians such asBusta Rhymes, Jelly Roll, Mary J. Blige,andCiara.And you could see on TV a deep squad of legendary comedians:Bill Murray, Tracy Morgan, Jerry Seinfeld,Larry David. And there’s no Knicks fan more dedicated thanTimothée Chalamet,who not only went to games one and two of the Pacers series, he also traveled with the team to Indianapolis to spur on a come-from-behind victory on the road Sunday, followed by the punishing loss on Tuesday night. Which isn’t surprising for Chalamet, a born-and-raised New Yorker, who, as a 14-year-old Knicks fan in 2010, won a trivia contest and got to meet then rookiesLandry FieldsandAndy Rautins.“Tim Chalamet is the winner. Found us at grand central. Congrats Tim!” Fieldsposted at the time. “See you Friday at the game.” But most shockingly, to one game Chalamet brought his girlfriend,Kylie Jenner,and her sisterKendall Jenner—two of the most famous Angelenos on the planet, with Lakers yellow and purple running through their veins. But there they were, courtside next to Chalamet, going nuts for the Knicks. But if there are, say, 20 famous faces in celebrity row each night, that leaves another 130-odd seats filled by people who might not make it on the Jumbotron but represent the great cross section of cultural firepower and financial might that defines New York City in 2025. I asked a number of sources who have been sitting courtside and courtside-adjacent at games the last few weeks if they could tell me a few people who have popped up, notables who might not make it on TV every night, but kind of, you know, run the city. There’s quite a large contingent of art dealers and art collectors in the mix—if that surprises you for some reason, it shouldn’t. New York’s Chelsea is still the nation’s largest concentration of primo blue-chip art galleries, and the art world is crazy about the Knicks.Larry Gagosianis often sitting courtside, right next to the media wall, and on one occasion brought with him the collectorTico Mugrabi.On another night, those seats were occupied bySteve Cohen,the Mets owner and billionaire hedge fund manager who also has one of the greatest art collections in America. He brought his wife,Alexandra Cohen. On other playoff nights, sources spotted the multigenerational art-dealing family the Acquavellas, as well asJoe Nahmad,the member of the Picasso-owning Nahmad family and the founder of the gallery Nahmad Contemporary.Vito Schnabel,the art dealer with galleries in Chelsea and the West Village, was sitting withJeff Zalaznick,partner at Major Food Group. Schnabel has curated the art installed at the group’s restaurant Carbone—yes, Chef!—as well as at ZZ’s Club, in Hudson Yards. Longtime mega-collectorDavid Geffenhas been in attendance, as well as collectorGlenn Fuhrman,who also runs the FLAG Art Foundation in Chelsea. CollectorAndres Santo Domingooften sits behind the baseline, and attended a game this month with the art dealerPC Valmorbida. Despite this being New York and not LA, there are plenty of Hollywood movers and shakers at the games. Netflix head honchoTed Sarandoscame by and sat courtside while in town for upfronts. When he wasn’t there with Larry David, Zaslav posted up withJohn McEnroeandDon Johnson. Jeffrey Katzenbergwas spotted sitting courtside as well. As for Wall Street,Dan Sundheim,the founder of D1 Capital, has been at most games. And several sources said they’ve spottedLeon Black,the Apollo cofounder, sitting courtside as well. Those who follow the exploits of celebrity row know about the secret suite at the Garden where invited VIPs can go enjoy food and drink courtesy of ownerJames Dolan.It’s not a thing that a courtside ticket will necessarily get you into—it’s invitation only, primarily to make sure the Turlington-Burnses and Jenners of the world have a place to chill during the break where they won’t have to be walled off by bodyguards. But the non-movie-star billionaires? They go to the Delta Sky360° Club. Located on the far side of the court, tucked under the bottom riser of seats, the Delta lounge is where you’ll find most of those mentioned above enjoying gratis food and a cash bar, taking advantage of an incredible mingling opportunity. I’ve sat in seats with Delta lounge access on a few occasions, and let me tell you, it’s something. At one point I was heading back to my seats and almost knocked intoJamie Dimon. “I bet the Delta lounge has been a networkingdream,” one Knicks source said. Though of course it remains to be seen what the vibe will be like tonight, when the Knicks face the Pacers at home in a win-or-go-home game five. To lose and end the season, after all this, is unthinkable. But hey, if that happens, you still get to walk out of the Garden and realize: At least you live in New York City, and not Indiana.

    "title": "Queen Camilla Underscored the Ties Between Britain and Canada With One Unexpected Jewelry Choice",
    "article_text": "This week,King Charles IIIandQueen Camillamade a three-day trip to Canada, where they still reign as king and queen. In a speech to parliament, the king made headlines for defending Canada’s “freedom” without making specific references to PresidentDonald Trump’s threats to turn the member of the Commonwealth into the 51st state. Though Camilla didn’t make any similar public remarks, her choice of jewelry emphasized the long-standing connections between Canada and generations of the royal family. During a Monday walkabout in Ottawa, the queen wore a familiar Canadian Maple Leaf brooch, crafted by jewelry brand Asprey in platinum and diamonds. The piece was given to the Queen Mother as a gift in 1939, and it has served as the must-have accessory for royals in Canada ever since. The late Queen Elizabeth made her debut in it back in 1951, and she continued to wear it for the rest of her life. She loaned it to Camilla during her previous trips to Canada, and bothPrincess AnneandKate Middletonwore the brooch when they visited the nation. Camilla paired the brooch witha pink Anna Valentine dressand another familiar piece crafted by Asprey, the 167 Button necklace. The 18ct white gold pendant features a central amethyst surrounded by pavé-set diamonds, and according toThe Court Jeweller’sLauren Kiehna,the necklace is also engraved with the initials of her grandchildren. During their Tuesday trip to the Canadian Parliament, where the king read a speech prepared by the government, now headed by recently elected Prime MinisterMark Carney,Camilla wore a green dress and a brooch with special significance in Canadian history, the Pellatt brooch bearing the insignia of the Queen’s Own Rifles of Canada, the Canadian militia’s oldest infantry regiment. Camilla became the colonel-in-chief of the regiment back in 2012, a role she took over fromPrincess Alexandra,The Honourable Lady Ogilvy. During her first trip to Canada following the appointment, she debuted the brooch, named after the regiment’s modern hero, industrialist and soldier Sir Henry Pellatt. The bejeweled piece is fashioned in the shape of the regiment’scap badge, including a figure 2 set in rubies. It’s unclear when the piece was created, but writerCarlie Oreskovichhas notedthat Pellatt’s wife, Mary, was seen wearing a “brilliant” diamond-and-ruby version of the regiment’s crest during its fiftieth-anniversary ceremony in 1910.

    "title": "After ‘Atlanta,’ Brian Tyree Henry Is “Reclaiming” His Name",
    "article_text": "Brian Tyree Henry’s career has been on such a steady rise that it’d be easy to dismiss how much work—and risk—has gone into every step of it. TakeDope Thief,the vehicle for Henry’s biggest onscreen leading role to date. As the North Carolina nativetold me earlier this year, the project took a lot out of him. Henry plays Ray, a formerly incarcerated recovering addict who goes on the run after a robbery gone wrong. The role required Henry to do a lot of introspection, at the same time that he was learning the ropes as a first-time executive producer. For this week’sLittle Gold Men(listen or read on below), I caught up with Henry, now thatDope Thief’s run has finished on Apple TV+. The actor speaks like someone at an inflection point: He’s past the exciting, sometimes confusing hump ofthe initial famethat came with his Emmy-nominated breakout onDonald Glover’sAtlanta.Since then, he’s received an Oscar nominationfor the character-driven indieCausewayand appeared in blockbuster franchises likeGodzillaandSpider-Verse.Now he feels prepared to take charge of his career by constantly upending our expectations of how it should look. Dope Thief’s sweet ending nicely exemplifies this. Ray has survived several life-or-death situations, finally finding himself out of harm’s way. He’s in a fast-food drive-through, sitting beside the undercover agent (Marin Ireland) who’s been after him all season. In a moment of peace, they order. They eat. He gets ketchup on his face. She wipes it off and says, “You’re clean.” Ray replies, “Hallelujah.” Vanity Fair:Dope Thiefhands you this really playful, at times crazy mix of tones. Can you talk about getting to play that? Brian Tyree Henry:Every single character in this show is fucking flawed. They are just people who are trying to make it, and aren’t usually choosing the best ways to do so. I often joke with [creator]Peter Craigabout his amazing skill—his weird Dr. Frankenstein way of making characters who are so incredibly flawed and dark be so lovable and likable. You want to know what’s going on with them regardless of if they make it or not. What I know about Ray and Manny [played byWagner Moura] is that there is still something incredibly youthful to them. Even though they are grown men in the eyes of society, there’s still this disconnect between how to be and how to be free. I just don’t think they think about their future that much. Their future technically was taken away from them when they were very young. But I think what elevates the show is the humor. We’re dealing with such dark subject matter—be it suicide, be it addiction, be it, I don’t know, cartels—but tragedy and comedy are hand in hand. You never really know when either is going to creep up on you. We spoke before the premiere, and you said that this project was personal for you. I’m curious what you remember about the period right after you finished filming. Did you take a break? I don’t know if you’ve met me, but I don’t know what the wordbreakmeans. That’s why I ask. When you are fortunate enough to be the lead of the show and the EP, you’re with the show until the show is released. It really is your child. I’ve found, in the course of my career, release has been hard—especially for these men that I’ve played, because I’ve spent so much time with them. They become a part of me. I realize that’s not always helpful, especially if you’re dealing with characters who are being required to confront so much loss, grief, trauma. But with Ray, it was very different because my whole point of taking Ray was to get him to the other side. I often joke that if this had come to me five years ago, there’s no way I would have been able to [do it]. I don’t know if I would have made it to the other side. So much is required in order to carry Ray. When you wrap a show like this, it doesn’t leave you. Once the show is over, you’re editing and you’re scoring and you’re looking at a lot of yourself. Which also was new for me, because all the projects I’ve been a part of, I’ve been at the mercy of the edit. But with this one, it was incredible to be able to go into the booth and watch the edits—to watch the lighting and the VFX, to watch the music go into place. I also had to release a lot of things. Once I finish a project, I don’t run to watch it. But with this one, I was forced to confront my choices, which—there’s just a whole metaphor baked into that. I would never have been able to sit with myself the way that I had to sit with myself for this show. But it gave me a true sense of pride at the end of the day. So all that to say, no, there is no break. But for this show, it was worth it. Dope Thief It might be hard to go back to the way that you used to experience acting, without that level of input. There’s no going back. What I’m hoping to achieve with being an EP is that, when you see my name attached to something, it comes with a certain caliber of excitement for you to be like, Oh, okay, well, we know what we’re going to get. It also gives me a chance to feel like I have a hand in making the sauce. Instead of just sitting at the table and consuming it, I actually get to know all the flavors and smells and varieties that go into making something that I cook. That is the progression that I want—and it’s addictive. I’m not going to lie. In my career, I’ve found myself doing [the work] of executive producers; I just wasn’t credited that way, or people didn’t think I was ready to be credited that way. But now, I know that is how I want to progress. Peter mentioned to me that he had an idea to continue the show. Are you interested in that? Gosh, man, I’d go anywhere with Peter. I believe in him so much, and I know he believes in me. It’s all about alignment for me, truly. If it aligns, then who am I to deny it? When you first started shooting the show, you were in Philadelphia. That’s where you learned of your Oscar nomination forCauseway.I wonder how you felt about yourself in that moment. The feeling of it is constantly changing. When people are like, “Emmy-nominated, Tony-nominated, Oscar-nominated,” when it comes to me, I’m like, Oh, right, I guess that’s my title. But you never really have the control of what you think people are going to recognize you for. I’m walking around with a sash that’s like, “Just so you know.” I just had an interview where I was talking about reclaiming my name. Getting my name back and the loss of that—when I took onAtlanta,I didn’t realize that I would just be known as Paper Boi to people. I went from Brian to Paper Boi, and I never had any say in how people knew me. That’s a big reason why I tookDope Thief,to reclaim my name again—to be like, Okay, well, you know that, but then you get to know this as well. Then Ialsodidn’t realize being an Oscar-nominated actor, what comes with that—because I was like, Well, what does this mean now? And will it ever happen again? Now you’re like, Oh, well, it’s happened once. It is an honor because it’s bestowed to you by your peers, by people who you want to believe know movies and know talent. But at the same time, I still have work to do. TheAtlantaparallel is interesting too, and I know you’ve talked about this: When you started on that show, you were very much treated like someone in his first acting job. People didn’t even know I was an actor. People thought that they pulled somebody off the street. Right. They did not know you had been on Broadway. They didn’t know that I was trained. They really thought that I was a rapper that Donald found somewhere in SWATS Atlanta and gave him his first shot, which—as an actor, that’s great! You know what I mean? But then you have to fight to remind people that, Hey, hold on, I did all this too. There’s this sense of ownership that people have, and I have to be okay with that. Paper Boi belongs to everybody. Paper Boi is a way for people to feel. It’s so crazy. I was out in the desert the other day, going to the grocery store, and there was this little white kid who had to be 15 years old that just saw me and waited in the parking lot for me to come out—just so he could go “Paper Boi!” and throw up the deuces. The ownership of Paper Boi made him feel connected to something. I have to remember over and over again that Paper Boi means something to people. He really does. He meant something to me, I care about him very much, but I have to remember who the hell I am at all times. I have to remember exactly who I want to be, how I want to present myself. With great success also comes great loss because that is something that I had to deal with. On top of being Paper Boi, I had to find a way to show people these other sides of me so that they get closer to Brian. I don’t know if, back then, I was ready for people to get closer to Brian, but now I’m like, No, it’s okay. Come closer to me, so you get to know me and all the things that I can do. Because I haven’t shown you anything yet. What do you feel ready to show people that you haven’t yet? Love. There’s a lot of love in Ray. There is, but it also comes with a lot of bullets and tears. And look, even love is messy. I would like to show you the softer side of who I am. I want to get to the cashmere level of my career, where it’s like, Ah, this is nice. I get to wear this. I get to be in love. I get to be kissed. Atlanta. During the pandemic, you were asked to do a virtual reading ofAngels in America.You pushed to play the lead, Prior—and Tony Kushner ended up writing you a letter basically saying, “I can’t believe I’d never seen a Black Prior before.” I imagine that speaks to your desire to push people’s expectations of you. When I gotAngels in America,everything that I saw of who had played it before, it already told me what I couldn’t do—every single thing at the beginning said, “Dah, dah, dah, but if you’re of color, Belize.” What I connected with the most was Prior. I was like, This is something I have to shout from the rooftops: I know I could do this. That’s been the testimony of my acting. When I read something and it hits me, and I feel like I can see myself in the space, I always ignore the things that people put at the front. I never really think about who played it before, what they looked like before. If I feel like my voice is the voice, then that’s where I’m going to go. It’s exciting, but it’s also tiring. It takes a lot to try to bend and stretch people’s imaginations, but I find that when the wordactionis called, that’s where I do the best. I’d rather show you than tell you. I don’t want to be a man who’s spending his career convincing anybody of anything—that’s already part of my job. But convincing you that I deserve to exist in a space that you have already told me that the expectation doesn’t include me, that’s more than I care to do. I guess that also means that I have to just keep EP’ing as well. That’s another great thing with that title: I get to choose. I get a say in how these men live, and the worlds they get to live in, and how they’re loved, and how they’re cherished. You were recently in London, where you shotPanic Carefully,which stars Julia Roberts and is directed by Sam Esmail. You’re playing a federal agent in that film. How did that fit into what is exciting you right now? What felt fresh? I’m just like, Wait, am I really sitting with Julia Roberts about to do this? Okay. To be able to do a high-action thriller with the people that I got to do it with, it was so much fun. I always try to remember that little kid in Fayetteville, North Carolina, who sat at his television and watched so many programs where he never saw himself—I would always put myself in them. When I would watch the shows, I would always see myself.Deliciousis the only word I can think of now. It’s so delicious to be able to know that the bandwidth has broadened, because I have decided to step in it. I want to just keep doing that and building on that.

    "title": "Billionaire Tech Freaks Get the Succession Treatment in Mountainhead",
    "article_text": "In case we don’t already spend enough time thinking about the sociopathic tech billionaires who are going to kill us all, HBO has a new movie premiering on May 31 about four such men. The film—calledMountainhead—is fromSuccessioncreatorJesse Armstrongand is thus not exactly sympathetic to the cause of accelerationist, techno-libertarian transhumanists. But even a biting satire requires that we spend an unpleasant amount of time with these ghouls and their bad ideas. Jason Schwartzmanplays Hugo, an investor and app developer who is ashamed that he, unlike his billionaire friends, is only worth $550 million. As a way to flex what he does have, Hugo invites three masters of the universe to his brand sprawling new modernist ski bunker in Utah for a weekend of poker and manly bonding. This is some kind of annual ritual, a gathering to make merry and toss around the next great terrible notion about humanity’s future. This time, though, the outside world begins to intrude. One of the guests, Venis (Cory Michael Smith), is the brash young founder of a globally dominant social media company that has just released an AI tool so effective it’s disrupting the world order. Venis tries to bluster past all the obvious disaster caused by his creation, but as his phone informs him of one violent uprising or government collapse after another—caused by disarmingly convincing AI videos and images—his confident strut takes on a nervous wobble. A former pal turned rival, Jeff (Ramy Youssef), arrives for the weekend smug in the knowledge that he owns a technology that can easily identify Venis’s AI fakes, thus mitigating their impact. This tech is sought by the U.S. government in the hopes that it will curb the quickly spreading catastrophe. But Venis wants to buy it first, so he can manage its effect on his cool new toy. Jeff seems to have at least a slight conscience about the recklessness of his fellow billionaires, but he’s also interested in wielding petty power at this little party. Venis has an ally in Randall (Steve Carell), the elder statesman of the group, a zillionaire venture capitalist whose interest in accelerationism—particularly of the kind that can move the world toward a post-human epoch—is partly guided by a terminal cancer diagnosis that he refuses to accept. In essence, we have a stand-in forPeter Thiel(if Peter Thiel was dying) going to bat for a slightly alteredMark Zuckerberg, with two composite characters rounding out the quartet. Mountainheadwas made in a hurry—it was filmed in March—and seemingly written as a response to the nightmarish takeover of government by tech freaks like Thiel andElon Musk. These have indeed been sensational, frightening events, ones worth covering in scripted form. With his detailed knowledge of the towering arrogance and stupidity of the oligarch class, Armstrong would seem the ideal interpreter of all this madness. And at times,Mountainheaddelivers. It is grimly amusing to watch these awful men plot and scheme in the way we imagine guys like them—pseudo-philosophical, amoral, convinced that anyone who isn’t them is nothing but an NPC—do here in the real world. That kind of scary confirmation—imagined but ringing with truth—can be cathartic, just as it was onSuccession. But jolts of gallows-humor satisfaction can only carryMountainheadso far. Given that this is filmed entertainment, we must at some point get to an actual story, which is where Armstrong falters. The plot, such as it is, emerges after tensions among the group rise to absurd heights—though I suspect Armstrong might argue they’re not so absurd at all. Either way, a crucial credibility is missing here. It’s becomes too easy to seeMountainheadas a mere hastily made comedy, a chance for these four actors to put on a kind of play, in which they can curse and spar and toss around a lot of inside-baseball lingo. No one is really delving into the human heart of these characters—save, maybe, for Smith as the buffoonish, overgrown dorm-room nerd who refuses to grapple with the tangible consequences of his inventions. He keenly renders a geek thrilled (and still, deep down, shocked) to have become a god, his antipathy for the world clearly sourced from the most adolescent of grievances. Youssef tries to plumb some depths too, though his character is the most confusingly rendered—it’s not quite believable that Jeff would ever have been such a willing participant in this cabal. Maybe the few moments whenMountainheaddoes take on a chilling relevance—when it seems to pick at something nightmarishly real—are enough to justify the sillier stuff. And, we must sadly admit, that silly stuff may not actually be that silly. This year, the sociopathy of the tech industry—or, at least, a faction of it—led toa cult murder spree, motivated in part by the so-called rationalist mindset that Armstrong is skewering here. To say nothing of the many people mortally harmed by, say, DOGE gutting various government programs. If nothing else,Mountainheadis an introduction for those not terminally online to the profoundly unsettling ethos that has captured the chambers of money and power in this country, and around the world. As Saturday night entertainment, it falls short. And it’s not as informative as a journalistic long read. But at least it’s something, the slightest of pushes back against the people trying so offhandedly to grind us into soylent.

    "title": "Matthew Goode Isn’t a Hostile Jerk—He Just Plays One on ‘Dept. Q’",
    "article_text": "Matthew Goodehad no idea that writer-directorScott Frank—cocreator ofThe Queen’s Gambitand creator ofGodless—had written the lead of a new series,Dept. Q,with Goode in mind. Though the pair had kept in touch since Goode played a Kansas City thug in Frank’s 2007 filmThe Lookout—and they also shared an agent—Goode also wasn’t aware that Frank had been working on the show, an adaptation ofJussi Adler-Olsen’s Danish novels, until their shared rep gave him a call. “They were gleaning my interest, which piqued very quickly,” Goode says of the character-driven police drama in which he stars as Detective Chief Inspector Carl Morck, a snarky English cop with a superiority complex. Morck is contemptuous of everyone in his adopted home of Edinburgh—except, perhaps, his Scottish partner, DCI James Hardy (Jamie Sives). “It’s quite worrying, really, when Scott says he thought of me to play the part. Maybe it’s because he thinks I’ve been working in the British film industry for 20-odd years and that I’ll bring that good sense of jadedness to it.” Nevertheless, Goode—who’s known for such films asThe Imitation GameandBrideshead Revisited,and TV series includingThe Good WifeandDownton Abbey—wasn’t a shoo-in for the role. “Scott had to go to bat for me because I’m not, you know,Tom HardyorZendaya,” he jokes during a late-afternoon Zoom interview from the UK in “the snug room”—a.k.a. his wifeSophie Dymoke’s Surrey home office—as one of their three kids (Matildais 16,Teddy,11, andRalph,nine) sometimes sets off the car alarm, and another runs in and out of the space that doubles as the family’s screening room. “The folks at Netflix I’m sure wanted a bigger ‘name,’ as the cost of the show was going to be high for their British division,” Frank explains via email. “But when I pointed out the range of roles Matthew had played, as well as the fact that today, it’s more often than not the show that makes the star, rather than vice versa, they gave their approval and then expressed nothing but white-hot enthusiasm for his performance.” Clean-shaven and affable in conversation, Goode sports a white tee and baseball cap, and occasionally pulls on a vape pen. He’s infinitely more laid-back and self-effacing than the brittle, bearded single father whose life implodes whenDept. Qopens. As the first detectives to arrive on the scene where a dead body sits in a chair, the partners walk into what may be an ambush. The attack leaves a young constable dead, Hardy partially paralyzed, and Morck, having survived a bullet to the face, now guilt-ridden and ordered to see a shrink. “I had problems with other human beings long before I was shot,” he tells Dr. Rachel Irving (Kelly Macdonald) when she suggests that PTSD may make interacting with people difficult. Visiting Hardy in the hospital after his return to work, he reports that “nothing’s changed. All fucking morons. I think I’m just gonna put my time in and be done with it.” But his boss, Detective Chief Superintendent Moira Jacobson (Kate Dickie), has other ideas. To get him out of her hair (“Do you ever stop and wonder why people hate you?” she asks), he’s assigned to a newly created cold-case unit that’s really just a PR stunt, and stashed in the station basement’s former shower room. Soon, Goode’s malcontent has assembled a team that includes Akram (Alexej Manvelov), an enigmatic Syrian émigré (“He comes dressed as a geography teacher, but it might turn out that he’s actually Batman,” Goode says), and Rose (Leah Byrne), a plucky, sidelined detective who’s itching to get back to work. Morck even enlists Hardy from his hospital bed as they investigate the mysterious disappearance of a prosecutor (Chloe Pirrie) with a complicated past. Frank—who wrote or cowrote all nine episodes of the series, and directed six—relocated the story from Copenhagen to Edinburgh, and told his star not to bother reading Adler-Olsen’s books. “Considering I’ve done quite a few adaptations in my time, I found that so freeing,” Goode says. Instead, the actor recently seen as a vampire inA Discovery of Witches,Hollywood producer Robert Evans inThe Offer,and C.S. Lewis (oppositeAnthony Hopkins) inFreud’s Last Session,got under the prickly cop’s skin by reading up on police procedures, talking to a former cop acquaintance who worked murders, and recalling confidences shared by military-veteran mates who suffered with PTSD. He told Frank that one friend used a stress ball to relieve tension. The anecdote inspired the container of tennis balls found in Rachel’s borrowed office. Though Morck initially scoffs at using them, he then changes his mind. Ultimately, Goode absorbed the essence of his tightly wound detective—“There is a great kindness to him, but it requires mining to get to”—during hot soaks. “I spent a lot of time in my bathtub, really, just daydreaming and popping in memories…just to bolster all the sort of literal evidence that you can find in and around you.” Whether he’ll watch his performance is another story. Goode still hasn’t fully checked out his Emmy-nominated turn as Anthony Armstrong-Jones inThe Crown,except for the episode in which Lord Snowden takes Princess Margaret’s picture. “I watch a lot of sport. I’m not mad keen to see stuff that I’m in always. And I knew that show was gonna get difficult to watch the closer it got up to date. But I’ve heard it’s great.” Talk to him a bit, and it’s clear that Goode—“Goody” to his wife, and other intimates—has a refreshingly frank take on life in the entertainment industry. Don’t get him started on awards shows; ask about which actors he’s close to, and he says, “I only really see my kids and my wife. That’s it. I’m a bit of a shut-in, really. I quite like it. I don’t really do anything showbizzy.” When he does get together with people likeMatthew Rhys,with whom he didThe Wine Show,they don’t talk shop. “He’s a fine actor [and]hystericallyfunny. But no, we wouldnevertalk about work. We’d be far too busy giggling and, um, drinking.” Goode did send Hopkins a note after the Oscar winner lost his Pacific Palisades home in the recent LA fires. “It was such a joy to work with him, and I wasn’t afraid, which I thought I was going to be. He was so warm and welcoming, and I had him to myself for three weeks…. He was everything I wanted him to be, and I hope he had a nice time with me. I’m pretty sure he didn’t. But, no, we’re not best buds. You do your work and then you move on.” One upcoming project that he won’t be a part of is the thirdDownton Abbeymovie. Goode’s Henry Talbot wasn’t by Lady Mary’s side in the franchise’s second feature film because he was busy shootingThe Offer.He just toldRadio Timesthat a “buggered” knee and an ensuing surgery kept him from the third picture. “And let’s face it,” Goode told the outlet of hisDowntoncharacter—“he was edging towards becoming a bit of a wet lettuce.” The same cannot be said of Morck, whose bad humor began rubbing off on Goode while filming the series over six months. “I don’t really bring work home with me that much. But there was a bit of osmosis. I did become a little bit short-tempered,” he chuckles. “Not with people on set…. I don’t even know how to explain it. I got infected by a bit of Morck.” Still, Goode hopes viewers like his cop enough to warrant a second season. “Well, that would be something new for me.” The UnsinkableKathy Bates HowJohn LandgrafBrought YouThe Bear, Fargo, Shōgun,and More From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "title": "Kate Middleton Has Hilarious Response After Being Mistaken for Prince William's Assistant",
    "article_text": "HELLO!magazine has unearthed a royal anecdote proving thatKate Middletonhas a charming answer for everything, even when being mistaken for her husband's assistant. In 2020,Prince Williamand Princess Kate visited the residents of a Cardiff retirement home, a few months after playing bingo with them via Zoom. The couple were reunited with 87-year-old patientJoan Drew-Smith, who was quick to question their bingo skills after their game. They are, after all, game enthusiasts andgreat competitors. \"You may not recognize us, but we played bingo with you and you won,\" began Prince William. “But you said we didn't do a very good job?” \"No, you did a crap job,\" reiterated the patient. \"Excellent!\" responded William, laughing out loud, promptly imitated by the rest of the assembly. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. “Is this your assistant?” Drew-Smith then asked, pointing to the Princess of Wales, seated next to William, her face half-hidden behind a mask. Amused by the remark, the Brit immediately laughed and replied: “Well, I'm his assistant! I have been for a long time!” Following the resident's outspokenness, Prince William told the staff he “adored Joan.” \"She's brilliant,\" he said after the visit. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Despite their popularity and titles, Kate and William's faces are sometimes unfamiliar to those who meet them. Like the Scottish schoolboy who, in November 2023, asked the Princess of Wales about her identity. “Who am I?” she replied. “I'm married to William,” she humbly explained, pointing to the future king who was greeting other children in the background.

    "title": "Anyone Want to Buy Stanley Kubrick’s Stunning English Mansion?",
    "article_text": "In the heart of the countryside of Hertfordshire, a county in eastern England, lies a one-of-a-kind property: the historic residence of famed filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. Born in New York, Kubrick spent more than half his life in Hertfordshire. He bought the home that’s now for sale, called Abbots Mead, in 1965 and lived there for 14 years. The property, less than an hour by train from London, has been expanded and altered over the years and now offers a spacious and flexible three-floor home. “We are very fortunate to have the privilege of selling many extraordinary homes with a rich and varied history. However, it is rare for a place to have such a direct connection to the world of film, unless it was used as a filming location,” said real estate agentSteven Spencer.“The close proximity to Elstree Studios made it the perfect base for Kubrick and his family. He also worked a lot from home—carefully managing all aspects of four films from his extraordinary body of work from within its four walls.” The bright and spacious interiors retain all the elegance of the period: high ceilings, ornate cornices, carved marble fireplaces, original doors, and large windows offering spectacular views of the gardens. On the ground floor are four sitting rooms with large windows overlooking the garden. The main living room, with wood floors and a decorative fireplace, opens to the conservatory and study, while the dining room, enhanced by a fireplace, bow window, and French doors, overlooks a rooftop terrace. The family living room boasts an additional fireplace and direct access to the garden, and connects harmoniously to the kitchen and entrance hall. The rustic-style kitchen, with solid pine cabinetry and open shelving, opens onto a cozy breakfast room. On the second floor, the master suite is a private oasis with a large bedroom, decorative fireplace, walk-in closet, and two bathrooms. Three additional bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a study complete the floor. The second floor houses five more bedrooms and a large hallway. The property is accessed through an elegant wrought iron gate with electronic opening and a video intercom, which leads to a gravel driveway with ample parking and a detached garage block consisting of a double garage, a single garage, and a first-floor apartment with a living room, kitchen, two bedrooms, and bathroom. The garden at the back of the house is accessible from several rooms, with a covered terrace ideal for outdoor dining. There’s a wisteria-covered pergola, a gazebo, and an orchard, which provide a private and charming environment. Completing the outdoor spaces are two large greenhouses, a large workshop, and several outbuildings, including a storage room and a studio. A real highlight of Abbots Mead is the stunning outdoor heated swimming pool, nestled in the quiet garden. Surrounded by a large terrace, it is perfect for moments of relaxation, entertainment, and outdoor living during warm weather. The pool area is complemented by a pool house equipped with a changing room, shower room, sauna, and comfortable service areas, with sliding doors opening directly onto the terrace. Also within the boundaries of the main property is Abbots Mead Lodge, a detached villa with a private garden and separate entrance. Interiors include a large living room, a dining room with an open kitchen, a bathroom, a laundry room, and a study/salon on the ground floor. On the second floor are four bedrooms and two bathrooms, offering ideal spaces for guests, extended family, or service staff. The property is for sale onSavillsfor the price of 6,950,000 British pounds. Original story inVFItalia. default More from Vanity Fair Contact ©2025Condé Nast.

    "title": "Justin Bieber Goes Quiet After Hailey Bieber Becomes a Beauty Billionaire",
    "article_text": "After selling her Rhode brand to e.l.f. Beauty for a cool $1 billion,Hailey Bieberofficially became a billionaire—andher husbandJustinhonored the big business deal by keeping his mouth shut. On May 28, the day the acquisition was announced, Justin shared a photo of Hailey standing behind a desk with some of her skin-care products, alongside a screenshot of her confirming the news onInstagram. But aftersparking backlashwith his response to Hailey’s recentVoguecover, Justin kept any of his own praise—backhanded or otherwise—off of social media. Hailey, who will remain chief creative officer and head of innovation at Rhode, in addition to acting as a strategic adviser for e.l.f., celebrated the sale and reflected on founding the brand in 2022. “I always had big dreams for the company, and the most important thing to me is to keep bringing rhode to more spaces, places, and faces globally,” she wrote in her own May 28Instagram post. “So, today I am so incredibly excited and proud to announce that we are partnering with e.l.f. Beauty as we step into this next chapter in the world of rhode.” She continued: “I found a like-minded disruptor with a vision to be a different kind of company that believes in big ideas and innovation in the same way that I do and will help us continue to grow the brand.” Rhode Beauty is e.l.f.’s largest purchase to date, topping its $355 million acquisition of skin care brand Naturium in 2023,CNN reports. The deal includes $800 million in cash and stock at closing, with a potential additional $200 million earnout based on Rhode’s future growth. Perhaps it was wise for Justin to forego any public words about Hailey’s accomplishments. When acknowledging her first soloVoguecover last week, Justin inexplicably wrote onInstagramthat he once told Hailey during “a huge fight” that she would “never be on the cover ofVogue.” He apologized for this miscalculation in the original caption, thendeletedhis comments altogether, replacing them with a series of emojis reading, “🤷🫵🏻🫶🏼🥹.” In theVoguearticle itself, Bieber praised his wife, writing to the outlet via email, “I’ve done a lot of dumb things in my life, but the smartest thing I’ve ever done was marry Hailey.” Hailey, meanwhile, told the magazine that she follows Justin’s advice when it comes to dealing with the spotlight. “I’ve learned so much from Justin, really,” she said. “He’s been doing this literally since he was a child and he has had to face the most scrutiny of any person that I know. He was, like, ‘Baby, trust me, I’ve been here before many, many times. You’re not going to win. There is no winning.’” The couplewedin a 2018 civil ceremony, then threw a star-studded2019 weddingin South Carolina. On August 23, 2024, the pairannounced the birth of their son,Jack Blues. Despite speculation about the state of their marriage, things appear to be going strong between the Biebers. Earlier in the day on Wednesday, Justinpostedphotos of himself kissing Hailey on the cheek while cupping her breasts. And on Friday, May 23, Haileycheered Justin onas he made a surprise onstage appearance duringSZA’s concert at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, writing, “My 2 favorite artists” over a video of their performance.

    "article_text": "On the balcony of Amalienborg Palace on May 26,the Danish royal familygreeted a massive crowd celebratingKingFrederik X's 57th birthday. At his side wereQueen Mary,PrincessesJosephineandIsabelle,Prince Vincent, andQueen Margrethe, whoabdicated on January 14, 2024. OnlyCrown Prince Christian, currently in military training, was missing. But the vacant seat didn't stay vacant for long. An adorable fur ball stole the show: one of the family's border collies spontaneously invited itself onto the balcony, immortalized by the photographers on hand. The moment was both comical and historic, as it was the very first time a royal dog had made a public appearance on a balcony. The only unsolved mystery: was it Coco or Grace? The Danes welcomed Grace, a relative of the late Ziggy, in 2017. She then gave birth to Coco in 2021. But the two dogs look so much alike that no one can tell them apart. In the end, it doesn't matter, because the one who slipped into the photo won the hearts of the Danes, adding a touch of tenderness and spontaneity to this historic image. In her own way, she joins the exclusive circle of European royal dogs. After the death of Beth, the Queen's beloved jack russell terrier,Queen CamillaandKing Charles IIIwelcomed a new puppy, Moley, adopted from the Battersea Dogs and Cat Homes shelter. A touching snapshot of the queen carrying the little dog in her arms was published on May 18, delighting fans of the monarchy. For their part,Kate MiddletonandPrince Williamrecently sawtheir cocker spaniel Orlagive birth to four puppies, promising happy stirrings in Kensington Gardens and, who knows, perhaps future surprise appearances on special occasions.

    "title": "Max Disables Comments Under ‘Harry Potter’ Cast Announcement, Staving Off Threats and Insults",
    "article_text": "IsHarry Potteruntouchable? For years, fans of the past two decades’ most famous literary saga have been divided about the original Warner Bros. adaptations ofJ.K. Rowling’s novels, complaining that some of the films sacrificed details from the books due to time and style issues. At the same time, that series’ lead actors—Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint,andEmma Watson—have become so embedded in our imagination that it’s nearly impossible not to picture their faces every time we pick up the books. Was there a need, then, for a new TV series based on theHarry Potteruniverse, eager to be as faithful as possible to the books? Warner Bros. Discovery believes so. Thenew series, which is set to cover the events of one book each season, is expected to begin filming this summer. It’s only right that a story as emotionally and narratively impactful asHarry Pottershould be told through new points of view. Yet it is also clear that some audiences—people who are accustomed to using social media as a place to vent—do not agree. Earlier this week,HBO announcedthe names of the three young actors who will play Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the series:Dominic McLaughlin, Alastair Stout,andArabella Stanton,respectively. But its streamer, Max,closed the commentsunder its announcement on Instagram, likely to prevent it from being flooded with insults and criticisms. It followed the same procedure when the actors playing Dumbledore, Quirrell, and otherswere announced—much to the indignation of some fans who wereincensedover the series choosing a Black actor,Paapa Essiedu,to play Professor Snape. Leaving aside the fact that this preemptive hatred seems based more in ignorance than anything else, we ask: Shouldn’t audiences consider seeing how the actors do first, then criticize them if necessary? If you think that Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are the only actors who can ever conceivably play the main characters inHarry Potter,fine, don’t watch the series—go rewatch the films instead. But to insult three young actors simply for winning an audition seems to us a punishment worthy of an Imperius curse. Original story inVFItalia.",

    "title": "Stop Asking Mike White’s Casting Guru If You Can Be on ‘The White Lotus’",
    "article_text": "Casting directorMeredith TuckerandWhite LotuscreatorMike Whitehave been friends and collaborators since they met in an acting class during their freshman year at Wesleyan University. They’ve worked together on many of White’s projects, including 2007’sYear of the Dog, 2016’sMamma Dallas,and 2017’sBrad’s Status,and she also helped out on his hit seriesEnlightened.Over the years, they’ve developed a shorthand that has served them well. “It makes things a little easier,” Tucker tellsVanity Fair.“I mean, it makes things a little harder too, because I don’t want to let him down.” She definitely hasn’t disappointed with their latest collaboration: HBO’s hitThe White Lotus,on which Tucker has worked for all three seasons. With its colorful characters and wild, juicy storylines, the critically acclaimed series has cultivated a slew ofbreakout performancesfrom actors likeMeghann Fahy,Leo Woodall,and, most recently,Patrick Schwarzenegger.It’s also juiced the careers of more established actors, such asJennifer CoolidgeandCarrie Coon.So it should come as no surprise that a lot of hopeful agents and actors are metaphorically knocking on Tucker’s door. “I’ve been getting a lot of emails from actors that swear they’ve heard that it’s gonna shoot in Morocco, they swear it’s gonna be in Türkiye this year,” she says with a laugh. “Some people are like, ‘I’ve never acted before, but I’d really love to be on the show.’ I think because it’s so hypernaturalistic, people assume these people are not acting. But it takes tremendous skill and tremendous writing and tremendous directing to make it seem that way.” While she can’t say anything about the upcoming season, Tucker, a five-time Emmy winner who earned hardware forThe White Lotusin 2022 and 2023, had plenty to say about her work on the show—including how they cast such real-looking siblings, what she looks for in an alpha male character, and why she thinks the show appeals to so many actors. Tucker Vanity Fair:Almost everyone has to audition forThe White Lotus.Do you and Mike start with a wish list of actors for each role? Meredith Tucker:We start working on lists, but then take a lot from the agents—especially with the younger characters. I did not knowSarah Catherine Hookbefore we started this process. I knew Patrick [Schwarzenegger], I knewSam [Nivola], but I did not knowAdam DiMarcobefore we started. So a lot of those parts really do come from auditions. Obviously, it’s not a democracy—but because the show is so popular, I do try to cast a wide net and give people the opportunity to read. Especially the young people who might not have had that much professional experience. Has the process changed a lot since the first season, when the series wasn’t as well-known as it is now? The thing about season one—we did it very quickly, but it was one of the few things that was trying to shoot in that fall 2020 window that was actively casting. So because Michael was already established as this writer-director that people do in general clamor to work with, people were pretty enthusiastic, even from the start. Obviously, that has only grown. Season one, because it was a short timeline and because we were shooting in the States, we could only consider Americans. And now that we’ve gone global, the incoming can come from everywhere. How do you go about casting siblings and families? Do you choose one person first, then cast around them? It’s kind of crazy that it’s worked out as well as it has in the past. It’s a degree of, do these people physically look like each other? Do you buy it? We don’t do chemistry reads at all and never have. But season one, when we sawSydney [Sweeney]andFred [Hechinger]andSteve [Zahn]andConnie [Britton], it was like, Wow, these people really do look like a family. It really does come organically from the performances. Patrick Schwarzenegger told me abouthow he seduced the camerain his audition tape. Do you remember his tape? I remember him being very present and dropping into the character very realistically—the confidence. I did not think, Oh, he’s making eyes at me. But it was a very, very strong self-tape. And it seemed like he understood the kind of guy he was playing. As the season goes on and the layers come out, especially in the last episode when he’s talking to Chelsea on the beach—and then she sees Rick and runs away, and he looked so longingly at her, realizing that he will never have that? I just thought it was such a beautiful moment. How did you go about casting the three friends played by Carrie Coon, Leslie Bibb, and Michelle Monaghan? Michael did want them to look a little bit alike, because of the identity and Buddhism and mirroring that was the thematic point of the season. Because they were childhood friends, they had to be relatively the same age. We were playing with some women in their early 40s, and what that kind of meant if you’re closer to 50, as opposed to closer to 40. Ultimately, he decided he liked going the older route. For Michelle’s character, an older actress—it’s loaded for her in some regards. For Carrie’s character, the disappointments of life and all of that. And Leslie just sort of taking stock of everything. I think Leslie was the first one, and we built around that. The three of them did such a beautiful job. Do you see anything specific about the alpha males you’ve had to cast throughout the series, from Patrick to Theo James? The thing that’s so great about Michael’s writing is that, yes, these guys look one way, but they are so multifaceted. I think about Theo when he is flossing his teeth, when Daphne is on the phone with the kids. It was such a small moment, but there was such anger in the flossing. They’re three-dimensional; it’s not like they’re just bros. In terms of these guys in particular, you just need to be able to see the humanity. You need an actor who can present all the different facets, all the different colors. I’ve always thought casting is intuitive. Do you think that’s the case? I think it very much is. It’s, do you actually buy this person in this character? And there’s something slightly inexplicable about that. Especially with this show. The nature, the tone—it is slightly hyperrealistic but incredibly grounded, but real and funny. Some people’s energy is just not quite right for it. They can be a phenomenal actor, but just might be a little theatrical. They might not have the right sense of humor. Not everyone does fit in this world, I don’t think. How has your process changed since you started working on this show? A lot of it is just managing the incoming [requests], which is understandable. People want to be on the show. I’ve said this before: It is much better to be on a show that everyone wants to be on. But it’s about being able to say, “Hey, I don’t think this person is right,” and I hope that people will take me at my word. Especially with something like this, when we don’t want to divulge certain things narratively in the casting process. I have a lot more information than they do. And so trying to convey, like, “Hey, I understand your client really loves the show, but they’re not right here”—I hope I’m getting better at explaining that. But sometimes people just don’t listen. A lot of times they don’t listen. I understand they are doing their job, and if they have a client that really wants to be on the show, it is their job to not take no for an answer. Speaking of, anything to share about the next season? I have no idea what’s going on for next season. I don’t think Michael knows yet. People are saying “so-and-so would be great on the show”—it’s like, yeah, they could be. I have no idea if there’ll be a part for them. [Laughs] But again, I feel very blessed and lucky to be part of it.

    "title": "Former Princess Of Japan, Mako, Welcomes Her First Child",
    "article_text": "Mako Komuro,formerly Princess Mako of Japan, has just entered a new chapter in life: motherhood. According to theJapanese magazineJesei Seven, the ex-royal and her husband,Kei Komuro, reportedly welcomed their first child a few weeks ago. In the published images, Mako and Komuro are seen walking with a baby stroller in a residential neighborhood of New York, where the two settled following their wedding and Mako's abnegation of her royal title and duties. Mako of Japan and Kei Komuro married in 2021. Mako and Komuro met when they were both studying at Gakushuin University in Tokyo. Their relationship began in 2012 and although they were engaged six years later, they waited another three years to get married. The civil ceremony took place on October 26, 2021 and at that time, the niece of theEmperor Naruhitowas removed from any public duties on behalf of the Japanese imperial family, adopting the surname of her husband. In addition, she waived her corresponding dowry, about 150 million yen, approximately $1.35 million. After the wedding, in November 2021, the princess settled with her husband in New York, where he graduated from Fordham University that same year and began working in a law firm. There they began a new,essentially anonymous life in a small apartmentthey rented for about $4,500 a month in Hell's Kitchen. Little to nothing is known about the life 33-year-old Mako has been leading in the city. In the few images that have been captured of her, she can be seen shopping in neighborhoods like Chelsea and Soho as well as strolling through flea markets, Amish Market (known for its locally sourced organic fare) as well as browsing for second-hand clothes and vintage pieces. The ex-princessmoves around the city like any other citizenand goes from one place to another by public transport. Mako renounced her title and imperial rights. Mako studied art history and has been known to haveworked for a time as an art dealer for the Metropolitan Museum. She broke with the tradition of her country's monarchy by going abroad to train at Edinburgh University and the University College Dublin. She then graduated in Art and Cultural Heritage at the International Christian University in Tokyo, where she obtained a certificate in heritage conservation and a driver's license, which was also unusual in her family. She continued her studies in the United Kingdom, where she earned a Master's degree in Museology at the University of Leicester. For his part, her husband Komuro started working at Manhattan law firm Lowenstein Sandler LLP, but naturally first had to pass the state exam. He first sat for 2021 but failed and tried again in February of the following year. It was finally in October 2022 whenKomuro passed that test after two failed attempts. Prince Hisahito will celebrate his coming of age next year. Although she is no longer attached to the institutional duties of the court of Emperor Naruhito, next September Mako could return to Japan to attend the celebrations for the 19th birthday of her brother,Prince Hisahito,second in line to the throne behind his father. Although the prince came of age last year, he decided to postpone festivities in order to finish his high school studies earlier. There will be a big party to commemorate the date and it is likely the whole family will be reunited, including the former princess. Originally published in Vanity Fair Spain.

    "title": "How Desi Arnaz Defied the Suits and Got Lucille Ball’s Pregnancy on TV: “Don’t F--k Around with the Cuban”",
    "article_text": "For all ofI Love Lucy’s success, tensions were building behind the scenes. Lucy had long been attuned to Desi’s exquisite sensitivity about his standing in Hollywood relative to hers and had gone out of her way to give him public credit and praise whenever she could. With that in mind, in rehearsal one day Lucy asked Al Simon to suggest to Desi that he should become executive producer. Not long afterward, Desi went to see Jess Oppenheimer in his office. “Jess,” he said, “you and I know that after this show goes off the air, I’m not going to get a lot of other acting jobs. What I really want to do is produce, but I need to build a reputation as a producer. How would you feel about letting me take executive producer credit on the show?” Oppenheimer’s contract with CBS specified that he had creative control and that any disputes with Desi were to be put to a three-way vote, with Lucy holding the effective veto. He worried that Desi’s taking the executive producer title might sow doubts about his own authority, as he was also working to build up his reputation in Hollywood. He suggested alternatives—“executive in charge of production” or “co-producer”—but Desi wouldn’t bite. They agreed to discuss the matter again after thinking it over. On March 2, 1952, Desi turned thirty-five, and in the middle of his birthday party he again approached Jess about taking the title. Desi’s timing was opportune. By this point, Oppenheimer would recall years later, he was so exhausted by his multiple duties as producer and head writer that he had been considering quitting the show altogether. So he was willing to be relieved of some of the business-related decisions that came with his job, and when Desi assured him that his executive producer title would come after Oppenheimer’s in the roll of on-screen credits and would not affect his producing powers, they agreed that the new arrangement would start in April. With the episode that aired on Monday, April 7,I Love Lucybecame the first program in the history of television to reach ten million homes, or 63.2 percent of all the television sets in America. With an average of 2.9 viewers on each set, that meant that more than thirty million people, including seven million children—nearly one-fifth of the country’s population—were watching the show. Later that month, the A.C. Nielsen rating service officially pronouncedI Love Lucythe number one show on television. At a party to celebrate that milestone, Desi gave Jess a small trophy of a baseball player in mid-swing with the inscription Jess Oppenheimer, The Man Behind the Ball. The production team seemed united in triumph. But a few days later Jess was shocked to get a call from Eddie Feldman at the Biow Agency, urgently telling him to get hold of a copy of theHollywood Reporter. Dan Jenkins, one of the Arnazes’ favorite reporters, had the scoop on Desi’s new title. He apportioned credit for the show’s success to many hands—including Oppenheimer’s—but “above all to Desi Arnaz, the crazy Cuban whom Oppenheimer insists has been the real producer all along and who in two weeks reluctantly starts taking screen credit as producer.” Jess was stunned and stormed angrily into Desi’s office, demanding to know how Desi could have put such words in his mouth. “It’s like I told you, amigo,” Desi replied calmly, “I need to build a rep as a producer.” Oppenheimer instantly realized that he couldn’t correct the record without hurting the show—andthe Arnazes’ marriage—so he and Desi worked out an uneasy détente. “He started to get into the various areas of production and postproduction,” Dann Cahn said of Desi, “and he was a quick study and he did grab it all, and there was a certain creative conflict between him and Jess as to who was running the show.” In effect, Desi now vied with Jess for the role of showrunner, once again becoming the first Latino to lay claim to such an assignment—a job he would eventually take on undisputed before the end of the show’s run. Bill Asher, the director, added: “It kind of became a wedge between them. They never really got along after that.” Jess was still smarting nearly twenty-five years later, when Desi published his memoir and failed to acknowledge thatI Love Lucyhad ever had any producer other than himself. Desi had become so used to being underestimated and taken for granted that when it was finally his turn to control the narrative, he sometimes took too much credit. That’s a shame, but it shouldn’t detract from the indispensable contributions he had made from the start. After all, he and Lucy owned the show, and Lucy never left any doubt that it was Desi who controlled the purse strings—a reality also always reflected by Bob Carroll and Madelyn Pugh. “Bob and I have always attributed a great deal of the success ofI Love Lucyto the fact that Lucy would do absolutely anything we could dream up and Desi would pay for it,” Pugh recalled. “It gave us marvelous creative freedom. Nothing was impossible. If it was funny, we could do it. In May 1952, just as the first season’s shooting was winding down, Lucy came to Desi with a bulletin. They adored little Lucie, and were still adapting to parenthood, but they had always envisioned a bigger family. “Hey, Father,” she told him, “I’ve got news for you. I’m pregnant again.” Just nine months after the birth of Lucie, this was indeed a bombshell—and perhaps a death knell forI Love Lucy. It seemed impossible that a pregnant woman would appear on the air. “Oh, my God. What are we going to do?” Jess Oppenheimer exclaimed after hearing the news. “What do you mean, what are we going to do? She’s going to have a baby,” Desi responded. “What about Lucy Ricardo having a baby as part of our shows this year?” “They’ll never let you do that,” Jess immediately retorted. That was Desi’s recollection. A much more credible account— offered by both Jess and Lucy—is that Desi came to Jess with the news, visibly worried and swallowing hard. “How long will we have to be off the air?” he asked. In a flash, without thinking, it was Jess who took Desi’s hand and pumped it—with a brainstorm that would make television history. “Congratulations, this is wonderful!” Oppenheimer said. “This is just what we need to give us excitement in our second season. Lucy Ricardo will have a baby too!” Whoever had the idea, what is not in dispute is that the notion of a pregnant Lucy Ricardo faced a steep and immediate uphill battle in the corporate suites of CBS and Philip Morris. While there was no codified ban on pregnancy on television, it was a mass-market medium, dependent on the blandest possible, inoffensive, middle-of-the-road appeal to the maximum number of viewers. And the act that produced pregnancy—that is, sex—was all but nonexistent on television, where even married couples typically slept in twin beds. It may be hard to imagine, but in 1952 pregnancy was still regarded as such a debilitating (or vaguely embarrassing) condition that expectant mothers were routinely dismissed from their jobs. The network and sponsor suggested alternatives: hide Lucy behind furniture (impossible, since Ball ballooned dramatically in her pregnancies); devote only one or two shows to the plotline; avoid showing the pregnancy at all costs. But Oppenheimer insisted that the story could be done in good taste, and Desi was adamant that an effective narrative arc required half a dozen or more episodes to track the progress from the first word of the pregnancy to the actual birth. Still, they got nowhere. Desperate, Desi appealed to the ultimate authority, the chairman of Philip Morris, Alfred E. Lyon. Desi wrote him a remarkable letter, laying it all on the line: Mr. Lyon, I guess it all comes down to you. You are the man who is paying the money for this show and I guess we will have to do whatever you decide. There’s only one thing I want to make certain that you understand. We have given you the number-one show in the country and, up till now, the creative decisions have been in our hands. Your people are now telling us we cannot do this, so the only thing I want from you, if you agree with them, is that you must inform them that we will not accept them telling us what not to do unless, in the future, they will also tell us what to do. At that point, and if this is your decision, we will cease to be responsible to you for the show being the number-one show on television, and you will have to look to your people, to the network and to the Biow Agency for that responsibility. Thank you very much for all you have done for us in the past. Within a week or so, opposition to the pregnancy plot suddenly faded. Desi would claim he only learned why a couple of years later, on a visit to Lyon’s office in New York, when the chairman’s secretary surreptitiously showed him the memo the chairman had sent to his staff at the time. “Don’t fuck around with the Cuban!” it read. To assure that Lucy Ricardo’s pregnancy was handled as tastefully and as inoffensively as possible, Desi and Jess sought the advice of Cardinal James McIntyre, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles; Rabbi Edgar Magnin of the Wilshire Boulevard Temple (the rabbi to many Jewish studio heads and movie stars); and Reverend Clifton Moore of the Hollywood Presbyterian Church. In the end, Moore wound up as script consultant to Bob and Madelyn, as did two other clergymen, Rabbi Alfred Wolf of Wilshire Temple and Monsignor John Devlin of St. Victor’s Catholic Church. The three of them carefully reviewed every episode’s storyline for any moral objections. Devlin’s church was just off the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, and his famous parishioners included Ricardo Montalban, Cesar Romero, and Loretta Young. He was also head of the Legion of Decency, the national Catholic hierarchy’s censorship board, which held powerful sway over movie content from the 1930s until well into the 1960s. He had served as an adviser to religious-themed movies likeGoing My WayandThe Bells of St. Mary’s, whose star Bing Crosby summed him up as “a very serious, quite humorless, but nice man.” The religious consultants “were with us four days a week to see the rehearsals and filming,” Desi recalled. “They used to have lunch and dinner together and became very good friends,” but in the end they had no objection to anything the writers dreamed up. The production team also faced a logistical issue. With the baby due in January, Desi did not want Lucy to have to work from about the end of October until mid-March. This would require some rejiggering of the work schedule, because Desilu was required to deliver a season of thirty-nine episodes to CBS. There were already five episodes in the can that had been filmed the prior spring, but other accommodations would be needed, including ending the summer hiatus a month early, in July. After some discussion, CBS agreed to rerun ten episodes from the previous season—a most unusual concession—if theI Love Lucyteam could produce a new opening scene for each, essentially turning them into flashbacks in which the Ricardos and Mertzes reminisce about the past as they contemplate the impending birth. Since hardly any filmed television programs (the essential ingredient for a high-quality repeat broadcast) existed in 1952, this development also amounted to a Desilu innovation—one that would be repeatedly employed in sitcoms in the decades to come. The pregnancy shows would be filmed in September and October, when word of Lucy’s condition had become public. The planned schedule gave the cast and writers time to explore aspects of pregnancy in all its comic possibilities, including several that gave Desi a special opportunity to shine. In one episode, Ricky experiences sympathetic, psychosomatic labor pains—with priceless expressions of illness by Desi—while Lucy indulges in weird food cravings like pistachio ice cream drenched in hot fudge and sardines. In yet another scenario, Lucy is so determined that their child speak proper English that she hires a fussy tutor, a professor whose real ambition is to perform at Ricky’s nightclub. This episode allows Desi a brilliant turn critiquing the vexing inconsistencies of English, in which Ricky tries to read a children’s book aloud and stumbles on a series of words ending in “o-u-g-h” that are variously pronounced withoo,ow, anduffsounds. Eventually he promises to get the professor an audition with “every record company in town” if he will embrace Ricky’s mispronunciations. The professor sings a rousing snippet of “Babalú,” and Lucy admits defeat. But the triumph of the pregnancy shows—and probably the most moving episode of the entire series—was titled “Lucy IsEnceinte,” the French word for pregnant, chosen as a private dig at the network censors, who had banned use of the term, though the religious advisers had expressed no objection to it. (The titles were for the production team only; they were not announced to the public.) In this episode, Lucy, feeling inexplicably tired and gaining weight, visits her doctor and, after she learns her happy news, spends the day in vain trying to tell Ricky in a private, tender way but is constantly interrupted. Finally, she goes to the Tropicana and passes the maître d’ a note, which Ricky reads aloud, without knowing who sent the note: “Oh, isn’t this sweet. Listen. ‘Dear Mr. Ricardo: My husband and I are going to have a blessed event. I just found out about it today and haven’t told him yet. I heard you sing a number called ‘We’re Having a Baby, My Baby and Me.’ If you will sing it for us now, it will be my way of breaking the news to him.’” At this, Ricky strolls around the club, singing the opening bars of “Rock-a-bye Baby,” asking couple after couple if they are the parents to be—including an elegant, silver-haired matron who blushes as the audience laughs. Meantime, Lucy has quietly taken a seat at a ringside table, and when Ricky passes, he silently points and nods as if to ask her—“as if it’s a big joke,” the script reads— whether she’s the lucky one. At that, the scene cuts to a close-up of a misty-eyed Lucy nodding yes. Desi continues his stroll and song before coming to a dead stop and doing a stunned double-take, his mouth agape and his Adam’s apple bobbing. Lucy again nods and he slides across the floor on his knees to her table. “Honey, honey, no!” he says. “Yes.\" “Really?” “Yes.” “Why didn’t you tell me?” “You didn’t give me a chance,” Lucy protests, tearing up. At this Ricky leaps to his feet. “It’s me!” he shouts. “I’m gonna be a father. How ’bout that? I want you to meet my mother! I mean my wife!” By this point, Lucy and Desi’s real emotions—as they remembered all the years of trying so hard to have one baby, much less two— suddenly suffuse their performances, and the Arnazes and Ricardos are magically as one in a moment of pure emotion that no acting could ever equal. Ricky gently takes Lucy’s arm and glides her to the dance floor as several members of the band, concerned that Arnaz was so overcome he had forgotten his next music cue, shout, “Sing the baby song!” Ricky launches into an old song made popular by Eddie Cantor, exulting: He’ll have toys, baby clothes He’ll know he’s come to the right house Bye and bye, when he grows, Maybe he’ll live in the White House. Ricky tells Lucy, “I bet he’s gonna look just like you,” and she demurs, “Oh, I hope not!” We’re having a baby . . . “I’ll bet she’ll speak with an accent, like you,” Lucy says. “She?” Ricky asks. We’re havin’ a baby, my baby and me . . . Ricky nuzzles his wife, and Lucy, tremulous once more, bites her lip and starts to kiss him before breaking out in a radiant smile and tucking her head against his. By this point the studio audience and the whole cast and crew were crying. Desi had flubbed part of the lyric to “Rock-a-bye Baby” at the start of the scene, and up in the control booth, the director Bill Asher, himself in tears, called for a retake, but the audience shouted in protest. Asher shot the scene again but nothing could equal the spontaneity and emotion of the first try, and the raw scene was used in the episode that aired on December 8. John Crosby in theNew York Herald Tribunereported that “the news that Lucille Ball was about to have a baby was whispered demurely into roughly 12,000,000 homes.” The combined pregnancies—real and imaginary—riveted public attention. A Cleveland newspaper even started a contest to predict the exact day and time Lucy would deliver. Because Lucie Arnaz had been delivered by cesarean section, and the obstetric practice of the day mandated a cesarean birth for all subsequent pregnancies, the Arnazes were able to fix the date of their baby’s arrival. Lucy’s doctor, Joseph Harris, performed his operations on Mondays, which meant that absent some emergency, Monday, January 19, 1953, was set as the big day. Though Lucy and Desi did not know the real baby’s sex, they had already decided that the Ricardos’ offspring would be a boy—in part so that little Lucie would come to understand that the television baby was just make-believe and that she and her sibling were the family’s only actual children. On the evening of Sunday, January 18, Lucy checked into Cedars of Lebanon to find a wire from a friend: “Well, don’t just lie there, do something!” At 8:20 the next morning, through the swinging doors of the delivery room, Desi and James Bacon, of the Associated Press, the sole reporter waiting with him, heard Lucy shout through her spinal anesthetic, “It’s a boy!” Within minutes, the news of the birth of the eight-pound, nine-ounce Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y Ball (the fourth of the name, but henceforth known to the world as Desi Jr.) was on the radio and wire services all over the world. That afternoon, Lucy and Desi read the first of some seven thousand letters and one thousand telegrams to arrive. (The congratulatory messages would eventually top one million.) Desi went to the Brown Derby, a show business hangout in Los Angeles, threw his hands to the ceiling, and exulted, “Now we have everythin’!” That evening, forty-four million Americans tuned in to CBS to watch the brilliant episode in which Little Ricky Ricardo is born. The plot has Lucy, Ricky, Fred, and Ethel working out a tightly choreographed division of labor for heading to the hospital—with one in charge of the phone, another Lucy’s overcoat, another the suitcase—but when the actual moment of truth arrives, only Lucy stays calm while Ricky and the Mertzes collapse into chaos and Ricky is so distraught that he arrives at the hospital in a wheelchair. When he finally sees his new little boy, the proud father faints. The broadcast ended with an announcer intoning, “To Lucy, to Ricky, and to the new baby, love and kisses from Philip Morris and from all America.” The next morning, only about two-thirds as many Americans tuned in to watch the inauguration of the new president, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Years later, when Ike ran into Desi Jr. at the El Dorado Country Club in Palm Springs, he demanded, “Is this the little fellow who knocked me off the front pages?” and bought the boy a banana split.

    "title": "John Landgraf Has Notes: How One Philosophical TV Exec Brought You ‘The Bear,’ ‘Fargo,’ ‘Shōgun,’ and More",
    "article_text": "The path to John Landgraf’s desk is a yellow brick road of prestige television. The walls of FX are lined with dramatic posters from the likes ofThe Americans, Fargo, American Horror Story,andReservation Dogs.Inside the office lobby sits a piano with candy-colored keys, a prop from the eerie “Teddy Perkins” episode ofAtlanta.Turn down any random hallway and you’ll likely run into a cache of golden statues. In 2024 alone, FX took home 36 Emmys. Thanks in large part toShōgunandThe Bear,it nearly topped Netflix and HBO’s combined tally. In the two decades he has been at FX’s creative helm, Landgraf has transformed it from a basic-cable network known for edgy, testosterone-soaked series likeThe ShieldandRescue Meinto a singular brand that’s now the jewel in Disney’s crown. Landgraf doesn’t believe in churning anything out. Even in his years as chairman, he’s taken an artisanal approach to development. He steered FX through the collapse of the cable industry as well as the madness of Peak TV,a term he himself coinedin 2015 to describe the glut of scripted series spewed out during the streaming wars. ACCORDING TO THE GOSPEL OF LANDGRAF, MAKING GREAT WORK MEANS “CONTINUOUSLY LOSING YOUR WAY.” Peak TV has peaked and most streamers are scrambling for safety, but FX keeps taking bigger risks—the latest being the upcomingAlien: Earth,inspired by Ridley Scott’sAlienfranchise and created byFargoshowrunner Noah Hawley. Some showrunners worried that Disney, which bought what used to be called 20th Century Fox six years ago, might sandpaper down some of FX’s sharp edges.It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,the longest-running live-action sitcom in American history, has been FX’s resident troublemaker since 2005. Its creator and star, Rob McElhenney, says that after the acquisition, Landgraf’s team assured him that nothing would change creatively. McElhenney and hisAlways Sunnyfriends tested the boundaries with a few offensive jokes anyway. “I thought, We’ll probably get a standards note on that. When we didn’t, we were disappointed. What do we gotta do to upset people?” According to the gospel of Landgraf, making great work means “continuously losing your way. A television show is a living, breathing process that needs room for failure and also wild serendipity.” Collaborators gather his wisdom like Willy Wonka’s golden tickets. “I’m almost embarrassed to admit that today, in a meeting, I quoted John Landgraf,” says veteran producer Nina Jacobson, whose company Color Force is behind FX series such asSay NothingandAmerican Crime Story.“His approach to the business is so thoughtful that you often find yourself referring back to it, particularly in the heat of this algorithm-driven moment.” Brad Simpson, Jacobson’s producing partner, goes further: “He has a bit of a cult around him—people become obsessed.” Simpson sees Landgraf as “a studio executive therapist. He has that vibe of ‘I understand you…but you still have to make this show work for our audience and for a budget.’ ” Pamela Adlon vividly remembers hanging out at a friend’s house when Landgraf called and asked her to sell him on why FX should greenlight her seriesBetter Things.“I was like, Holy fuck, how do I do this?” But after an hour on the phone, she not only knew Landgraf’s obsessions and cadences but understood the mystique surrounding him. “He’s like a Buddhist monk that visits every country in the world and then likes to go on roller coasters with you. He’s a holy man, but he’s in the sandbox with you.” Sitting in a green velvet chair in his office on the Fox studio lot, Landgraf doesn’t look much like a holy man in his dapper blazer, close-cropped beard, and upscale combat boots. He does, however, use the wordshumbleandhumilitya lot, as when he says, “I think humility is a superpower—being willing to acknowledge what you don’t know, to apologize and learn from things.” Over and over he points to his colleagues Gina Balian and Nick Grad, copresidents of FX Entertainment, as the originators of an idea or the cheerleaders for a particular project. In fact, when Balian was considering leaving HBO for FX in 2012, she was partly swayed by the way Landgraf so comfortably credited his colleagues for some of the network’s most successful shows. “I could see thatThe Bearwas excellent, but there were others, like Kate Lambert”—she’s a development executive—“that were absolutely relentless with me in saying, ‘Thisis the thing,’ ” Landgraf admits during the first of several long conversations. With bothAtlantaandThe Bear,he eventually came to a deep understanding of the shows and their creators, Donald Glover and Christopher Storer, respectively. “It took me a while,” he says, nodding soberly. “Neither one of them was particularly good at or interested in articulating what they were doing or why. They’re both very instinctive and have such distinctive visions that you have to [imagine] a whole other level on top of what you read on the page.” In a joint email, Storer and executive producer Josh Senior say of Landgraf, “The questions he would then ask really make us do our homework. Why now? Why this restaurant? What are we saying overall? Can we take this tension further? Does it have to be that loud? When we ultimately arrive at an answer we’re excited about, I’m guessing it’s the one he’s already been at for a while.” Resistant to the idea of television as interchangeable content, Landgraf aims to give shows time to find an audience and springs to his writers’ defense if necessary. He bristles when I mention some viewers’ disappointment inThe Bear’s third season. “This is a show about codependency and stuckness and the kinds of substitute obsessions and addictions that people have,” he says vehemently. “I understand that watching someone not move forward is a lot less exhilarating than watching somebody make breakthrough after breakthrough, but if you’re not willing to let it rip, you don’t getThe Bear.I just am madly in love with the season that we’re working on right now, watching Chris grapple with the question of: How does growth occur? How do epiphanies happen?” A few weeks later I’m ushered through a barricade of production trucks on a quiet Chicago block that’s home to an old-school Italian sandwich joint. The sign hanging outside says “Mr. BEEF est. 1979,” but step inside and every corner is familiar as the original centerpiece ofThe Bear. Instead of a line of customers, the counter is blocked by a rack of clothing, full of wardrobe choices for the cast of FX’s Emmy-winning series. StarsAyo Edebiriand Jeremy Allen White stand in the corner of a concrete lot next door, laughing together. Minutes later they shoot a quietly emotional scene for season four. Each take feels slightly different, a symphony of small revelations. Storer (who also happens to be directing today) leaps up from the rickety box he’s been perched on and rubs his rumpled hair. “Hell, yeah!” he shouts, his highest accolade. “Moving on, guys!” When the cameras aren’t rolling, Storer whirls around the lot, weaving gracefully through heavy equipment and crew members. A perfect combo of chill and exuberance, he constantly checks in with his cast. “Are you having fun?” Storer asks me at one point. “I mean,wehave fun,” he says, nodding to the people scurrying around us, “but is it fun to watch?” Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who plays Richie on the show, arrived early to observe his colleagues’ scenes. Remembering what it was like to film the first season during COVID, he says, “That’s part of why the show was so fun to make, and then so successful—the intimacy and proximity. I hadn’t been close to people in so long that it was nice to see people on top of each other.”Liza Colón-Zayas, who plays Tina, seconds this. Despite pandemic protocols, she says, “the chemistry from day one was enough.” Ricky Staffieri, who plays the comical Teddy Fak and is also a series coproducer, points to the mostly local Chicago crew and says, “The city gets behind us like crazy. On location, especially on days Jeremy’s there, it’s like the Beatles are coming.” Storer and Senior say in their email about Landgraf and his team that they’ve learned over the course of the show that the most effective kitchens operate on trust. “John surrounds himself with people that he trusts,” they write, adding that the executives’ fingerprints are on every shot. “I think we take 99 percent of their notes/ideas? And vice versa. We’re on such a rushed production schedule, we can’t have any weirdness between us. The show would never make it on time.” One of Landgraf’s favorite refrains is “It’s your vision, not mine.” According to Storer and Senior, “Any ideas or questions from John follow that philosophy; there’s always a push toward the vision. He doesn’t encourage us to take swings, he expects us to, which makes any sort of development process that much more clear because it protects the show from an easy or lazy solve.” Landgraf describes his childhood as disjointed and solitary. His parents were itinerant evangelical musicians who both decided to get graduate degrees—and later a divorce. That made for a lot of moving around, which he believes fed his understanding of artists. “I really lived in a world of books and imagination and movies and television, and I always gravitated towards the artists and the nerds in school,” he says. “I found my people, and those are the same people that write television shows, act, and direct.” Joel Fields, executive producer of FX’sThe Americans,The Patient,andFosse/Verdon,met Landgraf when Landgraf gave him a prospective student tour at Pitzer College. When I prod Fields for wild-oats-sowing tales—keg parties, bacchanalian nights—he shakes his head sadly. “If you want the dirt…he played the flute. Does that tell you what you need to know?” After studying anthropology, Landgraf did a fellowship in political science and pursued a master’s in public policy. He never imagined himself working in the entertainment industry, but an internship shifted his career path. Six years at a production company led to a big leap: a gig as the vice president of NBC prime-time series during the network’s Must-See TV golden years, overseeing classics likeThe West Wing,Friends,andER.A stint at Jersey Films followed, but Landgraf was increasingly convinced that the television business was broken. “I didn’t feel I could protect the creative,” he says. “Writers have something they want to say, and I felt that in the commercial process—the sausage factory—most of that gets jettisoned in favor of: We need it to be paced likethisand we don’t want to offendthisperson, and whatever other compromises you make along the way.” And the thing that gets lost? “It’s actually the animating spirit that makes great movies and great television.” In 2003 Landgraf got a call asking if he’d be interested in working at a basic-cable network called FX. Launched by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., it had been a dowdy home for reruns until 2000, when an HBO marketing exec named Peter Liguori joined forces with Kevin Reilly, who’d helped bringThe Sopranosinto the world. Together they reconceived FX as a “free HBO” and proved their daring with two original series:The Shield,a raw ride-along with corrupt LA cops, and the plastic surgery dramedyNip/Tuck.The Shieldbecame the highest-rated basic-cable debut of its time; its star, Michael Chiklis, beat outWest Wing’s Martin Sheen andSix Feet Under’s Michael C. Hall for the best-actor Emmy that first year.Nip/Tuckfurther whipped up excitement for the fledgling FX slate, introducing the wider world to a showrunner named Ryan Murphy. Landgraf initially turned the FX job down. “I didn’t believe that I would find the creative freedom and ability to nurture talent at a basic-cable network inside Fox,” he says. Liguori finally convinced him, and Landgraf got to work shaping shows already in the works (Rescue Me,with Denis Leary) and developing new ones likeIt’s Always Sunny in PhiladelphiaandOver There.The latter was a Gulf War drama, airing in the middle of the Gulf War. It flopped. “I think maybe on some unconscious level, I was trying to see if I would just get fired or shut down,” he says now with a hint of a smile. “Even though that didn’t work, it set the right tone, which is to say: Just try stuff, take shots.” Murphy sometimes tested Landgraf’s convictions. During their early years working together, their clashes were “brutal,” Murphy once toldVanity Fair,to the point that he and Landgraf briefly stopped speaking to each other. But once they found an equilibrium, Murphy’s perverse creations (includingAHS,Pose,Feud,andGrotesquerie) became a core element of FX’s DNA. Landgraf’s longtime Fox colleague and now Disney boss, Dana Walden, says that if you know both men—with their similar taste in books and their fascination with storytelling—their bond makes sense. “John has created for Ryan a playground where he can pretty much do anything he wants to do,” Walden says. “There’s really nothing Ryan comes up with that John ever has to say to him, ‘That’s not an FX show.’ John has done a really good job of maintaining extraordinary elasticity.” Not that there’snocreative conflict. Murphy once toldGQ,“He doesn’t yell, but he can annihilate you with his intellect and make you feel like a really shitty, bad person,” noting that Landgraf doesn’t do so to pick a fight: “He’s trying to change your behavior in the future.” When I read the quote to Landgraf, he replies with some amusement, “Look, Ryan does not love getting feedback or notes from anybody. In truth, he’s a visionary, and he does his own thing.” Murphy’s also a perpetual motion machine: He currently has multiple FX projects in development or production, includingThe Beauty,a new drama starring Evan Peters, and anAmerican Love Storylimited series about Carolyn Bessette and JFK Jr. “I know of three or four other things that he’s noodling and working on in his own way,” says FX’s Balian. “It’s almost like a brand within a brand—and a brand that’s been incredibly successful for us.” Landgraf has a reputation as the head number cruncher of Peak TV. “John loves data,” says Warren Littlefield, executive producer ofFargoandThe Old Man(and once upon a time, Landgraf’s boss at NBC). Landgraf often shares with producers what the numbers mean for FX, Littlefield continues: “I get a strong sense that at Disney, there’s buy-in to what John and his team are capable of doing.” Walden suggests Landgraf does indeed have buy-in. “We’ve been working together for a very long time, and there was a period where I was running the Fox television studio and John was relatively newly running FX, when we had very heated disputes over the business model and who should bear responsibility for which parts of the budget,” she recalls. “I think the strength of our relationship now is partly because we had that conflict, and we worked it out.” The first wave of prestige television was a rogues’ gallery of alpha dudes. Even thoughSex and the Citywas one of HBO’s first breakout hits, Tony Soprano set the mood: It was gonna be dicks all the way down. FX fit in perfectly, thanks to shows likeThe ShieldandRescue Me.That changed slightly when, according to Landgraf, a tight budget forced him to choose between two series they’d been developing. One was another male-antihero-driven drama, the other a legal thriller with a female protagonist. Landgraf hoped to broaden FX’s appeal to a female audience, which is howBreaking Badended up at AMC andDamages(starring Glenn Close) got Landgraf’s thumbs-up. Still, the cable network remained fairly white male–flavored in ensuing years, asSons of Anarchy,Justified,andLouiekept FX’s flag flying. In the wake ofLouie’s success, Landgraf says, “it occurred to us that white men had gotten the opportunity to do this sort of very personal show” while other creators (and audiences) remained neglected. FX began seeking out different perspectives. The scripts for Adlon’sBetter Thingsand Glover’sAtlantacame in on the same day and premiered on the same week in September 2016, with FX’s first female and Black creator-stars. Over a sushi lunch in the FX office, I ask Landgraf, Balian, and Grad why it took so long to greenlight a show created by a woman. “It’s not for lack of trying,” says Balian. “It was certainly a perception I had when I got here that FX did really well with male audiences,” which she suggests might have become a self-fulfilling syndrome. In recent years, a number of its limited series created by and starring women have aired, includingFleishman Is in Trouble, Mrs. America,and this spring’s searing Michelle Williams dramedy,Dying for Sex,fromNew Girlvets Elizabeth Meriwether and Kim Rosenstock. Taffy Brodesser-Akner, who adapted her novelFleishman Is in Troublefor the FX limited series, remembers Landgraf spending a whole evening proposing a way to fix the pilot. “When I disagreed, he yielded to me,” she says. “And I thought, Wow, you are so insistent on your identity as a creator-first company that you actually do it.” She also confirms that Landgraf’s intellect is no joke: “He’ll bring Euripides into a conversation and assume you knowwhat he’s talking about!” “IN TELEVISION, BIG BETS ARE NOT A LOT OF FUN. YOU REALLY, REALLY SWEAT.” FX wasn’t exempt from the #MeToo searchlight. Ironically, FX’s most high-profile female-driven series got caught in it. Louis C.K. had cocreatedBetter Things,and his public cancellation for sexual misconduct in 2017 left both Adlon and FX reeling. Landgraf looks grief-stricken when I mention his name. “It was devastating,” he says, pointing out that FX made four different series with C.K. and had no issues with him. FX Productions quickly canceled its overall deal with his production company, and Landgraf took pains to publicly attest that Adlon wasBetter Things’ creative engine. He also told Adlon to take the time she needed before returning to make a third season on her own. “I didn’t understand how to rebuild and come back from that, and he was just so patient with me, it’s gonna make me cry,” Adlon says now, her voice wavering. “I definitely think that the show got hurt by it, but it stayed alive.” More recently, Brian Jordan Alvarez of FX’s comedyEnglish Teacherwas accused of sexually assaulting actor Jon Ebeling on the set of his 2016 web seriesThe Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo.FX has renewedEnglish Teacherfor a second season, and Landgraf chooses not to comment about that decision or about the allegations, which long preceded his company’s relationship with Alvarez. “I don’t want to litigate theEnglish Teacherin a public way,” he says. “I can just tell you that we’ve gotten so much overwhelmingly positive feedback about the feeling people have of that show’s willingness to wade into contentious ground in ways that aren’t shrill, that make fun of dogmatism and arrogance.” Before the assault accusation came to light—Alvarez has insisted that everything that transpired was “entirely consensual”—many critics included the series in their best of 2024 lists alongsideShōgun. The FX team seems to thrive when they’re creatively or financially out on a limb—whether it’s taking a gamble on an inexperienced artist or squeezing their budget to keep futzing with a project they love. “A lot of our biggest successes were pilots that we reshot all or most of,” Landgraf says, pointing toSons of AnarchyandSnowfall.Balian embarked on creatingShōgunwhen she first arrived at FX; it went through two showrunners and 11 years of labor before it became a smash hit. The project also survived Disney’s acquisition of FX’s then parent company, 21st Century Fox. In many ways, the transition to Disney made it a reality. Says Landgraf, “Shōgun’s a huge swing, and a swing that we just never could have made as a basic-cable network, because it needs the potential of a global audience to make the investment reasonable.” Landgraf had watched with fascination as the industry frantically tried to replicate the success ofGame of Thrones.Creating an American historical epic seemed difficult in the recent political climate. “Every war we’ve ever fought is now politically contentious,” Landgraf points out—but 16th-century Japan isn’t. “I had conversations with my bosses saying, ’I think we have a way of making it 70 percent in English and 30 percent in Japanese,’ ” he says with a sheepish grin. When his team decided they preferred Japanese-speaking actors, Landgraf walked back his 70 percent promise but agreed to compensate by hiring a big star for the one British character. Soon, he walked even that back. One key to FX’s survival has been scrappiness and keeping a tight rein on finances. “In television, big bets are not a lot of fun. You really, really sweat,” Landgraf says. “And this was a 10-hour saga, more in Japanese than English. I doubt I’d be sitting here talking to you if it hadn’t worked.” Walden, his boss, shrugs off the notion: “He’s a very good storyteller.” Justin Marks, who cocreated theShōgunseries with his wife, Rachel Kondo, remembers the first time he walked onto the massive soundstage to launch the show and realized there was no turning back. “That night, I went for a walk and sat on a bench in the park outside our building and just stared, like, How are we gonna survive this?” When I catch up with Marks and Kondo, they’re in the throes of writing the show’s second season and keenly aware of what it would mean if that season is underwhelming. “I liked it better when I didn’t know any of that,” he quips. “I think there are expectations, and there are ways that we’re going to surprise and exceed—and exceeding probably will cost a little more.” Landgraf first proposed FX’s next pricey gambit,Alien: Earth,in 2018, while Disney’s acquisition of Fox was still in progress. Since then, FX has gained a strong foothold in the global streaming world, airing on Hulu in the US and on Disney’s international streaming service, Star. But Noah Hawley still feels the burden on him as he does postproduction on theAlienseries: “You’re talking about a price point that’s at the top end of anything they’ve ever spent before.” When Landgraf tells me some off-the-record details about the series, he’s as giddy with excitement as I’ve seen him. “The challenge ofAlienis that most of the characters die at the end, it has one of the greatest cinema monsters, and one of the greatest production designs of all time,” he says. “If you’re spending that kind of money and working with intellectual property owned by and controlled by the corporation, you have to be thoughtful about it. I really appreciate that Noah has stayed true to himself and his originality. But it’s been grueling—and ifIthink it’s been grueling, it’s been five times as grueling for him.” When asked what counts as success in FX’s Disneyfied streaming era, Landgraf throws out a mix of metrics: hours of consumption, good reviews, number of new subscribers a show brings in. But for him, one of the most important things is co-viewing: two or more people watching a show together in the same room. This is, he points out, “distinctly the opposite of how the internet works.” The message is that television is better when experienced communally. “We’re in a world of algorithms, and streamers are constantly looking for the hack to the system,” Grad tells me at one point. “There’s no cheat code.” Okay, fine, but the brand’s sophisticated marketing has always helped enormously. “I can pick out an FX billboard anywhere,” saysMrs. Americacreator Dahvi Waller. “They understand what each show is, and they’re so creative about how they market it.” It’s not unusual for shows to sit neglected on streamers without target audiences even knowing that they exist. Says Waller, “That is definitely disconcerting, and it’s a big draw of FX.” Littlefield sometimes wonders if marketing boss Stephanie Gibbons understands his shows better than he does. “What they’re able to do in a world of infinite choice is break through the clutter so the show can have value and meaning to people.” During one of our conversations, Landgraf leaps up from a chair in his office and grabs the laptop off his desk. He wants to show me an email he just got from a producer of FX’sA Murder at the End of the World.One of the thriller’s central characters is a former hacker and wife of a tech billionaire who dreams of escaping his underground bunker but doesn’t want to leave behind their young son. Landgraf points to an image on his screen, which is very much a real-life analogue to the show: It’s Elon Musk and one of his children romping in the White House, juxtaposed with a photo of the boy’s mother, Grimes, looking bereft. “How do artists do that?” he asks. “Yes, it’s just pure coincidence on some level. But so often in my experience with artists, they just have an intuition about something that presages real life.” This is one of Landgraf’s favorite topics—the mysterious process of inspiration. “The world is a cacophony of sound,” he says. “But these people that we work with, they hear things, they feel things, they see things that I can’t. I just really admire that, to be honest with you. And I think I am pretty good at helping someone tune their receiver.” The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "title": "The 25 Best Shows on Netflix to Watch in June",
    "article_text": "We’ve all been overwhelmed by streaming TV choices, only to give up and watch something we’ve already seen. But this curated list of the best shows on Netflix is here to narrow down your decision-making and help you figure outexactlywhich titles you want to sample next. Amy (Ali Wong) is an entrepreneur in the middle of a protracted negotiation to sell her independent store to a huge home-improvement chain. Danny (Steven Yeun) is a contractor and handyman desperately trying to scrape together enough money to buy a plot of land on which he can build a house for his parents, who lost their motel and moved back to their native Korea. There’s no reason Danny and Amy should ever know each other, never mind end up as one another’s sworn enemies. But after the two have an unfortunate parking lot run-in, they both become obsessed with avenging themselves on each other in this pitch-black, Emmy-winning comedy. Nick KrollandAndrew Goldbergwent through puberty together as middle school friends, went into comedy as adults…and then, withMark LevinandJennifer Flackett,cocreated this animated sitcom. About kids but not reallyforthem,Big Mouthhas become one of the most outrageous comedies on Netflix by delving into such sensitive topics as first periods, masturbation, and sexual identity. It also uses the filthiest words you’ve ever heard (and some you possibly haven’t) for body parts and fluids. The voice cast features Kroll in roles as varied as protagonist Nick Birch, his classmate Lola, their coach Steve, and a Hormone Monster named Maury; you’ll also hearJohn Mulaney, Fred Armisen,andMaya Rudolph,among many others—including, starting in season four,Ayo Edebiri.The eighth and final season drops May 23. Comedy writerCharlie Brookerstepped out of his primary genre for this sci-fi anthology series. In the style ofThe Twilight Zone,each episode tells a self-contained story, generally about a dystopian application or evolution of technology we are familiar with. (The titleBlack Mirrorrefers to the look of a TV, computer, or phone screen when it’s turned off.) What if you lived in a bunker and pedaled a stationary bike for hours on end to earn “merits” for your food and entertainment? Could a computer simulation allow our consciousness to outlast our physical form? What if a popular streaming platform eavesdropped on your phone calls and turned your life into a drama series starring a CGISalma Hayek? These are just a few questions raised overBlack Mirror’s run, which continues with this spring’s season seven. If FX’sShōgungripped you last year, maybe you’re in the market for another Japanese historical epic to fill the time until season two.Maya Erskinevoices Mizu, a female warrior whose mother disguised her as a boy for protection during her childhood. As an adult, Mizu has continued posing as a man in order to pursue a revenge plot against several men who illegally remained in Japan after the Tokugawa shogunate closed its borders…and one of those men is her father. Other voice performers includeGeorge Takei, Brenda Song,andNever Have I Ever’sDarren Barnet.The show is undoubtedly one of the most visually arresting adult animation shows on Netflix. Life can be rough in late ’50s Poplar, a disadvantaged neighborhood in London’s East End. But while struggling residents must endure deprivations of all kinds—unethical landlords, insecure employment, open racism for new immigrants of color—one boon they can count on is top-notch medical care. Working with the UK’s National Health Service, an order of Anglican nuns—assisted by several secular nurse-midwives—provide pre- and post-natal care to Poplar families; as the series has progressed through more than 10 seasons (and counting!), it’s also moved forward in time to show characters dealing with limb differences caused by Thalidomide; an outbreak of diphtheria; and the introduction of the pill. No less an eminence thanVanessa Redgravenarrates. The attention to detail on the period design, the understated performances, and the thoughtful portrayal of complex issues make this one of the best TV shows on Netflix. The 13th season—the show’s latest, with more to come in the future—has just been added to the platform. (Warning for anyone suffering from American health insurance—or suffering in America without it: the care depicted on this show may cause intense jealousy.) Forget, if you can,the scandalthat caused 2018’sRoseannerevival to come to an abrupt end: everyone else who worked on the show without being hateful were allowed to continue working on a version ofRoseannewithoutRoseanne.The series premiere directly follows the offscreen death of the titular character who spawned it, and portrays how her husband Dan (John Goodman), sister Jackie (Laurie Metcalf), and daughters Becky (Alicia Goranson) and Darlene (Sara Gilbert) go on without her. (Becky and Darlene’s brother,Michael Fishman’s D.J. also appears sporadically for the first few seasons.) After the conclusions ofShameless,Mom,andSuperstore,The Connersis one of the last working-class sitcoms on TV, and very much worth your time. The seventh and final season recently concluded on ABC. Among his many other credits, writerPeter Morganhas defined himself as an interpreter of current events, fromThe Special Relationship(aboutTony BlairandBill Clinton) toFrost/Nixon(about the televised interviews the former conducted with the latter), with many stops in between. WhenThe Queen,about the eponymous monarch’s reaction to the death of Princess Diana, became a critical and awards sensation, a series follow-up about the royal family was the obvious next step. From 2016 to 2023,The Crownchronicled the entire professional life of Queen Elizabeth II, starting just before her coronation and extending into the adulthood of her most famous grandchildren.The Crownis one of the most controversial titles on Netflix—particularly if you ask a member of the family being portrayed—and it’s also one of the most lavish. If the royal family, including current members and those who have departed, has been on your news feed lately, this might tide you over between updates. Producer-directorJung Jong-yeonwould already be a reality TV legend if all he’d done wasThe Genius, a fiendishly complex game of skill, strategy, and insight. But we’re lucky he’s gone from fiendish to diabolical withThe Devil’s Plan, a new show that will hopefully return for more seasons. Twelve extremely impressive contestants—including an MIT-trained lawyer, a professional poker player who studies biology on the side, and an actor-slash-inventor with an MSc in evolutionary psychology—face off in tests of their intelligence. But there’s a social game too. If you’re tired of American competition shows that feel the same year after year, give this brain-breaker a shot. Season two premiered in May. After Denise (Lisa Bonet), the second-eldest sibling onThe Cosby Show,graduated high school, she moved on to Hillman College, a fictional HBCU located in Virginia. There, she met roommates Jaleesa (Dawnn Lewis), a recent divorcée enrolled as a mature student, and Maggie (Marisa Tomei), a sweet and daffy military brat. Other students in her orbit include Southern belle and Hillman legacy Whitley (Jasmine Guy), after whose family Denise’s dorm is named, and Dwayne Wayne (Kadeem Hardison), a math genius with a crush on Denise. Bonet departed the show (eventually turning up for a later-season guest spot) when she became pregnant, and series creatorBill Cosbyforbade her characterfrom also carrying a pregnancy to term as an unmarried woman. (In retrospect, who better to be an arbiter of morality?) But the show continued for five more seasons, welcoming in new students played byCharnele Brown, Cree Summer,andJada Pinkett,not yet Smith. ReadLeah Faye Cooper’sVForal historyto find out how this show became one of the most important sitcoms of its day. Judy Blume’s1975 novelForever…has been a frequent target for censorship due to the frank sex scenes between its protagonists, two high school students who have fallen in love for the first time. InMara Brock Akil’sloose adaptation, the action begins on New Year’s Eve 2017, as high school juniors Justin (Michael Cooper Jr.) and Keisha (Lovie Simone) run into each other at a party for the first time since they were elementary school classmates. But their instant attraction doesn’t result in an instant relationship, and the series tracks them as they deal with such issues as a scandalous sex tape, their parents’ expectations, Michael’s pride, and whether Keisha’s vision for her college career can include her boyfriend from back home. The show has already beenrenewed for a second season;while you wait, you can also watchGirlfriends,Akil’s first TV hit, on Netflix. In the late ’90s and early ’00s, pop groups were routinely assembled not through organic connections and shared musical influences, but because the members wanted to be famous and managers wanted to make money off them. So it was with the Girls5eva, who had an entire rise and fall in a matter of months. Decades later, a chance sample by a new artist brings Dawn (Sara Bareilles), Wickie (Renée Elise Goldsberry), Summer (Busy Philipps), and Gloria (Paula Pell) back together, and they decide to try for a comeback. While this comedy’s first two seasons aired on Peacock, Netflix now has the entire run—including the third season, which premiered last year. You will need all your faculties to make sure you see and hear every gag in this extremely joke-dense show—hands down one of the funniest sitcoms on Netflix. Loganco-screenwriterScott Frankwrote and directed this series in 2017, the same year that darkX-Menspinoff debuted. It also happens to be one of Netflix’s best crime shows. Frank re-teamed with executive producerSteven Soderbergh(who had directed Frank’s screenplay forOut of Sightnearly 20 years earlier) on the seven-episode miniseries set in La Belle, a New Mexico town mostly peopled by women following a catastrophic mining accident that killed most of La Belle’s male residents. Further crisis ensues when an outlaw on the run is pursued to La Belle. When you finish this one, check out Frank’s newest show, the crime dramaDept. Q. Three Michigan moms—sisters Beth (Christina Hendricks) and Annie (Mae Whitman), plus Ruby (Retta), their friend since all three were teens—run into pressing financial difficulties at the same time. What if they solved all their problems at once by robbing the supermarket where Annie works? It seems like a winning plan, until they find out the store is entangled in a complex criminal operation—and that the only way they can avoid disaster is to get recruited to work in it themselves. Treat yourself to four seasons of one of the best crime dramedies on Netflix. And, if you wish, turn on NBC to check outGrosse Pointe Garden Society,from the same creators. Hilda (voice ofBella Ramsey,now back forseason two ofThe Last Of Uson HBO) used to live in a forest cabin with her mother Johanna (Daisy Haggard) and deerfox Twig. Then that home was destroyed, so the family moved to the walled city of Trolberg. Hilda soon finds out that the city is full of unusual characters—including a bureaucratic elf named Alfur (Rasmus Hardiker), who becomes a friend. If your kids need a break fromBluey,give this, one of the best family series on Netflix, a shot. If you don’t have kids, you might still enjoy its beautiful animation and soothing rhythms. The third and final season premiered in December 2023. Saturday Night Livestar/writer.Detroitersstar/cocreator.The Charactersstar/writer. All ofTim Robinson’struly superlative work in comedy led to this: one of the most confidently unhinged sketch shows in recent memory, and among the best comedy shows on Netflix. Each episode is well under a half hour, so it will take you no time at all to learn the origin of such memes as“We’re all trying to find the guy who did this”and“I don’t even want to be around anymore.”When you’re through, you can watch Robinson headlining A24’s darkly comic feature filmFriendship. Those of us raised on Doug Henning specials may, rightly, be suspicious of the camera tricks that could be employed in translating magic illusions to the screen. But even if your rational mind knows that magic isn’t real,Justin Willmancan make you believe! In addition to his skills as a prestidigitator, Willman is a legitimately talented comic—and you don’t have to take my word for it. Alt-comedy legendsTim HeideckerandEric Wareheim(a.k.a. Tim and Eric) are among the show’s executive producers. Once you’ve caught up, move on toWillman’s next series,The Magic Prank Show.He’s also launching his first special,Justin Willman: Magic Lover,on Netflix on June 17. For every short season of what is practically an event series,David Letterman—the original host of bothLate NightandLate Show—curates a tiny group of guests and spends an entire episode with each for an in-depth conversation. Past visitors includeTina Fey,Howard Stern,andBarack Obama,giving his first talk show interview after leaving office. The rhythms are definitely different from what you’re used to seeing with Letterman, but it’s still a joy to watch one of the greats. A new season five episode dropped in April. How did Pablo Escobar go from a comparatively low-level smuggler to one of the world’s most notorious drug kingpins whose (uh, spoiler?) death came at the hands of an international law enforcement task force?Steve Murphy—a since retired DEA agent who worked on the case—is portrayed here byBoyd Holbrook,who also narrates the story of the DEA’s investigation into Escobar (Wagner Moura); Murphy’s DEA colleagueJavier Peñais played by futureMandalorianstarPedro Pascal.The series was followed by a companion series,Narcos: Mexico,in 2018. Once, Siaja (Anna Lambe) enjoyed being married to Ting (Kelly William), her former high school sweetheart and the “golden boy” of Ice Cove—their (fictional) town in Nunavut, one of Canada’s Arctic territories. But after one last cataclysmic fight, Siaja decides she’s done trying to make things work with him, and starts her life over for the sake of her own happiness and that of her young daughter, Bun (Keira Cooper).Mary Lynn Rajskub,24alumna, costars as Helen, Ice Cove’s town manager and Siaja’s new boss. Dr. Harry Vanderspeigle (Alan Tudyk) was once a distinguished New York City coroner. But he chose the wrong time to visit his lakeside cabin in Patience, Colorado—because when an alien with spieciecidal designs crash-landed nearby, he killed Harry, transformed himself into Harry’s exact double, and started passing as Harry around town. Fortunately, no one there really knew him well and thus can’t tell he’s acting like someone who learned English and human behavior fromLaw & Ordermarathons. Over time, Harry develops relationships with clinic nurse Asta (Sara Tomko); D’Arcy (Alice Wetterlund), Asta’s best friend and a former Olympic skier; and Max (Judah Prehn), the mayor’s son, who happens to possess the rare power of perceiving both Harry’s real form and the glow of his extraterrestrial gear. “Fish out of water” is a story trope we’ve all seen many times, but Tudyk’s extremely committed performance elevates this to one of the funniest under-the-radar shows on Netflix—the fourth season premieres on Syfy on June 6. Patricia Highsmith’s bookThe Talented Mr. Ripleyhas already been adapted for the screen a few times, most notablyby the late Anthony Minghella. This project, from writer-directorSteven Zaillian,is the first to give Highsmith the series treatment. In his version, Tom Ripley (Andrew Scott) is running short cons in New York when a PI named Alvin McCarron (Bokeem Woodbine) approaches him with an invitation to meet shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf (Kenneth Lonergan). Only when one of Ripley’s go-to scams goes awry does he make contact, subsequently finding out that Greenleaf wants to send him to Italy to convince his wastrel son, Dickie (Johnny Flynn), to come back to America. That might have been a solid plan—if Greenleaf had done just a little more due diligence on this freelancer. Stunning black-and-white photography makes this one of the most beautiful shows on Netflix. Nadia (Natasha Lyonne,who’s also a cocreator alongsideLeslye Headland) has a perfectly lovely time at her 36th birthday party. She stops at a bodega and is about to head home when she spots her wandering cat, Oatmeal. Stepping into the street to retrieve him, Nadia is struck by a cab and killed—but onlyverybriefly. When she reawakens in the bathroom at her birthday party, she remembers having lived this night already, but no one else does. After living and dying several times over, she meets a stranger who is experiencing the same phenomenon, and they unite to figure out how to break themselves out of their time loop. A second season, which premiered in 2022, features a much more central role for season-one guest starChloë Sevignyand plays with time in an entirely different way. Reacquaint yourself with this one between new episodes of ofPoker Faceon Peacock. Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) is a gambling addict crushed both by his personal debt, and by his daughter’s imminent move to the US with his ex and her new husband. When a mysterious stranger approaches him, seemingly by chance, and offers him the opportunity to play a series of games with the possibility of winning an unimaginable cash prize, it seems too good to be true. Turns out: It is! The first season was a massive ratings and critical hit and spun off an unscripted competition show, alsoon Netflix;the third and final season premieres June 27. Following the wild success ofLove Is Blind, series creatorChris Coelendebuted a new unscripted dating show on Netflix in 2022. InThe Ultimatum: Marry Or Move On, half a dozen established couples entered the process. In each case, one partner wants to get married, while the other isn’t sure. To clarify matters (or, at least, that’s the conceit), the couples part; each person gets paired up with a new one from a different couple, living with them for eight weeks to see what would happen. This time around,The Ultimatumhas assembled a new cast of couples who are at odds about their future. The twist is that they’re all women and nonbinary people. Unscripted romantic shenanigans: They’re not just for the cishet anymore! The long-awaited second season drops June 25. When Lifetime got out of the scripted-series business,You—which premiered there in 2018—was orphaned. But Netflix scooped it up and ran with it for several more seasons. Based on the book series byCaroline Kepnes,the series revolves around Joe (Gossip GirlalumnusPenn Badgley) and the many female objects of his desire. With Joe as our wildly biased narrator, we watch as tropes that have historically been presented as romantic in pop culture are revealed for what they are: morbidly obsessive and frequently criminal. It is also, somehow, one of the blackest comedies in TV history. Season four relocates Joe to England, allowing him to mess with a whole new cast of characters. Thefifth and final season, which returns Joe to New York City, dropped April 24.

    "article_text": "Officials urge high-risk groups to get vaccinated amid ‘expected’ uptick in cases, even as Covid activity rates show signs of decline Covid-19 activity in Hong Kong is starting to show signs of decline from a recent peak, but levels are expected to remain high for the next month or two. The Centre for Health Protection on Thursday also urged high-risk groups to receive booster vaccinations to reduce the chances of serious complications or even death. According to the centre, the latest data as of May 24 shows that both the viral load of Covid from sewage surveillance and the test positivity rate of respiratory samples have begun to decline in the past week. The rate of positive tests fell from 13.8 per cent in the week beginning on May 11 to 11.12 per cent in the following week. As for sewage surveillance, the per capita Covid viral load decreased from 770,000 to 500,000 copies per litre over the same period. “Besides, the consultation rate of Covid-19 cases at general outpatient clinics and sentinel private medical practitioner clinics also dropped,” a spokesman for the centre added. Dr Edwin Tsui Lok-kin, controller of the centre, explained that the virus had transitioned into an endemic disease with cyclical patterns.",

    "title": "Hong Kong to launch second phase of free breast cancer screenings on June 10",
    "article_text": "Thousands of women at high risk of breast cancer are expected to benefit from the new round, doctor says Hong Kong health authorities will roll out the second phase of a free breast cancer screening programme next month under a pilot scheme that is expected to benefit thousands of women at high risk. The Department of Health said on Thursday that the three-year scheme, set to launch on June 10, would cover women aged 35 to 74 who either carried certain genetic mutations or had a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Dr Anne Chee, the department’s non-communicable disease head, said only “thousands” were expected to benefit from this phase because just those at high risk, such as carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, or relatives of patients with both breast and ovarian cancer, were eligible for free screenings. The lifetime chance for a woman to develop breast cancer before the age of 70 is about 12 per cent, but that could increase to 60 per cent for carriers of certain gene mutations. “Many women in Hong Kong are health-conscious and will seek genetic testing on their own, especially family members of breast cancer patients … doctors also typically recommend screening for female relatives of their patients,” she said. “In the past, they all had to pay out of their pockets. We hope the second phase of the pilot scheme can cover this group of women, offering them free screening and one-stop services.”",
