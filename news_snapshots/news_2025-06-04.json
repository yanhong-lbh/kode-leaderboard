    "article_text": "The prosecution introduces a clip from Karen Read's 2024 interview with Investigation Discovery before resting the state's case after six weeks of testimony in Read's trial on Thursday, May 29, 2025. (Pool) Karen Read’sdefense team’s decision to not call her to the witness stand is a gamble that could help or hinder her case after the prosecution played her damaging interview clips in her second murder trial – allowing the jury to hear Read’s version of events in her own words. Read is facing the possibility of life in prison for thealleged murderof her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O’Keefe. The prosecution claims Read struck O’Keefe with her Lexus SUV in a drunken argument, leaving him to freeze to death in the front yard of a friend’s house party shortly after midnight on Jan. 29, 2022. Read’s defense team insists her vehicle never made contact with O’Keefe and there was no collision. \"When I first came to practice, it was ‘never put your client on stand, ever,’\" New York City defense attorney Louis Gelormino told Fox News Digital. \"But I tend to disagree with that sometimes. I think we have gotten our biggest wins when we put our client on the stand.\" KAREN READ'S TRUE-CRIME DOCUMENTARIES MAY IMPACT SECOND TRIAL: COURT DOCS Karen Read walks with one of her attorneys, Alan Jackson, during her trial Tuesday, May 27, 2025, in Dedham, Mass.(Matt Stone/The Boston Herald via AP, Pool) On Tuesday, the defense submitted the team’sproposed jury instructionsthat indicate Read will not take the stand in her trial. \"As you know, Ms. Read did not testify at this trial,\" the instructions read. \"You may not hold that against her. Ms. Read has an absolute right not to testify because, as I've explained, she is presumed to be innocent and does not have to do anything to convince you she is innocent.\" The instructions stress that the reason Read chose to not take the witness stand is not relevant to the jury’s deliberations and cannot be considered evidencein her trial.Legal experts tell Fox News Digital the choice to keep a defendant from speaking may not always be the best choice. KAREN READ, ACCUSED KILLER OF COP BOYFRIEND, SHOWED NO EMOTION UNTIL JURY DELIBERATIONS: DOCUMENTARY Karen Read and John O'Keefe pose for an undated photograph.(Karen Read) Gelormino said he believes Read would put on a strong performance on the witness stand, but calling her to testify does not come without risks. \"I think the reason they're hiding her is because they don't want to have to have her explain all these videos that they saw of her not acting in a good way,\" Gelormino said. KAREN READ JUDGE BLOCKS SANDRA BIRCHMORE MENTIONS; EXPERT SAYS CASES SHOULD BE WAKE-UP CALL FOR POLICE Karen Read talks with her attorneys Robert Alessi and David Yannetti during her trial at Norfolk Superior Court, Tuesday, May 6, 2025, in Dedham, Mass.(Matt Stone/The Boston Herald via AP, Pool) Special prosecutor Hank Brennan played numerous clips from Read's televised interviews, picking out clips that could potentially damage the defense. \"I also wonder, did I say, ‘could I have hit him,’\"Read saidin a 2024 interview with Investigation Discovery. \"Or was it told to me that I said I hit him. And I knew I never could’ve said that, so the closest thing I must’ve said was, ‘did I hit him?’\" In the clip, Read questions if she \"really [said] it as many times as law enforcement is claiming.\" KAREN READ DEFENSE FLOATS THEORY THAT ‘JEALOUS’ BRIAN HIGGINS FOUGHT JOHN O'KEEFE BEFORE DEATH In another clip, she talked about spiking her own drinks with extra shots because they weren't strong enough. Gelormino said the defense team likely does not want Read to be confronted about her statementson cross-examination, possibly opening the door for days of tense questioning from the state. \"They don't want to have her explaining all of these misbehaviors or what people would think would be bad behavior,\" Gelormino said. But the choice to keep Read off the stand could potentially keep her from providing an explanation for her statements in the interviews while also clarifying her side of the story. LEAD DETECTIVE'S TEXT MESSAGES CAST SHADOW OVER KAREN READ MURDER TRIAL Prosecutor Hank Brennan questions a witness during the Karen Read murder trial at Norfolk Superior Court, Tuesday, May 27, 2025, in Dedham, Mass.(Matt Stone/The Boston Herald via AP, Pool) \"There are two sides of every coin,\" Gelormino told Fox News Digital. \"You could put her on and try to have her explain it, or you can avoid it altogether.\" Gelormino pointed to the reality that Read could appear defensive while offering an explanation for her on-camera stories, which could shift the jury’s perception of her personality. \"As a defense attorney, you are going to have to clean that up,\" Gelormino said. \"So you are going to be spending a lot of time defending your character there.\" GET REAL-TIME UPDATES DIRECTLY ON THETRUE CRIME HUB Karen Read arrives at court on day 22 of the Karen Read murder trial at Norfolk Superior Court in Dedham, Massachusetts, on Wednesday, May 28, 2025.(Greg Derr/The Patriot Ledger / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images) The videos pose a new obstacle for the defense, since they were not played in Read’s first trial last year. \"The first jury almost convicted Read of manslaughter while operating under the influence,\" retired Massachusetts Superior Court Judge and Boston College law professor Jack Lu told Fox News Digital. \"That was with no defendant video statements. Here, we have many damaging statements, and maybe a few more in rebuttal.\" FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X Lu said the defense has not attempted to address the video clips or provide context regarding Read’s version of events at this point in the trial. \"So, the same trial plus the damaging video, where the jury almost convicted, is bad for the defense,\" Lu said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As the defense continues calling witnesses, the notable absence of Read’s own testimony will likely only be fully felt once the jury reads its verdict, with the prosecution acting as the only side that opted to include her own words in the courtroom. \"Based on the fact that they had a hung jury the last time, [the defense has] a decent case,\" Gelormino told Fox News Digital. \"So do you want to mess that up with having her defend her actions and character for the next two or three days on the stand? That's a tough decision.\" Julia Bonavita is a U.S. Writer for Fox News Digital and a Fox Flight Team drone pilot.

    "title": "House Republicans push for spending cancellations as Elon Musk and conservatives demand deeper budget cuts",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram highlights divisions in the Republican Party over President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' on 'Special Report.' And you thought you had just figured out what \"reconciliation\" means inCongressionalbudget terms. Here’s a new vocabulary term: rescissions. You might not be able to spell it. But I can tell you what it does. A \"rescissions\" bill \"rescinds\" money which Congress has already allocated, ex post facto. For simplicity, I often describe rescissions legislation as \"spending cancellations.\" Congress appropriated money. Then, under a recissions bill, Congress claws back dollars it previously appropriated. It’s kind of like a reverse appropriation. And you thought that in elementary school, there were no takebacks. TRUMP SENDS $9.4 BILLION DOGE CUTS PROPOSAL TO CONGRESS, TARGETING NPR, PBS U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks to the media after the House narrowly passed a bill forwarding President Donald Trump's agenda at the U.S. Capitol on May 22, 2025 in Washington, DC.(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Presidential administrations send \"budget requests\" to Congress. This is the opposite. An administration can send a \"recissions request\" to Congress, too. And that’s what Budget Director Russ Vought is doing this week. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is intent on moving fast. \"I'd like to turn it around as quickly as possible,\" said Johnson. \"There may be multiple rescissions packages coming and we’ll process them as quickly as we can. It’s a big priority for me.\" Congressional conservatives andElon Muskwere not pleased with the relative paucity of spending cuts in the Big, Beautiful Bill. Musk told CBS he was \"disappointed\" in the legislation. \"Which increases the budget deficit, not decreases it. And it undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" said Musk about the hallmark of President Trump’s agenda. By Tuesday morning, the world’s richest man incinerated the bill on X and chastised most Republicans in Congress. Musk characterized the legislation as \"a disgusting abomination.\" He lectured the 215 House Republicans who voted yes, declaring \"you know you did wrong.\" SCOOP: HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS DRAWS BATTLE LINES AS WHITE HOUSE READIES $9.4B DOGE SPENDING CUTS DOGE initially set a goal of unearthing $2 trillion in spending cuts. It then slashed the threshold to $1 trillion. DOGE finally homed in on about $150 billion in cuts by the end of next year. And many of those cuts aren’t even in effect because Congress has the power of the purse. That’s where Congress comes in with a potential rescissions package. Most Republicans are appreciative of the efforts by DOGE and Musk. \"I think this is the beginning and the whole conversation in Congress is changed because of it,\" said Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., on Fox. But DOGE evaluated \"discretionary\" spending. Congress has the \"discretion\" to spend or not spend certain money each year. That comes through the annual appropriations process. That’s why GOPers are now using their \"discretion.\" They intend to unwind some of that spending with a rescission plan. U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) delivers a statement on the Israeli museum shooting that left two Israeli Embassy staffers dead after holding a press conference on the House passage of the tax and spending bill, at the U.S. Capitol on May 22, 2025 in Washington, DC.(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) But the largest percentage of federal spending – by about two to one – is tied to entitlements like Medicare, Medicaid andSocial Security, plus interest on the debt. That spending is called \"mandatory.\" House Republicans tried to address that slightly in the Big, Beautiful Bill since it dealt with Medicaid spending. But cuts to federal departments lie in the appropriations realm and falls on the discretionary side of the ledger. However, discretionary cuts via the Big, Beautiful Bill weren’t going to happen. \"Much of what DOGE has looked at is the discretionary spending,\" said Flood. \"This is far more complicated than just doing it in reconciliation.\" WHITE HOUSE SENDING $9.4 BILLION DOGE CUTS PACKAGE TO CONGRESS NEXT WEEK And so here we are, with Republicans in Congress looking at the first major rescissions plan since 1993. \"The House Freedom Caucus strongly supports these critical rescissions, and we will support as many more rescissions packages the White House can send us in the coming weeks and months,\" said the Freedom Caucus in a statement. \"There is no excuse for a Republican House not to advance the first DOGE rescissions package the same week it is presented to Congress then quickly send it for passage in the Republican Senate so President Trump can sign it into law.\" The law requires the president to spend money which Congress approves. However, there are some loopholes where a President can \"impound\" money and not spend it. GOP REBELS FIRE WARNING SHOT IN SHUTDOWN SHOWDOWN: NO DOGE, NO DEAL On CNN, Vought suggested that the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 \"allows for a procedure called pocket rescissions later in the year to be able to bank some of these savings without the bill actually being passed.\" Vought signaled that President Trump would likely lean on that tool. But he wants to start with an initial rescissions request. A recissions plan requires a simple majority to pass the House. And, believe it or not, a simple majority in the Senate. There’s no 60-vote requirement to break a filibuster. Moreover, the \"motion to proceed\" to start debate on a recessions package is \"privileged.\" That means the Senate only needs 51 votes to begin the process. Many \"motions to proceed\" in the Senate need 60 yeas and can be subject to a filibuster. President Trump formally routed his recissions request to Capitol Hill on Tuesday. It aims to trim $9.4 billion dollars from public broadcasting and foreign aid programs. All of this is money which Musk targeted in his DOGE reviews. But these cuts only count if Congress approves them. \"I want make sure you take the first tranche and see if it passes,\" said Vought on the targeted set of proposed spending reductions. \"The wider you do in terms of a package, the harder it is to pass. And if it doesn't pass, this is the real world. And we will lose flexibility that we have to use executive tools to find other ways to make the DOGE cuts permanent.\" SPEAKER JOHNSON SETS EYES ON CUTTING GOVERNMENT SPENDING, VOWS TO TAKE A 'BLOWTORCH' TO THE 'REGULATORY STATE' Lawmakers are starting to process the rescissions proposal. Especially since Republicans often talk a good game about slashing spending. \"We'll see if Congress can step up to the plate,\" said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Tex., noting the political consequences of not green lighting the rescissions package. \"(Members will have) to go campaign on why they want to continue to fund PBS, NPR, and a whole bunch of foreign policy and foreign funding that most Americans don't like. So you go explain it.\" Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., represents one of the most-Democratic leaning districts in the country. He worries about the PBS and NPR cuts. \"I have a great rapport with Nebraska Public Radio and TV. I think they've been great to work with. And so that would be one I hope they don't put in,\" said Bacon. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) speaking at the Senate Appropriations hearing to examine disaster funding needs on Wednesday, Nov. 20, 2024.(IMAGN) Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, flagged reductions to PEPFAR, short for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. \"I consider that to be possibly the most successful public health program that has ever been used in Africa and other parts of the world. So I do not support the reduction in PEPFAR,\" said Collins. It’s unclear whether this opening bid to cut spending – minimal as it is – can make it through Congress. Lots of Republicans will sweat this. And these are just negligible cuts. Republicans extolled the work of DOGE. But if they want to eliminate spending, they have to put their vote where their favorite program is. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We’ll know more in a few weeks whether Republicans can approve the recissions package andrescindwhat some characterize as wasteful spending. Otherwise, they may need torescindthose campaign promises. Chad Pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).

    "title": "Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' faces resistance from Republican senators over debt fears",
    "article_text": "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., lays out his objection to President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' on 'The Will Cain Show.' President Donald Trump's \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" is facing criticism, even from within his own party, as some lawmakers remain skeptical about the massive spending package and its potential impact on the nation's debt, despite it being under consideration by a Republican-controlled Congress. The spending bill, which the House passed late last month and is now in the Senate’s hands, aims to address a number of issues, including tax policy, border security and immigration, defense, energy production, the debt limit, and adjustments to SNAP and Medicaid. However, without a serious overhaul, lawmakers like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is still a \"no\" on the legislation because it will increase the nation's debt limit. He is among a group of at least four Republican senators who have expressed concerns over Trump's bill, because of the package's projected increase in the national debt. RAND PAUL SAYS HE WOULD SUPPORT 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' IF DEBT CEILING HIKE REMOVED Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Monday said he is still opposed to President Donald Trump's \"Big, Beautiful Bill,\" despite discussions with him.(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images; Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) This week,Paul relayedhis concerns to media members that the bill will raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. \"We have never raised the debt ceiling without actually meeting that target,\" he said. \"So you can say it doesn't directly add to the debt, but if you increase the ceiling $5 trillion, you'll meet that. And what it does is it puts it off the back-burner. And then we won't discuss it for a year or two.\" As of Tuesday, thenational debt, which measures what the U.S. owes its creditors, was $36.2 trillion, according to the Treasury Department. Trump pushed back on Paul's remarks about his bill. TRUMP WARNS RAND PAUL HE'S PLAYING INTO 'HANDS OF THE DEMOCRATS' WITH 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' OPPOSITION Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks to the media after the House narrowly passed a bill forwarding President Donald Trump's agenda at the U.S. Capitol, May 22, in Washington, D.C.(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) \"Rand Paulhas very little understanding of the BBB, especially the tremendous GROWTH that is coming. He loves voting ‘NO’ on everything, he thinks it’s good politics, but it’s not. The BBB is a big WINNER!!!\" Trump wrote on TRUTH Social. Meanwhile, the national deficit, which occurs when the federal government’s spending exceeds its revenues, was $1 trillion as of Tuesday, according to Treasury Department data. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the \"blatantly wrong claim that the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ increases the deficit is based on the Congressional Budget Office and other scorekeepers who use shoddy assumptions and have historically been terrible at forecasting across Democrat and Republican administrations alike.\" SEN. RON JOHNSON PROPOSES 'LINE-BY-LINE' CUTS TO PASS TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' The outlook for the federal debt level is bleak, as FOX Business previously reported, with economists increasingly sounding the alarm over the torrid pace of spending by Congress and theWhite House. Under the terms of the bill, the bill would add over $2 trillion to budget deficits over a decade, according to a recent analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). All together, the tax cuts and reforms in the package add nearly $3.8 trillion to the deficit over a decade – though spending reductions in other parts of the bill offset some of that to arrive at the $2.3 trillion figure. Elon Musk, who ended his tenure last week as Trump’s lead in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), doubled down on his position Tuesday that the House’s reconciliation package was an \"abomination.\" WHITE HOUSE STANDS BY TAX BILL AFTER MUSK CALLS IT A ‘DISGUSTING ABOMINATION’ The White House launched a Big Beautiful Bill calculator for taxpayers.(White House ) \"I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,\" Musk posted on X Tuesday. \"This massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\" The Trump administration and some congressional Republicans have pushed back on the estimates of the bill, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and its impact on the deficit, arguing that economic growth from thetax cutswill stimulate economic activity and lead to more tax revenue than what is projected. SPEAKER JOHNSON CLASHES WITH RAND PAUL OVER 'WIMPY' SPENDING CUTS IN TRUMP'S BILL \"Hope it does a lot to get some further cuts,\" Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., told Fox News about the bill. \"We don't want to bankrupt the country. And what Elon also should recognize is we don't need more solar and EV credits. That actually makes it worse. He probably knows that, though.\" A man walks past the National Debt Clock on 43rd Street in New York City. The billboard constantly updates to display the current U.S. gross national debt and each American family's share of the debt.(Getty Images) To push back on the criticism, the White House launched a website where Americans can tabulate how much the bill will personally save them. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The House passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on May 22 with anarrow 215-214-1 votethat went largely along party lines. If that version of the bill is revised by the Senate, the legislation will have to go back to the House for another vote before it can go to Trump's desk and become law.

    "title": "Ex-boxer opens up about being granted clemency by Trump and the president potentially pardoning Diddy",
    "article_text": "Former boxer Duke Tanner, who was pardoned by President Donald Trump after 16 years in prison, gave his thoughts on Trump recently suggesting he may also pardon Sean 'Diddy' Combs. Formerprofessional boxerDuke Tanner remembers witnessing a murder on his first day in prison in 2004. \"I watched the guy walk out the unit, blood seeping out of his neck. He dropped on the floor andended up dyinglater,\" Tanner told Fox News Digital, recalling his thoughts at the time. \"'It's my new environment. I got to survive. I'm not going to die in here. I'm not going to be him.'\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM He wound up in jail after getting caught in a drug trafficking sting operation while trying to make additional money for his family. \"I thought it was a robbery at first. So, when I saw it was cops, I was really at peace,\" he said. He was sentenced to two life terms, ending his boxing career and separating him from his family, including his son, who was just 2 at the time, for 16 years. He dedicated his time in prison to embracing Christianity and taking up every rehabilitation program available. And Tanner remembers the night in 2018 when he realized PresidentDonald Trumpwould be the one who would end his sentence. BIDEN CLEMENCY ANNOUNCEMENT GETS MIXED REVIEWS ON CAPITOL HILL: ‘WHERE’S THE BAR?' \"I had a dream, and I woke up,\" Tanner said. \"I started writing a letter once a week to the White House after I had that dream, and, two years later, I was let go.\" After being denied clemency by former President Barack Obama in 2016, Tanner was granted clemency by Trump in 2020. In May, the former boxer was granted a presidential pardon. Tanner visited the White House to thank Trump in person. \"I got to thank him, and he remembered my case. And he said, 'Man, you had a bad road, but you got a beautiful son. I hear you’re doing great things. And continue the good work. I'm watching you,'\" Tanner said. Former boxer Duke Tanner was granted clemency by President Donald Trump in 2020 and granted a presidential pardon last month.(Courtesy of Duke Tanner) In August, Tanner published a book, \"Duke Got Life: A Boxer's Fight for Freedom and One Last Shot at Redemption,\" detailing his story. Weeks after Tanner received his presidential pardon, Trump floated the idea of giving a presidential pardon to hip-hop artist Sean \"Diddy\" while he's on trial for sex trafficking. Tanner, who admits he hasn't followed the \"Diddy\" case closely and isn't \"at liberty\" to discuss the rapper's charges, revealed how he would feel about the idea of Combs getting a pardon from Trump. \"This administration is going to read every piece of paperwork. They're going to get to the facts. They're going to get to the bottom of everything. And if he decides to make that move, it's a positive move, because he went through the system,\" Tanner said, referencing Trump's criminal trial last summer over alleged hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels. \"He knows what they did to him to try and make him a convicted felon, to make him get found guilty of all those counts. So, he knows the prosecution misconduct. He knows how they do it. He knows that it's a broken system.\" Tanner also suggested Trump's pardons are a means of holding those involved in the criminal justice system accountable. \"And he's trying to show them, 'You guys do y'all job right, or I'm going to come and fix it for you and embarrass you,'\" Tanner added. \"So, with that being said, if he decides to do it, evidently he saw something, and he got the best lawyers around him. …  I'm not at liberty to even speak on [the Diddy trial]. I don't know what's going on. I'm just saying I don't care who it was. If the president said that he wanted to do it, believe me, there's a reason behind it, and that the law wasn't handled correctly.\" Tanner said he knows a lot of other people who are incarcerated who he believes deserve clemency. Duke Tanner with Donald Trump(Courtesy of Duke Tanner) \"I definitely know there's so many men and women that need clemency to be let out of the system,\" Tanner said. Tanner has already witnessed another president give a series of controversial pardons in the last year. Former President Joe Biden granted a series of pardons before leaving office in December, including to his son Hunter Biden, who was due to be sentenced for federal gun and tax convictions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I heard about it. He freed his son,\" Tanner said. \"It can never be comparable to my own because he never went to prison. He never even got charged. I did 16 years, six months and 21 days, taken away from my 2-year-old son. … He can never compare to the pain I went through. And then I came home still fighting for other people. \"What has [Hunter] done? Have we even heard from him since he got the pardon? Did he even speak about it? Did he even thank his father about it?

    "title": "Expert speaks out on 'perfect solution' to federal hiring issues creating national security concerns",
    "article_text": "Fox News Digital spoke to SkillStorm CEO Justin Vianello about what his company is doing to make federal government hiring better and address current national security concerns. EXCLUSIVE:Fox News Digital sat down with SkillStorm CEO Justin Vianello, who addressed issues the federal government faces hiring workers, sometimes raising national security concerns, and explained what his company is doing to streamline that process. The federal government has struggled for decades with staffing issues in key roles like cybersecurity, tech and other high-skill areas, an issue flaggedas far back as 2001,according to the Government Accountability Office. Vianello discussed how SkillStorm is attempting to solve those issues. \"If we look at the procurement process and the way it's been structured, there's significant delays,\" Vianello told Fox News Digital. \"So, it can take years to actually get to a point where a solicitation is actually awarded. And then, ironically or paradoxically, post that award, the agency will expect … the particular company to be able to deliver a team in 10 days. So, this process is inefficient and somewhat outdated.\" Vianello explained that the current hiring process is \"lengthy\" and \"laborious,\" sometimes taking years rather than months and creating delays that teams need to properly mobilize and deploy. MAGA GROUP FIGHTS TO UNDO CARTER-ERA BAN ON MERIT-BASED FEDERAL HIRING Fox News Digital spoke to SkillStorm CEO Justin Vianello about ways to improve federal hiring.(Getty/Fox Digital) \"One of the solutions to that issue is to actually allow for an on-ramp time where people can spend between two to four months to custom build teams that have the right skills, that have (the) right certifications that are based in the right locations to rapidly deploy teams and to accelerate IT transformation and automation. And that's really where the SkillStorm model comes in,\" Vianello said. Vianello says the company has spent millions of dollars in recent years building a Performance Acceleration Center for Excellence that is essentially a learning management training system with a customized curriculum and content along with a \"stable of trainers\" in a position to \"rapidly upskill and deploy people.\" \"How do we leverage that infrastructure to build out a solution for the federal government?\" Vianello said. \"Well, what we do is we leverage that infrastructure to accelerate and train teams. And the way the model works is we both bring people into our program. We train them for anywhere between 10 and 16 weeks. We pay them while we're training them. We help them achieve their certification, and then we deploy them. And we recover the investment that we make by billing them hourly.\" FLASHBACK: TOP FIVE WILDEST MOMENTS FROM ELON MUSK'S DOGE TENURE AS IT COMES TO AN END The U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., Feb. 24, 2025.(Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) That system, Vianello explained, means SkillStorm takes \"all the risk up front\" and recovers it by billing hourly to the client. \"Now this is the perfect solution to being able to custom-build tech teams, create net new talent for the ecosystem and being able deploy these people over time. But the government is gonna have to change the procurement system to not require people to be deployed within 10 days but allow companies to build these teams over two, three, four months.\" Another issue, Vianello told Fox News Digital, is the current hiring process can get tied up with security clearances and become anational security risk. \"That's absolutely part of it, but I think there's a bigger issue here if you look more generally at our model and some of the issues that are facing the market,\" Vianello said. \"Well, if you look at SkillStorm's model, SkillStorm has an innovative cost-effective solution to custom-build U.S.-based tech teams for rapid deployment. \"Now, we have a student debt crisis in this country, and, at the same time, what are we doing? We're offshoring our children's roles to other countries, and we're using visa holders to take up the place of entry-level tech roles. Now, if we don't invest in programs like SkillStorm, if we do invest in these outcome-driven, apprenticeship-type programs, where's the next generation of cybersecurity experts going to come from? \"Where’s the new generation of AI innovators going to come from? This is a national security issue that is essential in driving innovation. Right now, there are 500,000 open cybersecurity roles as of January 2025. We are the domestic models, like these apprenticeship models, that can support that gap to make sure that we're protecting national security.\" Former DOGE chief Elon Musk looks on as President Donald Trump meets South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.(AP/Evan Vucci) Former General Services Administration (GSA) head Emily Murphy, who previouslyspoke to Fox News Digitalabout the GSA’s work to streamline government in the era of DOGE, said she has \"seen firsthand how outdated federal systems have become one of the most serious yet least discussed threats to national security. \"Agencies charged with safeguarding cybersecurity and digital infrastructure are losing the talent battle to the private sector, and the slow, outdated process for onboarding cleared workers doesn’t match the urgency of today’s threats.\" Murphy explained that the federal government needs a \"new pipeline\" that \"delivers clearance-eligible, project-ready professionals trained on mission-specific tools.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"SkillStorm is doing exactly that, deploying \"Stormers,\" technologists trained on specific tech platforms, at a significant discount. It’s a smarter, faster way to secure the talent our government urgently needs. Vianello told Fox News Digital SkillStorm and theDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE) have similar goals in making government more efficient. \"I think DOGE is really focused on IT automation and IT transformation and doing it on an efficient and cost-effective basis,\" Vianello said. \"We believe, going forward, there's probably going to be more of a push to less full-time employees and more of a push towards efficient contractors coming in and accelerating project delivery. So, again, this really does come back in our belief. \"To the solicitation process, how do we tighten it up? How do we make sure that once an award is made and that technology is implemented, it's not outdated? Because, if that continues to happen, how are you going to continue to attract technologists, young technologists who want to be part of the change?\" Andrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

    "article_text": "NBC host Seth Meyers ridiculed the notion that the White House engaged in a \"cover-up\" of former President Biden's declining health during his term. NBC \"Late Night\" hostSeth Meyersmocked the idea of former President Joe Biden's declining health being a major political scandal, claiming it \"was the worst cover-up in American history.\" Questions about Biden's health have resurfaced after the release of \"Original Sin,\" a new book by CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios journalist Alex Thompson, which alleges that Biden's inner circleconcealed the president's flailing healthand cognitive decline for years, despite telling the public that he was mentally sharp and fit for office. Meyers ripped the media for paying attention to the Biden \"cover-up\" when, according to him, \"The Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress are rapidly dismantling American civil society and turning the country into a reclusive oligarchy.\" \"But I don't want to talk about any of that and neither does the media. We both want to talk about something way more important.Joe Bidenis, and has been, for a while, very old,\" he said sarcastically. CREDIBILITY CRISIS: BIDEN'S LATE-NIGHT ALLIES GO QUIET AFTER DAMNING COGNITIVE DECLINE REVELATIONS Late-night host Seth Meyers dismissed the media fervor over an alleged Biden ‘cover-up’ on his Monday night show.(NBC/Screenshot) After playing a montage of figures calling the cover-up a media scandal, Meyers joked, \"They're right. This is the biggest scandal in history, bigger than Watergate, bigger than Iran-Contra, bigger than the Teapot Dome Scandal.\" The late-night host argued that the president's advanced age wasn't a secret and the majority of Americanswere against him runningfor re-election in the 2024 campaign, believing him to be too old to serve again. \"Now, you might be thinking to yourself, 'Wait, didn't everybody already know that Joe Biden was old?'\" Meyers asked. \"'Didn't poll after poll show that the vast majority of Americans, including a clear majority of Democrats, thought he was too old to run for reelection, and wanted someone else? Didn't he biff it so bad in the debate that his own party undertook an unprecedented effort to successfully force him out of the race?'\" \"'Weren't Democrats ultimately punished for Biden's disastrous choice to run again when they got their asses kicked in the November election?'\" he continued. \"'Didn't Seth play that clip of Biden falling up the stairs, like, 1,000 times?'\" JEN PSAKI INSISTS SHE ‘NEVER SAW’ DIMINISHED BIDEN WHILE WORKING AS PRESS SECRETARY President Joe Biden's cognitive decline was known to his inner circle, according to new bombshell books released this year.(Derek White/Getty Images for DNC) \"This was on TV, everyone saw it,\" he said of Biden stumbling while walking up the stairs of Air Force One in 2021. \"If this was a cover-up, if this was the worst [bleep] cover-up in American history. It was the worst-kept secret since Mika and Joe,\" he joked, referring to the relationship of \"Morning Joe\" co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough who wed in 2018 after years of co-hosting the morning MSNBC show. \"This was only like Watergate if the break-in had been live-streamed on Twitch,\" Meyers added. After poking fun at reports that Biden got lost in his closet in the White House, Meyers turned serious. \"It was just a disastrous political choice. And the people who deserve criticism for that are Biden, the aides who convinced him and themselves that he should ignore reality and run again,\" he concluded. CREDIBILITY CRISIS: WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS SPEAK OUT ON WHETHER BIDEN'S MENTAL DECLINE WAS DELIBERATELY HIDDEN Late-night host Seth Meyers dismissed Special Counsel Robert Hur's report in February 2024 which said President Biden demonstrated memory issues.(JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) Meyer's Monday night show appears to be the first time he referenced the Biden cover-up revelations from Tapper's book, according to Grabien transcripts. Meyer and fellow liberal late-night hosts Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel have all welcomed Biden for friendly interviews. Most recently, Biden was on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\" in February 2024, just days after the release of Special Counsel Robert Hur's report. Hur was heavilyattacked by the mediaat the time for calling Biden a \"sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory\" in his report. During his February 2024 interview of Biden, Meyers gently broached the subject of Biden's age before quickly moving on to other topics. CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS Questions about then-President Biden’s fitness to serve another term exploded following a disastrous presidential debate in June 2024.(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images) After Hur's report was released a few days later, Meyers called the special counsel's comments a \"gratuitous hypothetical\" and stressed that Hur was a \"Republican attorney\" who \"was originally appointed by Trump.\" \"If that kind of language was appropriate in a legal finding, then prosecutors could have done the same thing to Trump,\" Meyers said before repeatedly drawing attention to PresidentDonald Trump's mental acuity.

    "article_text": "Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum join 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the Trump administration moving to accelerate drilling on a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. Conservative energy leaders are celebrating PresidentDonald Trump'slatest effort to unleash American drilling. The Department of the Interiorannounced a proposalMonday to rescind President Joe Biden's restrictions on oil and gas development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said a Biden-era 2024 Bureau of Land Management (BLM) rule that restricted energy development for more than half of the 23 million acres on Alaska’s North Slope ignored the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976. \"The National Petroleum Reserve (NPR), created by Congress over a century ago to secure America’s energy supply, supports responsible oil development on 13 million acres,\" Frank Lasee, president of Truth in Energy and Climate, said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO OPEN 13 MILLION ALASKA ACRES TO MINING, DRILLING Unleashing American energy was one of President Donald Trump's key campaign promises on the 2024 presidential campaign trail.(Getty Images/AP) \"President Biden’s drilling banin Alaska undermined energy security, increasing reliance on foreign oil, raising gasoline prices and fueling inflation through higher transportation costs,\" Lasee added. \"Resuming drilling puts economic growth and energy independence ahead of climate ideology in a place almost no regular American will ever visit.\" TRUMP ENERGY DEPARTMENT CANCELS $3.7 BILLION IN BIDEN-ERA GREEN ENERGY GRANTS Consistent with Trump's executive orders, the proposed revision reverts to regulations that were in place prior to May 7, 2024, which Lasee called a \"commendable\" prioritization of \"American energy needs and economic well-being while adhering to the law.\" \"President Biden never should have halted congressionally sanctionedoil drilling in Alaska,\" said Sterling Burnett, director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy at the Heartland Institute. \"Trump is to be applauded, both for putting Americans' energy needs and our economic well-being first and for following the law by opening these areas back up for production.\" According to the Department of Interior, the 2024 rule provisions lacked \"a basis in the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act\" and undermined the BLM's congressional obligation to oversee timely leasing in the region. A part of the Trans Alaska Pipeline Sept. 17, 2019, in Fairbanks, Alaska.(Getty Images) \"President Trump’s move to restore drilling in Alaska’s Arctic region is a bold and necessary step toward reclaiming American energy independence,\" Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, said. Trump vowed to unleash American energy on thecampaign trail in 2024and signed executive orders on the first day of his second term to rescind Biden-era climate policies. \"By reversing Biden’s disastrous restrictions on 13 million acres, Trump is unleashing the abundant resources that power our economy, lower energy costs and strengthen national security. This is a victory for American workers, consumers and allies who rely on stable, affordable energy,\" Isaac added. Steve Milloy, senior policy fellow at the Energy & Environment Legal Institute, called the announcement \"more good news from the Trump administration in rolling back more of Biden’s war on fossil fuels.\" President Joe Biden's administration added regulations to 13 million acres on Alaska’s North Slope.(Bonnie Cash/UPI/Bloomberg via Getty Images) \"Promises made. Promises kept. But the Trump administration will need to go further to give investors confidence that the Alaska leases will actually be viable. Radical climate activists will resort to the courts and scare off investors. There likely needs to be a legislative solution to that,\" Milloy added. Trump and his Republican allies are seeking to roll back some of Biden's green energy initiatives through budget reconciliation on Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\" \"The National Petroleum Reserve (NPR) was created more than 100 years ago specifically to provide a supply of oil for America’s energy security. That energy security can be achieved by responsibly developing our oil reserves, including in the Gulf of America, our vast shale oil deposits in America’s heartland and, now, thankfully, the 13 million acres of the NPR that are going to be developed,\" said Gregory Whitestone, CO2 Coalition executive director. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Continuation of the Biden administration’s drilling ban would have resulted in a greater reliance on foreign supplies of oil (and) increases in gasoline prices and the inflationary spiral across all sectors of the American economy from increased transportation costs,\" Whitestone added.

But the pull of a new technological wave – generative AI – and the thought that they may be able to  build something even bigger with them have drawn them back in. The two have now co-foundedThunder Code, a generative AI-powered software testing platform, which has already secured $9 million in seed funding, they told TechCrunch. “It’s pretty crazy because we promised not to do another company because Expensya was too hard,” Jouini told TechCrunch. “But I think it’s like when people have two kids, they forget how hard the first one was. This new venture is less than six months old and already super intense, but we’re fired up. We’re convinced this is unicorn material.” Jouini says his transition into head of technology at Medius reignited a spark he missed after years as Expensya’s frontman. As he oversaw the integration of six companies across three continents, he saw firsthand how generative AI could reshape the software industry. Testing was a universal problem, no matter the product, a realization that seeded the idea for Thunder Code. Thunder Code tackles slow, manual testing with AI-powered “agents” that mimic human testers. These agents simulate QA processes, catch subtle UI and UX issues, and learn from feedback. Determined to avoid Expensya’s early missteps, Jouini prioritized speed. “We shipped our first MVP in week six, and now the product is much more solid six months in than Expensya was in year four,” he said. This reflects a widely held belief in startup land that fast feedback trumps perfect plans. Thunder Code is already gaining traction, with paying customers and pilot programs across the U.S., Canada, France, and Tunisia. The company partners with delivery managers, QA shops, and developer teams eager to test and ship faster. Its current focus is web application testing, with plans to expand into mobile, desktop, and API testing by late 2025. In addition to speed, Jouini’s second rodeo also applies other hard-earned lessons from Expensya, like focusing on core features and getting the best talent as soon as possible. He’s unapologetic about early dilution, as it relates to investing in top talent. “A lot of African entrepreneurs are scared to dilute capital because they want to keep 100%. We believe that if we create a unicorn while diluting ourselves, that’s good value,” he remarked. Jouini believes, however, that AI will let Thunder Code generate 10 times the value with fewer people, echoing the broader sentiment shift toward leaner AI-powered teams. Nevertheless, Jouini admits the jump from expense management to software developer tools was a leap despite the pain points feeling familiar. Yet, he sees software testing as a bigger, more complex market,projected to exceed $100 billion by 2027, still dominated by legacy code-based platforms like Tricentis and BrowserStack, that may be slow to adapt. He believes Thunder Code’s fast execution with AI gives it an edge even against similar new agentic products. Thunder Code, headquartered in Paris with an office in Tunis, joins an increasingly crowded market of startups all attempting to do same with entrants ranged fromUIPathto startups likeJetify,Nova AI. It helps that his co-founder, Othmani, brings deep expertise in generative AI, having built internal AI tools at Expensya years before ChatGPT made waves. Their complementary skills and the $9 million raised in six months position Thunder Code to move fast and capture market share, Jouini said. The funding round includes familiar faces from Expensya’s cap table, including Silicon Badia and Jaango Capital, along with Titan Seed Fund and strategic angels like Roxanne Varza (Director of Station F) and Karim Beguir, CEO of Instadeep,Africa’s biggest AI startup. Former and current Expensya employeeswho cashed out during the acquisitionhave also invested. “Some of our investors are actually Expensya employees and I’m glad it worked out that way,” said Jouini.

Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan said in apost on XTuesday that Anthropic gave Windsurf little notice for this change, and the startup now has to find other third-party compute providers to run several of Anthropic’s most popular AI models on its platform. “We have been very clear to Anthropic that this is not our desire – we wanted to pay them for the full capacity,” said Mohan on X. “We are disappointed by this decision and short notice.” In ablog post, Windsurf said it has some capacity with third-party inference providers, but not enough, so this change may create short-term availability issues for Windsurf users trying to access Claude. With less than five days of notice, Anthropic decided to cut off nearly all of our first-party capacity to all Claude 3.x models. Given the short notice, we may see some short-term Claude 3.x model availability issues as we have very quickly ramped up capacity on other inference… The decision comes just a few weeks after Anthropic seemed to pass over Windsurf during thelaunch of Claude 4, the company’s new family of models, which offer industry leading performance on software engineering tasks. Onlaunch day, Windsurf said it did not receive direct access from Anthropic to run Claude 4 on its platform, and still hasn’t. This forced the company to rely on a workaround that’s more expensive and complicated for developers to access Claude 4. Meanwhile, other popular AI coding tools — including Anysphere’s Cursor, Cognition’s Devin, and Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot — seemed to have direct access to Claude 4 models at launch. The AI-assisted coding sector, also know as vibe coding, has heated up in recent months. OpenAI reportedlyclosed on a deal to acquire Windsurf in April. At the same time, Anthropic — whose AI models are a favorite among developers — has invested more in its own AI-coding applications. In February, Anthropic launched its own AI coding application,Claude Code, and in May, the startup held its first Code with Claude developer conference. “We’re prioritizing capacity for sustainable partnerships that allow us to effectively serve the broader developer community,” said Anthropic spokesperson Steve Mnich in an email to TechCrunch on Tuesday, noting that it’s still possible to access Claude 4 on Windsurf via an API key. “Developers can also access Claude through our direct API integration, our partner ecosystem, and other development tools.” Windsurf has grown quickly this year, reaching$100 million ARR in April, in an attempt to catch up with more popular AI coding tools such as Cursor and GitHub Copilot. However, Windsurf’s limited access to Anthropic’s models may be stunting its growth. Several Windsurf users who spoke with TechCrunch were frustrated by the lack of direct access to Anthropic’s best AI coding models. Ronald Mannak, a startup founder that specializes in Apple’s programming language, Swift, told TechCrunch that Claude 4 represented a significant jump in capabilities for his workloads. While Mannak has been a Windsurf customer since late 2024, he’s switched to using Cursor in recent weeks so that he can vibe code more easily with Claude 4. As a short-term solution to support Claude 4, Windsurf allows users to connect their Anthropic API keys to their Windsurf accounts. However, developers have noted that this “bring your own key” solution is more expensive and complicated than if Windsurf provided the models itself. When it comes to vibe coders, optionality is the name of the game. Every few months, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic release new AI models that seem to outperform the industry on coding tasks. Because of that, it benefits vibe coding startups to support AI models from all the leading developers. Windsurf spokesperson Payal Patel tells TechCrunch via email that the company has always believed in providing optionality for users. In this case, it seems Anthropic has made that a bit more challenging. Topics Senior Reporter, Consumer Think you know AI? Prove it.

    "title": "Labour is cosying up to China after years of rollercoaster relations",
    "article_text": "The sprawling city of Chongqing in southwestern China is an incredible sight. Built on mountainous terrain and crisscrossed by rivers, it is connected by vast elevated roads. Trains even run through some buildings. TikTokers have begun documenting their commutes in the striking urban architecture, generating millions of likes and much hype. But it is also where, on a somewhat quieter trip, mayors and their deputies from the UK recently visited - the largest British civic delegation to visit the country in modern history. The whole trip, which took place in March, received substantial Chinese media coverage, despite flying more under the radar in the UK. The impression it left on some of the politicians who travelled there was vast. \"[The city is] what happens if you take the planning department and just say 'yes' to everything,\" reflects Howard Dawber, deputy London mayor for business. \"It's just amazing.\" The group travelled to southern Chinese cities, spoke to Chinese mayors and met Chinese tech giants. So impressed was one deputy mayor that, on returning home, they bought a mobile phone from Chinese brand Honor (a stark contrast from the days the UK banned Huawei technology from its 5G networks, just a few years ago). Roughly half-a-dozen deals were signed on the back of the trip. The West Midlands, for example, agreed to establish a new UK headquarters in Birmingham for Chinese energy company EcoFlow. But the visit was as much about diplomacy as it was trade, says East Midlands deputy mayor Nadine Peatfield, who attended. \"There was a real hunger and appetite to rekindle those relationships.\" To some, it was reminiscent of the \"golden era\" of UK-China relations, a time when then-Prime Minister David Cameron and Chinese President Xi Jinping shared a basket of fish and chips and a pint. Those days have long felt far away. Political ties with China deteriorated under former UK Conservative Prime Ministers Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss. The last UK prime minister to visit China was Theresa May, in 2018. But the recent delegation - and the talk of Sir Keir Starmer possibly visiting China later this year -  suggests a turning point in relations. But to what greater intent? The course correction seemed to begin with the closed-door meeting between Sir Keir and Chinese President Xi in Brazil last November. The prime minister signalled that Britain would look to cooperate with China on climate change and business. Since then, Labour's cautious pursuit of China has primarily focused on the potential financial upsides. In January, Chancellor Rachel Reeves co-chaired the first UK-China economic summit since 2019, in Beijing. Defending her trip, she said: \"Choosing not to engage with China is no choice at all.\" Reeves claimed re-engagement with China could boost the UK economy by £1bn, with agreements worth £600m to the UK over the next five years — partially achieved through lifting barriers that restrict exports to China. Soon after, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband resumed formal climate talks with China. Miliband said it would be \"negligence\" to future generations not to have dialogue with the country, given it is the world's biggest carbon emitter. Labour simply describes its approach as \"grown-up\". But it all appears to be a marked shift from the last decade of UK-China relations. During the so-called \"golden era\", from 2010, the UK's policy towards China was dominated by the Treasury, focusing on economic opportunities and appearing to cast almost all other issues, including human rights or security, aside. By September 2023, however, Rishi Sunak said he was \"acutely aware of the particular threat to our open and democratic way of life\" posed by China. Labour claimed in its manifesto that it would bring a \"long-term and strategic approach\". China has a near monopoly on extracting and refining rare earth minerals, which are critical to manufacturing many high-tech and green products. For example, car batteries are often reliant on lithium, while indium is a rare metal used for touch screens. This makes China a vital link in global supply chains. \"China's influence is likely to continue to grow substantially globally, especially with the US starting to turn inwards,\" says Dr William Matthews, a China specialist at Chatham House think tank. \"The world will become more Chinese, and whilst that is difficult for any Western government, there needs to be sensible engagement from the get-go.\" Andrew Cainey, a director of the UK National Committee on China, an educational non-profit organisation, says: \"China has changed a lot since the Covid-19 pandemic. To have elected officials not having seen it, it's a no brainer for them to get back on the ground\". Certainly many in the UK's China-watching community believe that contact is an essential condition to gain a clearer-eyed view of the opportunities posed by China, but also the challenges. The opportunities, some experts say, are largely economic, climate and education-related. Or as Kerry Brown, Professor of Chinese Studies at King's College London, puts it: \"China is producing information, analysis and ways of doing things that we can learn from\". He points to the intellectual, technological, AI, and life sciences opportunities. Not engaging with China would be to ignore the realities of geopolitics in the 21st century, in Dr Matthew's view, given that it is the world's second largest economy. However he also believes that engagement comes with certain risks. But Charles Parton, who spent 22 years of his diplomatic career working in or on China, raises questions about the UK's economic andnational security. For example, the government is reportedly weighing up proposals for a Chinese company to supply wind turbines for an offshore windfarm in the North Sea. Mr Parton warns against allowing China access to the national grid: \"It wouldn't be difficult in a time of high tension to say, 'by the way, we can turn off all your wind farms'\". But earlier this year, the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU issued a statement expressing concern over the \"politicisation\" of deals between wind developers in Europe and Chinese turbine suppliers. James Sullivan, director of Cyber and Tech at defence think tank Rusi, notes there are also some questions around cyberspace. \"China's activities in cyberspace appear to be more strategically and politically focused compared to previous opportunistic activities,\" he says. As for defence, the UK's recently published defence review describes China as a \"sophisticated and persistent challenge\", with Chinese technology and its proliferation to other countries \"already a leading challenge for the UK\". Ken McCallum, MI5 director general, meanwhile, has previously warned of asustained campaign on an \"epic scale\"of Chinese espionage abroad. But Prof Brown pushes back on some concerns about espionage, saying some media narratives about this are a \"fairytale\". Beijing has always dismissed accusations of espionage as attempts to \"smear\" China. Sir Keir and his team will no doubt be closely monitoring how this is all viewed by Washington DC. Last month, President Donald Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro described Britain as \"an all too compliant servant of Communist China\", urging the UK against deepening economic ties. \"When it comes to foreign policy towards China, America's influence on policy will be quite substantive compared with say continental Europe,\" says Dr Yu Jie of China Foresight at LSE IDEAS think tank. Most analysts I speak to in both the UK and China are still clear on the need for the two countries to get back in the same room, even if they differ on where to draw the line: in which areas should Westminster cooperate and where should it stay clear. These red lines have not yet been drawn, and experts say that without some kind of playbook, it is difficult for businesses and elected officials to know how to engage. \"You can only keep firefighting specific issues for so long without developing a systematic plan,\" warns Mr Cainey. Certain thorny issues have arisen, including Chinese investments in the UK. For example in April when the government seized control of British Steel from its former Chinese owner Jingye, to prevent it from being closed down, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds admitted that he would \"look at a Chinese firm in a different way\" when considering investment in the UK steel industry. China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, warned that Labour should avoid \"linking it to security issues, so as not to impact the confidence of Chinese enterprises in going to the UK\". After Starmer met Xi last year, he said the government's approach would be \"rooted in the national interests of the UK\", but acknowledged areas of disagreement with China, including on human rights, Taiwan and Russia's war in Ukraine. Securing the release of pro-democracy activist and British citizen Jimmy Lai from a Hong Kong prison is, he has said, a \"priority\" for the government. Labour's manifesto broadly pledged: \"We will cooperate where we can, compete where we need to, and challenge where we must.\" What is still lacking, however, is the fine print. Asked about the British government's longer-term strategy, Mr Parton replied: \"No.10 doesn't have a strategy.\" He tells me he has some specific advice: \"Go with your eyes open,\" he says. \"But have a clear idea of what needs protecting, and a willingness to take some short-term financial hits to protect long-term national security.\" Labour has suggested that some clarity on their approach will be provided through the delayed China \"audit\", a cross-government exercise launched last year, which will review the UK's relations with China. The audit is due to be published this month, but many doubt that it will resolve matters. \"If we see a visit from Starmer to Beijing, that will be an indication that the two sides have actually agreed with something, and that they would like to change and improve their bilateral relationship,\" says Dr Yu. But many people in Westminster remain China-sceptic. And even if the audit helps Britain better define what it wants out of its relationship with China, the question remains, do MPs and businesses have the China-related expertise to get the best out of it? According to Ruby Osman, China analyst at the Tony Blair Institute, there is an urgent need to build the UK's China capabilities in a more holistic way, focusing on diversifying the UK's points of contact with China. \"If we want to be in a position where we are not just listening to what Beijing and Washington want, there needs to be investment in the talent pipeline coming into government, but also think tanks and businesses who work with China,\" she argues. And if that's the case, then irrespective of whether closer ties with China is viewed as a security threat, an economic opportunity, or something in between, the UK might be in a better position to engage with the country.

    "title": "Man killed in racist attack told police he saw similar assault weeks before death",
    "article_text": "An elderly man who was racially abused before being fatally attacked had told police he witnessed an assault on another Asian man yards from his home two weeks earlier, the BBC has found. Bhim Kohli had been walking his dog in a park in Leicestershire in September when he was punched and kicked by a 14-year-old boy while a girl, 12, filmed the attack. The BBC has learnt that Mr Kohli spoke to officers in August after he saw two white boys aged 12 and 13 racially abuse a man and throw a large rock at him near the same park where the 80-year-old encountered his own attackers. Leicestershire Police said \"organisational learning\" to improve logging anti-social behaviour had been identified. Mr Kohli died the day after the \"intense attack\" against him in Franklin Park, Braunstone Town near Leicester, for which the boy and girl, now aged 15 and 13 respectively, were both convicted of manslaughter. They are due to be sentenced on Thursday. Another eyewitness to the attack in August, Linda Haigh, said she warned police about racially motivated problems in the area before Mr Kohli died, and believes he would still be alive had they taken her more seriously. The victim, who wishes to remain anonymous, was walking to Franklin Park on 17 August when he was targeted by the two boys, who were not involved in Mr Kohli's death. He told the BBC: \"One of the boys started picking up stones and throwing them at me... and then the same boy picked up a quite a large rock from the front garden of one of the houses there, and tried to throw it at me.\" The man, aged in his 40s, said they shouted at him to \"go back to your village\". \"It was a throwback to back to the 80s, when it was quite commonplace to be racially abused,\" he said. \"I was shocked that this kind of behaviour was still around society. \"I've not been in that situation for a long time, maybe 40 years.\" It was when one of the boys picked up a wooden fence post and tried to hit the man with it that others - including Mr Kohli and his daughter Susan, and their neighbour Ms Haigh - intervened, according to the man. He said he was shocked by the \"kind of behaviour from such a young age group\". \"The racist language, the violence used as well... they were trying to physically hurt me,\" he added. \"The anger, but more just the vitriol of the whole thing.\" Police were called but the pair were not arrested until three days after the death of Mr Kohli, according to the man. He believes a greater police presence in the area following the assault could have prevented the attack on Mr Kohli two weeks later. \"They should have really looked at putting more presence there, more officers, maybe mobile police cars driving around,\" he said. \"They could have deterred them. It's obviously very tragic.\" During the trial of Mr Kohli's killers, the court was told about an occasion \"a week or two\" before his death when the girl convicted of his manslaughter was present while other children threw apples at him. The jury was also shown a video she had filmed on her phone of another Asian man having a water balloon thrown at him and being racially abused. The BBC has also been told it was reported to police that in July Mr Kohli had stones thrown at him, was spat at and had been racially abused by a group of children after he told them to get off his neighbour's garage roof. Ch Supt Jonathan Starbuck, of Leicestershire Police, said: \"Prior to Mr Kohli's death, police were aware of two reports of anti-social behaviour involving youths in the Franklin Park area which were being investigated. \"Partnership work in the area following Mr Kohli's death did identify further incidents which had not been reported.\" He added an investigation conducted by the force, reviewed by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, did not identify any \"misconduct or missed opportunities which could have prevented Mr Kohli's death\". The attacks have left the victim of the August assault fearful for his safety and that of his elderly parents, who also live in the area. His father, like Mr Kohli, likes to go for a walk, but since being targeted, he tells him not to, especially in the dark, he told the BBC. \"Even my nephews... you worry about them as well because you just don't know. It's just become more violent,\" he said. The two boys involved in the August assault appeared in youth court in Leicester in December charged with racially or religiously aggravated common assault. They admitted the offences but were later dealt with out of court by way of a deferred youth caution following a referral to the youth justice panel for an out-of-court disposal. The process aims to divert young people away from the criminal justice system where possible, the Crown Prosecution Service said. Ms Haigh, who was friends with Mr Kohli for more than 20 years, told the BBC she called police when she saw the two boys involved in the August assault pick up the boulder from outside her neighbour's house and throw it at the man. She said she was aware of similar attacks by young people happening last summer in Braunstone Town and told police it needed to be \"nipped in the bud\". \"I don't think it was taken serious enough,\" she said. \"I think they should have acted on it. I feel that we've been totally let down.\" Ch Supt Starbuck said: \"We continue to monitor the area of Franklin Park and have engaged with the community through a local survey, drop-in centres, engagement with local schools, youth work and proactive policing patrols.\" Follow BBC Leicester onFacebook, onX, or onInstagram.

    "title": "Chancellor to announce £15bn for transport projects",
    "article_text": "Billions of pounds of investment in transport infrastructure in England are set to be announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves on Wednesday. The money will be spent on tram, train and bus projects in mayoral authorities across the Midlands, the North and the West Country. The move comes before the government's spending review next week, which will determine how much money each Whitehall department gets over the next three to four years. Reeves has been under pressure from Labour MPs to spend money following criticism of relentless economic gloom, particularly around disability and benefit cuts, as the chancellor tries to stick to her fiscal rules in difficult circumstances. Trams form the backbone of the investment plans, with Greater Manchester getting £2.5bn to extend its network to Stockport and add stops in Bury, Manchester and Oldham, and the West Midlands getting £2.4bn to extend services from Birmingham city centre to the new sports quarter. There will also be £2.1bn to start building the West Yorkshire Mass Transit programme by 2028, and build new bus stations in Bradford and Wakefield. Six more metro mayors will receive transport investments: The transport investment marks Reeves' first open move away from the stringent rules in the Treasury'sGreen Book, which is used by officials to calculate the value for money of major projects. The book has been criticised for favouring London and the south-east. Labour MP Jeevun Sandher, a member of Westminster's Treasury Committee, complained of its \"hardwired London bias\" in April. In a speech in Manchester later today, the chancellor is expected to say that sticking to book's rules has meant \"growth created in too few places, felt by too few people and wide gaps between regions, and between our cities and towns\". Changing the rules will also mean more money for areas of the North and Midlands, including the so-called \"Red Wall\", where Labour MPs face an electoral challenge from Reform UK. Reeves is not the first chancellor to review the rules; Rishi Sunak also reviewed the book as part of the Conservatives' Levelling up agenda. Sunak had also announced some of these same projects, including the development of a mass transit network in West Yorkshire, in his Network North plan, intended to compensate for the decision to scrap the HS2 line north of Birmingham. Labour reviewed these projects when they came to power in July, arguing they had not been fully funded. Reeves' £15.6bn regional transport announcements are part of a five-year funding allocation from 2027/28 to 2031/32, which a Treasury spokesman confirmed would double the current £1.14bn spending allocation for 2024-25 to £2.9bn by 2029-30. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the announcement \"marks a watershed moment on our journey to improving transport across the North and Midlands - opening up access to jobs, growing the economy and driving up quality of life\". However, Liberal Democrat treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper warned the chancellor must now deliver, because \"these communities have heard these same promises before, only to be left with phantom transport networks\". \"We must not see people led up the garden path once again,\" she said. \"Extra investment in public transport must also focus on cutting fares for hard-pressed families being clobbered by a cost of living crisis.\" Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "title": "PM warned more funding needed to halve crime against women",
    "article_text": "The prime minister has been warned he will fail to meet his own target of halving violence against women and girls without significant investment in services, according to two senior government watchdogs. This is the first time Domestic Abuse Commissioner for England and Wales Dame Nicole Jacobs and Victims Commissioner for England and Wales Baroness Newlove have written jointly to Sir Keir Starmer. The pair said victim support services were being \"pushed to the brink\" by funding cuts and rising costs. The intervention comes ahead of the chancellor's spending review later this month, which is expected to feature cuts to some areas of public spending. In a further headache for ministers, the country's most senior police chiefs have also warned Sir Keir Starmer they will face \"stark choices\" about which crimes to investigate if their budgets are cut as expected. The BBC understands that the Home Office, which is responsible for both victims and police forces, is still in negotiations with the Treasury over how funds will be allocated in the spending review. In the letter seen by the BBC, the commissioners told Sir Keir that the spending review was a chance to define the government's legacy for victims and survivors. The pair said they welcomed the prime minister's \"personal commitment tohalving violence against women and girlswithin a decade\" but said \"funding cuts and scaled back ambition are leading to piecemeal policies\". They added that with \"bold and ambitious investment, we can finally tackle the systemic stain of violence and abuse\" and said the \"cost of inaction is one this country can no longer afford\". As first reported in The Times, Metropolitan Police chief Sir Mark Rowley is also among those cautioning Sir Keir against cuts in next week's spending review, saying they will herald a return to frontline police numbers last seen under austerity. Going over the heads of Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Chancellor Rachel Reeves is reportedly seen as a \"last-ditch ploy\" by the police chiefs, who say negotiations between the Home Office and the Treasury have been going \"poorly\". Sir Mark, the head of the National Police Chiefs' Council Gavin Stephens, and the head of the National Crime Agency (NCA) Graeme Biggar made a direct appeal to the PM around the \"far-reaching consequences\" of decisions. \"We understand that the Treasury [is] seeking to finalise departmental budget allocations this week and that the negotiations between the Home Office and the Treasury are going poorly,\" they wrote. \"We are deeply concerned that the settlement for policing and the [NCA], without additional investment, risks a retrenchment to what we saw under austerity. This would have far-reaching consequences.\" The Conservative government's austerity policies saw police numbers fall by 45,000 between 2010 and 2016, with Office for National Statistics figures from 2016 showing violence against the person offences rose by 24% in the previous 12 months. The police chiefs' letter sets out how government funding \"has not kept pace with demand\", which has left \"very limited room for manoeuvre\" within police services. \"A settlement that fails to address our inflation and pay pressures flat would entail stark choices about which crimes we no longer prioritise,\" they add. \"The policing and NCA workforce would also shrink each year.\" Last week, The Times disclosed that police chiefs and MI5 had warned the government that theearly release scheme represented a threat to public safety. Rowley was one of six police chiefs who publicly warned that promises on crime would be broken without more money from the Treasury. Money will be spent on tram, train and bus projects in England across the Midlands, North and West Country. MI5 apologises for false evidence but says contempt of court proceedings would not be “appropriate”. The barrister, who is also a former police commissioner, is tasked with reforming the embattled commission. Judge's concerns came ahead of High Court hearing to decide next steps about false evidence. With the NHS and defence getting more funding, cuts to other areas are inevitable, the influential think tank says.",

    "article_text": "Sir Richard Knighton has been chosen as the next Chief of the Defence Staff, the UK's most senior military officer role, the BBC understands. Sir Richard is set to replace Admiral Sir Tony Radakin who has been in the role since November 2021. He will be expected to oversee major reforms as the government bolsters the UK's defence capability. An official announcement is expected in the coming days, once the decision has made its way through Royal procedure. Sir Richard has been Chief of the Air Staff, the professional head of the Royal Air Force, since June 2023. The change in leadership comes asthe government has pledged to increase defence spendingfrom 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027. It has then set a goal of increasing that to 3% by 2034. On Monday, the government outlined itsdefence strategyfor the next decade. Defence Secretary John Healey told MPs billions of pounds would be invested to move the UK to \"war-fighting readiness\" in the face of a new era of threats from nuclear powers like Russia and China. Sir Richard is known for having a particular focus on military capability. According to a biographyon the government website, he joined the RAF in 1989 as a university cadet, and served as deputy chief of the defence staff from 2019 to 2022. Regarding the appointment, the Ministry of Defence said: \"This is speculation. The appointment process is ongoing and any announcement will be made in the usual way.\" Sir Keir Starmer is under pressure to raise defence spending above the UK's target of 3% of GDP by 2034. Defence minister Luke Pollard says the region has the expertise to benefit. Dame Caroline Dinenage speaks in House of Commons about fears for HMS Sultan and HMS Collingwood. The review was asked to keep to a target of spending 2.5% of GDP on defence. It's clear more will be needed for full implementation. Sir Keir Starmer has announced the findings of a \"root and branch\" review of the UK's defence capabilities",

    "title": "Author Bernardine Evaristo 'astonished' to receive one-off £100k prize",
    "article_text": "Trailblazing author Bernardine Evaristo has said she is \"astonished\" to have been honoured with a one-off outstanding contribution award to mark the 30th anniversary of the Women's Prize for Fiction. Evaristo, who was the first black woman to win the prestigious Booker Prize when the award was shared with Margaret Atwood in 2019, told the BBC: \"This [prize] wasn't on anyone's radar... I feel very blessed.\" The accolade is in honour of her career's work - which includes her Booker-winning novel Girl, Woman, Other - and her long-running advocacy for inclusion and diversity in the arts. Evaristo will receive £100,000 prize money and a sculpture. Both will be presented on 12 June at a ceremony in London, where the winners of the 2025 Women's Prizes for Fiction and Non-Fiction will also be announced. Evaristo said she would put the prize money into a project to support other women writers, and will give more details in the autumn. \"I'm not doing it because I'm a multi-millionaire,\" she joked. \"It just feels right to put back in. We should support each other.\" The writer said it was \"incredibly validating\" that her advocacy work had been recognised by the Women's Prize body. \"Women's fiction was in a very bad place when it [the Prize charity] began. Every year it's shone a light... and helped to amplify women's voices.\" Evaristo co-founded Britain's first black women's theatre company, Theatre of Black Women, which ran from 1982 to 1988. She also set up the Spread the Word writers' development agency, the Complete Works mentoring scheme for poets of colour, and the Brunel International African Poetry Prize, among other projects. She was made an MBE in 2009 for services to literature. The 66-year-old said she began her activism work in the 1980s \"simply because there was a need for it\". \"At that time, it's not something I saw as separate to my creativity. I did it because I knew I wanted to take responsibility, to be the change I wanted to see. I did it because it needed to be done.\" It's important not to rest on your laurels because \"if we don't keep up momentum, the status quo might close in on itself again\", she said. \"It's not something where we can say 'We've achieved this, we can drop it'.\" She said there was a current \"backlash against freedoms women had earned over a century\". \"There is always the risk of a backlash.\" She wouldn't be drawn on her next writing project because \"it's not wise to announce things prematurely\", but she said she still has time to juggle both her writing and her activism work. \"I've been here a long time... I've had a long time to get things done! My main focus is my writing. I'm a writer who has to juggle lots of things... to create tensions. That's how I work. \"I'm good at compartmentalising. But I do work all the time. My husband and I have been together 18 years and we went on our first holiday three years ago!\" But she said that's because \"I enjoy what I do\". \"I work weekends, there's no distinction between weekdays and the weekend. I don't need to drag myself away from what I do. It's positive energy.\" The Women's Prize Trust says it aims to celebrate and amplify women's voices; open up writing as a viable career for women from all backgrounds; and promote original work. The judging panel for the contribution award included critic and writer Bonnie Greer, broadcaster Vick Hope, and author Kate Mosse. Mosse said in statement: \"Bernardine Evaristo's beautiful, ambitious and inventive body of work, her dazzling skill and imagination, and her courage to take risks and offer readers a pathway into diverse and multifarious worlds over a 40-year career, made her the ideal recipient. \"Significantly, Evaristo has consistently used her own magnificent achievements and exceptional talent as a springboard to create opportunities for others, to promote unheard and under-heard women's voices and to ensure that every female writer feels she has a conduit for her talent.\" Evaristo was born the fourth of eight children in Woolwich, south east London, to an English mother and a Nigerian father. Her father was a welder and local Labour councillor; her mother was a teacher. She spent her teenage years at Greenwich Young People's Theatre and went on to study at Goldsmiths, University of London, where she earned her PhD in creative writing. She is currently president of the Royal Society of Literature (RSL) and a professor of creative writing at Brunel University, London. Her other creative works include her 2013 novel Mr Loverman, about an elderly man whose marriage falls apart after his long-term affair with his male friend. It was adapted for a BBC drama series starring Lennie James, and recently picked up two major acting prizes at the Bafta TV Awards. Evaristo's other books include satirical novel Blonde Roots and a memoir, Manifesto: On Never Giving Up. Former US President Bill Clinton and best-selling author James Patterson sat down with the BBC to discuss how real life informed their new political thriller, The First Gentleman. Eight authors are attending talks at East Riding libraries as part of National Crime Reading Month. The popular author tells the Hay Festival she would be wary of writing about Beaker in later life. Zadie Smith and Ian McEwan are among 380 writers and groups to call the war a \"genocide\". The actress and writer gets the drama gong at the festival where she is speaking about her novel.",

    "title": "Boulder attack renews safety concerns for US Jewish communities",
    "article_text": "On Sunday, a group gathered in Boulder, Colorado, to raise awareness for hostages held in Gaza was attacked, leaving 12 people injured. The suspect, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, accused of throwingincendiary devicesat them, allegedly planned the attack for a year, and told police he wanted to \"kill all Zionist people,\" according to court documents. It was the latest in a string of attacks against Jewish people and institutions,  ratcheting up anxiety among those in North America's Jewish community who see these incidents as signs of growing antisemitism in the US. The Boulder attack occurred just weeks after a suspect shot andkilled a couple outside the Capitol Jewish Museum in Washington, DC.They were later identified as employees of the Israeli embassy who had been attending an event at the museum. In April, theofficial residence of Pennsylvania governorJosh Shapiro was set on fire,just hours after the Jewish lawmaker celebrated the first night of Passover. \"Jews are feeling the impact and are more afraid than they were two weeks ago, or that fears that existed in some communities a few weeks ago are more heightened,\" said Adina Vogel Ayalon of J Street, a pro-Israel advocacy group that's critical of the war and has called for a ceasefire in Gaza. \"These types of hate crimes are not distinguishing between where you fall on the political spectrum about the war\" between Israel and Hamas, Ms Ayalon said. \"And that is something very unsettling.\" Israel has faced sustained international criticism over its military actions in Gaza, which it undertook after Hamas attacked the country on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 251 hostages. Over50,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The statistics do not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters, and the BBC and other international media organisations are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza to verify. But a United Nations report that assessed Gazan deaths during a six-month period  foundnearly 70% of verified victims were women and children. Throughout the conflict, human rights experts have raised the alarm of widespread hunger, disease, and displacement within Gaza. The war also has become a divisive political issue in the US. Pro-Palestinian protests across university campuses and in major cities have ignited greater debates over education and free speech. There arereligious, generational, and partisan divides within the American Jewish communityabout support for Israel and the question of Palestinian statehood. But the attacks in Boulder and Washington DC, struck a broader nerve because they crossed a \"clear red line between legitimate free speech and political violence,\" Ms Ayalon said. Boulder's attack has drawn condemnation outside the Jewish community. \"Acts of antisemitism have no place in our society,\" the Muslim Public Affairs Council condemned the Boulder attack in a statement. \"This violent assault is not only an attack on a specific community but a direct threat to the values of pluralism, dignity, and safety for all people of faith. As Muslims, our faith calls us to speak out against injustice and to uphold the sanctity of every human life.\" The group targeted in Boulder, Run For Their Lives, holds weekly meetings and marches across the country to call for the release of the remaining hostages taken to Gaza. \"The premise of the group is to peacefully raise awareness of the hostages. We're apolitical, we're not protesting anything,\" said global coordinator Shira Weiss. Many of the group's members are Jewish and support Israel, but those are not requirements for participation. \"We get people from all walks of life - who vote Republican, Independent, Democrat, who support the Israeli government, or don't support the Israeli government,\" Ms Weiss said. Safety has always been a top priority for group chapters, she said, but they \"never thought such a violent attack would happen.\" Jewish communities and institutions across the US have long required security, but many bolstered their defences after a shooter espousing right-wing antisemitic conspiracy theoriesmurdered 11 worshippers at a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania synagogue in 2018.The following April, another shooterattacked a synagogue in Poway, California,killing one person and injuring three others. Those conversations are again happening in the wake of the Boulder incident. \"The attacks, especially given the succession of attacks in a short period of time have made every Jewish American question their security, whether it's their personal security or the security of Jewish institutions that they visit,\" said Haliey Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America. \"There's a sense that what has occurred in DC and Boulder could have happened anywhere, could have happened to anyone.\" The Jewish Colorado organisation announced a fundraiser to support increased security for Boulder's Jewish community, as well as financial and trauma support for victims of the attack. Its goal is $160,000. Rabbi Dan Moskovitz of Temple Sholom in Vancouver, Canada frequently joins Run For Their Lives events and plans to continue advocating for the hostages in Gaza. But he worries the Boulder attack would not be an isolated incident. \"It's only going to inflame more radicalisation,\" he said. \"It's only going to inspire more people to do those things.\" The Navy is also considering renaming ships named after Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Harriet Tubman. Demetric Deshawn Scott sent the letters to prevent a man from testifying against him in a robbery case, officials say. Israel said the attack came after two projectiles were fired into Israel from Syria. Billionaire says the bill, which faces a key test in the Senate, undercuts efforts to slash federal spending. Aid distribution will be halted on Wednesday, with Gazans warned by the IDF not to travel to collection points.",

    "title": "South Korea's new president has a Trump-shaped crisis to avert",
    "article_text": "South Korea's new president, Lee Jae-myung, has secured a storming victory, but his honeymoon will barely last the day. The former opposition leader is not getting to enjoy the two-month transition period usually afforded to new leaders, so they can build their team and nail down their vision for the country. Instead he is entering office immediately, to fill the hole left by the impeachment of the former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who last December tried and failed to bring the country under martial law. In electing Lee, with almost 50% of the vote , South Koreans have vehemently rejected the military dictatorship that was almost forced upon them. Lee campaigned on the promise that he would strengthen South Korea's democracy and unite the country, after a divisive and tumultuous six months. But that will have to wait. First, he has a Donald Trump shaped crisis to avert. In the coming months, Trump has the power to destabilise South Korea's economy, its security, and its volatile relationship with North Korea. South Koreans were dismayed when Trump slapped 25% tariffs on all Korean imports in April, after already hitting the country with aggressive tariffs on its core industries – steel and cars. They had assumed that being longstanding military allies from the days of the Korean War, and having a free-trade agreement with the US, would spare them. If these tariffs take effect \"they could trigger an economic crisis\", a seasoned advisor to Lee's Democratic Party, Moon Chung-in, said. Before Trump's announcements, South Korea's economy was already slowing down. The martial law chaos constricted it further. Then, in the first quarter of this year, it contracted. Fixing this has been voters' number one demand, even above fixing their beleaguered democracy. But without a president, talks with Trump have been on hold. They cannot be put off any longer. And there is much more than South Korea's economy at stake in these negotiations. The US currently guarantees South Korea's security, by promising to come to its defence with both conventional and nuclear weapons, were it to be attacked by its nuclear-armed neighbour, North Korea. As part of this deal there are 28,500 US troops stationed in the country. Yet Trump has made clear he does not plan to differentiate between trade and security when negotiating with South Korea, signalling that Seoul is not pulling its weight in either area. In a post on his Truth Social platform in April, Trump said that during initial tariff talks with South Korea he had \"discussed payment for the big time military protection we provide\", calling it \"beautiful and efficient one-stop shopping\". This approach makes Seoul uniquely vulnerable. Evans Revere, a former senior US diplomat based in Seoul, fears a crisis is coming. \"For the first time in our lifetime we have a US president who does not feel a moral and strategic obligation towards Korea\". In his first term as president, Trump questioned the value of having US forces stationed in Korea and threatened to withdraw them unless Seoul paid more to have them. It seems likely he will demand more money this time around. Seoul may not want to pay more, but it can afford to. A bigger problem is that Trump's calculations, and that of his defence department, seem to have changed. This is no longer just about the money. Washington's top priority now in Asia is not just stopping North Korea attacking the South, it is also to contain China's military ambitions in the region and against Taiwan. Last year, a now senior US defence official, Elbridge Colby, said that South Korea was going to have to take \"overwhelming responsibility for its own self-defence against North Korea\", so the US could be ready to fight China. One option is that the troops stationed here would switch their focus to constraining China. Another,touted by a couple of US defence officials last month, is that thousands of soldiers would be removed from the peninsula altogether and redeployed, and that Seoul's military would also have to play a role in deterring Beijing. Not only could this put South Korea in a dangerous military predicament, but it would also create a diplomatically difficult one. President Lee, who historically has been sceptical of Korea's alliance with the US, wants to use his presidency to improve relations with China, South Korea's powerful neighbour and trading partner. He has stated several times that South Korea should stay out of a conflict between China and Taiwan. \"We must keep our distance from a China-Taiwan contingency. We can get along with both\", he said during a televised debate last month. The political advisor Mr Moon, who once served as national security advisor, reiterated Lee's concerns. \"We are worried about America abandoning us, but at the same time we are worried about being entrapped in American strategy to contain and encircle China\", he said. \"If the US threatens us, we can let [the forces] go\", he said. For Mr Revere, the former US diplomat, this combination of Lee, Trump and China threatens to create \"the perfect storm\". \"The two leaders may find themselves on very different pages and that could be a recipe for a problematic relationship. If this plays out, it would undermine peace and stability in North East Asia\". In Pyongyang, Kim Jong Un will no doubt be watching closely, keen to exploit the shifting ground. His nuclear weapons programme is more dangerous than ever, and nothing or no-one has been able to convince him to wind it down - including Donald Trump who, during his first term, was the first US president to ever meet a North Korean leader. Since returning to office Trump has indicated he would like to resume talks with Kim, which ended without agreement in 2019. In Seoul, there is real concern that this time the pair could strike a deal that is very bad for South Korea. The fear is that Trump would take an \"America first\" approach, and ask Kim to stop producing his intercontinental ballistic missiles that threaten the US mainland, without addressing the multiple short-range nuclear weapons pointed at Seoul. And in return, Kim could demand a high price. Kim has far more leverage than he did in 2019. He has more nuclear warheads, his weapons are more advanced, and the sanctions that were supposed to put pressure on his regime have all but collapsed, thanks largely to Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader is providing Kim with economic and military support in return for North Korea's help fighting the war in Ukraine. This therefore gives Kim the cover to make more audacious requests of the US. He could ask Trump to accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, and agree to a deal that would reduce Pyongyang's weapons count rather than get rid of them altogether. Another of his requests could likely be for the US to remove some the security it provides South Korea, including the troops. \"North Korea is in the driver's seat now. The only curveball is how much risk President Trump will take\", said Sydney Seiler, who was involved in the 2019 negotiations on the US side. \"The idea there might be some sort of troop withdrawal [included in a deal] is really not that far-fetched\". Mr Seiler stressed that the US would \"not leave South Korea in the dust,\" but advised South Korea's new president to \"establish a relationship with Trump early on\", and be clear they expect to be part of any process, if talks materialise. The new president must move quickly on all fronts, added Mr Revere, arguing that Lee's first homework assignment should be to come up with a list of 10 reasons why South Korea is an indispensable partner and why American dollars are being well spent; reasons that can convince a sceptical and transactional Trump. One Ace card South Korea is hoping to play is its shipbuilding prowess. It builds more vessels than any other country bar China, which is now the world's dominant ship builder and home to the largest naval fleet. This is a frightening prospect for the US whose own industry and navy are in decline. Last month I visited South Korea's flagship shipyard in Ulsan on the south coast - the largest in the world – where Hyundai Heavy Industries builds 40-50 new ships a year, including naval destroyers. Sturdy cranes slotted together sheets of metal, creating vessels the size of small villages. Seoul is hoping it can use this expertise to build, repair and maintain warships for the US, and in the process convince Washington it is a valuable partner. \"US shipbuilding difficulties are affecting their national security\", said Jeong Woo Maan, head of strategy for Hyundai's naval and ship unit. \"This is one of the strongest cards we have to negotiate with\". In his campaign for president, Lee Jae-myung declared he did not want to rush into any agreements with Trump. Now in office, he could quickly find himself without this luxury. Opposition's Lee Jae-myung will become South Korea's next president, winning the country's first election since impeachment chaos. The vote comes after the impeachment and removal of former president Yoon Suk Yeol. South Korea is voting for a new leader after the former president was impeached for imposing martial law. The snap election follows the impeachment of former president Yoon for declaring martial law. A snap presidential election has exposed South Korea's stark gender divide.",

    "title": "Extreme weather weighs on Australian economy as growth slows to 0.2%",
    "article_text": "Extreme weather and ebbing government support have dragged on the economy in early 2025, with growth of just 0.2% in the first three months to March compared to 0.6% in the previous quarter. The disappointing result left annual real GDP growth at 1.3%, as the end of state energy subsidies and a slowdown in public infrastructure work was not offset by a hoped-for lift in business investment. Cyclone Alfred, the first cyclone to hit south-east Queensland in 50 years, and the associated flooding,weighed on economic activity, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. The new figures also showed economic growth is once again falling behind population growth, pointing to a return to the fall in living standards that has bedevilled the country over recent years. GDP per person fell 0.2% in the three months to March, after a short-lived 0.1% rise in the December quarter, the figures showed. After propping up the economy over the past two years, public spending recorded the largest drag on growth since the September quarter of 2017, the ABS said. Treasury has estimatedthat natural disasters through the first half of 2025 will deliver a $2.2bn blow to the economy, concentrated in the first quarter of the year. Despite the grim economic update, Treasurer Jim Chalmers struck an upbeat tone, saying he remained “quite optimistic about the future of our economy”. “With all of the uncertainty in the world, any growth is a decent outcome,” Chalmers said, adding that the expected boost from the twointerest rate cutsin February and May were yet to be reflected in the data. “TheAustralian economyremains one of the strongest in the world,” Chalmers said. “There are some temporary factors in this quarterly outcome. There’s natural disasters in here, not just [Cyclone] Alfred, but the flooding in Townsville and Cairns and surrounding communities earlier in the year. “The fall in public demand [is] because some of the big state projects came off. So we shouldn’t overinterpret that March data. But growth is softer than we would like it to be, and I’m confident that growth will accelerate in our economy.” The weaker than expected growth figures increased the chance of another interest rate cut at the next Reserve Bank monetary policy board meeting on 8 July from 60% to 80%, according to financial markets. EY’s chief economist, Cherelle Murphy, said there was “nothing to be happy about” in the latest national accounts. “Some of the weakness can be blamed on temporary weather events interrupting export growth and hurting tourism and localised spending, but more worrying is the malaise that has set in across the business sector and amongst households,” Murphy said. “Productivity growth was flat in the quarter and down over the year, with no evidence that Australia is making any progress in shifting the problem which worsened in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. The figures also showed while Australians were forced to pay up for essentials – not least higher power bills as state subsidies rolled off amid a hot end to the summer – they were keener to save than spend what was leftover, despite incomes rising incomes. This was reflected in the household savings rate jumping from 3.9% in December to 5.2% in March, its highest in two-and-a-half years – and a sign of growing consumer caution that will drag on growth if it continues through 2025. NAB’s head of Australian economics, Gareth Spence, said the “soggy” start was likely to extend to another year of below trend growth of under 2%, and that the RBA would cut rates in July, August and November.",

NT Police say coronial investigation into death on hold while criminal investigations under way TheNorthern Territory Police Forcehave released an update on the death ofKumanjayi Whitewho died in police custody in Alice Springs, saying the coronial investigation will be on hold while criminal investigations are under way. In a statement, NT Police said the coronial investigation has been “paused” while the criminal investigation into the man’s death is ongoing to determine whether “any criminality was involved” after consulting with the NT Coroner. They said that the coroner will be given regular updates by the NT police as the criminal investigation progresses. In the statement, authorities say that the cause of the man’s death remains undetermined and an independent examination of the autopsy findings is being conducted. They say that any footage or CCTV will not be made public before the investigation completes. TheCentral Land Councilis urging the federal government to withhold funding from the Northern Territory government until it sets up an independent police conduct commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death in custody ofKumanjayi Whitelast week. The Warlpiri man, from the remote community of Yuendumu, died after being restrained by plain-clothed police officers in a Coles supermarket last week. The 24-year-old lived with disabilities and was reportedly subject to a guardianship order. The CLC is also calling for any independent inquiry to be led by the NT coroner and be finalised within 12 months. The Central Land Council chairman, Warren Williams, who is the uncle of the man, said in a statement that the territory lacks an independent authority to investigate any alleged police misconduct. Williams said: Unlike most jurisdictions, the NT lacks a body to investigate police misconduct and has failed to overhaul the culture of its police force. Williams said the community lacked trust in the appropriateness of the NT police to lead the inquiry. Members of the NT police force have been at the centre of alleged racist conduct during the long-running coronial inquest into Kumanjai Walker, who died in police custody, also from Yuendumu. Williams went on: But let me be clear, only money will force the NT government to act. Our lives are worth less than a chocolate bar to those in power and money is the only language they understand. We don’t trust this government and its police force to keep us safe. NT police talk of reform and anti-racism strategies is just that, talk. It’s time for the federal government to hold the NT accountable and force the change we so desperately need.

Final resting place of James Cook’s Endeavour confirmed by National Maritime Museum More than two-and-a-half centuries after CaptJames Cookarrived in Australia on the HM Bark Endeavour, the Australian National Maritime Museum has published its final report on the ship’s resting place. The museum published a preliminary report in 2022 that a wreck in Newport Harbor, Rhode Island was the Lord Sandwich, which was previously known as the Endeavour. The museum was confident of its identification but there wassome transatlantic pushbackand the museum continued its research for three more years. On Wednesday, the museum’s director, Daryl Karp, said it stood by its 2022 conclusions – the culmination of 25 years of research.

The body ofLuke Jon Telega,45, was discovered by a garbage contractor about 9am on Monday, behind a hairdresser and Salvation Army store in Bellerive, Hobart. Telega was last seen alive at 10pm on Saturday, but police said there was a significant gap in the timeline leading up to the discovery of his body. Police have identified two people of interest, including a woman seen on CCTV standing outside a shopfront in the area at 7.50pm on Sunday. She may have spoken with someone on the street at the time and was seen driving what is believed to be a light-coloured Toyota Prado. Police have identified another woman, who was seen on the footage at 8.05pm on Sunday. She was driving a red SUV. More from Chalmers on the tobacco excise: not ‘convinced’ cut would end illegal sales TreasurerJim Chalmerssaid earlier Labor won’t cut or freeze tobacco excise, despite calls from the New South Wales premier for action from the federal government. Chris Minnssays the huge surge in illegal tobacco sales across his state shows the federal excise is pushing smokers to illegal options, and driving down revenue for the federal government. Other states are dealing with crime related to illegal tobacco sales and some health experts believe recent increases in the excise levels are not driving down smoking rates in Australia. I’m not convinced that cutting the excise on cigarettes would mean that that would be the end of illegal activity. He also confirmed a freeze was not under consideration. Queensland police say a man, 34, is in custody as part of the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of missing teen Pheobe Bishop. Police said the man is assisting with enquires. No charges have been laid or allegations made against him. Bishop has been missing since 15 May. She was last seen near Bundaberg airport, where she was meant to board a flight to Western Australia. Officials say she never made it inside the airport. Greg Jericho breaks down Labor’s super tax plan The Albanese government wants to reduce the tax breaks for those with more than $3m in superannuation. And while sections of the media are highly critical of the changes, others say the proposal does little to address intergenerational inequality in the tax system. ColumnistGreg Jericho speaks toReged Ahmadabout why the media debate over a smaller tax break for Australia’s wealthiest 0.5% is divorced from reality. Health minister also throws water on Minns’ call to lower tobacco tax The health minister has quashed the NSW premierChris Minns’suggestion the federal government consider lowering the tobacco excise because it may be contributing to the rise of illegal tobacco across the country. Mark Butlersaid: I want to be very clear, since the increase in tobacco excise started a little more than a decade ago, 1 million fewer Australians are smoking. That is having a profound impact, not just on their health most importantly, but also on the health system itself. It’s quite clear from evidence all around the world that in the toolbox of tobacco control, lifting the price of cigarettes is the most effective tool. Government data at the end of last year showed thatas a result of smoking rates declining, obesity last year overtook tobacco smoking as the leading risk factor contributing to disease in 2024. Butler said: I also make the point that a number of other countries, most countries that have lower-priced cigarettes than Australia, also have burgeoning illicit or black-market cigarette markets. This is just the nature of organised crime around the world. They recognise illicit cigarettes as a low-risk, high-reward way in which to make money, to bankroll all of their other criminal activities. … We can’t raise the white flag on big tobacco and organised crime. Nicolette Boeleis close to being declared the winner for Bradfield, 27 votes ahead of LiberalGisele Kapterianaccording to the latest updated count by the Australian Electoral Commission. But we’ll have to wait a couple more hours before the AEC formally makes the call, as their state manager for NSW reviews a few final challenged ballot papers. But those few remaining ballots to be confirmed are unlikely to change the result. Multiple outlets have declared the count for Boele. It’s been one of the tightest seat contests in history, and the candidates were tied at one point while the counts were taking place. Chalmers defends super tax changes, will make system ‘fairer’ TreasurerJim Chalmerssaid earlier that Labor had spent years open to comment on the proposed changes to taxes on large superannuation balances north of $3m, but no one had come forward with a better plan. He said during a press conference: We said to people, if there is a better, fairer way of making this calculation, tell us about it. … We provided years of opportunities for people to suggest different ways of liability and nobody has come up with one. More from Chris Minns on the tobacco excise NSW will raise cutting the tobacco excise to deter illegal tobacco sales at the next health ministers’ meeting later this month, the premier,Chris Minns,said on Kiis FM this morning. He said: Look, it’s probably not a popular thing for a premier to say, because there’s been a tax on cigarettes and excise on cigarettes for decades, and I understand that. But they’ve been radically increased since 2019 so a packet in 2020 had a $16 tax on it. Today it’s $28. Minns said that the high taxes were causing ordinary citizens, who would never usually break the law, to buy illegal tobacco: They wouldn’t break the law in a million years, but they’re being dragged into a black market where they go to the store, they can either buy a $17 or $20 packet of illegal cigarettes or a $60 packet of cigarettes. He also said that tobacco shops, often associated with organised crime, were driving out legitimate businesses like bread shops from shopping strips because of the higher rent they could afford to pay. I mean, every tax and every tax change starts with an idea. Every single one of them, someone’s saying, “Look, I don’t think this is working. We need to change and so we might as well get the ball rolling here.” Multiple media outlets have declaredNicolette Boelethe winner of the NSW seat of Bradfield after a recount, defeating Liberal challengerGisele Kapterian. The ABC declared Boele the winner, saying even though the margin is just 27 votes, only a “very small number” of ballot papers are awaiting final adjudication. AAP has also called Bradfield for Boele, as have the Sydney Morning Herald and Sky News. Chalmers says government won’t cut tobacco taxes despite call from Chris Minns Chalmerswas asked about a recent call from the NSW premier,Chris Minns,tolower the tobacco excisein an attempt to undercut the sale of illegal cigarettes and other products. Chalmers said he wouldn’t move to make cigarettes “cheaper for people”: We’ve seen tax revenue for cigarettes come down for two reasons … fewer people smoking, the bad reason is we know that we’ve got a challenge when it comes to illegal tobacco. … I respectfully disagree with Chris. … I don’t think the answer here is to make cigarettes cheaper for people.",

    "title": "Australia mushroom trial live: Erin Patterson tells court she felt ‘scared, responsible’ after husband asked if she poisoned his parents using dehydrator",
    "article_text": "Victorian woman, 50, has pleaded not guilty to three charges of murder and one of attempted murder over a fatal 2023 beef wellington lunch. Follow live Erin Patterson explains health lies, food issues and how she made mushroom lunch as murder trial continues Who are Erin Patterson and the other key figures in Australia’s mushroom trial? The court is shown text messages between Patterson andSally Ann Atkinson, who was involved in the Department of Health’s investigation into the deadly lunch. Patterson says Atkinson’s messages and questions about the ingredients in the lunch made her feel “very anxious”. In the messages, Atkinson asks Patterson to provide a description of what the package containing the dried mushrooms looked like. She says by the Tuesday after the lunch she started to think that “perhaps they [foraged mushrooms] were in there too”. Erin Patterson says she felt ‘frantic’ and ‘scared’ she would be blamed before dumping dehydrator at tip Patterson says when she was discharged from hospital and returned home, she felt “frantic”. “Child protection was coming to my house that afternoon, and I was scared of the conversation that might flow about the meal and the dehydrator,” she says. Patterson says she worried she would be blamed and went to dump the dehydrator at a local tip. The jury has previously been shown CCTV footage of Patterson dumping the dehydrator at the Koonwarra Transfer Station And Landfill on 2 August 2023 – four days after the lunch. Patterson recalls discussions she had with Simon while she was at Monash medical centre. The court previously heard that while in hospital, Patterson told him she conducted a blind taste test with muffins cooked using dehydrated mushrooms. Patterson says Simon later asked: “He said to me, ‘Is that how you poisoned my parents … using that dehydrator?’” Mandy asks what her response was. “I said, of course not,” Patterson says, her voice trembling. Patterson says the comment by Simon caused her to “reflect a lot on what might have happened”. “It got me thinking about all the times I had used it [the dehydrator] … and how I had dried foraging mushrooms in it weeks earlier, and I was starting to think what if they had gone in the container with the Chinese mushrooms. What if that happened?”“I was thinking maybe that’s how this all …,”Patterson says as her voice trails off. Mandy asks how this made her feel. “Scared, responsible,” she says. She says she felt “really worried” because child protection was involved. “Simon seemed to be of the mind that this was intentional … I just got really scared.” Erin Patterson says she asked doctor why ‘people think that it’s death cap mushrooms’ Patterson recalls wanting to pick up her children from the hospital when staff mentioned they needed to be tested. “I was their mother and they’re my children and I wanted to be responsible for them,” she says The court previously heard Simon picked up the couple’s children and drove them to Monash medical centre. Patterson says she told Simon that she wanted her children to be at the same hospital where she would be transferred. Patterson says in a discussion with a doctor, she asked, “Why do people think that it’s death cap mushrooms?” She says she was administered fluid saline and NAC – a liver function medication – at Leongatha hospital. On route to Monash medical centre in an ambulance, Patterson says she was given anti-nausea medication and fentanyl for a headache. She says the fentanyl made her feel “loopy” but helped the pain. Erin Patterson says she told police leftovers were in a bin but she couldn’t remember which one Mandy asks Patterson about a phone conversation with police, facilitated by Webster, about where the leftovers from the meal were. She says she spoke directly to police at one point and told them the gate code to the property. She said she told police the beef wellington leftovers were in a bin, but could not remember if it was an outside bin or a kitchen bin. Patterson says Simon’s brother, Matthew, called her that morning and said someone from toxicology wanted to know where the mushrooms in the meal were sourced from. “I told him they came from Woolies and the grocer, the Asian grocer,” she says. Patterson says she may have mentioned Oakleigh as a suburb where the grocer was.She says she was trying to convey that she didn’t remember but was mentioning “possible places” where she shopped. Erin Patterson agrees she told hospital she would return in 20-30 minutesand that records indicate she took longer Mandy takes Patterson to when she left Leongatha hospital and went home. Patterson agrees she told medical staff she would return in 20-30 minutes and that her medical records indicate she returned after about an hour and a half. She recalls some of what she did: “I lay down for a little bit. I went to the toilet a couple of times.” Patterson says she did not leave the house during this time. She says she brought a phone charger, a toothbrush and toothpaste to the hospital, and staff told her she needed to be transferred to Melbourne. Recalling the urgent care area, Patterson says she got into the bed in the cubicle and waited to be assessed. She says the topic of her children and whether they had eaten the beef wellington came up in the conversation with Webster. “I would have told him not on the Saturday but on the Sunday they had the leftovers,” she says. The jury has returned to the court room in Morwell. Guardian Australia’s justice and courts reporter,Nino Bucci,was in court in Morwell this morning and filed this report. The court has adjourned for a lunch break. Patterson’s trial will resume from 2.15pm. Erin Patterson says she tried to argue against being transferred to Melbourne for treatment Mandy asks his client about what occurred next. Patterson says she was told she needed to be transferred to Melbourne for treatment. She says she had a water bottle, bag and a warm jumper with her at the hospital. She recalls trying to explain to medical staff why she could not go straight to Melbourne. She says she needed to make preparations for her daughter’s ballet and secure her pets at her house. Patterson says she could not move her brain away from what she thought “the day was going to look like”. She compares it to trying to “turn a really, really big ship”. Patterson says she lived about 10 mins away from Leongatha hospital and told staff she could return quickly. Erin Patterson says she was ‘shocked and confused’ when told of death cap mushroom fears Patterson was asked about the ingredients used in the beef wellington lunch. Webster expressed concern the lunch contained death cap mushrooms. Patterson says she was “shocked and confused”. “I didn’t see how death cap mushrooms could be in the meal,” she says. Erin Patterson says she told doctor ‘I’ve just got gastro’ at Leongatha hospital Arriving at Leongatha hospital on Monday morning, Patterson recalled telling a staff member she needed to use the toilet. “I waited in the waiting area for someone to come out,” she says. Patterson recalls Dr Chris Webster, who previously testified, opening the doors to the waiting room and apologising for the delay. He told her the urgent care centre had two “critically ill” people. “I told him that’s fine, I’ve just got gastro. It’s not urgent,” she says. Patterson says when she told Webster her name, he said “we’ve been expecting you.” She says this “could be wrong” but is “just what she remembers”. Patterson was then escorted into the urgent care centre. She says she felt “thrown” by Webster knowing who she was.",

    "article_text": "Sulphur-crested cockatoos inSydneyhave worked out how to operate drinking fountains, with footage showing the white birds gripping and turning the handle before leaning in for a sip. Researchers set up camera traps and recorded the birds taking turns at a drinking fountain in western Sydney. Scientists observed more than 500 attempts over 44 days and revealed the birds were successful about 46% of the time. “The behaviour consists of a combination of actions involving both feet, bill and shifting body weight to start the water flow,” theresearchers said in their paper. Dr John Martin, a senior ecologist at Ecosure and co-author of the study, said they stumbled on the complex behaviour at a twist-handle-operated bubbler located in a western Sydney sports field while surveying cockatoo foraging habits. “So they would go and stand on it, and then they would have to grip the handle and actually push it forwards to activate it, and then lean over and have a drink.” Presumably the birds first learned what to do by watching people, Martin said. “Eventually one of them got it, and then the others were like, ‘ah, this is fun’.” The cockatoos learned by watching others and then trying themselves, he said. About 70% of the local population attempted the manoeuvre, according to the research, published inBiology Letters. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Drinking from the public fountain wasn’t just out of necessity, he said, given there was a creek nearby, only 500 metres away. There seemed to be an element of fun, he said. “The flock would come in, and they’d all be foraging and drinking – having a bit of a relax and a bit of a laugh.” The “drinking fountain innovation” – which has persisted at least two years – is the second documented urban adaptation to spread across Sydney’s sulphur-crested cockatoo populations. It followed the“bin-opening innovation”, where cockatoos figured out how to use their beaks and feet to lift rubbish bin lids, abehaviour that soon spreadthroughout Sydney’s southern suburbs. Martin, also a co-author of that study, said birds used socially learned techniques specific to their cultural group. “Birds in one area opened a bin in a certain way, and birds in another geographic area opened a bin in a different way.” Members of the public are encouraged to submit their own observations of sulphur-crested cockatoo innovation via the Big City Birds website and app. Cockatoos, a family of parrots, are known innovators, with dextrous toes that are capable of gripping. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Austrian research onGoffin’s cockatoos, native to Indonesia, has observed birds dunking biscuits in water before eating them, anddipping their food in yoghurtto add flavour. The problem-solving behaviours are examples of rapid, widespread social learning that helps some species better adapt to city environments. Dr Holly Parsons, who manages the urban bird program at BirdLife Australia, said sulphur-crested cockatoos were big, loud and interactive birds and a common sight in Australian cities. “They’re smart, so they’re able to exploit the urban environment to get the resources that they need, and that’s one of the reasons why they’re doing so well living with us.” The species was the fourth most commonly spotted bird nationally in BirdLife Australia’s annualAussie Bird Count. Parsons, who had seen cockatoos flipping bin lids, said she was not surprised they could learn to operate drinking fountains. There were even stories ofpet cockatoosending up in the wild and teaching other birds to speak, she said. “It’s just so fascinating to see how their brains are working and how they are learning from each other.”",

    "article_text": "Independent Nicolette Boelehas won the Sydney seat of Bradfield, defeating Liberal Gisele Kapterian with a wafer-thin margin of just 26 votes. The Australian Electoral Commission said Kapterian won on the initial distribution of preferences by just eight votes, before a recount was ordered. The final result, announced on Wednesday afternoon, showed Boele won following rulings on ballot paper formality. Bradfield was the last outstanding seat from the 3 May election, but the result could still be challenged by the Liberals in the court of disputed returns. “As evidenced in previous elections, it is very common in tight contests and recounts for further rulings to be made on ballot paper formality,” the AEC said in a statement. “During a recount, each individual ballot paper is very closely scrutinised by AEC counting staff with challenges made from candidate-appointed scrutineers for both leading candidates.” At the end of the recount, Boele had 50.01% of the total vote, ahead of Kapterian’s 49.99%. The recount included a new count of all first preference votes previously counted, a re-examination of all informal votes, a complete recount of the two-candidate preferred count and a full distribution of preferences. The AEC said the process was conducted in front of candidate-appointed scrutineers to ensure transparency. Boele was declared the provisional winner on 19 May, after she took a last-minute 40-vote lead over Kapterian. The seat has been held by theLiberal partysince its creation in 1949.

    "title": "Pornhub owner to suspend site in France in protest at new verification law",
    "article_text": "French visitors to the adult sites Pornhub, Youporn and RedTube will on Wednesday be greeted with a message denouncing the country’s age verification requirements, the company said on Tuesday. Parent company Aylo, in reaction to a French law requiring adult sites to take extra steps to verify that their users are 18 or older, will stop operating inFrance, a spokesperson said. “I can confirm that Aylo has made the difficult decision to suspend access to its user-uploaded platforms (Pornhub, YouPorn, RedTube) in France. We will be using our platforms to directly address the French public tomorrow,” a spokesperson for Pornhub said on Tuesday. By showing the message rather than Pornhub’s vast library of adult content, Aylo “is communicating directly with the French people to tell them how dangerous, how potentially privacy-infringing, and how ineffective the French law is”, Solomon Friedman of Aylo’s owner, Ethical Capital Partners, told reporters in a video call on Tuesday. France has this year gradually introduced requirements for all adult websites to have users confirm their age with details like a credit card or ID document. In a bid to preserve privacy, operators must offer a third-party “double-blind” option that would keep the platforms themselves from seeing users’ identifying information. But Aylo says this is an ineffective mechanism that puts people’s data at risk from bad actors, hacks or leaks. They say countries should target developers of operating systems like Microsoft’s Windows, Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android, rather than porn platforms. “Aylo is extremely pro the concept of age verification,” executive Alex Kekesi told reporters in a video call. But requiring individual platforms to confirm visitors’ ages “poses a very serious risk … with respect to your privacy rights”, she added. ECP’s Friedman said: “Google, Apple and Microsoft all have the capability built into their operating system to verify the age of the user at the operating system or device level.” Their ability “to supply an age signal to any site or app … can actually provide a solution” for controlling access to adult content without requiring users to share sensitive data with multiple websites, he argued. “I understand that those three entities are large and they’re powerful, but that is not an excuse for France to do what they have done.” Aylo’s message to would-be porn viewers will be topped with the image of Liberty Leading the People from Eugene Delacroix’s renowned bare-breasted painting of the allegorical figure. Culture minister Aurore Berge wrote on X that it was “so much the better” if Pornhub and other Aylo sites cut off access for French users rather than “conforming to our legal framework”. “There will be less violent, degrading and humiliating content accessible to minors in France,” she added. “If Aylo would rather leave France than apply our laws, they are free to do so,” Clara Chappaz, France’s junior minister for artificial intelligence and digital technology, wrote on X. Arcom has said that 2.3 million minors access porn websites every month even though legally they should be blocked from them. Adult content platforms have come under fire elsewhere in the European Union. EU regulators said last month that several sites, including Pornhub, would be investigated for failing to comply with rules to protect children.",

    "article_text": "Israel hit southern Syria with a series of strikes overnight from Tuesday into Wednesday, saying it had targeted weapons belonging to Syrian authorities after the launch of projectiles towards its territory Israel launched the two attacks after reporting projectiles had been fired fromSyriaon Tuesday. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the two projectiles. A Syrian state news agency and security sources reported a series of Israeli strikes, targeting several sites in the Damascus countryside and Quneitra and Daraa. They came days after an Israeli strikekilled a civiliannear a village in western Syria in the first such attack in nearly a month. Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, had said earlier that he held Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa responsible for the two projectile launches. “We consider the president of Syria directly responsible for any threat and fire toward the State of Israel, and a full response will come soon,” Katz said. The Syrian foreign ministry said in a statement that reports of the launches towards Israel had not been verified yet and reiterated that Syria has not and will not pose a threat to any party in the region, the state news agency Sana reported. “We believe that there are many parties that may seek to destabilise the region to achieve their own interests,” the Syrian foreign ministry said. Syria and Israel have recently engaged in direct talks to ease tensions, a significant development in relations between the two countries that have been on opposite sides of conflict in the Middle East for decades. Several Arab and Palestinian media outlets circulated a claim of responsibility for the projectiles fired on Tuesday to a little-known group, Martyr Muhammad Deif Brigades, an apparent reference to Hamas’ military leader who was killed in an Israeli strike in 2024. Reuters could not independently verify the statement. Syrian state media earlier reported an Israeli strike in the southern Daraa province, an attack the Syrian foreign ministry later said resulted in “significant human and material losses.“ Local residents said Israeli mortars were striking the Wadi Yarmouk area, west of Daraa province, near the border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The area has witnessed increased tensions in recent weeks, including reported Israelimilitary incursions into nearby villages, where residents have reportedly been barred from sowing their crops. Israel has waged a campaign of aerial bombardment that destroyed much of Syria’s military infrastructure. It has occupied the Syrian Golan Heights since 1967 and hastaken more territoryin theaftermath of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s ousterin December, citing lingering concerns over the extremist past of the country’s new rulers.",

    "title": "Fire stations in England ‘falling apart’ amid £1bn funding cut, chiefs say",
    "article_text": "Fire stations inEnglandare “falling apart”, fire chiefs have warned, with funding plummeting by an estimated £1bn in the last decade as callouts have increased by a fifth. Fire and rescue must not become the “forgotten emergency service”, the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) urged, warning of mounting pressures that “risk undermining public and firefighter safety”, as it responds to more 999 calls with fewer firefighters. The call comes before the government’sspending reviewnext week, in which the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has promised to support the NHS and increase defence budgets. Fire services have not been mentioned, leading to concern that they will be forgotten, according to the NFCC, which represents the heads of fire services across the UK. Firefighter numbers in England have dropped by a quarter in seven years, the equivalent of 11,000 full-time staff, according to the government’s workforce statistics. There has also been an estimated £1bn shortfall in capital funding since the previous government removed a significant grant in 2014-15, which the NFCC said meant services could not maintain or modernise ageing infrastructure, including fire stations. Failing to reverse this damage could endanger the public and firefighters, said Phil Garrigan, the NFCC chair. The inquest intothe deaths of two firefighters and a member of the public in a blaze in Oxfordshireopened on Tuesday. The firefighters, Jennie Logan, 30, and Martyn Sadler, 38, are thought to have died when a structure collapsed on them at a Bicester business park during a large fire on 15 May. Two other firefighters are still in hospital. The financial challenges are being tackled at the same time as demand for fire and rescue services in England is growing. Government figures show officers responded to 600,185 incidents in the year up to December 2024, a 20% increase compared with a decade ago. While the number of fires has fallen by 11%, non-fire callouts have increased by 65%, data from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) shows. In 2022, the services dealt with a record number of wildfires but 2025 appears likely to beat that, with 225 wildfires tackled so far, compared with 106 over the same period in 2022. Garrigan said: “These figures are unequivocal: fire and rescue services are busier now than they were 10 years ago, and we are taking on more responsibility, not less. The risks faced are now more challenging and more complex. Despite this fact, we are seeing firefighter numbers falling, whereas all other public services are seeing their numbers return to pre-austerity levels.” He said firefighters’ work was “crucial in maintaining public safety and we welcome the opportunity to make a real difference but, if it is to be sustained against a backdrop of increasing demand, we need to see investment back into the fire and rescue service”. He added: “If we leave fire and rescue services without proper financial support and investment, we risk undermining public and firefighter safety. When it comes to wildfires, flooding and terrorism, fire and rescue services are right at the heart of the response. If we fail to invest, then we need to be prepared to answer to the communities that rely on these services in their greatest time of need.” Earlier this year, the NFCC called on ministers totake urgent actionto protect communities from the effects of climate breakdown, saying the UK was not prepared. The organisation said fire services’ ability to tackle weather-related emergencies was at risk, despite them often being the main frontline response to major weather events including flooding, fires caused by heatwaves, and storm-related emergencies, all of which are becoming more frequent. An MHCLG spokesperson said: “We understand the challenges that fire services are facing, and despite the inheritance this government has been left with, we are determined to deliver better public services through our plan for change. “Fire and rescue authorities have received almost £3bn in the last financial year to support our brave firefighters and help them protect our communities.”",

    "article_text": "Julie Etchingham has withdrawn her candidacy to join theGarrick Club, uncomfortable with the protracted process of being vetted by the London club’s membership of 1,500 men. The broadcast journalist said she would not comment on her decision, but she is understood to have been uneasy at the level of hostility displayed by men opposed to the admission of women during a candidacy lunch at the club, when members have the opportunity to question prospective members. One member said he understood that with “hardly any women being elected, it is very uncomfortable to walk into a room full of men scrutinising (and ogling) you”. Only three women have been admitted in the year since members decided todrop the club’s men-only rulelast May, 193 years after the club was founded. The comedian Matt Lucas was one of six men elected last month alongside one woman, Celia Imrie, who joins fellow actors Judi Dench and Siân Phillips, named as members last year. Several women from the first batch of female nominees for membership have expressed frustration at the club’s “half-hearted” steps towards admitting women. After decades of internal wrangling over the issue, 60% of members voted last May to confirm that women could be admitted to the club. But none of the seven women nominated as prospective candidates last year, all of whom occupy senior roles in journalism, law or academia, have yet been voted in as members. One woman whose candidacy is being considered by the club described the vote to admit women as a cynical public relations gambit, designed to allow the club to continue functioning quietly as essentially a men-only club. She said she found the vetting process absurd. “We’re all being made to feel we need to beg to join; most of us don’t give a toss whether we join or not and think they should be making every effort to persuade us,” she said, asking not to be named to avoid alienating her sponsors at the club. She said it was clear that men who opposed women’s membership were continuing to fight against the swift admission of women. “It’s frankly ridiculous and embarrassing. What are they scared of?” The actor Juliet Stevenson said she had heard nothing further from the club since she received a phone call from a member early in 2024 asking her if she would like to be nominated. She was uncertain about whether her candidacy had been dropped. “I was asked if my name could be cited as a potential candidate and I agreed, but since then I’ve heard nothing more,” she said. “I haven’t set foot in the place. It wouldn’t surprise me if they’ve decided they don’t want a troublemaker like me in there.” One recent visitor to the club said the vote to admit women had had no impact on the atmosphere there, with just two women in a dining room full of approximately 50 men. A cohort of men who remain opposed to the rule change have set up a WhatsApp group named Status Quo where they continue to protest against the admission of women. The classicist Mary Beard, the former home secretary Amber Rudd, the Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman and the Labour peer Ayesha Hazarika were among the first nominees to join the club, along with Stevenson, Margaret Casely-Hayford, who was chair of Shakespeare’s Globe and was chancellor of Coventry University until last year, and Elizabeth Gloster, a former appeal court judge. None of them have yet been approved for membership.

The club has consistently said it would not fast-track female members, stressing that women may have to wait three or four years for approval. “It would be a helpful change if they brought in some female members of the legal profession; it would demonstrate the keenness of members to modernise themselves,” she said. A string of high-profile names resigned from the Garrick last year after the Guardian published a long list of senior figures from the civil service, politics, the arts and the judiciary who were members of a club that had repeatedly blocked the admission of women since the 1960s. Listed alongside the king were the then deputy prime minister, dozens of members of the House of Lords and 10 MPs, as well as heads of influential thinktanks, law firms and private equity companies, academics, senior journalists, the head of the Royal Opera House and the head of the Independent Press Standards Organisation. The head of the MI6, Richard Moore, and the then head of the civil service resigned from the club after deciding that membership was incompatible with their organisations’ commitment to improving diversity. Several judges also left the club. The Garrick club did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "title": "‘Tudor high drama’: English Heritage looks for descendants of abbey rebels",
    "article_text": "They included a brewer, a tailor and a shoemaker – a hardy bunch of craftspeople prepared to stand up to the might of the Tudor regime to try to save their local monastery. Exactly five centuries on,English Heritageis appealing for people who think they may be descendants of those who took part in the uprising against Cardinal Thomas Wolsey’s closure ofBayham Abbeyto come forward. The idea is to get some of them together for a commemorative event this summer to mark the Bayham Abbey uprising, which took place on 4 June 1525 and is seen as a precursor to the turbulent years of religious reform that followed. Michael Carter, anEnglish Heritagehistorian, described the Bayham Abbey uprising as a moment of “Tudor high drama”. He said: “It is a fascinating precursor to Henry VIII’s religious reforms – a harbinger not only of the dissolution of the monasteries 10 years later but also of the Pilgrimage of Grace, a major revolt against the reforms in the north of England in 1536 and 1537. “In 1525, Bayham was deeply embedded in the religious and social life of its locality. Many of its community – the canons – were local boys and their prayers were highly prized. In addition, a bed in which St Richard of Chichester slept had been preserved at Bayham Abbey as a relic and was believed to perform miracles.” The uprising was probably not just spiritual in nature. The abbey was also a significant employer and those who took part in the uprising were predominantly tradespeople. “Whilst they will undoubtedly have feared the loss of their spiritual leaders, their loss of income would have been of equal concern,” said Carter. He said he feared for what happened to them. “This act of rebellion could have cost them their lives. We are keen to remember and celebrate these brave men.” In advance of the dissolution of monasteries, Wolsey started suppressing some of England’s smaller monasteries to fund his new colleges at Oxford and Ipswich. Bayham Abbey on the Kent/Sussex border was among those targeted, leading to its closure in 1525. Incensed, local people turned to violence, and on 4 June 1525 more than 100 men with painted faces and armed with longbows, crossbows, swords and clubs assembled at the abbey. They stormed the gatehouse and temporarily restored the community. The canons were again removed a week later and 31 men were indicted by the crown for rioting. It is the descendants of these men that EnglishHeritageis hoping to find. They include Thomas Godfowle, a labourer; the tailor William Lamkyn; John Muge, a fuller (cloth worker); and the weaver William Mepam. Among their number are also a possible father and son, John Whitesyde, senior and junior. It is not clear what happened to most of the men but the abbot William Gale, who was among the 31, went on to head an abbey in Buckinghamshire until it was suppressed in 1536. Today Bayham Abbey, founded circa 1208 and built from golden sandstone, is a picturesque ruin with much of the church, gatehouse and chapter house remaining. The full list of those who took part in the uprising can be seen onthe English Heritage website. Anyone who thinks they have a connection with the rebels can email press@english-heritage.org.uk.",

    "title": "Noughties nostalgia trends on TikTok as fans revisit music and TV favourites",
    "article_text": "It is the social media platform that likes to see itself as being on the cutting edge of the latest youth culture and setting the latest trends for others to follow. But across music, television and observations on British daily life, something more familiar is trending onTikTok– a new generation of nostalgia. Music and TV from the 2000s are being rediscovered by gen X and ageing millennials, as well as being discovered for the first time by gen Z. Use of the #noughties nostalgia hashtag is up 36% on last year across entertainment content – while the era is also enjoying a revival in fashion. Sex and the City, which initially ran from 1999 to 2004, has been the subject of 108,000 videos on the site, with a doubling in videos over the past year. Gossip Girl, which ran from 2007 to 2012, has been the subject of 1.2m videos. Gilmore Girls, which ran from 2000 to 2007, has 1m associated videos. Vampire Diaries, which aired for eight years until 2017, is one of the most discussed, with 2m videos so far. There has also been a revival in attention for the UK show Skins, a drama about a group of teenagers from Bristol, which first aired on E4 in 2007. It has 1.6m posts globally to date. “We’re seeing a really big fondness for 90s and noughties across all key content categories,” said Lily Hall, a programs and insights manager at TikTok UK, Ireland and Nordics. “It obviously remains massive in fashion and beauty, and we’re continuously seeing older music, TV shows and films resurface as users are finding that comfort and escapism in the past. “Older series are currently amongst the most popular on the platform. You’ve got this new generation rediscovering older TV shows, and an older generation resharing their old favourites.” TikTok’s penchant for “Britcore” content has crossed over with the demand for 2000s nostalgia, with creators sharing videos on itsfashion and lifestyle,childhood toysand stores such as Toys R Us, anddiscontinued snackslike pink and white mice sweets and Cadbury’s Animal Crackers. Crime drama has also been having a bigger impact, with a 70% increase in associated videos over the past 12 months. The runaway success ofAdolescenceled to content examining how it was made in one shot. There have been 76,000 videos created with the programme’s hashtag. Other creators have been rediscovering the likes of Code of Silence and Kin. In music, the wave of nostalgia has included the rediscovery of tracks such asHeadlock by Imogen Heap, released in 2005, andPrice Tag by Jessie J, released in 2011. But the most surprising throwback success is a song that was recorded 64 years ago and was only deemed good enough at the time to make a B side. Yet Pretty Little Baby, by Connie Francis, has been adopted by a new generation and made waves on the platform. Such has been the impact that Francis, 87, has joined TikTok herself. Sign up toThe Guide Get our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every Friday after newsletter promotion The track has gone viral on the site and has been the subject of more than 20m video creations. It comes 65 years after Francis became the first woman to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart. TikTok said the song had been used as the soundtrack to wholesome content around the family and pets. Among the celebrities to have joined in with the trend areNara Smith,Kylie Jenner, andKim Kardashian. “This is a reminder that the TikTok community doesn’t care about genre or age,” said Sheema Siddiq, an artists partnerships manager at TikTok. “It doesn’t matter if the song was released a month ago or decades ago. What matters is whether the community can be creative with it.”",

    "title": "Potential ‘agroterrorism weapon’ fungus smuggled into US by Chinese scientists, FBI alleges",
    "article_text": "Two Chinese scientists have been charged with smuggling a toxic fungus into the United States that they planned to research at an American university, the justice department has said. Yunqing Jian, 33, and Zunyong Liu, 34, are charged with conspiracy, smuggling, false statements, and visa fraud, the US attorney’s office for the eastern district of Michigan said in a statement on Tuesday. The justice department said the pair conspired to smuggle a fungus called Fusarium graminearum into the United States that causes “head blight,” a disease of wheat, barley, maize, and rice. The fungus is classified in scientific literature as a “potential agroterrorism weapon,” the FBI said, and causes billions of dollars in losses each year. It causes vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in humans and livestock, it said. Jian appeared in court and was returned to jail to await a bond hearing on Thursday. An attorney who was assigned only for her initial appearance declined to comment.In July 2024, Liu was turned away at the Detroit airport and sent back toChinaafter changing his story during an interrogation about red plant material discovered in his backpack, the FBI said.He initially claimed ignorance about the samples but later said he was planning to use the material for research at a University of Michigan lab where Jian worked and where Liu had previously worked, the FBI said. According to the complaint, Jian and Liu, her boyfriend, had both previously conducted work on the fungus in China. The FBI said authorities found a scientific article on Liu’s phone that was titled, “Plant-Pathogen Warfare under Changing Climate Conditions.” Messages between the two in 2024 suggest that Jian was already tending to Fusarium graminearum at the campus lab before Liu was caught at the Detroit airport, the FBI said. The university does not have federal permits to handle it.The US does not have an extradition treaty with China, which makes Liu’s arrest unlikely unless he returns. US Attorney Jerome Gorgon Jr described the smuggling of the fungus into the United States as a “national security” concern and emphasized Jian’s membership of the Chinese Communist party. “These two aliens have been charged with smuggling a fungus that has been described as a ‘potential agroterrorism weapon’ into the heartland of America, where they apparently intended to use a University of Michigan laboratory to further their scheme,” Gorgon said. US secretary of state Marco Rubio vowed last week to “aggressively revoke visas” for Chinese students, a movecondemned by Beijingas “unreasonable” and “discriminatory.” The move is part of a wider crackdown on immigration by the Trump administration. The US has also said it willrefuse visas to foreign officialswho block Americans’ social media posts and hasrescinded visas for peoplewho criticize Israel. Meanwhile, Kseniia Petrova, a scientist from Russia at Harvard, isfacing potential deportationafter she failed to declare biological samples in her luggage upon returning from a trip to Paris.

    "title": "White House boasts family of suspect in Boulder attack ‘could be deported as early as tonight’ – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This liveblog is now closed Family of suspect in Colorado fire attack taken into custody of US immigration The White House is boasting on its official social media accounts aboutthe arrestsof the wife and five children of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspected Boulder attacker, who were taken into custody on Tuesday. Soliman’s six family members, “have been captured and are now in ICE custody for expedited removal”,a White House postsays. It adds, in all caps: “THEY COULD BE DEPORTED AS EARLY AS TONIGHT.” Thirty minutes later, the White Houseadded, in the gleeful, mocking tone that has distinguished posts gloating over deportations of even immigrants sent to foreign jails by mistake: “Six One-Way Tickets for Mohamed’s Wife and Five Kids. Final Boarding Call Coming Soon.” That timeline would appear to conflict with both court orders that people threatened with deportation should be given sufficient time to challenge their removals, and a statement from the homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, earlier on Tuesday, that authorities “are investigating to what extent his family knew about this horrific attack, if they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it”. According toa state arrest affidavit, Soliman told the Boulder police “no one knew about his plans and he never talked to his wife or family about it”. For its post on Instagram, the White House cropped an image of Soliman taken during the attack to include a rainbow Progress Pride Flag on the Boulder courthouse behind him. Stephen Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, said on Tuesday that all of the victims of the firebomb attack are expected to survive,the Denver Post reports. Three of the 12 victims are being treated at UCHealth’s burn and frostbite center at the University of Colorado in Aurora. This ends our live coverage of the secondTrump administrationfor the day, but we will be back at it on Wednesday. In the meantime, here are some of the day’s developments: Elon Musk, who played a leading role in the Trump administration until last week,denouncedthe massive spending and tax bill the president wants to sign as “a disgusting abomination”. “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong”, he added. One Republican who did vote for it, Scott Perry, quickly piped up to say that he agreed with Musk, even though his single vote could have stopped it from passing the House. The White Housegloatedon social media aboutthe arrestsof the wife and five children ofMohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspected Boulder attacker, and joked about providing them with “six one-way tickets”. In the 48 hours since the firebomb attack in Boulder, Colorado, on a demonstration in support of Israelis held hostage in Gaza, Republicanspoliticized the attack, attempting to blame Democrats, including the state’s multiple Jewish leaders. Democrats denounced the Trump administration’s “cruel”decisionto rescindhealth department guidanceissued in the wake of the 2022 Dobbs decision, striking down the right to an abortion, that required hospitals to provide abortions to women in medical emergencies even in state’s with local bans on the procedure. At a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, pressed Kate Shaw, a law professor and host of the liberal podcast Strict Scrutiny, to explain why so many more injunctions were issued againstDonald Trumpthan against other presidents. As Hawley had a chart displayed showing the comparison, and asked: “You don’t think this is a little bit anomalous?” Shawreplied: “A very plausible explanation, Senator, you have to consider, is that he is engaged in much more lawless activity than other presidents.” Democrats responded with anger to the Trump administration’sdecisionon Tuesday to rescindhealth department guidanceissued in the wake of the 2022 Dobbs decision, striking down the right to an abortion, that required hospitals to provide abortions to women in medical emergencies even in state’s with local bans on the procedure. “Trump’s HHS is erasing guidance that affirmed protections for abortion care during medical emergencies,” the RepresentativeAyanna Pressleywrote on Bluesky. This is cruel, callous, and outright dangerous. “Trump just quietly erased guidance that told hospitals they had to save pregnant women’s lives,” the Washington SenatorPatty Murrayposted. “That’s right—they don’t care how many women die or are forced into health crises to advance their anti-abortion agenda. I won’t let this fly under the radar.” “This is cruel, dangerous, and puts lives at risk,” the Arizona SenatorRuben Gallegowrote. “Revoking emergency abortion protections means women in medical crisis could be told ‘no’ at the ER — just because they’re pregnant.” Michigan’s governor,Gretchen Whitmer, also called the policy cruel. “Taking away emergency abortion care puts lives on the line and hands power to politicians, instead of medical professionals and patients,” she posted. “In Michigan, we trust women. We trust doctors. And we’ll never stop fighting to protect your health care.” In the 48 hours since the firebomb attack in Boulder, Colorado, on a demonstration in support of Israelis held hostage in Gaza, and the arrest of an Egyptian asylum seeker charged with hate crimes and attempted murder for wounding 12 people,Republicanshave politicized the attack, attempting to blame Democrats for the attempted murders. Donald Trumpclaimedthat the suspect, who arrived on a tourist visa in 2022 and asked for asylum six months later, “came in through Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy”. The attack, Trump claimed, was “yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals”. Republicans in Congress even tried to use the attack as an argument to pass their massive spending and tax cut bill, which takes health insurance away from millions and cuts taxes for the rich, but also increases spending on deportations. “This attack was preventable, but Democrats & Biden closed their eyes & created a national security nightmare” House Republicansposted. “It doesn’t have to be this way & House Republicans passed a solution: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” As the 9News Denver anchorKyle Clarkobserved, “Colorado’s elected leaders are responding to the terror attack in Boulder, with leading Democrats condemning antisemitic hate and violence and leading Republicans condemning Democrats.” Colorado’s Democratic governor,Jared Polis, who is Jewish, said: “an attack on any of us is an attack on all of us, it goes for Jews, Christians, Muslims, people of no faith at all; there’s just no room in our state for these acts of terror”. The state’s Democratic attorney general,Phil Weiser, condemned what he called a painful, “antisemitic attack on fellow Jews”. Democratic SenatorMichael Bennet, whose mother was born to a secular Jewish family in Poland in 1938 and smuggled out of the Warsaw ghetto, said he was horrified by “the terror attack in Boulder– targeting Jews peacefully marching”. Colorado’s Democratic secretary of state,Jena Griswold,posted on Bluesky: “My heart goes out to those who were injured in the senseless and despicable attack that took place in Boulder. Violence is never the answer. Antisemitism has no place here.” Even so, two Colorado Republicans in Congress,Lauren BoebertandGabe Evans, insisted Democrats were to blame. “When progressives allow and encourage hate speech toward Jews for their mere existence, people get hurt,” Boebertposted. In a dozen posts, Evansrepeatedly claimedthat the attack was “a direct result of failed sanctuary states like Colorado”, even though the state’s unwillingness to cooperate with federal immigration officers had nothing to do with the suspected attacker, who had reportedly applied for asylum and so was legally allowed to remain in the US until that claim was adjudicated. But the most inflammatory response came fromDanielle Jurinsky, a conservative Aurora city council member, who called the Democratic party “a demonic cult”, and attacked fellow Jews Polis, Bennet, Griswold and Weiser. “Shame on every single one of you, who have made the Democratic party your religion. Shame on you! You’re not Jewish, you’re a Democrat!” By contrast, the organizers of the movement for Israeli hostages, Run for Their Lives,thanked Weiser and Polis“for their immediate and decisive responses”. Run for Their Lives is non-partisan but at least one its leaders, Shira Weiss, is a committed Democrat. Her Facebook page mixes posts about the plight of the Israeli hostages with denunciations ofDonald Trump. “Thank g-d no one in MY immediate family voted for this imbecile,” she wrote in April. During Tuesday’s Republican-led Senate judiciary subcommittee hearing, District Judges v Trump, there was an unusual degree of agreement among the senators and their panel of witnesses that nationwide injunctions have become problematic. They agreed that the sweeping rulings have been abused by both Republican and Democratic administrations, and that single judge divisions, which allow plaintiffs to guarantee their case will be heard by a particular judge they believe could be favorable to their case, known as forum shopping, are an “enormous problem”. “Both sides,” SenatorJohn Kennedy,a Louisiana Republican, declared loudly during the hearing. “There are no clean hands here.” But there was also plenty of political posturing and goal-scoring. Several Republican senators spent their time assailing the Democrats’ guest, law professorKate Shaw,who hosts the podcastStrict Scrutiny, part of the liberal Crooked Media empire. On concerns over the rising threats to judges,Republicanssought to point the finger at Democrats, ignoring entirely Trump’s attacks on the judiciary. At the end, SenatorAdam Schiff, Democrat of California, highlighted some of the names Trump has used against the judges who have ruled against him: “communist”, “lunatic” and “monster”. In response, Cruz read aloud tweets posted by a liberal online commentator after the extraordinary supreme court leak that previewed the justices decision to overturn Roe v Wade. Declaring the left’s rhetoric “angry” and “unhinged”, he adjourned the hearing. On Tuesday, SenatorTed Cruz, a Texas Republican, conveneda hearingon a legal matter that has troubled judges and lawmakers of both parties: nationwide injunctions. Cruz said the use of nationwide injunctions by a single judge to block large swaths of Trump’s agenda from taking effect across the country amounted to “judicial tyranny”. But Democrats decried the hearing – titledThe Supposedly ‘Least Dangerous Branch’: District Judges vs. Trump– as a political stunt designed to intimidate judges who rule against the president. “These district judges, they were not elected,” Cruz said. “They were appointed by one individual and confirmed, not to legislate, not to govern, but to apply the law. And yet, far too many of them have abandoned that role. They stepped off the bench and into the political arena issuing sweeping edicts that impose their policy preferences on 340 million Americans.” He counted 40 universal injunctions issued against Trump in his second term so far, noting that it was “more than all of the nationwide injunctions issued against [presidents] Bush, Obama and Biden combined.” SenatorSheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat,said the rise in their use did not reflect judicial overreach but the necessary response to “unprecedented lawlessness”. “Many are flat out, on their face illegal as any first year law student could tell you,” Whitehouse said, pointing to several of Trump’s executive orders that have triggered judges to issue nationwide injunctions, including his attempt to end birthright citizenship, a right enshrined in the 14th amendment of the US constitution. Trump is “breaking the law and doing it a lot,” Whitehouse said. “And judges are doing their job.” RepresentativeScott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican and member of the far-right House Freedom caucus, just seconded Elon Musk’s criticism of the massive spending bill that passed the House by a single vote as “a disgusting abomination” and added that the billionaire Republican donor “is right to call out House Leadership”. Perry, who voted for the bill last month,shared Musk’s postwith that criticism on the billionaire’s social media platform X along with a comment that he and his colleagues “were right all along” to object to the spending bill Donald Trump is eager to sign into law. Projections from non-partisan expertssuggestthat the spending bill, which includes massive tax cuts for the rich and could deprive 14 million people of health insurance, could add over $3tn to the federal debt in 10 years. Aaron Fritschner, an aide to RepresentativeDon Beyer, a Virginia Democrat, replied to the comment from Perry by pointing out that he could have defeated the bill himself by simply voting no. The House vote in favor of the bill, thanks to Perry’s vote, was 215-214. Perry reportedly played a key role in Trump’s plot to subvert the result of the 2020 presidential election he lost to Joe Biden, according torecords obtained by special counselJack Smith, and the testimony of former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson. The White House is boasting on its official social media accounts aboutthe arrestsof the wife and five children of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspected Boulder attacker, who were taken into custody on Tuesday. Soliman’s six family members, “have been captured and are now in ICE custody for expedited removal”,a White House postsays. It adds, in all caps: “THEY COULD BE DEPORTED AS EARLY AS TONIGHT.” Thirty minutes later, the White Houseadded, in the gleeful, mocking tone that has distinguished posts gloating over deportations of even immigrants sent to foreign jails by mistake: “Six One-Way Tickets for Mohamed’s Wife and Five Kids.

Stephen Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, said on Tuesday that all of the victims of the firebomb attack are expected to survive,the Denver Post reports. Three of the 12 victims are being treated at UCHealth’s burn and frostbite center at the University of Colorado in Aurora. Brazil’s president,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, vowed on Tuesday to defend his country’s supreme court against attacks from the United States, in a sharp rebuke of potential sanctions from Washington against one of the top court’s justices. US secretary of stateMarco Rubiotold Congresslast week that the Trump administration could impose economic sanctions on the judge overseeing the trial of Brazil’s former president, Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally accused of plotting a January 6-style attack by his supporters on government buildings in Brasília in 2023, to demand that the presidential election he lost be overturned. “It is unacceptable for the president of any country in the world to comment on the decision of the supreme court of another country,” Lulatold reporters, adding that the United States needs to understand the importance of “respecting the integrity of institutions in other countries”. The Brazilian supreme court justiceAlexandre de Moraesis under fire from the far-right in Brazil and the US as he leads the court’s crackdown on what he has called threats to Brazil’s democracy, both online and in an alleged coup plot. His orders to social media companies to remove posts from Bolsonaro supporters that he considered threats to democratic institutions were called censorship byElon Musk, the owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, and Rumble, a right-wing alternative to YouTube backed byPeter ThielandJD Vance. The judge suspended Musk’s social media platform in Brazil until it acquiesced to his orders. Tensions have spiked between the two nations since Trump took office, according to reports in the Brazilian press. Last month, the country’s leading newspaper, Folha de S.Paulo,reportedthat a Trump administration diplomat, David Gamble, was rebuffed when he asked, during a visit to Brazil, for the Brazilian gangs PCC (Primeiro Comando da Capital) and CV (Comando Vermelho) to be designated terrorist organizations. Two weeks later,according to Folha, a visit to Brasília by the head of the US Southern Command, Admiral Alvin Holsey, “caused discomfort among Brazilian military officials” and “a dinner he hosted that ended up sparsely attended after key invitees failed to show”. The tension in that case was over the American’s announcement that he planned to visit a military base along the border with Peru and Bolivia, to highlight illegal trafficking, without getting permission from Brazil’s military. The visit to the border was ultimately cancelled and Brazil’s defense minister and the leaders of its army, navy and air force did not attend the dinner hosted by the visiting US admiral. Republican firebrandMarjorie Taylor Greenehas drawn widespread criticism from Democratic colleagues for admitting that not only did she not read Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill before voting for it, but she would have voted against it had she read thoroughly. Greene revealed she was unaware of a provision in Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” (OBBB) that would prevent states from regulating artificial intelligence systems for a decade. The Georgia representative said she would have voted against the entire bill if she had known about the AI language buried on pages 278-279. “Full transparency, I did not know about this section on pages 278-279 of the OBBB that strips states of the right to make laws or regulate AI for 10 years,”Greene wroteon X. “I am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in there.” Democratic lawmakers, who all voted against the bill, responded with incredulity of Greene’s admission. “You have one job. To. Read. The. Fucking. Bill,” Representative Eric Swalwell wrote in response. Representative Ted Lieu said he had read the AI provision beforehand and “that’s one reason I voted no on the GOP’s big, ugly bill”, he posted on X. “PRO TIP: It’s helpful to read stuff before voting on it.” Representative Mark Pocan was more forward: “Read the f**king bill instead of clapping for it like a performing monkey. You should have done your job while it was written. You didn’t. You own that vote.” Read more: Elon Musk’sonline outburstcould embolden fiscally conservative Republican senators – some of whom have already spoken out – to defy Trump as they continue crucial negotiations on Capitol Hill over the so-called “big, beautiful bill”, my colleagueDavid Smithreports. Musk drew immediate support fromThomas Massie, one of only two Republicans who last month voted against the bill in the House of Representatives. “He’s right,”Massie responded on Xtoday. Having narrowly passed the House, the bill is now under consideration in the Senate, which is aiming to pass a revised version by 4 July. Some Republican fiscal conservatives, such as senatorsRon JohnsonandRandPaul, share Musk’s concerns about the need for significant spending cuts. Trump, who has been pressuringRepublicansto pass his signature legislation to enact his domestic agenda, attacked Paul on Truth Social earlier today, writing: “Rand Paul has very little understanding of the BBB, especially the tremendous GROWTH that is coming. He loves voting “NO” on everything, he thinks it’s good politics, but it’s not. The BBB is a big WINNER!!!” He then posted again: “Rand votes NO on everything, but never has any practical or constructive ideas. His ideas are actually crazy (losers!). The people of Kentucky can’t stand him. This is a BIG GROWTH BILL!” Politicoreportsthat House speakerMike JohnsonsaidElon Muskis “terribly wrong” after the tech billionaire – and, until last week, top Trump adviser -blasted Trump’s megabillas a “disgusting abomination” that will expand the “already gigantic” budget deficit. “With all due respect, my friend Elon is terribly wrong about the one big, beautiful bill,” Johnson told reporters. Johnson said he spoke over the phone with Musk for what he described as a friendly conversation of more than 20 minutes yesterday about the “virtues” of the bill. “And he seemed to understand that,” Johnson said. Johnson added that he discussed with Musk the accelerated repeal of many green energy tax credits in the House version of the bill, which Musk alsovoiced opposition to last week. “But for him to come out and pan the whole bill, to me, is just very disappointing, very surprising in light of the conversation I had with him yesterday,” Johnson said. “It’s not personal,” the speaker added. “I just deeply regret that he’s made this mistake.” House majority leaderJohn Thune,according to Politico, simply said GOP senators “have a difference of opinion” with Musk and that he hoped “he’ll come to a different conclusion” after learning more about the bill. The family of the Egyptian national charged with attacking people with a makeshift flamethrower and other incendiary devices at an event for Israeli hostages in Boulder,Colorado, was taken into federal custody today, officials said. The Homeland security secretaryKristi Noemsaid in a social media video post that Ice had taken into custody the family ofMohamed Sabry Soliman, who lived in Colorado Springs and who federal officials have said was in the US illegally, having overstayed a tourist visa and an expired work permit – though he had a pending asylum claim. Noem said while Soliman will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, federal agents were also “investigating to what extent his family knew about this horrific attack – if they had any knowledge of it or if they provided any support for it”. Ice did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for more details about the detention of Soliman’s family. According to local media reports, Soliman’s family included two teenagers and three younger children. FBI and police officials had said on Monday that the family has cooperated with investigators. The suspect told investigators he acted alone. DHS officials said Soliman entered the US in August 2022 on a tourist visa, filed for asylum the following month, and remained in the country after his visa expired in February 2023. A police affidavit filed in support of Soliman’s arrest warrant said he was born in Egypt, lived in Kuwait for 17 years and moved three years ago to Colorado Springs, about 100 miles south of Boulder, where he lived with his wife and five children. Federal and local authorities said at a news conference in Boulder yesterday that Soliman had done nothing to draw law enforcement attention before Sunday’s attack. He was believed to have acted alone, they said. Marco Rubio,the secretary of state, has announced visa restrictions for several unnamed Central American government officials and their families for allegedly exploiting Cuban medical professionals, Reuters reports. Rubio, who did not name the officials or the countries they are from, said the officials are responsible for Cuban medical mission programs that include elements of forced labor and the exploitation of Cuban workers. “These steps promote accountability for those who support and perpetuate these exploitative practices,” he said in a statement. “Attacks on the judiciary itself are dangerous to the rule of law and to the actual judges themselves,” saysDick Durbin, citing a spike in violence and threats against judges and their families in light of the president’s rhetoric. “Let us recognise that violence begets violence,” he says. “Threats of violence … are never acceptable. “People are welcome to debate the merits of any particular judicial decision but we cannot condone personal attacks and threats against judges who rule against this administration, and we can’t allow partisan politics or the latest outrage from the president to undermine the judicial branch and our constitutional order.” Durbin cites language used by Trump and his allies to attack the “authority and legitimacy” of the judiciary and to intimidate judges, including demanding impeachmentof a judge who ruled against him. It is difficult to imagine either President Bush, President Obama or President Biden using such unhinged, bombastic and childish language, or calling for the impeachment of a judge simply for ruling against his administration. The reason it’s difficult is because Obama or Biden never did anything like this. Durbin goes on to say that Trump and “his allies go after anyone who dares to speak up because fear of political retribution is now at the core of this Maga world, and my Republican colleagues have been silent as the president has made the statements he has about judges”.",

    "title": "Hunger and bullets: Palestinians recall Rafah aid massacre horror",
    "article_text": "Khan Younis, Gaza– Yazan Musleh, 13, lies in a hospital bed set up in a tent on the grounds of Nasser Hospital, his t-shirt pulled up to reveal a large white bandage on his thin torso. Beside him, his father, Ihab, sits fretfully, still shaken bythe bloodied dawnhe and his sons lived through on Sunday when Israeli forces opened fire on thousands of people gathered to receive aid from the Israeli-conceived, and United States-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Ihab, 40, had taken Yazan and his 15-year-old brother, Yazid, from their shelter in al-Mawasi, Khan Younis, to the Rafah distribution point that the GHF operates. They set out before dawn, walking for about an hour and a half to get to the al-Alam Roundabout roundabout in Rafah, near the distribution point. Worried about the size of the gathering, hungry crowd, Ihab told his sons to wait for him on an elevation near the GHF gates. “When I looked behind the hill, I saw several tanks not far away,” he says. “A feeling of dread came over me. What if they opened fire or something happened? I prayed for God’s protection.” As the crowd moved closer to the gates, heavygunfire erupted from all directions. “I was terrified. I immediately looked towards my sons on the hill, and saw Yazan get shot and collapse,” he recalls. Yazid, also sitting by his brother’s bedside, describes the moments of terror. “We were standing on the hill as our father told us, and suddenly, the tanks opened fire.” He says. “My brother was hit in the stomach immediately.” “I saw his intestines spilling out – it was horrifying. Then people helped rush him to the hospital in a donkey cart.” Down by the gates, Ihab was struggling to reach his sons, trying to fight against the crowd while avoiding the shots still ringing out. “Shooting was coming from every direction – from tanks, quadcopters. “I saw people helping my son, eventually dragging him away.” When Ihab managed to get away from the crowd, he ran as best as his malnourished body could manage, towards Nasser Hospital, in hopes that Yazan had been taken there. It felt like more than an hour, he says. At Nasser Hospital, he learned that Yazan had been taken into surgery. “I finally breathed. I thanked God he was still alive. I had completely lost hope,” he says. The bullet that hit Yazan had torn through his intestines and spleen, and the doctors say he needs long and intensive treatment. Sitting by him is his mother, Iman, who asks despairingly why anyone would shoot at people trying to get food. She and Ihab have five children, the youngest is a seven-month-old girl. “I went to get food for my children. Hunger is killing us,” says Ihab. “These aid distributions are known to be degrading and humiliating – but we’re desperate. I’m desperate because my children are starving, and even then, we are shot at?” He had tried to get aid once before, he says, but both times he came away empty-handed. “The first time, there was a deadly stampede. We barely escaped. This time, my son was wounded and again… nothing,” he says. But he knows he cannot stop trying. “I’ll risk it for my family. Either I come back alive or I die. I’m desperate. Hunger is killing us.” The GHF, marketed as a neutral humanitarian mechanism, waslaunched in early 2025and uses private US military contractors to “secure the distribution points”. The GHF’s head, Jake Wood, resigned his post two days before distribution began, citing concerns that the foundation would not be impartial or act in accordance with humanitarian principles. Five days later, on May 30, the Boston Consulting Group, which had been part of the planning and implementation of the foundation, withdrew its team and terminated its association with GHF. International aid organisations have been unanimous in criticising the GHF and its methods. Lying nearby in the tent ward is Mohammed al-Homs, 40, a father of five. He had also headed out early on Sunday to try to get some food for his family, but moments after arriving at the al-Alam Roundabout roundabout, “I was shot twice – once in the leg and once in the mouth, shattering my front teeth,” he says. “I collapsed, there were so many injured and dead around me. Everyone was screaming and running. Gunfire was coming from tanks, drones everywhere. It felt like the end of the world.” He lay bleeding on the ground for what felt like an hour, as medical teams were not able to reach the injured. Then, word spread that the gates had opened for distribution, and those who could move started heading towards the centre. It was only then that people could start moving the wounded to a nearby medical point. “This was my first time trying to get aid, and it will be my last,” Mohammed says. “I didn’t expect to survive. We went looking for food for our hungry children and were met with drones and tanks.” Also in the tent is someone who had succeeded in getting an aid package on the first day of distribution, on May 27, and decided to try again on Sunday: 36-year-old Khaled al-Lahham. Al-Lahham is taking care of 10 family members: his parents, one aunt, and seven siblings, all of whom are displaced in the tents of al-Mawasi. He had managed to catch a ride with five friends that morning, driving as close as they could to the al-Alam Roundabout roundabout. As the distribution time approached, the six friends started getting out of the car. “Suddenly, there was loud gunfire all around and people screaming. I felt a sharp pain in my leg – a bullet had passed clean through my thigh,” says Khaled, who did not make it fully out of the car. “I was screaming and bleeding while people around me ran and screamed. The shooting was frenzied,” he adds. “There were tanks, quadcopters – fire came from every direction.” Injured, Khaled could not get out of the car and huddled there until one of his friends managed to return and drive him to the hospital. “I never imagined I’d face death for a box of food,” Khaled says. “If they don’t want to distribute the aid, why do they lie to people and kill them like this? “This is all deliberate. Humiliate us, degrade us, then kill us – for food?”",

    "title": "Chinese couple charged with smuggling toxic fungus into US",
    "article_text": "US federal prosecutors have charged two Chinese nationals with smuggling a toxic fungus into the United States, which authorities claim could be turned into a “potential agroterrorism weapon”. The charges against Jian Yunqing, 33, and Liu Zunyong, 34, two researchers from China, were unsealed by the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan on Tuesday. The pair face additional charges of conspiracy, visa fraud and providing false statements to investigators. Prosecutors allege that Liu smuggled the fungus, called Fusarium graminearum, into the US so he could carry out research at a University of Michigan laboratory where his girlfriend, Jian, worked. Fusarium graminearum causes “head blight”, a disease in crops like wheat, barley, maize and rice, and is “responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year”, according to the charges. The pathogen also poses a danger to humans and livestock, and can cause “vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects”. The investigation was carried out by US Customs and Border Protection and the FBI, whose mandate includes investigating foreign and economic espionage as well as counterterrorism. Jian was earlier arrested by the FBI and is due to appear in federal court this week, where her ties to the Chinese government are also under scrutiny at a time of increased paranoia within the US government about possible Chinese infiltration. Jian allegedly received funding from the Chinese government to carry out research on the same toxic fungus in China, according to the charges. The Associated Press news agency, citing the FBI, said that Liu was sent back to China from Detroit in July 2024 after airport customs authorities found the fungus in his backpack. He later admitted to bringing the material into the US to carry out research at the University of Michigan, where he had previously worked alongside his girlfriend, the AP said. During their investigation, the FBI found an article on Liu’s phone titled “Plant-Pathogen Warfare under Changing Climate Conditions”. Messages on the couple’s phones also indicated that Jian was aware of the smuggling scheme, and later lied to investigators about her knowledge. It is unlikely that Liu will face extradition as the US does not have an extradition treaty with China. FBI director Kash Patel claimed on X that China was “working around the clock to deploy operatives and researchers to infiltrate American institutions and target our food supply, which would have grave consequences”. New… I can confirm that the FBI arrested a Chinese national within the United States who allegedly smuggled a dangerous biological pathogen into the country. The individual, Yunqing Jian, is alleged to have smuggled a dangerous fungus called \"Fusarium graminearum,\" which is an… — FBI Director Kash Patel (@FBIDirectorKash)June 3, 2025 The Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The University of Michigan on Tuesday issued a brief statement condemning “any actions that seek to cause harm, threaten national security, or undermine the university’s critical public mission”. The case comes just a week after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio pledged to start “aggressively”revoking the visasof Chinese students in the US on national security grounds. Targeted students include Chinese nationals with ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), an institution that counts about 100 million members. While some Chinese may join for ideological reasons, membership in the CCP comes with perks like access to better jobs and educational opportunities. It is not uncommon for students from elite backgrounds, like those studying in the US, to also be members of the CCP. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has previously pledged to “firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests” of its students studying overseas following news of the visa crackdown.",

    "title": "El Salvador convicts army officers for 1982 killing of 4 Dutch journalists",
    "article_text": "Three former officers in El Salvador’s military have been convicted for the killings of four Dutch journalists during the Central American country’s brutal civil war in 1982. Former Minister of National Defence Colonel Jose Guillermo Garcia, 91, former police Colonel Francisco Moran, 93, and ex-infantry brigade commander Colonel Mario Adalberto Reyes Mena, 85, were found guilty late on Tuesday by a jury in the northern city of Chalatenango, a lawyer said. The Diario El Salvador news outlet reported that the three former officers – none of whom was present in court – were sentenced to 15 years in prison each for the killings. The four Dutch journalists, Koos Koster, Jan Kuiper, Hans ter Laag and Joop Willemsen, were killed while filming a television documentary on El Salvador’s civil war, which saw an estimated 75,000 civilians killed – mostly by United States-backed government security forces – between 1980 and 1992. The journalists had linked up with leftist rebels and planned to spend several days behind the front lines reporting on the war. But Salvadoran soldiers armed with assault rifles and machineguns ambushed them and the rebels. “We have clearly shown the level of responsibility of the accused,” said Oscar Perez, a lawyer for the Foundation Comunicandonos, which represents the victims. “The entire organised power structure that intervened in the political-military decisions that led to the murder of the journalists,” he said. A United Nations-sponsored Truth Commission in 1993 found that the journalists had walked into an ambush trap that was planned by Reyes, who still lives in the US, and with the knowledge of other officers. The Salvadoran Supreme Court approved an extradition request for Reyes in March, but there has been no progress in his return from the US so far. The ageing Garcia and Moran are under police surveillance in a private hospital in the capital, San Salvador. García was deported from the US in 2016, after a US judge declared him responsible for serious human rights violations during the early years of the war between the military and the leftist Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front fighters. The prosecution of the men was reopened in 2018 after the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a general amnesty passed following the end of the civil war. The case against the suspects moved slowly, but in March 2022, relatives of the victims and representatives of the Dutch government as well as the European Union demanded that those responsible for the journalists’ killing face trial.",

    "title": "US-backed GHF suspends Gaza aid for full day, names new evangelical leader",
    "article_text": "The United States- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) will suspend aid distribution in the war-torn territory on Wednesday, a day afterIsraeli forces again opened fireon Palestinian aid seekers near a GHF distribution site, killing at least 27 and injuring more than 100. Israel’s military also said that approach roads to the aid distribution centres will be “considered combat zones” on Wednesday, and warned that people in Gaza should heed the GHF announcement to stay away. “We confirm that travel is prohibited tomorrow on roads leading to the distribution centers … and entry to the distribution centers is strictly forbidden,” an Israeli military spokesperson said. In a post on social media, GHF said the temporary suspension was necessary to allow for “renovation, reorganisation and efficiency improvement work”. “Due to the ongoing updates, entry to the distribution centre areas is slowly prohibited! Please do not go to the site and follow general instructions. Operations will resume on Thursday. Please continue to follow updates,” the group said. The temporary suspension of aid comes as more than 100 Palestinian people seeking aid have beenreported killed by Israeli forcesin the vicinity of GHF distribution centres since the organisation started operating in the enclave on May 27. Thekilling of people desperately seeking foodsupplies has triggered mounting international outrage with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres demanding an independent inquiry into the deaths and for “perpetrators to be held accountable”. “It is unacceptable that Palestinians are risking their lives for food,” Guterres said. The Israeli military has admitted it shot at aid seekers on Tuesday, but claimed that they opened fire when “suspects” deviated from a stipulated route as a crowd of Palestinians was making its way to the GHF distribution site in Gaza. Israel’s military said it is looking into the incident and the reports of casualties. On Tuesday, GHF named its new executive chairman as US evangelical Christian leader Reverend Dr Johnnie Moore. Moore, who was an evangelical adviser to the White House during the first term of United States President Donald Trump, said in a statement that GHF was “demonstrating that it is possible to move vast quantities of food to people who need it most — safely, efficiently, and effectively”. The UN and aid agencies have refused to work with the GHF, accusing the group of lacking neutrality and of being part of Israel’s militarisation of aid in Gaza. Israel has also been accused of“weaponising” hunger in Gaza, which has been brought about by a months-long Israeli blockade on food, medicine, water and other basic essentials entering the war-torn territory. Moore’s appointment is likely to add to concerns regarding GHF’s operations in Gaza, given his support for the controversial proposal Trump floated in February for the US to take over Gaza, remove the Palestinian population, and focus on real estate development in the territory. After Trump proposed the idea, Moore posted video of Trump’s remarks on X and wrote: “The USA will take full responsibility for future of Gaza, giving everyone hope & a future.” Responding on social media to UN chief Guterres’s outrage following the killing of aid seekers in Gaza on Sunday, Moore said: “Mr Secretary-General, it was a lie… spread by terrorists & you’re still spreading it. The GHF’s founding executive director, former US marine Jake Wood, resigned from his position before the Gaza operation began, questioning the organisation’s “impartiality” and “independence”. Critics have accused GHF, which has not revealed where its funds come from, of facilitating the Israeli military’s goal of depopulating northern Gaza as it has concentrated aid distribution in the southern part of the territory, forcing thousands of desperate people to make the perilous journey to its locations to receive assistance.",

    "title": "As Trump raises deportation quotas, advocates fear an expanding ‘dragnet’",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –There were shackles at her wrists. Her waist. Her ankles. The memory of being bound still haunts 19-year-old Ximena Arias Cristobal even after her release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody. Nearly a month after her arrest, the Georgia college student said she is still grappling with how her life has been transformed. One day in early May, she was pulled over for a minor traffic stop: turning right on a red light. The next thing she knew, she was in a detention centre, facing a court date for her deportation. “That experience is something I’ll never forget. It left a mark on me, emotionally and mentally,” Arias Cristobal said during a news conference on Tuesday, recounting her time at the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia. “What hurts more,” she added, “is knowing that millions of others have gone through and are still going through the same kind of pain”. Rights advocates say her story has become emblematic of a “dragnet” deportation policy in the United States, one that targets immigrants of all backgrounds, regardless of whether they have a criminal record. President Donald Trump had campaigned for a second term on the pledge that he would expel “criminals” who were in the country “illegally”. But as he ramps up his “mass deportation” campaign from the White House, critics say immigration agents are targeting immigrants from a variety of backgrounds — no matter how little risk they pose. “The quotas that they are pushing for [are] creating this situation on the ground where ICE is literally just trying to go after anybody that they can catch,” said Vanessa Cardenas, the executive director of America’s Voice, an immigration advocacy group. She explained that young, undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, are among the most vulnerable populations. “In the dragnet, we’re getting long-established, deeply rooted Dreamers and other folks that have been in the United States for a long time,” Cardenas explained. An avid runner who studies finance and economics at Dalton State College, Arias Cristobal is one of the3.6 millionpeople known as Dreamers. Many were sent to the US as children, sometimes accompanied by family members, others alone. For decades, the US government has struggled with how to handle those young, undocumented arrivals to the country. In 2012, then-President Barack Obama announced a new executive policy, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). It provided temporary protection from deportation for younger immigrants who had lived in the US since June 2007. About 530,000 Dreamers are protected by their DACA status. But Gaby Pacheco, the leader of the immigration group TheDream.US, said that number represents a small proportion of the total population of young immigrants facing possible deportation. Some arrived after the cut-off date of June 15, 2007, while others have been unable to apply: Processing for new applications has been paused in recent years. Legal challenges over DACA also continue to wind their way through the federal court system. “Sadly, in recent months multiple Dream.US scholars and alumni have either been arrested, detained and even deported,” Pacheco said. She noted that 90 percent of the Dreamers that her organisation is supporting during their first year of higher education have no protections under DACA or other programmes. All told, she said, the last few months have revealed a “painful truth”: that “Dreamers are under attack”. But advocates like Pacheco warn that the first months of the Trump administration may be only a harbinger of what is to come. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller informed ICE agents that the Trump administration had increased its daily quota for immigration arrests, from 1,000 per day to 3,000. The current draft of Trump’s budget legislation — known as the One Big Beautiful Bill — would also surge an estimated $150bn in government funds towards deportation and other immigration-related activities. The bill narrowly passed the House of Representatives and is likely to be taken up in the Senate in the coming weeks. Both actions could mean a significant scale-up in immigration enforcement, even as advocates argue that Trump’s portrayal of the US as a country overrun with foreign criminals is starkly out of step with reality. Studies have repeatedly shown that undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes — including violent crimes — than US-born citizens. Available data also calls into question Trump’s claims that there are large numbers of undocumented criminal offenders in the country. The rate of arrests and deportations has remained more or less the same as when Trump’s predecessor, former President Joe Biden, was in office, according to a report by theTRACresearch project. From January 26 to May 3, during the first four months of Trump’s second term, his administration made an average of 778 immigration arrests per day. That is just 2 percent higher than the average during the final months of Biden’s presidency, which numbered about 759. The number of daily removals or deportations under Trump was actually 1 percentage point lower than Biden’s daily rate. All told, Pacheco and Cardenas warned that the pressure to increase arrests and deportations could lead to increasingly desperate tactics. The administration has alreadyrolled backa policy prohibiting immigration enforcement in sensitive areas, like churches and schools. It has also sought to use a 1798 wartime law to swiftly deport alleged gang members without due process, and revoked temporary protections that allowed some foreign nationals to remain in the country legally. In an effort to increase immigration arrests, the Trump administration has also pressured local officials to coordinate with ICE. Drawing on section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the administration has even delegated certain immigration powers to local law enforcement, including the right to make immigration arrests and screen people for deportation. In one instance in early May, the Tennessee Highway Patrol coordinated with ICE in a sweep of traffic stops that led to nearly 100 immigration arrests. Another large-scale operation in Massachusetts in early June saw ICE make 1,500 arrests. Swept up in that mass arrest was Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, an 18-year-old high school student on his way to volleyball practice. His arrest sparked protest and condemnation in Gomes Da Silva’s hometown of Milford, Massachusetts. Cardenas pointed to those demonstrations, as well as the outpouring of support for Arias Cristobal, as evidence of a growing rejection of Trump’s immigration policies. “I think we are going to see more and more pushback from Americans,” she said. “Having said that, it is my belief that this administration has all the intention to implement their plans… And if Congress gives them more money, they’re going to go after our communities.”",

    "title": "Pokémon Violet and Scarlet’s Switch 2 update is as good as it looks",
    "article_text": "The Nintendo Switch 2 update for the games significantly improves performance and lets their strengths shine. The Nintendo Switch 2 update for the games significantly improves performance and lets their strengths shine. byKallie Plagge I recently did something sort of unusual: I went to a preview event for a game that’s been out for almost three years. I’ve played around 400 hours ofPokémon Scarlet, according to my Nintendo Switch, since it was released in late 2022. It’s safe to say I know the game pretty well. And yet, when I was invited to previewPokémon ScarletandVioletonthe Nintendo Switch 2 ahead of the new console’s launch, I gladly took the opportunity to see three-year-old games I already own. I wanted to find out just how much they’d improved. I have a high jank tolerance with games — it builds character — but I’m well aware ofScarletandViolet’s shortcomings on the original Switch. There’s lag. The frame rate is… inconsistent. There are online connectivity issues. For a lot of people, performance problems overshadowed what was otherwise a great new generation ofPokémongames. With therelease of the Nintendo Switch 2, and the accompanying free performance update forScarletandViolet, that might finally change. Starting up the demo ofPokémon Scarleton the Switch 2 at The Pokémon Company International’s office in Bellevue, Washington, I knew immediately where I wanted to go first: Casseroya Lake, sometimes called “Lag Lake,” where the games’ graphical issues are most apparent. On the original Switch, the gamereallychugs when you’re on the lake; the frame rate takes a dive, and it struggles to render more than a handful of pokémon in your immediate vicinity. Exploring the liveliest open areas and encountering the pokémon that populate them is one ofScarletandViolet’s biggest strengths, but on the Switch, Casseroya Lake is dull and empty at best and impossible to navigate at worst. Playing on the Switch 2, however, Casseroya Lake ran beautifully. There were far more pokémon in view (and I was immediately accosted by a torpedo-like Veluza, same as it ever was), and the lag and stuttering I’d come to expect were nonexistent. I battled that Veluza with no problems. I stumbled upon a Slowpoke outbreak and sent out my Clodsire to auto-battle them — no lag. I found a wild Tera Pokémon and watched the Tera animation play out, looking sharper than I’d ever seen it. (I was playing in docked mode at a station set up by TPCi, so maybe that last one could be credited to the TV. But still.) It was the same case everywhere I went during my 30-minute demo: a stable and smooth frame rate, significantly faster load times, and far more pokémon populating the world. The Switch 2 update is not a complete overhaul of the graphics themselves — the grass textures looked just as unremarkable as always to my eye, for example — but it does seem to eliminate the performance issues that have draggedScarletandVioletdown for nearly three years. It’s a noticeable improvement in the world, in battle, in Tera raids, and even in menus. Is it praiseworthy for a game to simply run well? Maybe not. I don’t pretend to know how games are made on a technical level, or really any level, but I know they’re noteasyto make. And I had enough fun withPokémon Scarletto play for 400 hours without the performance issues bothering me much. But it did feel bittersweet, briefly, to think how much more these games could have shone if they’d run well in the first place. Then, in the last five minutes of my demo, as I waded in a different body of water to confirm that it too ran smoothly, I saw it: among the pods of Buizel dotting the shore, a shiny. A good portion of my 400 hours inScarletwere spent shiny hunting, because even though the alternate-color versions of pokémon are not quite as hard to find as they were in previous games, I get excited every time I see one, without fail. It’s the perfect encapsulation of the kind of joyScarletandViolethave to offer: exploring a lively area and finding something special.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 3, 2025 / 11:21 PM EDT/ KCAL News A Mexican family in Los Angeles has been given permission to stay in the United States in order to receive lifesaving treatmentfor their 4-year-old daughter, the family's attorneys announced Tuesday. For the past month, the girl's mother,Deysi Vargas, and her attorneys have pleaded with the Trump administration to reinstate their humanitarian parole after immigration services revoked the family's emergency visa back on April 11. Last week, Gina Amato Lough, one of the family's attorneys, said in a press conference that the family received a subsequent notice a few weeks later and a third such notice in May informing them that they were \"no longer in lawful status\" and vulnerable to deportation. Sofia, a pseudonym used to protect the girl's identity, has been receiving lifesaving treatment at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and the equipment used in her treatment is not available outside of the U.S., her attorneys say. Sofia's medical team told the family that if she does not continue to receive treatment, she could die in a matter of days, according to Vargas. On Tuesday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted a one-year humanitarian parole that took effect June 2, attorneys said in a news release. The decision to extend parole followed a \"biometrics appointment\" Friday with Sofia and Vargas at the USCIS field office in Bakersfield, attorneys said. Bakersfield is located about 100 miles north of L.A. \"We are profoundly grateful that USCIS acted swiftly to grant Sofia and her mother one year of humanitarian parole,\" Amato Lough said in a statement. \"By moving quickly, the agency has ensured that a four‑year‑old girl can continue receiving her life-saving medical treatment. We commend USCIS for its responsiveness and for recognizing the urgency of this situation. \" TheLos Angeles Timesfirst reported that Sofia is receiving treatment for a rare condition called short bowel syndrome, which requires her to receive 14 hours' worth of intravenous nutrition per day. Vargas said that when Sofia was 7 months old, she was diagnosed with the condition in Mexico and was told by doctors she had to come to the U.S. to receive life-saving care. \"Sofia's story is one of many, but life‑or‑death decisions like hers aren't always visible,\" Amato Lough said. \"Many families who seek refuge in the United States are fleeing threats you can't see and, while their wounds may be invisible, the danger they face is every bit as real.\" Matthew Rodriguez is a digital producer for CBS Los Angeles.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 3, 2025 / 10:51 PM EDT/ CBS News Police in Florida arrested a man who allegedly climbed a fence and tried to enter President Trump's Mar-a-Lago club early Tuesday, the Secret Service said. The alleged intruder — described only as an adult male — \"scaled a perimeter fence and triggered alarms\" shortly after midnight on Tuesday, a Secret Service spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. He was detained by the Secret Service \"without incident\" before local police in Palm Beach took him into custody and charged him with trespassing, according to the spokesperson. The arrested man allegedly told local police he hoped to speak with Mr. Trump about \"the gospel\" and wanted to marry his 18-year-old granddaughter, according to an arrest report obtained by thePalm Beach Daily News. CBS News has reached out to the Palm Beach Police Department. Mr. Trump was in Washington during the incident. \"No Secret Service protectees were present at the time of this incident,\" according to the agency. It's not the first time that Mar-a-Lago has faced security incidents. A manallegedly triedto enter the propertyrepeatedlylast year, both before and after the election, andtwo differentpeoplewere arrested for trespassing during Mr. Trump's first term in 2019. And Ryan Routh was charged last year with trying to kill Mr. Trump at his golf club in West Palm Beach, a few miles from Mar-a-Lago. AuthoritiessayRouth — who has pleaded not guilty —aimed a riflethrough the bushes at the edge of the property, but fled after he was spotted by the Secret Service. That was the second attempt on Mr. Trump's life last year. Joe Walsh is a senior editor for digital politics at CBS News.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 3, 2025 / 9:30 PM EDT/ CBS News Federal prosecutors charged a Southern California man with allegedly threatening to kill President Trump on Facebook after last year's election. The man — identified as 73-year-old Thomas Eugene Streavel of San Bernardino County — was indicted last week on three counts ofmaking threats against a president-elect, the Justice Department said in a news release Tuesday. An indictment unsealed Tuesday lists out a series of angry Facebook messages that Streavel allegedly penned about Mr. Trump both before and after the election — some of which expressed a desire for him to be assassinated. The charges focus on three messages allegedly written in November, the Justice Department said. Streavel was arrested Monday, and pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Tuesday. He was ordered released on $10,000 bond, the Justice Department said in itsstatement. The Secret Service is investigating the issue. Attorneys for Streavel were not listed in a federal court database. \"This defendant is charged with threatening the life of our President – a man who has already survived two deranged attempts on his life,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. Mr. Trump faced two attempted assassinations during last year's election. A shooterstruck Mr. Trump in the earat a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally in July, and a man waschargedwith trying to assassinate the then-presidential candidate at his Florida golf club in September. If convicted, themaximum sentencefor making threats against the president or president-elect is five years — though sentencing decisions are made by judges, and it is not unusual for federal criminal defendants to receive less than the maximum. In recent years, the Justice Department hasregularlybrought chargesfor threats against Mr. Trump, former President Joe Biden and other high-profile officials. Threats against officials — frommembers of Congressto judges and prosecutors — are also on the rise, authorities say. On Monday, a Romanian manpleaded guiltytoleading a ringthat targeted dozens of members of Congress and a former president with bomb threats and \"swatting\" calls — in which a person makes a false police report with the goal of drawing a massive police response.

    "title": "When a senator's husband landed on a travel watchlist, a phone call got him removed",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 3, 2025 / 8:36 PM EDT/ CBS News A U.S. senator's spouse was placed on a government watchlist in 2023 after a surveillance program flagged his travel profile, but he was removed after the senator back-channeled with administration officials, sources familiar with the situation told CBS News. Shortly after New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen spoke with the Transportation Security Administration about her husband, William Shaheen, TSA officials removed him from a list of people subjected to additional scrutiny under TSA's \"Quiet Skies\" domestic surveillance program. William Shaheen, an Lebanese-American attorney active in the Arab-American community, was then placed on a different list, which excluded him from any future advanced screening, including random checks at airport TSA checkpoints, two of the sources said. The episode took place in a heightened security environment in October 2023, days after Hamas attacked Israel and killed more than 1,200 people. TSA'ssurveillanceefforts have long attracted criticism fortrackingU.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes. The circumstances that land an individual on a list — or what gets them removed — have been mostly concealed from the public. Quiet Skies, which began in 2010, employs analysts and undercover air marshals to monitor people in airports and during flights, using outstanding warrants, facial recognition software, identification of suspicious travel patterns and behaviors and other data to try to prevent terrorist attacks. Some Americans undertake exhaustive efforts to get themselves removed from the Quiet Skies enhanced screening list — with some even engaging in protracted legal fights. Republican Tulsi Gabbard spoke out in 2024 after she was placed on the Quiet Skies list and subjected to searches and monitoring by federal air marshals. Gabbard, a former presidential candidate and Democratic member of Congress, has since been confirmed as the director of national intelligence. Shaheen's husband, according to sources, was removed from Quiet Skies two days after she contacted David Pekoske, then the TSA administrator. Pekoske served in the post under both Presidents Trump and Biden. The decision to then shield the senator's husband by putting him on what TSA calls the \"secure flight exclusion list\" marked an unusual step in a system meant to operate outside of political interference. A spokesperson for Sen. Shaheen told CBS News on Tuesday that she contacted TSA after her husband was subjected to several extensive, invasive and degrading searches at airport checkpoints – and was seeking to understand the nature and cause. Sources told CBS News that in July 2023, William Shaheen was pulled aside for extra screening at the Boston airport ahead of two flights. Officials said at the time that the security agency randomly selected travelers for additional screening, and William Shaheen had been randomly chosen. Three months later, William Shaheen was flagged by the transportation security agency because his travel companion on two flight reservations was a person listed by the FBI as a \"known or suspected terrorist,\" or KST, a broad designation that covers a wide-ranging risk profile. A federal air marshal was sent to covertly travel near them on a flight on Oct. 18, 2023, one source said. Sen. Shaheen spoke with Pekoske to ask about the situation regarding her husband. On Oct. 20, 2023, her husband was added to the \"secure flight exclusion list,\" a VIP list that exempts a traveler from the security agency's vetting and surveillance programs, including random screenings. An order from TSA headquarters was sent to ensure the safeguarded status for William Shaheen was signaled when his future boarding passes were presented at airports. The spokesperson for Sen. Shaheen said she wasn't aware that her husband had been monitored under the Quiet Skies program, or that he had later been given preferential treatment by being specifically excluded from enhanced screening. The person William Shaheen traveled with, whose identity could not be confirmed by CBS News, was removed from the FBI terrorism watchlist later in 2023, sources familiar with the matter said. It was not clear why the person was placed on the list, though a host of factors including visits to hostile countries, certain suspicious travel patterns, or contacts with designated terror suspects can all contribute to the listing. The spokesperson for Sen. Shaheen declined to identify her husband's travel companion other than to say the person was an Arab-American attorney. The senator was not given any indication the person was designated as a known or suspected terrorist, the spokesperson said. William Shaheen was recently removed from the list of people excluded from any enhanced surveillance, a Department of Homeland Security official told CBS News on Tuesday. Mr. Trump has criticized what he refers to as the weaponization of state power and the use of government levers to go after political opponents, but since his reelection, has sought to settle scores with those he perceives to have wronged him. Sen. Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee and a frequent critic of Mr. Trump and his policies, has announced she will not seek reelection in 2026. Her eldest daughter, Democrat Stefany Shaheen, is running for a seat in the U.S. House. Jennifer Jacobs is a senior White House reporter at CBS News. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "title": "\"Ice battery\" system being used to cool buildings and lower energy costs",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 3, 2025 / 8:24 PM EDT/ CBS News New York— In the heart of Manhattan, four stories below ground, the iconic Eleven Madison skyscraper is being air-conditioned using ice. \"There's about 500,000 pounds of ice created every night,\" said Holly Paeper, president of Trane Technologies, the company responsible for installing the system it calls an ice battery. \"And to put that into context, think about three city buses full of ice cubes.\" The ice battery system freezes water at night when the cost of electricity is low. Then, during the day, when the price is high, the building is cooled with the previous night's ice instead of usingexpensive electricity. Tranesaysthat this system can lower cooling costs by up to 40%. \"So, when everyone else is using their electricity in the middle of July to cool their building or to cool their homes, it's a big draw on the grid,\" Paeper said. \"This building won't draw from that because it made its ice last night.\" Air conditioning makes up about 20% of energy use in homes and businesses worldwide,according toa 2018 report from the International Energy Agency. But on the hottest days, it can account for more than 70% of electricity use during peak hours, per a2023 IEA report. \"We've done installations at about 4,000 sites globally,\" Paeper said. \"There are six million commercial buildings in the U.S. alone, and a very small fraction of them have installations like this.\" The problem that scientists like Dr. Patrick Shamberger are trying to solve isn't an overall lack of energy — it's when too many energy consumers are trying to use electricity at the same time, which puts stress on the grid. \"We don't want to build a whole bunch of excess power plants to just sit around, never turned on until that hot, hot day in August,\" said Shamberger, an associate professor of materials science and engineering at Texas A&M. \"It's a lot of capital investment that doesn't get used.\" So, instead of building more power plants, the focus is on storing energy with a system such as ice batteries. But because the process of freezing water uses a lot of energy itself, Shamberger and others are testing new materials that don't need to get as cold as ice, but can still keep buildings cool. \"We take water, we add some other elements and molecules to it,\" Shamberger explained. \"And based on the composition, we can control that temperature basically anywhere we want it, in the zero to 20 C range. And that's important, because what might work great here in Texas, maybe it's not the right temperature to store your heat at if you're in Nevada, or in Wisconsin, say.\" According toan analysis released last month by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a Washington, D.C.-based energy advocacy group, home electricity bills in the U.S. this summer are expected to rise to an average of $784 for the summer period, from June through September, up 6.2% from last year's projected average of $737. It marksthe highest such average in the 12 years that NEADA has been tracking summer residential cooling. Shamberger said he sees a world where this system can be used to cool homes. \"Absolutely, yeah...but we're a little bit far out, right?\" he said.

    "title": "Trump officials weigh rule to prevent asylum-seekers from getting work permits",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 3, 2025 / 8:18 PM EDT/ CBS News The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from getting work permits, potentially upending longstanding U.S. immigration policy, two Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News. A proposal by officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would amount to an indefinite pause on the U.S. government's decades-old policy of allowing migrants with pending asylum claims to work in the country lawfully while their cases are decided, the DHS officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The proposed changes — which have not been previously reported — would add yet another layer to President Trump's government-wide immigration crackdown, targeting a massively backlogged asylum system that his top aides have argued is being systematically exploited by economic migrants. But a halt to work permits for asylum-seekers would also trigger concerns among advocates that it could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and their families, and drive them to work illegally in the underground economy. Since the 1990s,U.S. lawhas allowed immigration officials to grant work permits to asylum applicants if their cases have been pending for at least 180 days. Generally speaking, that has allowed asylum applicants to request a work permit 150 days after they make their claim. Those eligible can be granted the permit after another 30 days. But a regulation under internal consideration by the Trump administration would suspend the issuance of new work permits to asylum-seekers until USCIS decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, the DHS officials said. That timeframe would be exceedingly difficult to meet in the near future, given massive case backlogs and operational constraints. Last year, for example,a federal government watchdog foundthat over 77% of the asylum applications before USCIS had been pending for beyond 180 days. Nearly 40% of applications remained unresolved after two years. Even if the 180-day processing average is reached, the proposal would require asylum-seekers to wait one year until after they file their application — instead of six months — to be eligible for a work permit, the DHS officials said. It's unclear when the regulation may be publicly announced, or if it will be altered before being finalized. In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, said it does not comment on the \"deliberative process or possible decision making.\" \"Over the previous four years, the Biden administration eviscerated the integrity of America's asylum system. The Department is exploring all possible options to protect our national security and increase program integrity,\" DHS said in its statement. \"DHS is working to mitigate all forms of fraud and abuse.\" The changes under consideration by the Trump administration would apply to asylum seekers with pending applications sent to USCIS and those in deportation proceedings before the immigration courts, which are overseen by the Justice Department. Asylum can be granted to foreigners on U.S. soil who prove they are fleeing persecution due to their nationality, race, religion, political views or membership in a social group. While factors like nationality and legal representation play a key role, many applicants do not ultimately meet the high legal threshold to win asylum,government figuresshow. Still, over the past decade, amid record arrivals of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, the number of asylum applications has ballooned. USCIS is overseeing roughly1.5 million asylum applications, while the immigration courts are reviewing another2 million, according to government data. The plan under consideration would seek to eliminate what Trump administration officials have described as a magnet for migrants using the asylum system simply to work in the U.S. It echoesa 2020 ruleissued by the first Trump administration that sought to increase the waiting period for asylum applicants requesting work authorization from six months to a year and impose other restrictions on eligibility for work permits. The proposed rule would also be the latest step taken by the second Trump administration to make the U.S. inhospitable for asylum-seekers. Immediately after returning to the White House in January, President Trump all but closed the U.S. asylum system, giving border agents the power to summarily deport most migrants on the grounds the country is facing an \"invasion.\" That emergency order is being challenged by pro-immigrant advocates, who say it ignores American asylum law. Conchita Cruz, the co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a group that supports those with asylum claims, said efforts to curtail work permits for the migrants she serves would hurt U.S. communities and employers. \"Asylum seekers are playing critical roles in a wide array of jobs — they are the doctors and the people cleaning the hospitals,\" Cruz said.

    "article_text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Marty McFly grabbed a guitar in \"Back to the Future\" and rocked out with the band at a 1950s high school dance, helping him narrowly avoid blinking out of existence before time-traveling back to the 1980s. The guitar, in real life, wasn't as lucky. Filmmakers went looking for the instrument while making the movie's 1989 sequel, but even now it's nowhere to be found. Four decades after the blockbuster film debuted, the guitar's creator has launched a search for the iconic Cherry Red Gibson ES-345. Gibson, which is based in Nashville, is asking the public for help tracking it down as the movie turns 40 and as the company produces a new documentary about the search and the film, \"Lost to the Future.\" In a video by Gibson, with the movie's theme song playing in the background, \"Back to the Future\" stars such as Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Harry Waters Jr. make a cinematic plea. There's also a surprise appearance by Huey Lewis, whose band Huey Lewis and the News performed the soundtrack's headliner song, \"The Power of Love.\" Lloyd, in the cadence of Doc Brown, says in the video that the guitar has been \"lost to the future.\" \"It's somewhere lost in the space-time continuum,\" says Fox, who played McFly. \"Or it's in some Teamster's garage.\" In the film, McFly steps in for an injured band member at the 1955 school dance with the theme \"Enchantment under the Sea,\" playing the guitar as students slow dance to \"Earth Angel.\" He then leads Marvin Barry and the Starlighters in a rendition of \"Johnny B. Goode,\" calling it an oldie where he comes was from even though the 1958 song doesn't exist yet for his audience. Fox said he wanted McFly to riff through his favorite guitarists' signature styles — Jimi Hendrix behind the head, Pete Townshend's windmill and the Eddie Van Halen hammer. After digging and dancing to \"Johnny B.

    "title": "Los Angeles County will pay $2.7M to teen  attacked in 'gladiator fights' at detention facility",
    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles County on Monday agreed to pay $2.7 million to a teenager who was attacked by at least six other young people at a juvenile detention center inso-called \"gladiator fights\" that were allegedly facilitated by probation officers. The boy's beating in 2023 at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall was captured on surveillance video that also showed several officials standing idly by and some of them shaking hands with the participants in the beating. A state grand jury in March charged 30 correctional officers for their role in allowing and sometimes encouraging nearly 70 fights to take place between July and December 2023. The officers face charges including child endangerment and abuse, conspiracy, and battery. More than 140 victims between the ages of 12 and 18 were involved, according to authorities. Attorney General Rob Bonta said after the charges were announced that it seemed the attacks were planned. \"They often wanted them to happen at the beginning of the day, in a certain time, in a certain place. A space and a time was created for the fights, and the plan was for the fights to happen,\" he said. The investigation began after the Los Angeles Times first obtained and published video footage that shows a then-16-year-old being attacked by at least six other young people, who came at him one by one as officers stand by watching. The video was first made public during a court hearing during which a public defender for the boy, now 17, argued to a judge that he was not safe at Los Padrinos and should be released ahead of his trial. His attorney, Jamal Tooson, said the settlement was a \"first step\" in recognizing the \"egregious\" conduct of the LA County Probation Department. \"Our priority needs to be not just protecting my client but all children in similar circumstances under the care and watch of the probation department,\" Tooson said. \"There were lawsuits prior to this. I personally represent several individuals who've been harmed at the same facility after this.\" According to a correction action plan written by the department, staff failed to review CCTV footage of the facility, delayed taking the teen to the hospital, and waited too long to notify his parents. To address these issues, the department will ensure CCTV monitors are \"staffed routinely\" and conduct random footage audits, and develop a protocol for making sure young people in custody are given medical care and their parents are informed appropriately. A judge ruled in April that the LA County Probation Department could not continue housing juveniles at Los Padrinos and approved a plan in May to move more than 100 youths out of the facility. California's state board overseeing local correctional facilities has previously ordered Los Padrinos to be shut down. Tooson believes there is a pervasive \"culture problem\" extending throughout the probation department's facilities that cannot be addressed by the correction action plan. He has filed at least 19 lawsuits in federal court alleging issues from physical violence allowed by officials to sexual assault by staff members in LA County's youth detention centers, he said. \"Until we actively start changing the mindset and behavior of those who are put into a caretaking responsibility of these youth, I think we're going to find ourselves in the same situation,\" he said.",

    "title": "Judge tells Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni to work out dispute over dismissal of claims",
    "article_text": "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni’s legal squabble over her claims of emotional distress hit a roadblock Tuesday when a federal judge refused to let Lively dismiss them on her preferred terms, instead telling both sides to reach an agreement. The recent dispute between the “It Ends With Us” co-stars, who have been entangled in ahigh-profile legal battlefor months, arose after Baldoni’s lawyers requested Lively’s medical and mental health records to defend against her claims that he intentionally and negligently inflicted emotional distress while they were on the set of the film. Lively’s initial complaintin December accused Baldoni of sexual harassment, as well as retaliation, after she raised issues about his on-set behavior — allegations Baldoni’s lawyers have denied. Since then, the two stars have been embroiled in a tense legal standoff, with each accusing the other of having orchestrated a smear campaign. Rather than provide medical and mental health records requested by Baldoni's team, Lively offered to drop her emotional distress claims, according to court documents filed Monday. In response, Baldoni’s lawyers Monday disputed her request to dismiss the claims “without prejudice,” meaning she would be able to refile them later. In a court filing, Baldoni’s team argued that Lively should permanently dismiss her claims if she will not provide the medical records it requested. In its own court filing hours later, Lively’s team called Baldoni’s motion a “false and plainly improper public relations stunt” and asked the court to deny and strike the motion entirely. On Tuesday morning, U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman of the Southern District of New York denied Lively’s request but wrote that she can file a formal motion asking for dismissal without prejudice. Otherwise, Liman wrote, Lively’s and Baldoni’s teams must agree among themselves whether the dismissal would be with or without prejudice. He also denied Baldoni’s motion to force Lively to provide her medical records, saying the request is rendered moot now that Lively is withdrawing her emotional distress claims. Liman’s ruling pressures Lively to dismiss her claims either way, as he wrote that “if the claims are not dismissed, the Court will preclude Lively from offering any evidence of emotional distress.” In a statement, Lively’s lawyers Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb wrote that Lively offered to dismiss those claims “because they are no longer necessary, and she will continue to pursue emotional distress damages through other claims in her lawsuit, including sexual harassment and retaliation.” “In addition, the Baldoni-Wayfarer strategy of filing retaliatory claims has exposed them to expansive damages under California law,” Lively’s lawyers wrote. (Wayfarer Studios, the production company behind “It Ends With Us,” which Baldoni co-founded, is a defendant along with Baldoni.) “This is exactly where both parties were before the Baldoni-Wayfarer Parties rushed to file this utterly pointless motion to compel, all searching for yet another press moment,” Lively’s lawyers wrote. Lawyers for Baldoni did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. Baldoni’s filing Monday argued that Lively was trying to avoid providing her medical records while preserving her claims of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. “Ms. Lively cannot have it both ways. If Ms. Lively wants to withdraw her frivolous IED [intentional infliction of emotional distress] Claims, the Wayfarer Parties are entitled to a dismissal with prejudice to ensure they will not be re-filed,” Baldoni’s lawyers said in the filing. “If Ms. Lively is unwilling to stipulate to the dismissal of her IED Claims with prejudice, then the Wayfarer Parties will continue to defend against them, and she must produce her medical information and documents as set forth herein.” Baldoni’s lawyers were specifically seeking the names and addresses of her health care providers, their treatment notes and signed privacy forms authorizing the release of her records. They wrote in their filing Monday that because she claimed emotional injuries, Lively has placed her mental condition “at issue” and thus “waived any doctor-patient privilege.” Lively’s lawyers countered Baldoni’s motion in their response Monday, arguing that Lively voluntarily agreed to withdraw her emotional distress claims “in good faith” to streamline the case. They added that Baldoni’s team had conceded that that means their request for medical records would become moot. Lively’s filing also claimed that Baldoni’s lawyers did not raise any objections to her proposed revisions to the joint stipulation for dismissal during a conference call Monday. It alleged that Baldoni’s team instead rushed to file a “clearly pre-written Motion the minute that the teleconference concluded.” “Almost immediately thereafter, tabloid media began reporting ‘exclusively’ on Ms. Lively’s ‘shock’ move, claiming that she has ‘sensationally’ dropped her IIED claim, quoting extensively from the Motion,” Lively’s filing said. Aside from asking the court to deny and strike the motion, Lively’s lawyers had asked Liman on Monday to consider sanctions for the opposition’s “continued abuse of this Court’s docket.” “The Motion was filed for a single audience: the media,” Lively’s filing said. “There is nothing for this Court to compel.” Lively and Baldoni are expected to go to trial in March.",

    "title": "Authorities reveal possible new look for 'Devil in the Ozarks' escapee",
    "article_text": "It has been nearly 10 days since the convict depicted in an HBO documentary as the \"Devil in the Ozarks\"escaped from an Arkansas prison, long enough for his appearance to possibly change. On Tuesday, the Arkansas Department of Corrections distributed a photo illustration of Grant Hardin, 56, with a short beard and a mustache. \"With over a week passing since Hardin escaped the North Central Unit, we are releasing a possible updated headshot which could reflect how he might look today,\" the department said in a statement. Hardin escaped from the North Central Unit in Calico Rock on May 25. Prison officials said he was seen on security video pushing a cart that carried wooden pallets while wearing a law enforcement-style uniform, apparently to evade the attention of guards. Hardin was briefly the police chief of Gateway, Arkansas, in 2016. That year, one of his victims, city water department employee James Appleton, criticized Hardin for encouraging police pursuits and handing taxpayers the allegedly increasing bill for police vehicle repairs. Cheryl Tillman, Appleton’s sister and the current mayor of Gateway, said in theHBO documentarythat her brother and Hardin clashed over the issue in 2016. Hardin resigned after four months, according to the documentary. On Feb. 23, 2017, Hardin fatally shot Appleton, according to a law enforcement affidavit filed in court, earning him a 30-year sentence after he pleaded guilty. When authorities ran Hardin's DNA, they discovered it was a match for evidence in the 1997 on-campus rape of an elementary school teacher, for which he was eventually also convicted under a guilty plea and then sentenced to 50 years in prison. Prison officials said Tuesday that the search for Hardin is focused on his native north-central Arkansas region, wherehis parents still call the town of Garfield home. The combined reward for information leading to his capture has risen to $25,000 after the FBI doubled its $10,000 contribution last week and then the U.S. Marshals Service contributed $5,000, the Corrections Department said. Hardin is white, stands 6 feet, 2 inches tall, weighs around 259 pounds and has brown hair and blue eyes, authorities said. Possible sightings and information about where he might be should be reported to the FBI, the Corrections Department said.",

Back in 2020, Phasmophobia took the formula of reality shows like Ghost Adventures, where frat boys explore a haunted location saying \"woah\" at every sound, and turned it into early access gold. It was ourco-op game of the year, won best debut at The Game Awards, and has gone on to sell 23 million copies. Now it's being made into a movie. The Phasmophobia movie will be produced by two studios with experience in horror and videogame adaptations: Blumhouse (M3GAN, Five Nights at Freddy's) and Atomic Monster (The Conjuring, Mortal Kombat). While I'm sure they could make a movie about some dopes investigating haunted houses and getting strangled by ghosts without paying for the rights to Phasmophobia, it's good name recognition sure to appeal to anyone who has fond memories of waving crucifixes and thermometers around a child's bedroom in the dark. Fun times. \"We never could've imagined the incredible heights this game would reach when it launched five years ago,\" said Daniel Knight, lead developer of Phasmophobia, \"and we're so thankful to our amazing community for the lasting impact Phasmophobia has had in the gaming space and beyond.

    "title": "The new Arctis Nova 3 looks like SteelSeries is min-maxing the midranged headset with both hardware and software",
    "article_text": "The lavendar and aqua colourways are also really nice to see as a standard option. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. SteelSeries has announced the latest in its lineup of gaming headsets with the TheArctis Nova 3 Wireless Series. It comes in two variations, the 3P for PlayStation, and the X3 for Xbox, but both work with PC and Switch The Arctis Nova 3 is a bit of a step down from some of the very impressive headsets we've reviewed like theArctis Nova Pro, but comes with a price to match. It looks like the Nova 3 series is all about bringing whatever SteelSeries can manage from those higher-end headsets into something more folks can afford. But the first exciting thing we need to address on these headsets are the colours. Without even needing a collab, the Arctis Nova 3 line of headsets come in black, white (eh,) aqua (oooh), and lavender (aaaaah). They haven't skimped on the colour either, with each headset featuring an allover paintjob, including the recessed SteelSeries logo on the side, and even the detachable microphone. Aside from the colour offerings, these headsets sport custom Neodymium Magnetic Drivers drivers, with up to 40 hours of battery life. They work with both Bluetooth and a USB-C dongle for high-speed 2.4GHz wireless, and you can quickly swap between wired devices. Plus there's optimised fast charging that boasts 90 minutes of play time after only a 15 minute charge. All packed into, what looks like a fairly comfortable set that weighs only 260g. This actually seems like a great deal in a headset that's only a little over $100 USD. But according to SteelSeries, it's not just the hardware but the software that makes this headset worth buying. It pairs with the new Arctis App, which is free on both the Google Play and Apple App stores. This app lets you do a little more than the usual array of sound control and customisation, which is always helpful in a gaming headset so you can use your phone rather than having to pause the game. It also has over 200 presets for various games and playstyles. It seems like overkill, but in a headset where money is being saved being able to dial in the sound this way means you can push the hardware available much further. It's still almost certainly overkill, but I'd be keen to see how much they can elevate this new Arctis to maybe even something like theArctis 7, or5X. These headsets should be up on the SteelSeries website now, retailing for $199 AUD, $119.99 USD, or €109.99. If these specs and hardware can push this midranged headset into the upper levels then that's a huge win for SteelSeries, and for the consumer. Just think, you can use the money you've saved on your headset for more important things, like the same headset in the other cool colour.

Kick your game off with our hint for today'sWordleand watch those yellow and green letters roll in. You could also try saving it for later, a little bit of help kept to one side just in case you need it. Either way, it'll definitely help you win this Wednesday. As will the June 4 (1446) answer, just a click away if you want to take a cheeky peek. Wait, done already? Really? Thanks for that quick win, second row, but now what am I supposed to do with my free time? Still, definitely better than yesterday's performance. If you like the idea of winning in two and don't want to risk it, make sure you take a look at the help we've got for you below, OK? This word brings things to a halt. A full stop. If something was happening before, it's not now. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. Playing Wordle well is like achieving a small victory every day—who doesn't like a well-earned winning streak in a game you enjoy? If you're new to the daily word game, or just want a refresher, I'm going to share a few quick tips to help set you on the path to success: There's no time pressure beyond making sure it's done by the end of the day. If you're struggling to find the answer or a tactical word for your next guess, there's no harm in coming back to it later on. You've just won. The answer to the June 4 (1446) Wordle isCEASE. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Knowing previous Wordle solutions can be helpful in eliminating current possibilities. It's unlikely a word will be repeated and you can find inspiration for guesses or starting words that may be eluding you. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and it's your job to work out which five-letter word is hiding by eliminating or confirming the letters it contains. Starting with a strong wordlike LEASH—something containing multiple vowels, common consonants, and no repeat letters—is a good place to start. Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second go should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" guess to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do.

    "article_text": "The hardware you need to not set your PC on fire. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've been hanging out for Remedy's next game after falling head over heels in love with the devs last big hit Control. So whenFBC: Firebreak was announcedby the brand last year I was delighted to see the team is bringing acooperative shooter into this twisted world. Control resonated with me so intensely it's in my top ten games of all time. This is in no small part thanks to how deeply weird the game can be, and FBC: Firebreak is looking to ramp this right up for some silly fire-zombie shenanigans. With any new game to release, there's always the question of hardware. And given how much of a Ray Tracing demon Control was for its time, I was a little worried about how demanding FBC might end up. There's not much reason to get excited for a game that my machine can't even run. Well thankfully Remedy recently announced the required specs over onBlueSky, and this is looking like a game that will still run, even on a fairly dated rig. So not only is FBC: FIrebreak lookingto respect my time, it might respect my wallet as well. To run at 1080p 60 with quality upscaling you only need a Nvidia GTX 1070, or an AMD RX 5600 XT. This needs to be paired with at least an Intel i5-700k or anAMD Ryzen5 1600X, as well as 16GB of RAM. You'll also need 30 GB of SSD storage to store and run the game from. Really, that's some super minimal stuff. While it'll only run the game on low settings, I'm impressed it would do it at all, so props to Remedy for giving some of us still rocking the older hardware a chance. Naturally the recommended specs are a fair bit more demanding than the minimum. These will let you run the game on medium settings at 1440p 60 FPS with quality based upscaling. For this you'll be needing a much more recent GPU, with at least an Nvidia RTX 3060 or an AMD RX 6600 XT, giving you at least an extra 2 VRAM over those minimum specs. It's recommended to pair these with at least an Intel i5-8500 or AMD's Ryzen 5 2600 CPU and still have at least 16 GB of RAM. To step that upscaling up to 4k performance levels, Remedy recommends upgrading that GPU. AnRTX 3070orRX 6800 XTcan level this gaming experience up to High presets. If nothing else, this tier demonstrates just how far a GPU upgrade can really go to helping you enjoythis game built for chaotic joy. If you want the high-definition Ray Tracing experience of your lives, then Remedy's High Ray Tracing tier is probably what you're after. These settings deliver a 4k 60 FPS experience with performance upscaling like before as well as High Ray tracing enabled. Hold your breath mind, as Remedy recommends you're packing anRTX 4080orRX 9070 XTbefore attempting these settings. Your CPU also needs an upgrade, with ani7-8700kor5 3600specified. The good news is your 16 GB of RAM should still be enough, so you can save some cash there at least. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And look, I'm not going to lie. Control looks amazing on rigs that can do it justice and I'm beating FBC: Firebreak will too. All those fire infected hiss-like creatures will no doubt look incredible reflecting off the shiny walls of the oldest house offices, but they don't have to. I'm excited to be able to play this game with more friends than I initially expected, even if theirweird pink blobs of goodon't look as good as mine. Best CPU for gaming: Top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game first.

Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon puts an interesting spin on Arthurian legend and presents a competent world that plays like a love letter to the open-world first-person RPG genre. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. The setup is this: you're an escaped prisoner who gets wrangled into defending the war-torn isle of Avalon from an impending otherworldly force called the \"wyrdness.\" And also the soul of the centuries-dead King Arthur has hitched a ride on your subconscious. After centuries of imprisonment, he wants to take back his kingdom, and you just happen to be the most ideal vessel for this task. What is it?An open-world first-person RPG that puts a unique spin on the legend of King Arthur.Expect to pay:$45/£38Developer:QuestlinePublisher:Awaken RealmsReviewed on:Radeon RX 7800 XT, Ryzen 5 7600, 32 GB RAMMultiplayer?NoSteam Deck:VerifiedLink:Official site There's a sense of confidence in Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon. You can see it in the world design, feel it in the colorful cast of characters. 'Skyrim but you're also haunted by the ghost of King Arthur' is a concept thatdemandsambition. But developer Questline is an untested studio, and fumbling the ball was always going to be a strong possibility. After dozens of hours, I’m happy to report that we have a genuinely fascinating open-world first-person RPG experience on our hands. It's not without blemishes, though. Yes, Tainted Grail is sure of itself, but for every moment worth celebrating there's also a frustrating enemy encounter or a confusing UI feature to endure. The resulting game can be summed up in one word: inconsistent. Tainted Grail is a dark fantasy take on Arthurian legend set in the same world as the popular board game; in fact, it came to be thanks to the wild success of the 2018 Kickstarter campaign for the tabletop game. Being a first-person open-world RPG, Tainted Grail invites comparisons to genre mainstays like The Elder Scrolls and Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and it unabashedly leans into those influences—it even opens with an Oblivion-style prison break. You'll level up skills as you use them, rewarding whatever playstyle you happen to be rolling with at the time; I tended to favor a battlemage-style build with a magic spell in one hand and a sword in the other. Each cast grew my magic power, each swing made me stronger with one-handed weapons. I've always been a big fan of this system in the Elder Scrolls games, and it's used to good effect here. There are traditional skill trees, too. More than 20 of them, in fact, offering more substantial upgrades to your abilities. I felt overwhelmed in the early game when deciding what playstyle to try out, but skill points are plentiful enough that I felt free to experiment. The world is also a lot of fun to explore. The realm of Avalon is divided into three different hub regions, each with their own storyline and biome. The environments are very pretty and loaded with points of interest to explore, like caves and abandoned villages. I found something useful—a new piece of armor, a new crafting recipe—almost everywhere I looked. There's very little filler space in the game's large maps. During your journey, you'll make several forays into the \"Wyrdrealm,\" an alternate dimension populated by spirits and otherworldly monsters. The design of this realm is filled with character, from huge statues of eldritch creatures to a skyline of crumbling towers. Trips here were always full of surprises and I often looked forward to the next mission that took me to the Wyrdrealm. For me, though, Tainted Grail shines brightest with its characters. Every NPC has something worthwhile to contribute, and most of them offer side quests that add new wrinkles to the larger story. They can also be surprisingly funny: you'll help a nobleman fake his death to get out of a loveless marriage, uncover the lair of an undead chef chasing the next great meal, assist a woman who accidentally turned her husband into a pig, and more. That sense of humor extends to gear too, with a haunted chest piece that screams in agony as you take damage and a magic spell that can turn enemies into cheese. The larger story is a lot of fun too. Awaken Realms and Questline have presented a unique take on the tale of King Arthur, steering it into dark fantasy territory. There are a lot of clever twists on familiar tropes, like the roles played by Arthur's closest confidants, including Galahad and Merlin. Tainted Grail is ambitious and grand in scope, so it's surprising that it's as technically sound as it is. Games of this scale tend to come with a bunch of bugs and glitches, but I experienced very little during my 40-plus hours; the most glaring hiccup I encountered was a few dropped lines of dialogue. It's likely that the game's two years in early access on Steam played a large role in this technical feat. There's a lot to like about Tainted Grail, but Questline's ambition runs ahead of its execution in myriad small ways: little quirks here and there that don't amount to much individually, but, taken together, lessen the immersion and lead to some frustration and monotony. My biggest complaint here is with some of the worldbuilding. I don't want to disparage the work of any voice actors, but it feels like many of them weren't briefed on some important bits of lore. For example, Cuanacht, the name of the second region of the game, is pronounced at least four different ways. This is true for a handful of other proper nouns, too, like \"Dal Riata,\" and \"Osbryht,\" and it makes the world feel less cohesive. (This could have been a way to differentiate between cultures, but I didn't notice any in-game reasons for the different pronunciations.) Some more variety in enemy design would have been welcome as well. You can only kill so many bandits with the same face before it becomes rote, and the liberal use of palette-swapped monsters makes the world of Avalon feel smaller than it is. The upside is that boss encounters feel novel and unique, such as a Davy Jones-type squid pirate, or a deer spirit that can clone itself. With boss designs like that, it's a shame the intervening chaff feels so repetitive. There are some design decisions that I'm not too keen on. Being limited to only four weapon loadouts was a bit disappointing, and having to menu my way back to the weapons screen got tedious every time I wanted to experiment with something new. By and large, though, the first-person combat feels smooth—sword swings have weighty impact and spells explode in showers of sparks and ice. However, there are a couple difficulty spikes that caught me off guard. There were times when I'd breeze through most of a dungeon's monsters, taking them out with just a couple spell casts, only to come up against a boss that may as well have been a brick wall for all the damage I did. This didn't happen often but it was discouraging when it did. Exploring the world's dungeons and caves offers worthwhile rewards, but the design of these places is often disorienting. Pathways twist and turn, crossing over themselves in maze-like tunnels. I got lost more than a few times in these labyrinths, and the lack of a minimap was very much noticed. Confusingly, you can't seem to be able to access the full world map inside dungeons either. There's a lot to like about Tainted Grail, and the good outweighs the bad by a fair margin. In a genre largely dominated by Bethesda and Obsidian, it's good to see a new developer making its mark, and Questline is punching above its weight. Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon puts an interesting spin on Arthurian legend and presents a competent world that plays like a love letter to the open-world first-person RPG genre.

    "title": "Free ChatGPT users can finally stop re-explaining themselves in every session",
    "article_text": "OpenAI is upgrading ChatGPT's memory even if you don't pay When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. OpenAIhas a reliable strategy of releasing new ChatGPT features for paying subscribers first before rolling them out to everyone. If you didn't remember that, don't worry because ChatGPT can do so for you now, even if you don't subscribe to ChatGPT Plus or another tier. The memory improvements for ChatGPT aren't exactly the same as those offered with a subscription, but they are potentially very significant for users interested in personalizing their AIchatbotexperience. Like paid tier users, free ChatGPT users can now access the \"memory\" feature and turn on ChatGPT's recall. That means the AI will be able to reference recent conversations to make its answers feel a little more tailored to you. Suppose you told the AI a while ago that you wanted help learning Italian or that you wanted dairy-free recipe ideas. Now, if you ask for dinner suggestions, it might recommend something like “risotto alla Milanese with a plant-based twist” and suggest providing you with the recipe in Italian to help you practice. It's not precisely what paid users get from ChatGPT's memory. The “lightweight” version of memory, as OpenAI calls it, is only designed for the short term. ChatGPT can remember a few recent details, but it won't have a long-term, detailed, and persistent memory. That's still reserved for ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. It's a matter of days versus months of remembered conversations. You don't have to let ChatGPT remember things, of course. You can toggle off saved memories and chat history at any time. There's also the “Temporary Chat” option, essentially an incognito or guest mode that doesn't save anything to ChatGPT's memory. There is also a slight geographical variation in how the new ChatGPT memory functions. For most users, if ChatGPT memory is enabled, it will update automatically. If you're a free ChatGPT user in pretty much all of Europe, however, you won’t get the memory feature by default. You’ll need to opt into it in the Memory section of your ChatGPT's memory feature is part of OpenAI’s effort to make interacting with AI chatbots on a regular basis feel more natural and personalized. The company's vision is of an ongoing relationship between you and your AI assistant, not just an intermittent and brief chat for a single request. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. And memory is arguably a fundamental step toward making AI more useful in everyday life. After all, remembering previous conversations is essential to any ongoing relationship between people. Remembering who someone is and details about them i how you seperate a strangerf from an acquaintance, friend, or even enemy. . Though the free-tier memory isn't as robust as the subscriber's version, it's still a good way for ChatGPT to demonstrate its benefits to ChatGPT users. It's easy to imagine it helping convince people to pay $20 a month for the more comprehensive version. And if they don't remember how to sign up, ChatGPT will be happy to remind them of the necessary steps.

    "title": "Apple TV 4K is still your best bet for streaming privacy for one key reason, report claims",
    "article_text": "Apple's streaming box doesn't have ads front and center When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There is no shortage ofstreaming boxesor streaming sticks, but ever since the originalApple TVwas unveiled, the Cupertino-based tech giant’s offering has always been decidedly premium. And beyond the easy integration with otherAppledevices and the ability to live within the ecosystem, it’s also earned an accolade for being one of the best privacy-focused streaming boxes. That is, according to a new report from the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) who spoke withArs Technica. It all comes back to the idea of many streaming boxes integrating advertisements directly into the experience. You’ll find that onRokuas well as onAmazonFire TV devices, which in some cases have full banner ads. It’s also common for smart TVs, from the likes ofLGandSamsung, as well. The director of the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), RJ Cross, told them, “Apple’s primary business model isn’t dependent on selling targeted ads, so it has somewhat less incentive to harvest and monetize incredible amounts of your data.” And it’s a good point, since this also limits the amount of tracking Apple might need to do on the device. Yes, your recently watched list is available and can sync across devices, and content recommendations are also available. However, it’s not engaging ACR (or “automatic content recognition”) to track everything you’re doing on the device. This technology is primarily used to track viewing habits and what has been consumed on a TV, ultimately to build a profile. However, Apple has confirmed to Ars Technica that at this time or in the past, the streaming box has not used this technology. That’s a big win for consumers and comes to the ultimate recommendation from PIRG that the Apple TV4Kis the best bet for privacy-conscious consumers who want a best-in-class streamer. You’ll still need to sign in with your Apple Account and agree to “Data & Privacy” terms during the setup process, but it’s less demanding than other streamers on the market. The data that is collected, like what you or other profiles on the Apple TV 4K are watching or searching for, is done so anonymously, meaning it’s not traceable back to you or any other user on the streaming box. That data, once anonymized, can be shared with streaming services that use Apple’s APIs and offer apps. Here, additionally, you do have the ability to turn off some of the personalization and recommendation features. When you use Siri, either through the Siri Remote that pairs with the Apple TV or another Apple device to control the Apple TV 4K, those conversations will fall under Apple’s general Siri privacy stipulations. For some requests and asks, the transcription is sent anonymized with no personal details to Apple’s servers, but it will only stick around for at most six months. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. You can see the conversation between Ars Technica and the Public Interest Research Grouphere. If you’ve been considering the Apple TV 4K,you can read TechRadar’s full review here. It’s expected that atWWDC 2025– Apple’sWorldwide Developers Conference– a major update for tvOS will be announced, introducing a new look that we’ll likely call sleek, along with some other more advanced features. With tvOS 18 last year,Apple gave subtitles a significant upgrade. When you hit mute, it automatically starts closed captioning. It was a small change that made a big difference.

    "article_text": "The US Navy has been directed to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a replenishment oiler named after the slain gay rights activist and Navy veteran, as part of a broader initiative by President Donald Trump to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) references within the military. The upcoming renaming has not yet been officially confirmed but was outlined in an internal memo, multiple defensesourcestold Military.com and other US media on Tuesday. The USNS Harvey Milk was named in 2016 by then-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to honor Milk’s service and activism, and it was christened in 2021 by a transgender veteran. Milk, who became an American LGBT icon as the first openly gay official elected in the state of California, served in the US Navy in the 1950s before being discharged due to his sexual orientation. Less than a year after he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Milk was assassinated in 1978 by a fellow board member who had clashed with him over city policy. The renaming aligns with the Trump administration’s efforts to reestablish a“warrior culture”and remove DEI initiatives from federal agencies.The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the ship’s new name had not yet been chosen. The decision, coming during Pride Month, has drawn harsh criticism from Democrats, with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemning the move as a“shameful, vindictive erasure”of civil rights figures’ legacies. California Governor Gavin Newsom also slammed the decision as a sign of“Trump’s contempt for the very values our veterans fight to protect.” The Navy has not yet officially announced a new name for the vessel, and it remains unclear whether other John Lewis-class ships – all named after civil rights leaders – will also be renamed. Other ships in the fleet are named after African-American civil rights leader John Lewis, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, former US Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and women’s rights activists and abolitionists Lucy Stone and Sojourner Truth.",

    "title": "Pornhub threatens to pull out of France",
    "article_text": "Pornhub, one of the world’s largest adult content platforms, has threatened to cease operations in France over the country's stringent age verification regulations, which it claims leave users’ private data vulnerable to bad actors, hacks, and leaks. The platform’s parent company, Aylo – which also operates popular adult sites such as RedTube and YouPorn – has expressed concerns over the feasibility of complying with the French requirements by the June 7 deadline. Starting on Wednesday, French users will be greeted by a message denouncing the age verification demands, aiming to explain directly“how dangerous, how potentially privacy-infringing, and how ineffective the French law is,”a company representative told AFP. The French regulatory body, Arcom, mandated that adult websites implement robust age verification systems to prevent minors from accessing explicit content under a law passed in 2023. Non-compliance could result in significant fines or blocking of the website within France. The legislation envisions the use of third-party verification technologies that would confirm a user’s age without collecting personal data. However, Aylo has argued that the current technological solutions either infringe on user privacy or are not sufficiently reliable. The company insists it supports age verification – but calls for more secure, device-level solutions. “Google, Apple, and Microsoft all have the capability built into their operating systems to verify the age of the user at the operating system or device level,”said Solomon Friedman, vice president for compliance at Canadian private equity firm Ethical Capital Partners, which owns Aylo.“I understand that those three entities are large and powerful, but that is not an excuse for France to do what they have done.” The French government maintains that these measures are essential for protecting minors online. Culture Minister Aurore Bergé accused Pornhub, YouPorn, and RedTube of refusing to“comply with our legal framework”and deciding to leave“for the better.” “There will be less violent, degrading, and humiliating content accessible to minors in France. Bye,”Bergé wrote on X on Tuesday. France’s Digital Minister Clara Chappaz added that“requiring pornographic sites to verify the age of their users isn’t stigmatizing adults, but rather protecting our children.” Last month, President Emmanuel Macron confirmed his support for mandatory age verification not only for adult websites but also for teenagers registering on social media platforms, stating that online networks have contributed to suffering and mental health issues among young people. France, Spain, and Greece are also advocating for mandatory age verification on platforms such as Meta’s Facebook and Elon Musk’s X, according to Bloomberg. The three nations reportedly argue that the“lack of proper and widespread age-verification mechanisms”hampers enforcement of age limits. They aim to leverage the EU’s economic power – with its 450 million consumers – to compel tech companies to implement robust verification systems.",

(Photo: Ayumi Hamasaki/Instagram, Reuters/Hamad I Mohammed) This audio is generated by an AI tool. J-pop star Ayumi Hamasaki has shut down rumours that she had a child with Elon Musk. The rumours started when, during an interview with American newspaper The New York Times in late May, author Ashley St Claire said that Musk was the father of the child of “a Japanese pop star”. St Claire announced on X in February that she and the Tesla CEO share a son. Musk has 14 known children. Hamasaki, who has two young children, spoke up against the rumours on Monday (Jun 2) on Instagram, denying the viral speculations.The 46-year-old star said in Japanese: “I’ve been keeping an eye on this, and I guess it’s time for me to speak up. Elon Musk is not the father of [either of] my children.” She added: “I mean, I can understand if someone were to think it seems like the sort of thing I’d do.Even my mum laughed when she heard the rumours, saying, ‘This seems kind of Ayu-like,’ and if I were someone else, I’d probably be saying ‘Ayu is the pop star [St Claire] was talking about, right?’” However, she added, the rumours that Musk fathered one of her kids is \"just not true”. Hamasaki was previously married to Austrian actor-model Manuel Schwarz from 2011 to 2012, and to American medical student Tyson Bodkin from 2014 to 2016. She also had a seven-year relationship with actor-singer Tomoya Nagase, which ended in 2007. “Setting aside my personal image, when my kids are old enough to start googling things, I don’t want them to run into the rumours and think they’re true, so I’m firmly denying them,\" Hamasaki said. Hamasaki, best known for her songs Seasons (2000) and Blue Bird (2006), debuted in 1998 with her album A Song For XX and recently released her newest single Mimosa on Apr 8, commemorating her 27th anniversary. She is also the first female solo artiste in Japan to have 25 consecutive No 1 singles. In 2008, Hamasaki revealed that she had gone deaf in her left ear due to an ear infection she had caught in the middle of her tour in 2000. By 2017, she also began experiencing hearing loss in her right ear. Despite her condition, the singer has continued to tour and make music. She is currently on her Asia tour 2025 titled I Am Ayu Ep II, which includesa stop in Singaporeon Jul 5 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.

    "title": "Scientists in Japan develop plastic that dissolves in seawater within hours",
    "article_text": "Sustainability Sustainability A researcher shows a sample of ocean-degradable plastic at the Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS) of Japanese research institution Riken in Wako, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, on May 27, 2025. (Photo: REUTERS/Manami Yamada) WAKO, Japan: Researchers in Japan have developed a plastic that dissolves in seawater within hours, offering up a potential solution for a modern-day scourge polluting oceans and harming wildlife. While scientists have long experimented with biodegradable plastics, researchers from the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science and the University of Tokyo say their new material breaks down much more quickly and leaves no residual trace. At a lab in Wako city near Tokyo, the team demonstrated a small piece of plastic vanishing in a container of salt water after it was stirred up for about an hour. While the team has not yet detailed any plans for commercialisation, project lead Takuzo Aida said their research has attracted significant interest, including from those in the packaging sector. Scientists worldwide are racing to develop innovative solutions to the growing plastic waste crisis, an effort championed by awareness campaigns such as World Environment Day taking place on Jun 5. Plastic pollution is set to triple by 2040, the UN Environment Programme has predicted, adding 23-37 million metric tons of waste into the world's oceans each year. \"Children cannot choose the planet they will live on. It is our duty as scientists to ensure that we leave them with best possible environment,\" Aida said. Aida said the new material is as strong as petroleum-based plastics but breaks down into its original components when exposed to salt. Those components can then be further processed by naturally occurring bacteria, thereby avoiding generating microplastics that can harm aquatic life and enter the food chain. As salt is also present in soil, a piece about 5cm in size disintegrates on land after over 200 hours, he added. The material can be used like regular plastic when coated, and the team are focusing their current research on the best coating methods, Aida said. The plastic is non-toxic, non-flammable, and does not emit carbon dioxide, he added.

    "title": "Snap Insight: South Korea’s Lee Jae-myung has won the presidency. Now comes the hard part",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary Lee Jae-myung’s victory, despite several ongoing criminal trials, reflects the strong public disapproval of the conservative Yoon administration, says the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy’s Ryu Yongwook. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Exactly six months ago, hundreds of ordinary citizens flocked to the National Assembly to prevent then president Yoon Suk Yeol’smartial law order. On Wednesday (Jun 4), South Koreans woke up to anew president – Lee Jae-myungfrom the progressive Democratic Party. He won the country’s highest-turnout election in nearly three decades in polls held on Tuesday. Mr Lee, a former child factory worker turned human rights lawyer turned politician, secured 49.4 per cent of the vote, defeating conservative candidate Kim Moon-soo by more than 8 percentage points. The voter turnout of 79.4 per cent was the highest since 1997. His victory, despite ongoing criminal trials for charges including bribery and corruption, reflects the strong public disapproval of the Yoon administration’s martial law declaration and its handling of the aftermath. It also marks a tremendous comeback for Mr Lee, who lost the 2022 election to Yoon by a razor-thin 0.7 percentage point. In his victory speech on Wednesday morning, Mr Lee called for national unity and restoration of democracy, and vowed to become a leader for every Korean and to improve the lives of ordinary people. This is a welcome message, as intense political polarisation has divided the Korean society and stifled the functioning of government in recent years. Mr Lee faces a tough road ahead, however, as he inherits a set of internal and external challenges. The most pressing task for Mr Lee is to boost the sluggish Korean economy. Just last week, the Bank of Korea slashed its 2025 economic growth forecast to a meagre 0.8 per cent, down from 1.5 per cent in February. At the same time, inflation remains above 2 per cent, which implies that real growth has been negative, while housing prices in Seoul have increased beyond what most people can afford. Mr Lee has already promised a major stimulus package of 35 trillion won (US$25 billion), but an expansive fiscal policy of this sort can only be a short-term measure. What is required is fundamental reform that tackles structural issues – declining productivity, ageing society and the world’s lowest fertility rate, medical and pension reforms, controlling housing prices and upskilling the population for emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. It calls for the re-writing of a social contract that deals with how to generate and distribute wealth in a productive, fair and equitable manner. Successive Korean administrations have largely avoided dealing with these issues in the past, as structural reforms would cause controversy and prove unpopular. Mr Lee must show political courage and lead on structural reforms, not only to rejuvenate the ailing Korean economy, but to prevent deeper social fracture in the years ahead. Mr Lee’s foreign policy will be tested early. On North Korea, he favours engagement and negotiation, while simultaneously recognising the importance and utility of military deterrence. With a progressive administration in South Korea once again in place, along with United States President Donald Trump and Pyongyang’s Kim Jong Un – the configuration behind the Singapore and Hanoi summits in 2018 and 2019 – this raises the possibility of more diplomatic activities. While conditions have changed, especially with North Korea’s recent military partnership with Russia, both Mr Trump and Mr Kim appear interested in giving negotiation another shot. The Lee administration will seek to play a more active and conducive role in making progress on the North Korea issue. On the US-China rivalry, the Lee administration will come under greater pressure to enhance its cooperation with Washington. Mr Lee has pledged to enhance the alliance with the US and further develop the US-Japan-South Korea trilateral. At the same time, he has repeatedly said that South Korea must not be drawn into any conflict between the US and China, including over Taiwan. He calls this “pragmatic” diplomacy serving South Korea’s national interests. This balancing act is tricky. Mr Lee must show deft diplomatic skills if he is to navigate turbulent external circumstances and make progress on the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula. Otherwise, his pragmatic diplomacy could end up weakening the alliance with the US or degenerating South Korea to become a pawn in the great power strategic game. With Mr Lee’s victory, the Democratic Party will control the legislature and the executive. As president, Mr Lee can appoint three judges on the Constitutional Court, meaning progressive-leaning judges will dominate that court. In addition, Mr Lee might also seek to expand the number of Supreme Court judges, as a way to appoint more progressive judges on the supreme court. This would consolidate his power and control of all branches of government. The conservatives are deeply concerned about this situation and believe that Mr Lee will use his power to avoid his criminal investigation and charges, thereby weakening Korean democracy. The progressives vehemently disagree and believe that the conservative People Power Party must be dissolved for its role in supporting or defending Yoon’s martial law. If both sides maintain their views, Korean politics will continue to suffer from political polarisation and wrangling. Mr Lee’s political skills and leadership will be tested and assessed on how Korean democracy consolidates during his presidency. One hopes that he will rise above his personal or narrow group interests and promote the fundamental democratic principle of checks and balances across different branches of government.

    "article_text": "Business Business FILE PHOTO: A logo of Renault is seen inside a Renault car dealer in Arnhem, Netherlands February 18, 2025. REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw/ File Photo LONDON/PARIS :Dutch car sharing firm MyWheels will plug in the first of 500 grid-connectable Renault EVs to its fleet in the Netherlands this week, expanding the number of vehicles in Europe capable of strengthening the power grid as the technology gains traction. Vehicle-to-grid technology, known as V2G, allows electric vehicles to store power and provide it to the electricity grid at times of peak demand. The technology has been available for several years but only recently became commercially viable after the introduction of smart charging technology and batteries able to sustain intensive usage. The rollout by MyWheels will be the largest V2G car-sharing scheme in Europe and the largest addition of V2G-enabled cars in the region. It follows growing concern about grid stability after a major blackout in Spain and Portugal this year, and sabotage to power supply in southern France during this year's Cannes film festival, which have triggered more interest in a technology that can help balance fluctuating supply and demand, said Kees Koolen, an investor in We Drive Solar, the Dutch producer of the special chargers used in the project.

REUTERS/Takahiko Wada/File Photo TOKYO :Japan currently has no plan to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) but must continue innovating its payment and settlement system in an increasingly cash-less society, a senior central bank official said on Wednesday. Although banknote issuance remains high in Japan, usage of notes could fall significantly in the future amid rapid digitalisation, said Bank of Japan (BOJ) Executive Director Kazushige Kamiyama. \"As such, Japan must consider what steps it can take now to ensure its retail settlement system is convenient, efficient, accessible universally, while being safe and resilient,\" he said in a speech. While the BOJ currently has no plan to issue a CBDC, it must keep up efforts to enhance the safety and efficiency of Japan's payment and settlement system, Kamiyama said in a meeting with  private firms on a pilot programme for developing a digital yen.

    "title": "Australian mushroom murders accused gives her account of fatal lunch",
    "article_text": "World World A court sketch drawn from a video link shows Erin Patterson at the Latrobe Valley Magistrates' Court in Morwell, Australia, on Jun 2, 2025. (Photo: AAP via Reuters) SYDNEY: An Australian woman accused ofmurdering three of her estranged husband's elderly relativeswith poisonous mushrooms gave her account of the fatal lunch on Wednesday (Jun 4), in a case that has gripped the public. Erin Patterson, 50, is charged with the July 2023 murders of her mother-in-law Gail Patterson, father-in-law Donald Patterson and Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson, along with the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson, Heather's husband. The prosecution alleges she knowingly served the guestslethal death cap mushrooms in a Beef Wellingtonat her home in Leongatha, a town of around 6,000 people some 135km from Melbourne. She denies the charges, with her defence saying the deaths were a \"terrible accident\". She faces a life sentence if found guilty. The accused, the first witness for her own defence and who began her evidence on Monday afternoon, repeatedly wept as she told the court on Wednesday she may have accidentally included foraged mushrooms into the food she served. \"Now I think there was a possibility there were foraged ones in there,\" she said as she was questioned by her own barrister, Colin Mandy. The court also heard on Wednesday that Erin Patterson had invented medical issues partly to elicit sympathy from her estranged husband's relatives, from whom she said she felt she was growing apart. \"I didn't want their care of me to stop, so I kept it going. I shouldn't have done it,\" she told the court. \"Did you lie to them?\" Mandy asked. \"I did lie to them,\" the accused replied, through tears. The prosecution alleges Patterson invented the medical issues to lure the victims to her home for the meal, a claim she denies. The prosecution rested its case on Monday, following a month of evidence from witnesses, including relatives and medical, forensic and mushroom experts. The trial, which began on Apr 29, has seen intense interest from Australian and international media, with podcasters, journalists and documentary-makers descending on the town of Morwell, around two hours east of Melbourne, where the trial is being held. State broadcaster ABC's daily podcast about proceedings is currently the most popular in the country, while many Australian newspapers have been running live blogs on the case. The trial, scheduled to conclude this month, continues.

Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by six runs in the final in Ahmedabad, Gujarat on Tuesday, a long-awaited title win which reduced 36-year-old Kohli to tears. Kohli has been with the franchise since the inaugural 2008 edition of the league and helped them reach three previous finals in 2009, 2011 and 2016, losing all three. Former South Africa wicketkeeper-batter De Villiers played for Bengaluru from 2011-2021 while ex-West Indies all-rounder Gayle represented them from 2011 to 2017, with both experiencing the heartache of lost finals beside Kohli.

(Photo: Reuters/Pool/Anthony Wallace) SEOUL: South Korea's new liberal President Lee Jae-myung pledged on Wednesday (Jun 4) to raise the country from the near destruction caused by a martial law attempt and revive an economy besieged by global protectionism that is threatening its very existence. Lee's decisive victory in Tuesday's snap election stands to usher in a sea change in Asia's fourth-largest economy, after backlash against a botched attempt at military rule brought down Yoon Suk Yeol just three years into his troubled presidency. He faces what could be the most daunting set of challenges for a South Korean leader in nearly three decades, ranging from healing a countrydeeply scarred by the martial law attemptto tackling unpredictable protectionist moves bythe United States, a major trading partner and a security ally. \"A Lee Jae-myung government will be a pragmatic pro-market government,\" he said after taking the oath of office at parliament, a location where six months ago he jumped over the perimeter wall to enter the chamber and avoid martial law troops barricading it to vote down the decree.

He promised deregulation to spur innovation and growth in business and pledged toreopen dialogue with North Koreawhile maintaining a strong security alliance with the United States and bringing balance to diplomacy. \"It is better to win without fighting than to win in a fight, and peace with no need to fight is the best security,\" he said on the country's often violent ties with rival North Korea. Lee was officially confirmed earlier as presidentby the National Election Commission and immediately assumed the powers of the presidency and commander in chief, speaking with the top military leader to receive a report on defence posture. With all the ballots counted, Lee won 49.42 per cent of the nearly 35 million votes cast while conservative rival Kim Moon-soo took 41.15 per cent in the polls that brought the highest turnout for a presidential election since 1997, official data showed. Lee has said he would address urgent economic challenges facing the country on the first day in office with a focus on the cost-of-living concerns affecting middle and low-income families and the struggles of small business owners. He also faces a deadline set by the White House on negotiating import duties that Washington has blamed for a large trade imbalance between the countries. South Korean stocks rallied on Wednesday morning, with the benchmark KOSPI rising more than 2 per cent to its highest in 10 months, with the financial sector leading the gain on expectations of market reform by Lee. Renewable energy stocks also rose. Lee has pledged a shift to a greener energy mix. The government under a caretaker acting president had made little progress in trying to assuage crushing tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump that would hit some of the country's major industries,including autos and steel. \"President Lee will find himself with little to no time to spare before tackling the most important task of his early presidency: reaching a deal with Trump,\" the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio congratulated Lee on his election win and said the countries \"share an ironclad commitment\" to their alliance grounded on shared values, and deep economic ties. He also said that the countries were \"modernising the Alliance to meet the demands of today’s strategic environment and address new economic challenges.\" The White House said the election of Lee was \"free and fair\" but the United States remained concerned and opposed to Chinese interference and influence in democracies around the world, according to a White House official. Lee has expressed more conciliatory plans for ties with China and North Korea, in particular singling out the importance of China as a major trading partner while indicating reluctance to take a firm stance on security tensions in the Taiwan strait. Still, Lee has pledged to continue Yoon's engagement with Japan and said the alliance with the United States is the backbone of South Korea's global diplomacy.

(Photo: AFP/Nhac Nguyen) HANOI: Vietnam's communist government has scrapped its long-standing policy of limiting families to two children, state media said Wednesday (Jun 4), as the country battles to reverse a declining birth rate. The country banned couples from having more than two children in 1988, but a family's size is now a decision for each individual couple, Vietnam News Agency said. The country has experienced historically low birth rates during the last three years, with the total fertility rate dropping to just 1.91 children per woman last year, below replacement level, the ministry of health said this year. Birth rates have fallen from 2.11 children per woman in 2021, to 2.01 in 2022 and 1.96 in 2023.

She urged society to shift its mindset from focusing solely on family planning to a broader perspective of population and development. Vietnam is also grappling with sex imbalances due to a historic preference for boys. On Tuesday the ministry of health proposed tripling the current fine to US$3,800 \"to curb foetal gender selection\", according to state media. The gender ratio at birth, though improved, remains skewed at 112 boys for every 100 girls. Hoang Thi Oanh, 45, has three children but received fewer benefits after the birth of her youngest, due to the two-child policy. \"It's good that at last the authorities removed this ban,\" she said, but added that \"raising more than two kids nowadays is too hard and costly\". \"Only brave couples and those better-off would do so. I think the authorities will even have to give bonuses to encourage people to have more than two children.\" Vietnam's giant neighbour China ended its own strict \"one-child policy\", imposed in the 1980s due to fears of overpopulation, in 2016 and in 2021 permitted couples to have three children. But as in many countries, the soaring cost of living has proved a drag on birth rates and the moves have failed to reverse China's demographic decline -its population fell for the third year in a row in 2024.

    "title": "US-backed Gaza aid group to halt distribution on Wednesday, UN to vote on ceasefire demand",
    "article_text": "World World People walk as Palestinians receive aid supplies from the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, in the central Gaza Strip on May 29, 2025. (File photo: REUTERS/Ramadan Abed) CAIRO/JERUSALEM: The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation will not give out any aid on Wednesday (Jun 4) as it presses Israel to boost civilian safety beyond the perimeter of its distribution sites, a day afterdozens of Palestinians seeking aid were killed. The GHF said it has asked the Israeli military to \"guide foot traffic in a way that minimizes confusion or escalation risks\" near military perimeters; develop clearer guidance for civilians; and enhance training to support civilian safety. \"Our top priority remains ensuring the safety and dignity of civilians receiving aid,\" said a GHF spokesperson. An Israeli military spokesperson warned civilians against moving in areas leading to GHF sites on Wednesday, deeming them \"combat zones\". The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it opened fire on a group of people it viewed as a threat near a GHF food aid distribution site. The International Committee of the Red Cross saidat least 27 people were killed and dozens injured. The GHF said the incident was \"well beyond\" its site. Palestinians who collected food GHF boxes on Tuesday described scenes of pandemonium, with no-one overseeing the handover of supplies or checking IDs, as crowds jostled for aid. The UN Security Council is also set to vote on Wednesday on a demand fora ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamasand humanitarian access across Gaza, where aid has trickled amid chaos and bloodshed after Israel lifted an 11-week blockade on the enclave where famine looms. \"It is unacceptable. Civilians are risking – and in several instances losing – their lives just trying to get food,\" UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday, adding that the aid distribution model backed by the US and Israel was \"all a recipe for disaster, which is exactly what is going on.\" That model is run by the newly created GHF, which started operations in the enclave a week ago and said on Tuesday that it has given out more than seven million meals from three so-called secure distribution sites. GHF Interim Executive Director John Acree urged humanitarians in Gaza: \"Work with us and we will get your aid delivered to those who are depending on it.\" The UN and other aid groups have refused to work with the GHF because they say it is not neutral and the distribution model militarizes aid. GHF uses private US security and logistics companies to get aid to the distribution sites. It is the latest in a string of efforts to get more aid into the enclave, where experts say the entire population of some2.1 million people is at risk of famine. Jordan last year spearheaded humanitarian air drops, while the US briefly installed a floating aid pier, but it was beset by challenges. The UN has long-blamed Israel and lawlessness in the enclave for hindering the delivery of aid into Gaza and its distribution throughout the war zone. Israel accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the group denies. Israel said on Tuesday that three of its soldiers had been killed in fighting in northern Gaza. Gaza health officials said at least 18 more Palestinians were killed in other military strikes in the territory on Tuesday. Reuters could not independently verify the reports in northern and southern Gaza. The 10 elected members of the UN Security Council have asked for the 15-member body to vote on Wednesday on a draft resolution that demands \"an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza respected by all parties.\" The draft text, seen by Reuters, also demands the release of all hostages held by Hamas and others, and the immediate lifting of all restrictions on the entry of aid and its safe and unhindered distribution, including by the UN, throughout Gaza. \"The time to act has already passed,\" Slovenia's UN Ambassador Samuel Zbogar told Reuters. \"It is our historical responsibility not to remain silent.\" As US President Donald Trump's administration tries to broker a ceasefire in Gaza, it was not immediately clear if Washington would veto the draft text. A spokesperson for the US mission to the UN said: \"We cannot preview our actions currently under consideration.\" A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain or France - to pass. The war in Gaza has raged since 2023 after Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in Israel in an Oct 7 attack and took some 250 hostages back to the enclave, according to Israeli tallies. Israel responded with a military campaign that has killed over 54,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, which do not distinguish between fighters and non-combatants.

    "title": "Singapore to acquire two Malaysian-owned land plots for Woodlands Checkpoint expansion",
    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore The two land parcels have a total area of 0.79ha, slightly larger than a football field, and are vegetated and unused. The facade of Woodlands Checkpoint. (File photo: CNA/Syamil Sapari) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) gazetted the acquisition of two land parcels on Wednesday (Jun 4) for the redevelopment and expansion of Woodlands Checkpoint. The land parcels are currently owned by the Malaysian government. In a joint press release, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and SLA said that they will work closely with the Malaysian government through the acquisition process. \"We will continue our strong partnership with the Malaysian government to strengthen connectivity and people-to-people links,\" the Singapore authorities said. The two land parcels have a total area of 0.79ha, slightly larger than a football field. They are vegetated and unused and are located near the middle of the planned redevelopment area. The acquisition of land is part of ICA’s plan on redeveloping and extending Woodlands Checkpoint in phases over the next 10 to 15 years to \"provide a long-term solution to the chronic congestion at this land crossing\", said the joint press release. In 2024, the daily volume of travellers at Woodlands Checkpoint rose by 22 per cent, increasing to 327,000 from 269,000 in 2023. During the year-end school holidays in 2024, a record 376,000 travellers passed through the checkpoint on Dec 20 2024. By 2050, the average daily number of travellers at Woodlands Checkpoint is projected to reach 400,000. In 2024, ICA said that Singapore had written to Malaysia in May 2022 and in November 2023to propose the purchase of the land. Under Phase 1 of the construction process, ICA will build an extension of Woodlands Checkpoint at the Old Woodlands Town Centre. Construction works are anticipated to start in the third quarter of 2025. This extension will include new automated clearance facilities for cargo vehicles and arriving vehicles. The Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) will also be extended to create a direct route for vehicles exiting Woodlands Checkpoint to access the expressway, reducing traffic congestion on local roads during peak hours. Subsequent phases will comprise building additional clearance facilities andretrofitting the existing checkpoint. The full redevelopment of Woodlands Checkpoint aims to improve clearance efficiency across all modes of transportation, reduce average travel time during peak periods to 15 minutes and increase automation by incorporating systems for automated in-car immigration clearance. ICA will also be able to conduct security checks away from the main checkpoint structure and provide holding areas for vehicles within the checkpoint to alleviate congestion on the BKE and surrounding roads. \"ICA will continue to leverage technology and develop innovative solutions to facilitate cross-border travel and trade, while keeping our borders secure,\" said the release.

For private individual vehicles without a valid VEP, the summons must be paid and VEP registration completed before exiting Malaysia. Private individual vehicles with pre-registered but unactivated VEPs will be issued summons, and payment must also be made before exiting Malaysia, the ministry said.

It said 36,511 of the tags have not been activated. A total of 2,660 VEP tags have been installed and activated for private company vehicles, it said. Motorists have been given sufficient time to get their permits in order, Loke said. “We said in October we’ll start with a soft approach and advocacy,” he said, adding that authorities acknowledged motorists had difficulties with the registration process. “Before this, no Singaporean vehicles were given fines for not having VEP.” In this first phase of enforcement, 52,012 Singaporean vehicles were randomly inspected and 2,245 – or slightly more than 4 per cent – were issued reminder notices for not having registered for a VEP. Loke said he was confident that a majority of Singapore motorists will register before Jul 1, calling Singaporean drivers “law-obedient”. VEP enforcement will be done at various spots outside the checkpoints to ensure smooth flow of traffic, Loke said. A team of Road Transport Department (JPJ) officers will issue errant drivers a physical compound slip, which they must settle before leaving Malaysia, he said. Fines can be paid using cashless methods at JPJ counters, JPJ mobile counters or online via the MyEG website. Loke said enforcement of VEP would not be done “24 hours”, but stressed that authorities would automatically know which vehicles do not have VEP. When CNA asked if action will be taken against Singapore motorists with outstanding traffic fines in Malaysia, Loke said “that’s part of the VEP implementation”. “They are subject to enforcement if they have outstanding summonses,” he said. “They are supposed to pay up before they leave.” The VEP is a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag used to track foreign vehicles and note if their drivers have outstanding fines on traffic offences in Malaysia. Between 1990 and June 2024, Singapore motorists racked up more than 35,000 unpaid summonses, totalling RM3.5 million, Malaysia police previously said. Malaysia announced last May that all foreign-registered vehicles entering the country by land from Singapore would be required to use VEPs from October 2024. Following the announcement, Singapore drivers scrambled to register their cars under the VEP scheme, creating a bottleneck in applications as many expressed frustration over delays in getting their RFID tags. Four days before the start of the VEP enforcement, the JPJ said it would be \"executed in phases\", and that Singapore cars yet to install VEP tags by the Oct 1 deadline would still be allowed to enter Malaysia. The Malaysia government had previously said that motorists who fail to install a VEP may be fined up to RM2,000 or jailed for up to six months.

The world's top-selling automaker will take its supplier private through a complex 4.7 trillion yen ($33 billion) deal, offering 16,300 yen a share for Toyota Industries. That price was well below the closing price of 18,400 yen on Tuesday, before the deal was announced. Shares of Toyota Industries were down 12.3 per cent in morning trade in Tokyo at 16,135 yen.

Late on Tuesday, Trump signed an executive proclamation that puts into effect from Wednesday his surprise announcement last week that he was taking the tariffs on steel and aluminium imports that had been in place since Marchto 50 per cent from 25 per cent. \"We started at 25 and then after studying the data more, realised that it was a big help, but more help is needed. And so that is why the 50 is starting tomorrow,\" White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said in explaining the move at a steel industry conference in Washington on Tuesday. The increase comes into effect at 12.01am (12.01pm Singapore time). The increase applies to all trading partners except Britain, the only country so far that has struck a preliminary trade agreement with the US during a 90-day pause on a wider array of Trump tariffs. The rate for steel and aluminium imports from the UK - which does not rank among the top exporters of either metal to the US - will remain at 25 per cent until at least Jul 9.

Wednesday is also when the White House would like trading partners to submit their proposals for deals that might help them avoid Trump's hefty \"Liberation Day\" tariffs from taking effect in five weeks. Administration officials have been in active talks with a number of countries since Trump announced a pause on those tariffs on Apr 9, but to date only the UK deal has come to fruition. Even that agreement, which provided the basis for the carve out from the metals tariffs, is more of a preliminary framework for more talks. With just weeks remaining, the Trump team is eager to bring more deals over the line. Reuters reported on Monday that the US Trade Representative was asking countries to list their best proposals in a number of key areas, including tariff and quota offers for purchase of US industrial and agricultural products and plans to remedy any non-tariff barriers. In turn, the letter promises answers \"within days\" with an indication of a \"landing zone\", including what tariff rates countries can be expected to be saddled with after a 90-day pause on the tariffs expires on Jul 8. At issue for most trading partners is whether they retain the current baseline rate of 10 per cent on most exports to the US after that date, or something sharply higher in many cases. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt confirmed the report on Tuesday, saying: “USTR sent this letter to all of our trading partners just to give them a friendly reminder that the deadline is coming up.\" Other items requested by the Trump administration include any commitments on digital trade and economic security, along with country-specific commitments, according to the letter. Japan, a major US trading partner, has not received such a letter, top government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi told a regular press conference. \"Regarding US tariff measures, negotiations are underway between Japan and the United States,\" Hayashi said. \"The government will keep on tackling them, doing our utmost and giving them a top priority.\" The US embassy in Tokyo did not immediately comment.

Other Asian shares also extended a global rise on Wednesday following data indicating the US economy remained resilient. Speculation that United States President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinpingwill speak this weekstoked optimism for a soothing of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. However,Trump's ramped-up tariffs on aluminium and steel imports- announced on Friday - are due to kick in later on Wednesday, highlighting the uncertainty caused by the White House's off-the-cuff policies. Traders in Asia took the baton from a positive Wall Street, where all three main indexes were lifted by data showing US job openings unexpectedly rose in April, calming worries about the impact of Trump's tariff blitz on the world's number one economy. The reading came ahead of crucial non-farm payrolls figures on Friday, which are closely followed by the US Federal Reserve as it maps monetary policy in light of weak growth and fears of tariff-fuelled inflation. \"Growth is sputtering, the second half looks increasingly cloudy, and everyone knows the Fed's rate-cut cavalry will ride in eventually. It's already priced, already scripted - no one's shocked by the plot twist unless, of course, inflation proves stickier than expected,\" said Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management. \"But what's genuinely keeping equities ticking higher is the soft hum of hope - that US-China tensions could thaw into something warmer than their current frosty detente,\" Innes said. He added that the risk of tariffs, \"once a terrifying monster, now looks more like a toothless terrier's wag, comforting investors enough to hold their ground despite the global economy's chills\". Traders are awaiting further developments onthe China-US frontafter White House officials said the two nations' leaders could talk this week, even after Trump accused Beijing of violating last month's detente that slashedtit-for-tat tariffs. News that eurozone inflation had eased in May to its lowest level in eight months - and slipped back below the European Central Bank's 2 per cent target - added to the upbeat mood. Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Wellington, Taipei, Manila and Jakarta all rose.

    "title": "Industry group calls for retail lease reforms amid soaring rents, including limits for foreign tenants",
    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore The Singapore Tenants United for Fairness recommended policies to address what it calls “new and foreign players” with deep pockets and low-cost supply chains. Interior of a mall in Singapore. (File photo: iStock) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Optical retail chain managing director Bernard Yang has been hit by a double whammy in recent years – sluggish sales and rising operational costs, including rents. These pressures led Nanyang Optical to make some tough choices at its Marine Parade outlet, like cutting the hours of its part-time staff and downsizing its unit by almost half. “In our years of running retail in Singapore … (rent has) been going up all the time. It's a question of how much,” Mr Yang told CNA. \"If we were to keep the same unit, I think it's going to be very tough moving into the future, because I do see consumers’ spending habits changing quite a lot. People are very comfortable buying online, going overseas,” he added. Because of this, the company is focusing on growing its e-commerce platform and could adopt a “hybrid retail” model in the future. Soaring rental costs –a long-standing pain pointfor businesses – prompted the Singapore Tenants United for Fairness (SGTUFF), a cooperative representing more than 700 business owners, to release a new white paper in recent weeks. The group noted that rental costs can take up 30 to 50 per cent of revenue for food and beverage as well as retail businesses. “Without legislative intervention in this area, many of the remaining small local players will not be able to survive,” it said in the white paper. “Singapore as a whole will also be poorer off when what remains of our local shopping and dining vibrancy and sense of community gets further wiped out.” While retail rents across Singapore stayed stable in the first quarter of the year, falling 0.5 per cent according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority, an average of 450 retail stores shuttered monthly within that period. Last year, more than 3,000 food and beverage (F&B) establishmentsclosed in the country– the highest in almost two decades since 2005. Owners told CNA then that rising operating costs, including rent, took a toll on their business. SGTUFF is calling for retail lease reforms that include a cap on rental lease renewals, more prime spaces for local players, and penalties for landlords if they keep the shops empty for more than three months. It also recommended policies to address what it calls “new and foreign players” with deep pockets and low-cost supply chains, who are willing to pay premium rents. Among its policy suggestions are an additional property tax for non-local retail tenants, reduced foreign worker quota, and higher levies for foreign workers. It has also called on the government to find ways to release more retail space not just to private landlords, but social enterprise cooperatives or private entities that are not purely for profit. SGTUFF chairperson Terence Yow said the group’s idea of a cap on lease renewals came from other developed markets around the world such as Japan and Sweden, where rent renewals for commercial spaces are pegged to a formula or measure like the consumer price index. “We think that such indexing of rent renewal increases is very fair … and is a fair reflection of market conditions, rather than very arbitrary or mercenary … price increases, which are too much of a shock for businesses today,” he told CNA on Monday (Jun 2). Mr Yow also said that while retail leasescurrently must comply with a code of conductfor fair negotiations between tenants and landlords, this is not enough. “We think (it’s) ultimately about a very short supply of prime retail spaces versus still existing and new demand,” he noted. “Whether they are new local players or big foreign players, (they are) continuing to express interest, and are willing to pay and bid for very high rentals and pay well-above pocket prices for local labour.” He said the surge in rental costs is an “urgent issue” that the group has raised for some time now. But a “confluence of forces” like labour shortages and lower consumer spending has intensified the situation, prompting renewed calls for action. It is in talks with Enterprise Singapore and hopes to reach some agreements in the coming months. “We recognise that it is a symbiotic relationship. Tenants need landlords to do well and landlords need tenants to do well,” Mr Yow added. “So we hope over the next few months, we can quickly come to some agreement on what are the right, urgent, short- and long-term measures, and start to implement some of them.” Analysts said that the problem is unlikely to resolve soon, particularly as more international firms continue entering the Singapore market. “If it's a safe haven with the geopolitical uncertainties, people will try to look to Singapore to invest, and they do not know the environment - and they are doing it not necessarily for capitalistic reasons alone, and because there's this safe haven element in it,” said Savills Singapore’s executive director for research and consultancy Alan Cheong. “(Being in a) safe haven doesn't necessarily mean that you need to eke out a positive economic value-add to themselves and to the economy. “Consequently, the ecosystem by the local established chains, F&B, retail industries also get affected by this weight of money coming in.” This would lead to foreign brands dominating prime locations in malls, Mr Cheong warned. He suggested that beyond slowing or freezing rent hikes, landlords can help stabilise the market by showing social responsibility rather than chase higher-paying tenants. CNA contacted all major landlords, most of whom declined to comment. Lendlease – the developer behind several malls like 313@somerset and Jem – said it takes a tailored approach to support tenants through different stages and formats, such as pop-up stores. Mr Yow warned that if things do not change on the rental front, “copycat malls” will start popping up and people will not be incentivised to try their hand at running small businesses. “I think you will see the bottom falling out. I think you will continue to see … an acceleration of local small players – many of whom have been in business for 5,10, 20, 30, years – continue to drop out from the market because it's just not sustainable,” he said. “They cannot just keep increasing their prices. It doesn't work that way.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

(Credit: UNTV) The U.S. rejected aUnited Nations Security Councilresolution calling for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, standing by Jerusalem. France, the U.K., Russia and China all supported the resolution, which received 14 votes in favor and one vote against, meaning it was not adopted by the council. \"It is inexplicable that many members of this council still refuse to acknowledge that Hamas could end this conflict tomorrow by surrendering and laying down its arms. It is unconscionable that the U.N. still has not labeled and sanctioned Hamas as a terrorist organization,\" U.S. Chargé d’Affaires Dorothy Shea said.

Hamas was not condemned in the draft resolution, which only included a demand that terror organizations in Gaza release the remaining 58 hostages. Israeli Ambassador to the United NationsDanny Danon thanked the U.S. for voting against the resolution. \"We thank the United States for standing on the right side. For standing on the side of truth, justice, and moral clarity. Thank you for refusing to abandon the hostages and for refusing to legitimize the lies of this resolution,\" Danon said in a statement.

Barbara Woodward defended her country’s decision to vote in favor of the resolution, saying that \"the intolerable situation in Gaza needs to end.\" She said that the U.K. is \"determined to see an end to this war,\" condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza and called on the Jewish state to ease restrictions on humanitarian aid. Director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust Anne Bayefsky slammed the resolution and its \"obscene equation between the hostages — who have been starved, tortured and executed over the past 19 months — and Palestinian prisoners convicted of heinous crimes.\" However, Bayefsky argued that the resolution was not just about the U.N. attacking Israel, it’s about members of the international body taking a swipe at PresidentDonald Trump. \"Make no mistake, this is an attack on the United States, and President Trump in particular, by the French and the British, who are attempting to use the United Nations to sideline and belittle the U.S.,\" Bayefsky told Fox News Digital. Shea also had a warning for the world body. \"Engaging in this performative process at a time when serious questions are being asked about the utility of the U.N., its funding and use of resources is shameful.

If you care about aid, then help ensure it reaches civilians and not terrorists.\" Ultimately, Danon said that the resolution \"betrays the very people it claims to protect.\" Rachel Wolf is a breaking news writer for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.",

    "article_text": "Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss Ukraine's targeting of a key bridge connecting Russia and Crimea, the latest on the push for an Iran nuclear plan and antisemitism on college campuses. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday came out swinging at the U.S.’ most recent proposal, which apparently included a call for zero uranium enrichment, to which theIranian leadersaid was \"100 %\" against Tehran’s interests. The issue of whether the U.S. would push a complete ban on uranium enrichment – a process that is needed to produce nuclear energy as well a warhead – came into question this week afterreporting suggesteda U.S. proposal submitted to Iran through Omani mediators on Saturday allowed for \"low levels\" of enrichment. PresidentDonald Trumpappeared to refute this in asocial media postthis week, and on Wednesday, Khamanei, who did not comment directly on the specifics of the proposal, said that \"In the current nuclear talks that are being mediated by Oman, the U.S.’s proposal is 100% against the spirit of ‘We can’.\" U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, left, shakes hands with Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi in Muscat, Oman, on April 12, 2025.(Oman News Agency/ Handout via Reuters) TRUMP REAFFIRMS HARD-LINE ON IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL: 'WILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM' President Trump on Wednesday said he spoke with Russian President Putin on Iran's nuclear program and both were in agreement that Tehran \"cannont have a nuclear weapon.\" \"President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion,\" Trump said in a readout detailing their discussion. \"It is my opinion that Iran has been slowwalking their decision on this very important matter, and we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!\" The U.S. has not said how much time it will allow negotiations with Iran to continue for Khamanei did not say that Iran was unwilling to continue negotiating with the U.S., though Tehran has repeatedly insisted that azero-enrichment policyis a non-starter. \"A nuclear industry without enrichment capabilities is useless, because we would then be dependent on others to obtain fuel for our power plants,\" he said. Included in the proposal was apparently a call for a regional coalition for enrichment that could provide Iran with the uranium it needs for civilian projects, like energy. \"What the U.S. is demanding is that you should have no nuclear industry at all and be dependent on them,\" Khamanei pointed out. Iranian authorities said this week that this idea was not a new concept, and while Tehran is not opposed to being part of such a coalition, it would not serve as an adequate substitute even though Iran relies on nuclear energy forless than 1%of its energy consumption.

Iran has also repeatedly claimed it does not intend to develop a nuclear weapon, though its near-weapons-grade enrichment levels and missile program have suggested otherwise and prompted immense concern amonginternational security officials, including the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.

TheUnited Nationshas issued a litany of criticisms of Israel’s handling of the war as Palestinians in Gaza struggled under the blockade that was reinstated after the ceasefire collapsed in March. Israel lifted restrictions on humanitarian aid in May.

It undermines it. It ignores a working system in favor of political agendas. It ignores the one party still endangering civilians in Gaza: Hamas. The group that hijacks trucks and stockpiles the aid to their benefit,\" Israeli U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said ahead of the vote. Israeli Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Oren Marmorstein told Fox News Digital that the resolution does not do enough to link the release of hostages to the establishment of a ceasefire. The Israeli official also said the resolution would allow Hamas to stay in power. \"So basically, what this proposal is favoring or offering to do is to enable Hamas to come up with another October 7th massacre,\" Marmorstein told Fox News Digital. He added that Hamas said it would carry out another violent attack like the one on Oct. 7, 2023.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) filed acomplaint against Texasto block the state’s two-decade-old law that provides in-state tuition to illegal immigrants. Hours after the DOJ filed the complaint, Texas officials agreed to comply with federal law and stop providing illegal immigrants with in-state tuition costs, The Texas Tribunereported. The complaint was filed Wednesday in the Northern District of Texas against the State of Texas and several Texas officials to get Texas to comply with federal requirements. Under federal law, higher education institutions are prohibited from providing benefits to illegal aliens not offered to U.S. citizens.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., says the debt limit increase included in President Donald Trump's bill is a deal-breaker for him: \"It's just not a conservative thing to do.\" President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" is projected to increase the debt by $3 trillion, with interest, or $5 trillion if made permanent, according to estimates. An estimate of the House-passed bill by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects it would add more than $2.4 trillion to primary deficits before interest over 10 years, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), a nonprofit public policy organization. As of Wednesday, thenational debt, which measures what the U.S. owes its creditors, was $36.2 trillion, and the national deficit, which occurs when the federal government’s spending exceeds its revenues, was $1 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.

TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' FACES RESISTANCE FROM REPUBLICAN SENATORS OVER DEBT FEARS The White House launched a new website tabulating how much the \"big, beautiful bill\" is anticipated to save Americans. A public policy group estimates the bill would increase the debt by trillions of dollars, based on estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.(White House) \"Based on CBO’s estimate, the House-passed bill includes roughly $5.3 trillion of tax cuts and spending partially offset by $2.9 trillion of revenue increases and spending cuts,\" a CRFB statement said. \"Most significantly, the policies put forward by the Ways & Means Committee would increase deficits by $3.8 trillion, on net, while the policies in the Energy & Commerce title would reduce deficits by $1.1 trillion. With interest, the bill would add nearly $3.0 trillion to the debt through 2034 – or $5.0 trillion if various temporary provisions are made permanent.\" \"OBBBA (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) would add far too much to the debt as written and could lead to far more fiscal damage than reported if temporary provisions are extended as intended,\" the group said. It noted that the bill would boost near-term inflation, increase interest rates, add unnecessary complexity to the tax code as well as weaken market confidence and slow long-term economic growth. It urged the Senate to make the bill \"more responsible.\" PRICE TAG ESTIMATE FOR HOUSE GOP TAX PACKAGE RISES TO $3.94T Sen.

    "article_text": "House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that he and Elon Musk discussed the big beautiful bill and he was surprised when the tech billionaire came out fiercely against the legislation. Elon Musk’s tirade against PresidentDonald Trump’s\"big, beautiful bill\" has forced House Republicans to scramble to respond on Wednesday. GOP lawmakers who had spent months praising Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts are now working to avoid a war of words with the tech billionaire as he calls on them to scrap months of work in favor of a new budget reconciliation bill. \"He didn’t make it any easier for the bill,\" Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wis., told Fox News Digital. He noted that the bill also had its opponents in the Senate, where at least three fiscal hawks are calling for deeper cuts than the recent version passed by the House, which rolls back roughly $1.5 trillion in federal spending over 10 years. Fitzgerald questioned, however, what Musk’s endgame was. SCOOP: HOUSE GOP MEMO HIGHLIGHTS REPUBLICAN WINS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was \"surprised\" by Elon Musk's criticism of the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"(Associated Press) \"If it was to truly kill the bill, then – I get it, he’s not an elected official – but you never really make such a bold statement without having a Plan B, and clearly, there’s no Plan B,\" he said. House GOP lawmakers have for the most part, however, appeared in agreement on Musk ultimately having little impact on their actions. \"I don’t think he carries the same kind of gravitas that he did,\" Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., said. Another House Republican told Fox News Digital, \"When he’s not standing by the president’s side, he doesn’t have the same weight.\" Congressional Republicans are working to pass a mammoth bill advancing Trump’s priorities on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt via the budget reconciliation process. Reconciliation allows the party in power to totally sideline opposition – in this case, Democrats – to pass a sweeping piece of fiscal legislation by lowering the Senate’s threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51. But there are rules and limitations for what can be included in the budget reconciliation process. House GOP leaders say they will seek to codify spending cuts identified by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) via the annual congressional appropriations process. That has not stopped Musk from unleashing his fury against the bill over the money it could add to the already$36 trillion-and-counting federal debt. \"Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL,\" Musk wrote on X, among other posts. President Donald Trump is pushing Republicans to pass his agenda(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) The Tesla founder made a veiled threat against lawmakers’ seats as well, \"In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\" House GOP leaders and the White House, meanwhile, have closed ranks around the bill. \"I want Elon and all my friends to recognize the complexity of what we've accomplished here. This extraordinary piece of legislation – record number of savings, record tax cuts for the American people and all the other benefits in it,\" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.,told reporters in responseto Musk. \"We worked on the bill for almost 14 months. You can't go back to the drawing board, and we shouldn't. We have a great product to deliver here.\" But Musk’s comments appear to have created a difficult political situation for some fiscal hawks who aired concerns about the bill before ultimately voting for it after GOP leaders made some last-minute changes tightening Medicaid work requirements and green energy subsidy cutbacks. MIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET ‘BIG, 'BEAUTIFUL’ WIN AS BUDGET PASSES HOUSE \"I wish [Musk] had been cheering from the stands before we had the vote, that would have helped us, but we are where we are,\" House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., who fought for more conservative changes, told reporters. He side-stepped a question on whether he was worried about election threats from Musk. \"I’m going to be – I hope that Elon continues to stay in this fight because I’m philosophically aligned with him, with his effort to try to balance this budget,\" Burlison said. House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, meanwhile, said he believes Musk is wrong but conceded his opinion mattered to at least part of the GOP base. House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, said Musk has ‘created a bigger challenge’((Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)) \"The challenge is, he's a he's a credible guy, and he's done, a patriotic service,\" Arrington said, referring to DOGE. I just think he's just wrong about his comments that mischaracterize the one big, beautiful bill.\" \"So to say that it's a problem or that it has created a bigger challenge for us, is true. Because he's got a big voice, he's got a big audience. And more importantly, it's a credible voice. But he's wrong on this issue.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Conservative Rep. Mark Harris, R-N.C., said, \"I would have preferred that he not go the direction that he went…maybe it was to encourage Congress to get on the ball with these rescissions packages that are coming.\" The White House, meanwhile, has stood by the bill. \"The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. It doesn't change the president's opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill, and he's sticking to it,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.

    "title": "Trump foe Judge Boasberg rules deported migrants can challenge removals, in blow to admin",
    "article_text": "Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., dissects the legal battle between the Trump administration and Judge James Boasberg over deportation flights on ‘Fox News Live.’ U.S. District Judge James Boasberg on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to provide all non-citizens deported from the U.S. to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador to be afforded the opportunity to seek habeas relief in court, and challenge their alleged gang status— the latest in a heated fight centered on PresidentDonald Trump'suse of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport certain migrants. \"In short, the Government must facilitate the Class’s ability to seek habeas relief to contest their removal under the Act,\" Judge Boasberg said in the order, filed late Wednesday afternoon. \"Exactly what such facilitation must entail will be determined in future proceedings. Although the Court is mindful that such a remedy may implicate sensitive diplomatic or national-security concerns within the exclusive province of the Executive Branch, it also has a constitutional duty to provide a remedy that will ‘make good the wrong done.’\" Notably, the order also includes Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Salvadorian migrant andalleged MS-13 memberwho was deported from Maryland to El Salvador in March in what administration officials have acknowledged was an administrative error. That case alone had touched off a heated court fight, which prompted intervention from the Supreme Court in April. WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS? A split image of U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, left, and U.S. President Donald Trump, right. Judge Boasberg will hear from Trump lawyers and plaintiffs in an amended Alien Enemies Act case on Wednesday, a high-profile hearing likely to spark fresh ire from Trump.(Getty Images) At least 261 migrants were deported in the first wave of flights to El Salvador, including more than 100 Venezuelan nationals who were subject to removal \"solely on the basis\" of the law temporarily blocked by the federal district court. Judge Boasberg's new, 69-page order begins by invoking Franz Kafka’s \"The Trial,\" in which the protagonist, Josef K., awakens to find two strange men outside his room, who proceed to arrest him for unspecified crimes. \"Such was the situation into which Frengel Reyes Mota, Andry Jose Hernandez Romero, and scores of other Venezuelan noncitizens say they were plunged on March 15, 2025,\" Boasberg begins, before outlining the lengthy, complex saga that has spawned dozens of federal court challenges across the country— though the one brought before his court on March 15 was the very first— and which later prompted the Supreme Court to rule, on two separate occasions, that the hurried removals had violated migrants' due process protections underthe U.S. Constitution. JUDGE BOASBERG CANCELS PLANNED HEARING TO REVIEW TRUMP DEPORTATIONS More than 250 suspected gang members arrive in El Salvador by plane, including 238 members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang and 23 members of the MS-13 gang, who were deported to El Salvador by the US in San Salvador, El Salvador on Mar. 16, 2025.(El Salvador Presidency / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) Boasberg invoked the high court's rulings before reiterating that due process includes providing migrants prior notice of removal, as well as so-called habeas protections, or the right to challenge their removals in court. \"Defendants plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States — a right that need not itself be vindicated through a habeas petition,\" Boasberg said. He allowed that it is possible that the Trump administration \"lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act\" as well as the possibility that defendants are correct that the individuals removed are, in fact gang members. \"But — and this is the critical point — there is simply no way to know for sure, as the CECOT Plaintiffs never had any opportunity to challenge the government’s say-so,\" Boasberg said. The order is almost certain to spark fierce backlash from the Trump administration, which has previously railed against Boasberg's earlier orders and temporary restraining order handed down in March. He later found probable cause to hold the administration in contempt of the court, citing the government's \"willful disregard\" for his March 15 emergency order, though those proceedings were later halted by a federal appeals court. SUPREME COURT GRANTS TRUMP REQUEST TO LIFT STAY HALTING VENEZUELAN DEPORTATIONS James Boasberg, chief judge of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, attends a panel discussion at the annual American Board Association (ABA) Spring Antitrust Meeting at the Marriott Marquis in Washington, DC, on Apr. 2, 2025.(Drew ANGERER / AFP) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg made headlines earlier this year for granting the first emergency restraining order blocking the Trump administration from invoking a 1798 law to immediatelydeport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the violent gang Tren de Aragua, in March. He also ordered that plane carrying migrants removed by the law in question be \"immediately\" returned to the U.S., which did not happen. The Trump administration has been battling multiple court challenges centered on thosedeportation flights.

    "article_text": "Fox News' Rich Edson reports the latest on the arrest of two Chinese nationals for alleged smuggling. Fox News legal editor Kerri Urbahn also weighs in and discusses the latest on the effort to ban gender treatments for prison inmates. A Chinese embassy official said Wednesday he was unaware of the case involving two Chinese nationals charged with smuggling a \"dangerous biological pathogen\" into the U.S. for university research. \"I don't know the specific situation, but I would like to emphasize that the Chinese government has always required overseas Chinese citizens to abide by local laws and regulations and will also resolutely safeguard their legitimate rights and interests,\" said Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Embassy in the U.S. The statement came after University of Michigan research fellows Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu – who are also boyfriend and girlfriend – were charged with smuggling Fusarium graminearum fungus into the U.S. within the jurisdiction of the Eastern District of Michigan. Fusarium graminearum is considered a \"potential agroterrorism weapon\" by the Justice Department and can cause noxious \"head blight\" on cereal grain crops. PATEL: CHINESE NATIONALS CHARGED WITH SMUGGLING 'KNOWN AGROTERRORISM AGENT' INTO US IS A 'DIRECT THREAT' Toxic fungus smuggled into U.S.(FBI) The fungus causes $1 billion in global damage to crops each year, according to the feds. The FBI is conducting the investigation along with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. While Liu appeared to deny knowledge of the case, Jian allegedly received funding from the CCP for her work on the fungus inside China. China was also determined by several entities to be the culprit for the release of the coronavirus pathogen that caused a global pandemic in 2020.

    "title": "Durbin obstruction threat chills Senate as Trump nominees hang in balance",
    "article_text": "Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., gives retirement announcement from home in Springfield where he announced his first Senate bid. Sen.Dick Durbin, D-Ill., used his opening remarks during the Senate’s first judicial nominee hearing of the year on Wednesday to remind his colleagues that he was holding up at least one of President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice nominees. \"I've got a hold on one nominee from Florida,\" Durbin said. \"I've spoken to both Florida senators about it. It isn't personal. We've got to find a way out of this that is fair and bipartisan that we're going to stick with for both political parties.\" Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, is blocking the nomination of Jason Reding Quinones, Trump’s choice to lead the U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida. Durbin also recently threatened to obstruct more of Trump’s picks to lead the DOJ’s 93 U.S. attorney’s offices. Durbin's threat loomed over the committee hearing, which featured five of Trump's nominees to fill federal judge positions. The Illinois Democrat attributed his blockade to Vice President JD Vance announcing a hold on DOJ nominees in 2023. Vance, then a senator, said he would not lift his hold on nominees until then-Attorney General Merrick Garland stopped \"going after his political opponents,\" a reference to the two federal prosecutions of Trump. SEN. DICK DURBIN: CLOSING FEDERAL OFFICES PUNISHES EVERYDAY AMERICANS Sen. Dick Durbin speaks during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in 2024.(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) Any senator has the power to use holds to object to nominations. The practice significantly slows down the confirmation process because it prevents senators from voting for nominees through the typical, expedited unanimous consent process. Committee ChairmanChuck Grassley, R-Iowa, argued Wednesday that, like Durbin, he too disagreed with Vance’s decision, but Grassley said it was notably different than Durbin's. \"This isn't what you can legitimately call a precedent for blanket obstruction at the beginning of an administration before even a single one of these 93 U.S. attorneys have been filled,\" Grassley said. Grassley, who himself has hindered nominees in past administrations, said holds should be used \"selectively\" and quoted Durbin saying last Congress that \"public safety will suffer across the United States\" if the obstruction of U.S. attorneys is carried out. GRASSLEY ALLEGES FBI USED BIASED SOURCES IN ANTI-TRADITIONAL CATHOLIC MEMOS UNDER BIDEN ADMINISTRATION Sen. Chuck Grassley in the U.S. Capitol on Sept. 24, 2024.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Durbin said Vance changed the rules \"overnight.\" \"And guess what? The tables turn,\" Durbin said. \"There comes a time when you want to move these by voice vote, and we're going to have to say, as Democrats, we're going to follow the Vance precedent.\" Durbin, who has an amicable relationship with Grassley, signaled he was willing to come to negotiate with Republicans over the Florida nominee, who has already been favorably reported out of the committee along party lines. Asked by Fox News Digital what a resolution would look like, a Durbin spokeswoman pointed to the senator's remarks during the hearing and declined to comment further. Durbin’s hold is not the only roadblock for Trump’s nominees. Senate Minority LeaderChuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday from the Senate floor that Republicans wanted to \"quietly rubber-stamp\" Patrick Davis’ nomination and that he would not allow it. DEMS' 'DELAY TACTIC' TO 'MALIGN' PATEL AND STALL FBI CONFIRMATION DISMISSED AS 'BASELESS' BY TOP SENATE LEADER Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and President Donald Trump(Getty Images) Trump nominated Davis, a former Grassley aide, to serve as assistant attorney general for the Office of Legislative Affairs, who is responsible for handling DOJ's correspondence with Congress. Schumer said he opposed Davis' nomination in part because the DOJ has been unresponsive to his inquiries about the controversial luxury plane that Qatar gifted to the Trump administration. \"They won’t even answer serious questions about this. This plane should be withdrawn,\" Schumer said. He added that when \"this Justice Department is as horrible as it is, as political as it is, as destructive of American values as it has been, no way.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Grassley responded to Schumer on X: \"Why would Democrats expect responsiveness to Congress from DOJ when they obstruct Pres Trump’s nominees who r responsible to ANSWER THEIR LTTRS????\" The last two Senate-confirmed heads of the Office of Legislative Affairs, during the Biden administration and first Trump administration, were confirmed through the speedy voice vote process.

    "article_text": "Republicans and Democrats came together to condemn the fatal shooting of a young couple who worked at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C. (Credit: Nicholas Ballasy) EXCLUSIVE:A GOP lawmaker on the House’s Homeland Security Committee is spearheading a hearing on growing antisemitic violence in the U.S. in response to recent attacks in Boulder, Colorado, and Washington, D.C. These attacks are not outliers, according to the chairman of the committee’s counterterrorism and intelligence subcommittee, Rep.August Pflugerof Texas. He has scheduled a hearing for June 11 to examine the rise of anti-Israel terrorist attacks within the American homeland. \"From harassment of Jewish students and calls to ‘Globalize the Intifada,’ to arson against the Jewish governor of Pennsylvania and the cold-blooded execution of two young Israeli Embassy staffers in our nation’s capital – the heinous attack in Boulder this Sunday is part of a disturbing pattern, not an isolated incident,\" Pfluger said in a Wednesday statement to Fox News Digital. \"Antisemitic violence and harassment will not, and cannot, remain unchecked in the United States of America – whether it’s on college campuses or in our communities.\" BOULDER TERROR ATTACK RESULT OF ‘RECKLESS BIDEN POLICIES,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS Rep. August Pfluger is spearheading a hearing on growing antisemitic violence in the U.S.(Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) \"In the wake of the foreign policy failures and open-border policies of the Biden-Harris administration, the Department of Homeland Security, in coordination with state and local law enforcement, must be prepared to meet the moment as we face an increasingly complex threat landscape at home and abroad,\" he said. \"Congress must ensure the United States remains a bastion of freedom for all, and that our Jewish neighbors can live free from hatred and persecution.\" Among those who will appear at the hearing is Kerry Sleeper, the deputy director for intelligence and information sharing with the Secure Community Network. The group is the largest Jewish security organization in North America. Sleeper oversees its 24/7 operations of the National Jewish Security Operations Command Center, which coordinates intelligence with agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the FBI. Pfluger has previously sounded the alarm about antisemitic violence and other terror threats that jeopardize the safety of U.S. citizens. For example, he reintroduced legislation in February, known as the Countering Online Radicalization and Terrorism Act, which would require DHS to conduct assessments each year evaluating the threat terrorist groups like ISIS and Hamas pose to the U.S. through the use of foreign cloud-based mobile or desktop messaging applications. The measure has received bipartisan support, and Democratic Rep.Jimmy Panettaof California is a co-sponsor. Pfluger’s hearing comes not long after a gunman opened fire and killed two Israeli Embassy employees in Washington in May. A pro-Palestinian man, identified as 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, was arrested in connection with the case, according to authorities. SHOOTING AT CAPITAL JEWISH MUSEUM HIGHLIGHTS RISING WAVE OF ANTI-JEWISH HATE CRIMES Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, who were shot and killed as they left an event at the Capital Jewish Museum, in this handout image released by Embassy of Israel to the U.S. on May 22, 2025.(Embassy of Israel to the USA via X/Handout via Reuters) Likewise, Sunday’s terrorist attack in Colorado left a dozen people injured – including a Holocaust survivor – during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, a grassroots group that holds events urging the release of Israeli hostages. The suspect in the attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, first entered the U.S. under the Biden administration and had overstayed his visa, multiple Department of Homeland Security sources first told Fox News. Soliman, 45, allegedly yelled \"Free Palestine\" and used a makeshift flamethrower to conduct that attack, according to law enforcement officials. Lawmakers and intelligence experts have long warned about foreign terrorists entering the U.S. and conducting attacks against American citizens. For example, Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, then-chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and House Homeland Security Committee Chair Mark Green, R-Tenn., warned of such terror threats in August 2024, following the release of a report from House Judiciary Committee Republicans that determined the Biden administration released nearly 100 illegal immigrants on the terrorist watch list.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The FBI has voiced similar concerns. \"I have warned for some time now about the threat that foreign terrorists may seek to exploit our southwest border or some other port of entry to advance a plot against Americans,\" former FBI DirectorChristopher Wraytold the House Judiciary Committee in April 2024. \"Just last month, for instance, the Bureau and our joint terrorism task forces worked with ICE in multiple cities across the country as several individuals with suspected international terrorist ties were arrested using ICE’s immigration authorities.\" Diana Stancy is a politics reporter with Fox News Digital covering theWhite House.",

    "title": "4-H federally funded camps under fire for cabining kids, adult counselors  by 'identity'",
    "article_text": "The Center for Practical Federalism found that some states are still adhering to gender ideology guidance that the Trump administration has pulled. EXCLUSIVE:Some federally supported youth programs still have policies in place permitting attendees and adult camp counselors to stay in overnight housing based on their self-identified gender rather than their biological sex – despite the fact that the policy these rules are derived from has since been rescinded by the Trump administration, according to one nonprofit group. The Washington-area Center for Practical Federalism is calling on theU.S. Department of Agriculture(USDA), which oversees4-H youth programsthat federally funded public universities across the country administer, to evaluate the programs’ gender ideology standards. The 4-H programs offer a host of activities for youth through more than 100 public universities across the country in areas including health, science, agriculture and civic engagement. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN TAX MONEY GOES TO CONTRACTS FOR DEI GROUPS, WATCHDOG FINDS Parents around the country have protested the inclusion of gender ideology in schools.(iStock) The Center for Practical Federalism is an arm of the nonprofit organization the State Policy Network, and seeks to provide resources to the American public and policymakers to educate them about federalism, and the balance between state and national politics to prevent government overreach. The issue originated in 2017, when the National 4-H Council and USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture shared a \"4-H Guidance for Inclusion of Individuals of all Gender Identities, Gender Expressions, Sexual Orientation and Sexes\" on a USDA-managed website. That guidance has since been rescinded, and the Trump administration issued an executive order in January instructing agencies to take \"appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity.\" THE 'GRADING FOR EQUITY' PROPOSAL IS ABOUT LOWERING STANDARDS FOR STUDENTS, EXPERT SAYS The U.S. Department of Agriculture oversees 4-H youth programs that federally funded public universities across the country administer.(Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency) But policies that allow 4-H attendees and adult chaperones to stay in overnight accommodations based on their gender ideology – rather than their biological sex – remain in place in multiple states, according to the Center for Practical Federalism. \"Now that the Trump administration has rescinded all prior federal policies advancing gender ideology and replaced them with a clear biological framework through Executive Order, it is essential to ensure that federal grantees, including land-grant universities running 4-H programs, bring their practices into alignment with the law,\" Tony Woodlief, the Center for Practical Federalism’s senior executive vice president, said in a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, obtained by Fox News Digital. Specifically, the Center for Practical Federalism pointed to several instances where states have prioritized gender identity over biological sex for their 4-H programs. For example, the group alleged that, in 2022, theRock Springs Ranch 4-H Camp in Kansashoused a person who was born a male but identified as a female in a cabin with preteen girls – without alerting the parents beforehand for consent. The Sentinel, a nonprofit news site that is a subsidiary of the free market think tank Kansas Policy Institute, also reported on the incident. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Kansas 4-H Foundation has not updated its gender policy online since then, which claims to ban gender discrimination based on \"gender identity\" in areas including housing, according to the Center for Practical Federalism. \"The persistence of gender identity-based policies in 4-H programs shows how rescinded guidance can continue to shape policy and practice in violation of current federal directives,\" Woodlief said in the letter. \"The situation at Rock Springs Ranch 4-H Camp in Kansas is a clear example of how these policies can conflict with parental rights and children’s safety.\" The Kansas 4-H Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. MAHA REPORT RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT CHILDHOOD CHRONIC DISEASE The Center for Practical Federalism is requesting that the USDA conduct a review of all federally funded 4-H programs, land grant institutions and 4-H facilities to determine where rescinded gender ideology policies are still being enforced.(Liz Hafalia/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) Other states have similar policies, according to the Center for Practical Federalism. For example, California and Oregon both espouse policies in official documents or in training materials for their 4-H programs that place participants and adult chaperones in overnight housing based on their gender identity, rather than biological sex, the group said. The University of California's 4-H Youth Development Program did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital, nor did Oregon State's 4-H Youth Development Program. As a result, the Center for Practical Federalism is requesting that the USDA conduct a review of all federally funded 4-H programs, land grant institutions and 4-H facilities to determine where rescinded gender ideology policies are still being enforced. Likewise, the group urges the USDA to institute formal standards \"to prevent subregulatory guidance from circumventing lawful rulemaking.\" \"We also recommend that the Department use this case as a springboard for a broader, agency-wide audit of existing guidance documents, rescinding those that bypassed the regulatory process or are no longer necessary,\" Woodlief said in the letter.

    "article_text": "Former Trump DHS acting Chief of Staff Lora Ries discusses the latest numbers on ICE arrests of illegal migrants and more on ‘Fox News Live.’ New legislation aims to set a limit on the number of immigration parolees allowed into the United States annually. The \"Preventing the Abuse of Immigration Parole Act\" would cap parole admissions into the U.S. at 3,000 people a year starting in fiscal year 2029. It would also \"establish congressional findings\" that parole for people trying to enter the country should only be conducted \"case-by-case.\" It would also not allow those from \"a country of concern\" like Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Syria, and Russia to be given parole unless there is special permission granted by the Department of State.

Addison McDowell, the bill’s sponsor, said in a statement on Wednesday. \"When vetting procedures are ignored and the floodgates are opened, it’s hard to believe it wasn’t deliberate. They showed no regard for the American families left to deal with the fallout of their failed policies. My bill, the Preventing the Abuse of Immigration Parole Act, caps parole entries and closes the side door that’s been exploited to bypass our borders,\" the Republican continued. McDowell’s bill was inspired by the congressional U.S. House Homeland Security Committee, Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations & Accountability’s finding that 2.8 million individuals were given parole while formerPresident Joe Bidenwas in office under the purview of former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

    "article_text": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., slammed President Donald Trump's budget bill over cuts to Medicaid, saying Republican senators who support it are \"suicidal.\" Sen.Chuck Schumer,D-N.Y., on Wednesday renamed President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" the \"We're All Going to Die Act,\" slamming the package over cuts to Medicaid. The Senate Minority Leader said Republican senators who support Trump's budget bill are \"tenured at best, suicidal at worst,\" implying a vote forthe legislative packagewill have negative consequences at the ballot box. \"For many Americans, health care coverage is the difference between life and death,\" Schumer said. His new name for Trump's budget bill comes from a recent remark by Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa. In response to jeers from a crowd about how cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would cause people to die, Ernst retorted at a recent town hall event, \"Well, we’re all going to die.\" TRUMP CRITICIZES RAND PAUL OVER TAX BILL OPPOSITION: 'VOTES NO ON EVERYTHING' Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., at the Capitol Tuesday, Jun. 3, 2025.(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) \"According to Ernst, 'Fear not. We're going to die anyway.' Tell that, the American people have heard. Let me be clear. Democrats are ready. We are ready to fight,' Schumer said. \"We are doubling down. We're ready to show Americans what's really at stake here, because this fight won't be won in just the Capitol. As Abe Lincoln said, public sentiment is everything. And when public sentiment hears about this 'We're All Going to Die Act,' they're going to hate it, and they're going to tell their senators they hate it. And if the senators think they can get away with a yes vote and explain it, they're sadly mistaken. The cuts are too deep. The cuts are too real. The cuts are too devastating for people.\" He continued, \"Why are they being so mean? Why are they being so cruel? And why are they being so politically tenured at at best, suicidal at worst? All to give tax breaks to billionaires. They are in total obeisance. Donald Trump is, and his colleagues are to very very, the small group of very wealthy, greedy people who say, 'I don't care what you do to everyone else, cut my taxes. And by the way, get rid of any regulations.'\" In a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for Ernst said, \"While Democrats fearmonger against strengthening the integrity of Medicaid, Senator Ernst is focused on improving the lives of all Iowans. There’s only two certainties in life: death and taxes, and she’s working to ease the burden of both by fighting to keep more of Iowans’ hard-earned tax dollars in their own pockets and ensuring their benefits are protected from waste, fraud, and abuse.\" At the town hall event, Ernst also defended the integrity of these programs for the most vulnerable, saying Medicaid \"is extremely important here in the State of Iowa\" and the bill would \"leave those dollars for those that are eligible for Medicaid.\" Schumer said that the Congressional Budget Office found that the estimated number of people who would lose their health insurance coverage if Trump’s budget bill passes could increase from 13.7 million to up to as many as 16 million people.

Schumer alleged Trump \"is just lying about the bill.\" \"We've been told 11 million people cut off from affordable food tax cuts for billionaires. \"We're All Going to Die Bill.’ And that shows the callousness, the callousness of this Republican majority in the House and the Republican majority in the Senate.

    "article_text": "Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin joins 'FOX & Friends' to discuss the Loudoun County School District's liberal gender policies that prompted student protests. A Virginia school district at the center of a transgender bathroom controversy two years ago has been referred to the feds after the state’s attorney general completed a separate probe this week. Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, a Republican, announced the closing of his investigation into Title IX violations, unlawful retaliation and viewpoint discrimination byLoudoun County Public Schools (LCPS)after three boys were allegedly investigated for complaints made in regard to a female student – who identifies as male – in the men’s locker room. Miyares referred LCPS to the Justice Department and the Department of Education. \"The investigation reveals a disturbing misuse of authority byLoudoun County Public Schools, where students appear to have been targeted not for misconduct, but for expressing their discomfort for being forced to share a locker room with a member of the opposite sex,\" Miyares said in a Tuesday statement. \"Title IX was never meant to be used as a weapon against free speech or religious convictions. Every student in Virginia deserves the right to speak openly, think freely, and live according to their conscience without fear of retaliation. Protecting those rights is not political—it’s foundational to who we are as Americans.\" FATHER OF VIRGINIA STUDENT ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTED BY BIOLOGICAL MALE IN RESTROOM SPEAKS OUT In response to the referral, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon told Fox News Digital that \"sex-based discrimination and student safety are both top priorities of this Department of Justice. We will investigate these facts thoroughly, and go where the investigation leads us.\" \"‘Transgender’ policies in Loudoun County schools are stripping countless students of their fundamental rights,\" Dhillon added. Miyares’ probe found that LCPS allegedly began a Title IX probe into the three male students at Stone Bridge High School, who had also expressed religious objections to a policy allowing students to use sexually binary facilities based on their gender identity. The boys also reportedly voiced concerns about the biological female student who had purportedly been recording them in the locker room, according to theWashington, D.C., ABC affiliate. LOUDOUN COUNTY, VA, PARENTS DEMAND SUPERINTENDENT RESIGN OVER ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULTS IN SCHOOLS The father of one of the boystold the outletin May that his son was being formally investigated for sexual harassment after he expressed his own concerns about the situation. \"Furthermore, there are persistent reportsthat LCPSand the school board take adverse and potentially unlawful action against parents, teachers, and public speakers,\" Miyares’ office wrote in its announcement. In response to an inquiry from Fox News Digital, a representativefor LCPSsaid \"first and foremost [the district] continues to focus on following applicable law and ensuring all students are safe.\" \"LCPS is not in a position to provide comment on the attorney general's investigation or its purported findings at this time.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Transgender policies have been criticized amid the disproportionate violent crime rate among transgender women in comparison to biological females.(Fox News Digital) The district said it never received official communication from Miyares beyond what was announced in the press pertaining to the investigation being launched and was unable to \"meaningfully participate\" in it. \"To date, no findings have been shared with LCPS,\" the representative said. Fox News Digital reached out to the Department of Education, which said it doesn't confirm complaints. LCPS previously made national headlines after a father of a student accused the school board of covering up his daughter’s sexual assault at the hands of a biological male who wore a skirt.

TheCalifornia Senateapproved a measure Tuesday that would allow inmates sentenced to life without parole the opportunity to request an early release if their crimes were committed before the age of 26. Senate Bill 672, the Youth Rehabilitation and Opportunity Act, passed the Senate by a 24-11 party-line vote. The proposal now heads to the Assembly. The bill, introduced by Democratic Sen. Susan Rubio, was amended to exclude criminals convicted of certain offenses the chance to seek parole, including those who killed a law enforcement officer or carried out a mass shooting at a school, among other offenses. Republicans criticized their Democratic colleagues for passing the bill, saying the \"soft-on-crime\" proposalhelps criminalsand ignores victims.

They care about defending killers.\" \"This bill isn’t about second chances for petty offenders. It grants opportunity for release to some of the most violent criminals,\" Sen. Kelly Seyarto said. \"These individuals were sentenced to life without parole for crimes so extreme that the justice system deemed them beyond rehabilitation. Instead of weakening our justice system, we should be focusing on strengthening public safety and protecting Californians.\" Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil said the people who committed these \"depraved\" crimes have \"earned their sentence,\" and it is \"simply wrong for Democrat legislators to think they know better than the judges and juries who heard these cases.\" The bill was introduced by Democratic Sen. Susan Rubio.(Getty Images) \"We’re not talking about children who committed a ‘youthful indiscretion’; these are adults who committed planned murders with special circumstances,\" she said. \"We say kill this bill, not free these killers.\" In a post on X, State Assembly Republican Caucus press secretary George Andrews labeled the legislation a \"get-out-of-prison plan\" for people convicted of murder before age 26.

The Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), which is a recognized accrediting body for degree-granting higher education institutions across the Mid-Atlantic, ensures that its member schools — such as Columbia — meet established standards of academic quality, integrity, institutional effectiveness and more. MSCHE is one of several accrediting institutions across the country that theDepartment of Educationdeems reliable. Only institutions accredited by Department of Education-recognized accreditors are eligible to participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs, such as Pell Grants and federal work-study or student loan programs.

Just as the Department of Education has an obligation to uphold federal antidiscrimination law, university accreditors have an obligation to ensure member institutions abide by their standards,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said. \"We look forward to the Commission keeping the Department fully informed of actions taken to ensure Columbia’s compliance with accreditation standards, including compliance with federal civil rights laws.\" After launching an investigation into Columbia in February, the Trump administration opted to cancel $400 million in federal grants over the university's\"failure to protectJewish students from antisemitic harassment.\" Subsequently, Columbia agreed to make changes in an effort to prevent the funds from being canceled.

    "title": "Doctor reveals the 'hateful 8' seed oils that could harm your health",
    "article_text": "Steak 'n Shake COO Daniel Edwards joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the company making the switch from frying in vegetable oil to beef tallow. Americans are becoming more cognizant of the ingredients in their food amid theMake America Healthy Againmovement. Seed oils — which are plant-based cooking oils that are often used inprocessed, packaged foods– have been touted by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as \"unknowingly poison[ing]\" Americans. Any oil that comes from seeds is classified as a seed oil, but that also includes some that are beneficial, such as sesame seed oil, peanut oil and flax oils, according to board-certified family physician Cate Shanahan, M.D., who is based in Florida. IN-N-OUT BURGER MAKES MAJOR INGREDIENT CHANGES TO DRINKS AND POPULAR CONDIMENT Shanahan, who specializes in using traditional food topromote healthand reverse disease, shared with Fox News Digital which seed oils should be avoided. \"I had to create a term that described the harmful oils in ourfood supply…  the 'hateful eight seed oils’ or the ‘hatefully eight oils,’\" she said. Dr. Cate Shanahan shared the \"hateful eight\" seed oils that are criticized by those in the MAHA movement for their potential health risks and lack of nutrients.(iStock) Those eight include corn, canola, cotton seed, soy, sunflower, safflower, rice bran and grape seed. There are several factors that make these eight specific oils unhealthy, according to Shanahan. WHAT YOUR BLOOD QUIETLY REVEALS ABOUT YOUR EATING HABITS The process to extract the oil is \"not selectively bred to yield their oil easily,\" she noted — it requires high heat and pressure, leading to the presence of a neurotoxin called hexane. The oils contain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which can break down and turn into toxins during the heating process, according to Shanahan. The so-called \"hateful eight seed oils\" are corn, canola, cotton seed, soy, sunflower, safflower, rice bran and grape seed.(iStock) \"Even after processing, they can continue to degrade, especially when exposed to heatduring cooking, leading to further toxin generation,\" she said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It's necessary to refine the oils to make them edible, but that process removes nutrients. \"Some of these nutrients are very important, like choline and lecithin and other phospholipids,\" noted Shanahan. \"They're important for our brain and ournervous systemand our cellular division and fertility and key things in life like that.\" The process of refining oils removes nutrients, leaving them almost devoid of beneficial components, the expert noted.(iStock) Seed oils are commonly found in processed \"junk\" food, as well as foods servedin restaurantsand in hospitals. \"What makes a ‘junk food’ a ‘junk food’ is in the ingredients,\" Shanahan said. \"When you pay attention to the ingredients, are they wholesome or not? These hateful eight seed oils are not wholesome.\" Seed oils overall have been linked to anincreased risk of colon cancer, as Fox News Digital recently reported. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Some health agencies, however, have spoken in defense of seed oils. In 2024, the American Heart Association (AHA) published a piece asserting that \"there's no reason to avoid seed oils and plenty of reasons to eat them.\" The American Heart Association has stated that \"there's no reason to avoid seed oils and plenty of reasons to eat them.\" The piece argued that it is \"misleading\" to state that the fatty acids in seed oils \"break down into toxins when used for cooking, causing inflammation, weakening the immune system, and contributing to chronic illnesses.\" The AHA also pointed to other ingredients beyond seed oils that could lead to unhealthy outcomes. For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health \"The real concern should be overeatingultraprocessed foods, which may contain harmful ingredients such as high-fructose corn syrup, added sugar and sodium,\" the post reads. \"It's so odd that the internet has gone wild demonizing these things,\" said Dr. Christopher Gardner, a professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine in California and a nutrition scientist at the Stanford Prevention Research Center. \"They are not to be feared.\"",

    "title": "Carbohydrates and fiber linked to healthier aging in some groups, study finds",
    "article_text": "Harvard medical student and researcher Nick Norwitz recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. Carbohydrates may have gotten a bad rap, but a new study from Tufts University finds that some are better than others — and that older women in particular could reap the benefits. The research, which was recently published in the journal JAMA Network Open, found that daily consumption of fiber and\"high-quality\" carbsin midlife can contribute to healthier aging and overall better wellness among older females. The researchers defined \"healthy aging\" as \"the absence of 11 major chronic diseases, lack of cognitive and physical function impairments, and having good mental health.\" EXPERTS REVEAL HIDDEN WAYS SUGAR ACCELERATES AGING BEYOND JUST WEIGHT GAIN The study was led by researchers from the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts University and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"The main takeaway of the study is that consuming dietary fiber and high-quality carbohydrates — those from fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes — is associated withpositive health statusin older adulthood,\" lead author Andres Ardisson Korat, a scientist at HNRCA, told Fox News Digital. Daily consumption of fiber and high-quality carbs in midlife can contribute to healthier aging and overall better wellness among older females.(iStock) \"This includes the absence of chronic diseases and good physical and cognitive function.\" The researchers collected data from the Nurses’ Health Study, in which 47,000 women reported their dietary habits and health outcomes between 1984 and 2016, according to a Tufts press release. The women ranged in age from 70 to 93 by the end of the study period. EATING THIS BREAKFAST FOOD COULD HELP YOU LIVE LONGER, STUDY SUGGESTS The researchers looked at the women’s consumption of dietary fiber, total carbohydrates, refined carbohydrates, high-quality (unrefined) carbohydrates, and carbohydrates fromwhole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes. They also analyzed glycemic index (each food’s score indicating how much it raises blood sugar) and glycemic load, which also takes into account portion size to provide a more accurate measure of each food’s impact on blood sugar. \"It’s not just about ‘carbs versus fats versus protein’ — it’s about what kind of carbs you're eating.\" Women who consumed higher amounts of total carbohydrates; high-quality carbohydrates from whole grains,fruits, vegetablesand legumes; and total dietary fiber in midlife were 6% to 37% more likely to have healthy aging and to score higher in several areas of mental and physical wellness, the study found. Conversely, consuming refined carbohydrates — which come from added sugars, refined grains and potatoes — and starchy vegetables resulted in a 13% reduced chance of healthy aging. \"This study reinforces something many of us intuitively feel: quality matters,\" noted Melanie Avalon, a health influencer, entrepreneur and biohacker based in Atlanta, Georgia. \"It’s not just about ‘carbs versus fats versus protein’ — it’s about the kind of carbs you're eating.\" The researchers looked at the women’s consumption of dietary fiber, total carbohydrates, refined carbohydrates, high-quality (unrefined) carbohydrates, and carbohydrates from whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes.(iStock) Avalon, who was not involved in the research, discussed some of the more notable findings with Fox News Digital. \"Perhaps most surprising was the finding that replacing just 5% of calories from carbohydrates with protein (from either plant or animal sources) was associated with lower odds of healthy aging by 7% to 37%,\" she said. HEALTHY EATING IN MIDDLE AGE HAS THIS KEY LONGEVITY BENEFIT Avalon also noted that when carbohydrates were segmented by type — processed versus unprocessed — the associations with healthy aging were independent of BMI (body mass index), a metric typically closely linked to metabolic health. \"This suggests the effects of carbohydrate quality on healthy aging were not solely explained byweight-loss effects,\" she said. Based on the study findings, experts recommend focusing on whole, unprocessed foods, including fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains.(iStock) The study also briefly touched on the controversial topic of seed oils. \"It found that higher intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) — which are commonly found in seed oils — was linked to decreased odds ofhealthy aging, adding nuance to the ongoing debate,\" Avalon added. Based on the study findings, the biohacker recommends favoring whole, unprocessed foods, including fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Shop the perimeter of the grocery store for produce and whole grains, as well as the freezer aisles for frozen fruit and vegetables,\" she suggested. \"Consider dipping into the aisles only for pantry staples like canned legumes.\" For those who tolerate grains, people can reap the benefits of foods like quinoa, brown rice, oats and whole wheat products, Avalon noted. \"Prioritize fiber-rich foods and minimize refined carbohydrates like white bread, sugary beverages and ultraprocessed snacks,\" an expert advised.(iStock) \"Prioritize fiber-rich foods and minimize refined carbohydrates like white bread, sugary beverages and ultraprocessed snacks.\" \"These shifts can meaningfully supporthealthy agingand reduce the risk of chronic disease.\" One chief limitation of the study is that the participants were mainly white female healthcare workers. \"Because of the observational nature of the study, we cannot rule out confounding by other variables,\" Korat said. \"We would have liked to have data on men to evaluate the associations in this group.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER The researchers called for more diverse studies that look closer at how dietary fiber and high-quality carbs contribute to healthy aging. \"We hope our findings help inform consumers about the importance of healthy diets in the promotion of healthy aging,\" Korat added. \"Personalized nutrition, grounded in both science and self-awareness, may be key to thriving across the decades.\" \"The more we can understand about healthy aging, the more science can help people live healthier for longer.\" Avalon added that while diet is \"foundational,\" it’s just one piece of the \"healthy aging puzzle.\" For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health \"Exercise, sleep, stress management and social connection all play a role,\" she said. \"Ultimately,personalized nutrition, grounded in both science and self-awareness, may be key to thriving across the decades.\" Melissa Rudy is senior health editor and a member of the lifestyle team at Fox News Digital.

    "article_text": "Check out the best moments between the Cincinnati Reds and the Kansas City Royals. Kansas City was ecstatic whenthe Royalscalled up their top prospect, Jac Caglianone, but one former MLB executive called it the \"single-most irresponsible move I’ve seen in quite a long time.\" FormerMiami Marlinsteam president David Samson vocalized his displeasure with the Royals’ front office bringing Caglianone up to the big leagues despite his success in the minors. It wasn't Caglianone’s performance Samson was referencing in his opinion. It has to do with service time. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Kansas City Royals designated hitter Jac Caglianone bats against the St. Louis Cardinals during the second inning of his Major League Baseball debut at Busch Stadium.(Jeff Curry/Imagn Images) \"If he’s going to be that good, how do you call him up now where he will hit arbitration a full year earlier than if they waited until after around June 17?\" Samson wondered. \"I have no idea how a team that’s not in the top 10 of payroll is not paying attention to dates. And the Royals forcing the issue, that’s a bunch of horse hockey. You take the extra two weeks because it gives you an extra year and compounds itself in arbitration.\" RAYS SHORTSTOP HIKES BALL TO KICK OFF BIZARRE DOUBLE PLAY, ONE DAY AFTER ROBBING HOME RUN Caglianone will reach arbitration a year early because Kansas City brought him up before the Super Two deadline. Service time has been a debated topic for some time among baseball experts and fans because teams do have the ability to keep prospects down on the farm to ensure another year of control. But Kansas City clearly doesn’t mind bringing up Caglianone now. Kansas City Royals designated hitter Jac Caglianone (14) bats against the St. Louis Cardinals during the second inning of his Major League Baseball debut at Busch Stadium.(Jeff Curry/Imagn Images) He was just called up, but Caglianone is one of the top prospects in baseball and has been raking in the minors this year with a .322/.389/.593 slash line with 15 homers and 56 RBIs between Double-A and Triple-A. Samson believes calling up Caglianone now puts more pressure on him to perform right away because of the service time scenario. \"This is a $10 million decision they made. He better be Vladimir Guerrero Sr., and he better start now,\" Samson said. Caglianone went 0-for-5 in his major league debut Tuesday against the St. Louis Cardinals.

Do I have to worry about AB Hernandez jumping into the 400m next year?\" David Adams also doubled-down on the belief that the decision to revoke his daughter's title was racially motivated. \"I know for a fact that the history of our country when it comes to celebrations, when a White girl celebrates or a White boy celebrates, it's called, 'He’s passionate. It's good for the sport. We need this for the sport.'

Gavin Newsom and the state last Tuesday, threatening to cut federal funding to the state if a trans athlete competed in the girls' track and field championship. The CIF responded by amending its rules to accommodate female athletes who finished behind a trans athlete in the three events Hernandez competed in, thus granting them qualification and podium finishes they would have earned had a biologically male athlete not competed in those events. This resulted in Hernandez having to share podium spots with the female athletes who finished one spot behind Hernandez after the finals on Saturday.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. More former men’s basketball players forIndiana Universityhave come forward alleging sexual misconduct by a former team physician, while stating school officials, including the late head coach Bobby Knight, were aware of the situation. Last fall, former Hoosier players Haris Mujezinovic and Charlie Miller filed a lawsuit against Bradford Bomba Sr., who died last month. The suit claimed the two were sexually abused by Bomba during their time playing for Indiana. That lawsuit, which was filed in October, now has five ex-athletes named in it, while 10 additional men are planning to pursue litigation against Indiana,per ESPN.

They joked about it and let it continue.\" Bomba routinely gave male athletes rectal exams during their physicals despite no medical recommendations to do so, according to the lawsuit. Bomba worked as the men’s basketball physician for almost 30 years. FORMER INDIANA BASKETBALL PLAYERS SAY TEAM DOCTOR SEXUALLY ABUSED THEM WITH UNNECESSARY PROSTATE EXAMS Longtime trainer Tim Garl was listed as a defendant in January after another former player, John Flowers, joined the lawsuit. Flowers said Garl was aware of Bomba's \"invasive, harassing, and demeaning digital rectal examinations.\" \"After his first physical, Flowers's teammates told him he had 'passed' Dr. Bomba, Sr.'s 'test,' and that he would not have to undergo a digital rectal examination again,\" the lawsuit states. \"Garl laughed at Flowers and his freshman teammates and made jokes at their expense regarding the digital rectal examinations they endured.\" Legendary college basketball coach Bobby Knight died in 2023.(AP) Players allegedly complained about the exams, some of which said they wished to have a different physician look at them in the future. However, Knight and Garl continued to have players see Bomba. Another player, Butch Carter, who played for Indiana in the late 1970s, wrote in a letter that he told Knight he never wanted to see Bomba again. The letter is in the lawsuit, though Carter is not a part of the lawsuit. An outside investigation was done to look further into the allegations, and it found that rectal exams are a normal part of a physical. Indiana also released a statement in September 2024 saying they would beconducting an independent review. Indiana hired the law firm Jones Day to conduct the investigation, which involved speaking with \"100 individuals,\" going through \"10,000 emails\" and reviewing \"more than 100,000 pages of physical documents spanning six decades,\" according to the report released on April 25. With Bomba’s death last month, and the outside investigation clearing him of sexual misconduct, the legal path for these players will be a difficult one.

One of the men, who played in the late 1990s for the Hoosiers, claimed Bomba \"fondled his genitalia\" during a physical. \"My ten clients and numerous other players from the 1970s to the 1990s were subjected to completely unnecessary penetrative exams and other forms of sexual misconduct by team physician Brad Bomba Sr. for his own sexual gratification,\" said Simpson Tuegel in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Since these men bravely began to come forward last fall, Indiana University has repeatedly tried to avoid responsibility, falsely asserting that what happened to them doesn’t constitute abuse. That should be decided by an Indiana jury rather than the University and its hand-picked private law firm. My team and I will do everything in our power to ensure these survivors have their day in court.\" Indiana University told Fox News Digital it does not comment on litigation.

Marissa Rothenberger, atrans-identifying male athlete, threw a complete-game shutout Wednesday morning as No. 2-seeded Champlin Park defeated No. 7 Eagan, 5-0, in the Class AAAA quarterfinals.

On Wednesday, not everyone in the stands was clapping. Two Eagan parents, both of whom requested anonymity for the sake of their daughters, expressed frustration and disappointment after the game. One mother, wearing a \"Save Girls’ Sports\" T-shirt, said the outcome felt inevitable. \"I was pretty disappointed and frustrated,\" she told OutKick. \"I think we've seen this happen over and over again to our girls. You look online, and you see women transitioning to men, and they're not dominating any of the men's sports. You don’t see that. But on the women's side, you see it over and over again across the country. It's super frustrating. I knew it was eventually going to happen to my daughter. I was sad to see it happen to her.\" Her frustration wasn’t just about the scoreboard.

    "article_text": "International researchers from the Noah's Ark Project have tested soil samples from the Durupinar site in eastern Turkey, which suggest that the boat-shaped site once harbored ancient wood. (Credit: NoahsArkScans.com) Volunteers recently unearthed an ancient depiction of aRoman goddesswhile digging near a historic British landmark. The sandstone carving was found at Vindolanda, a fort in Northumberland, near Hadrian's Wall. In a May 21 press release, the Vindolanda Trust identified the depiction as Victoria, the goddess of victory in Roman mythology. The artifact was uncovered by Jim and Dilys Quinlan, a couple from Merseyside who have volunteered in countless excavations over the past two decades. The pair found the artifact in a pile of rubble near former infantry barracks. ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNEARTH STRANGE HEAD DEPICTING ROMAN GOD BENEATH CATHOLIC BASILICA Pictures show the proud volunteers smilingnext to their discoveryin the rubble pile. The organization said Victoria was the counterpart of the Greek goddess Nike, and was worshiped in Ancient Rome. \"Victoria was highly revered by the Ancient Romans. During times of war, she was often credited for battlefield success,\" the statement read. Volunteers recently discovered an ancient Roman goddess depiction, shown in inset, at Vindolanda near Hadrian's Wall — highlighting the site's historical significance.(The Vindolanda Trust; Getty Images ) Hadrian's Wall was built under the Ancient Romans, who successfully invaded Britain in 43 A.D. under Emperor Claudius. Previous attempts by Julius Caesar failed, and the Romans were able to establish long-lasting British settlements in the first century A.D. Under Emperor Hadrian, Hadrian's Wall began construction in 122 A.D. to protectthe northern borderof the province of Brittania from the Picts, who lived in southern Scotland. \"It is highly likely that this stone would have originally been brightly painted.\" The barracks were built in 213 A.D., which was a \"tumultuous time\" due to the Severan wars ending shortly earlier, according to the Vindolanda Trust. ANCIENT ROMAN HELMET TURNS UP IN UNUSUAL LOCATION: 'EXCEPTIONALLY RARE' \"The barracks were once adorned with a large ornamental arch and gate, precisely the location where an inscription may have been present,\" the statement noted. Jim and Dilys Quinlan, a couple from Merseyside, found the rare artifact while they were volunteering.(The Vindolanda Trust) \"The relief of Victory is poignant, representing the end of the war and the establishment of the fort at the site.\" Experts believe that the recently discovered stone was part of a significantly larger work, and may have been painted in vibrant colors.

    "article_text": "Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson explains how to keep your Windows computer safe and the security risks of online retail giant Temu. Hackers are no longer targeting only tech giants or hospitals. Any business that collects valuable personal information, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses or even basic financial details, is now a target. Companies that rely heavily on third-party vendors or outsourced customer support are even more at risk, especially if they are not particularly strong in the technology sector. German retailer Adidas learned this the hard way. The company recently confirmed a data breach involving one of its external partners, and although it has acknowledged the issue, many important details are still missing. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! A hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Adidas has officially acknowledged that a third-party vendor suffered a breach, resulting in unauthorized access to consumer data. In apublic noticetitled \"Data Security Information,\" the company revealed that a \"third-party customer service provider\" had been compromised. While the brand was initially silent on the scope, it had already been reported earlier this month that customers in Turkey and Korea had received breach notifications. MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS Adidas posted this information on both its German and English websites. However, no specific region or number of affected individuals has been confirmed. The company’s statement did clarify that no payment information, such as credit card details, nor passwords were included in the breach. Instead, it involved contact details submitted by users to Adidas’ help desk in the past. Data obtained reportedly includes names, phone numbers, email addresses and dates of birth. While this might seem limited compared to financial data, this type of information can be exploited forphishing scamsand identity theft. An Adidas sign(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) In the wake of the breach, Adidas began notifying potentially affected customers directly. The company's email to customers below aimed to reassure recipients and clarify what information was involved. Here is the full text of the notification sent to affected individuals. Dear customer, We are writing to inform you of an issue that we recently became aware of which may have impacted some of your data. What happened adidas recently learned that an unauthorized external party gained access to certain customer data through a third-party customer service provider. What information was involved The affected data does not contain passwords, credit card or any other payment-related information. Nor have any Social Security numbers been impacted. It mainly consists of contact information relating to customers who had contacted our customer service help desk in the past. This may have included one or more of the following: name, email address, telephone number, gender and/or birth date. What we are doing Privacy and the security of your data is our priority. Upon becoming aware of this incident, adidas took proactive and immediate steps to investigate and contain the incident. This includes further enhancing security measures and resetting passwords for customer service accounts. What you can do We are currently unaware of any harm (such as identity theft or fraud) being caused to our customers as a result of this incident. There are no immediate steps that you need to take. Although, as always, please remain vigilant and look out for any suspicious messages. As a reminder, adidas will never directly contact you to ask that you provide us with financial information, such as your credit card details, bank account information or passwords. Who you can contact If you have any questions, then please contact our Customer Service team athttps://www.adidas.com/us/help We apologise for any inconvenience caused by this incident. adidas Team THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK Despite the official acknowledgment, several questions remain unanswered. Adidas has yet to clarify whether this is a single breach affecting multiple regions or several separate incidents. The lack of transparency around the name of the third-party vendor and the absence of concrete numbers or locations for affected users has created frustration among observers and possibly among customers themselves. The earlier regional reports from Turkey and Korea might suggest that this incident was either global in scale or that similar third-party vendors were independently targeted. In either case, the company's current handling of the situation has left room for speculation. Adidas claims it is in the process of informing potentially affected customers, but it has not detailed the method or timeline for this outreach. We reached out to adidas for a comment, and a representative referred us to this statement on theirwebsite. In part, the company said, \"We remain fully committed to protecting the privacy and security of our consumers, and sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern caused by this incident.\" GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE An Adidas shoe(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO GET RID OF ROBOCALLS WITH APPS AND DATA REMOVAL SERVICES If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Adidas data breach: 1.

    "article_text": "Artificial intelligence and robotics may help with nursing shortage. Theglobal healthcaresystem is expected to face a shortage of 4.5 million nurses by 2030, with burnout identified as a leading cause for this deficit. In response, Taiwan's hospitals are taking decisive action by integrating artificial intelligence and robotics to support their staff and maintain high standards of patient care. AI-powered Nurabot(Nvidia) Nurabot, a collaborativenursing robotdeveloped by Foxconn and Kawasaki Heavy Industries withNvidia's AItechnology, is designed to take on some of the most physically demanding and repetitive tasks in clinical care. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! These include delivering medications, transporting samples, patrolling wards and guiding visitors through hospital corridors. By handling these responsibilities, Nurabot allows nurses to focus on more meaningful aspects of patient care and helps reduce the physical fatigue that often leads to burnout. AI-powered Nurabot(Nvidia) IS THIS ROBOT AFTER OUR HOSPITALITY, RETAIL AND HEALTHCARE JOBS? Foxconn's approach to smart hospitals goes beyond deploying robots. The company has developed a suite of digital tools using Nvidia platforms, including AI models that monitor patient vitals and digital twins that simulate hospital environments for planning and training purposes. The process starts in the data center, where large AI models are trained on Nvidia supercomputers. Hospitals then use digital twins to test and train robots in virtual settings before deploying them in real-world scenarios, ensuring that these systems are both safe and effective. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TRANSFORMS PATIENT CARE AND REDUCES BURNOUT, PHYSICIAN SAYS AI-powered Nurabot(Nvidia) AI HUMANOID ROBOT IS CHANGING THE WAY YOU BUY CARS AT DEALERSHIPS Taichung Veterans General Hospital (TCVGH), along with other top hospitals in Taiwan, is at the forefront of this digital transformation. TCVGH has built digital twins of its wards and nursing stations, providing a virtual training ground for Nurabot before it is introduced to real hospital floors. According to Shu-Fang Liu, deputy director of the nursing department at TCVGH, robots like Nurabot are augmenting the capabilities of healthcare staff, enabling them to deliver more focused and meaningful care to patients. HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PERSONAL INFO FROM PEOPLE-SEARCH SITES AI-powered Nurabot(Nvidia) WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Nurabot is already making a difference in daily hospital operations. The robot handles medicine deliveries, ward patrols and visitor guidance, which Foxconn estimates can reduce nurse workloads by up to 30%. In one ward, Nurabot delivers wound care kits and educational materials directly to patient bedsides, saving nurses multiple trips to supply rooms and allowing them to dedicate more time to their patients. The robot is also especially helpful during visiting hours and night shifts, when staffing levels are typically lower. Nurses hope future versions of Nurabot will be able to converse with patients in multiple languages, recognize faces for personalized interactions and even assist with lifting patients when needed. For example, a lung patient who needs two nurses to sit up for breathing exercises might only require one nurse with Nurabot's help, freeing the other to care for other patients. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES AI-powered Nurabot(Nvidia) BEST FATHER'S DAY GIFTS FOR EVERY DAD When it comes to addressing the nursing shortage, Taiwan is demonstrating that AI and robotics can make a significant difference in hospitals. Instead of spending their shifts running errands or handling repetitive tasks, nurses now have robots like Nurabot to lend a hand. This means nurses can focus their energy on what matters most – caring for patients – while robots handle tasks such as delivering medication or guiding visitors around the hospital. It's a team effort between people and technology, and it's already helping healthcare staff provide better care for everyone.

    "title": "NEWT GINGRICH: Pay less, know more — Trump is slashing red tape and lowering your healthcare costs",
    "article_text": "‘Trump’s Triumph’ author joins ‘Life, Liberty & Levin’ to discuss the president’s ‘remarkable’ political and cultural influence. One of the boldest and most consistent themes in President Donald J. Trump’s healthcare agenda is his determination to reduce the role and power of middlemen. From insurance companies to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) – and even hospitals –these intermediaries profit from the inefficiencies of our bloatedhealth system. The result is higher costs for American families. As I explain in my new book, \"Trump’s Triumph: America’s Greatest Comeback,\" the U.S. healthcare system isn’t expensive just because care is costly. It’s expensive because the system is complex – by design. The third-party payment structure, whether public or private, adds layers of bureaucracy. This opens the door for middlemen to offer supposed solutions that serve their own bottom lines – not patients. It’s a vicious cycle: more rules lead to more middlemen, which lead to even more rules, red tape, and rising costs. President Trump understood this – and he took action. TRUMP'S HEALTHCARE ORDER WILL HELP FIX HEALTHCARE FOR EVERYONE In his first term, he issued a groundbreaking executive order onprice transparency. For the first time, hospitals were required to disclose the real cost of procedures, enabling patients to compare prices before receiving care. While the Biden administration weakened enforcement, Trump doubled down in his second term with an even stronger push for what he called \"radical transparency.\" Radical transparency is the antidote to healthcare’s worst inefficiencies. When patients and employers can seewide price differencesfor the same procedures – even within the same hospital system – the games played behind the scenes get exposed. These inflated prices often have little to do with quality and everything to do with how well insurers negotiate – or how many middlemen take a cut. The same is true for prescription drugs. PBMs – giant corporations that control which drugs are covered and at what cost – use their market power to inflate prices. Three PBMs control 80 percent of the market. They’re often subsidiaries of major insurers, forming vertically integrated monopolies. New data from the Pacific Research Institute shows that most PBMs skim more money off high-cost prescriptions than European countries charge. It’s no wonder Americans are paying more. Hospitals play a role as well. Many exploit a well-intentioned federal program known as 340B, which allows them to purchase drugs at steep discounts. Instead of passing the savings to patients, they bill insurers full price and pocket the difference. The program was meant to expand care for low-income patients, but there’s little oversight to ensure this happens. President Trump’s recentexecutive orderon drug pricing targets this broken system. By creating a pathway for manufacturers to sell directly to patients, health plans, pharmacies, and clinics – without the markup – he’s offering a way to bypass the middlemen. This isn’t theory – it’s already working. When insulin makers launched direct-to-consumer programs, they sold the same drug at one-fourth the price patients were paying through insurance – while still making a profit. That’s the power of real market competition – without a single government price control. This stands in sharp contrast to the Left’s top-down vision. Whether it’s price controls, centralized purchasing, or government-run insurance, the left’s answer is always more bureaucracy. But more bureaucracy means more complexity – and more room for middlemen to thrive. Perhaps the most visionary part of President Trump’s health care agenda is his call to Make America Healthy Again. For decades, we’ve operated a \"sick care\" system focused on treating illness after it strikes. Trump’s approach is different. It emphasizes prevention, lifestyle, and personal responsibility – turning Americans from passive recipients into active participants in their own health. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In this model, the government’s role isn’t to run the system but to create an environment in whichpatients and doctors can lead– with access to better tools, more transparency, and useful information. That means clearer labeling for ultra-processed foods, ensuring gold standard scientific data free of conflicts of interest, and addressing environmental factors that contribute to chronic disease. These kinds of structural reforms empower people to make informed choices and live healthier lives – without mandates or micromanagement. It’s a model that eliminates the ultimate middleman: the system itself. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION President Trump’s leadership has laid the groundwork for a transparent, patient-centered, free-market healthcare system. But the job isn’t done. Congress should join him in continuing this fight – not just to lower costs, but to restore power to the American people. America deserves a healthcare system that benefits Americans – not industry middlemen. Newt Gingrich was Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995-1999 and a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. He is chairman ofGingrich 360.",

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: Musk vs. MAGA on Big, Beautiful Bill, but GOP needs both",
    "article_text": "FOX Business’ Gerri Willis and David Asman join ‘The Story’ to break down Elon Musk’s criticism of the Trump-backed spending bill. Last week, there were rumblings that Elon Musk had reservations about President Donald Trump’s so-calledbig, beautiful bill. This week, Musk, shall we say, clarified his position, calling the legislation a \"disgusting abomination.\" Tell us how you really feel, Mr. Musk. ELON MUSK WARNS EXCESSIVE SPENDING WILL PLUNGE US 'INTO DEBT SLAVERY' And yes, his concerns that this bill, now in the Senate, couldballoon the national debt, though disputed by the White House, are not particularly far-fetched. Until Trump, cutting as much spending as possible was Republican orthodoxy. The problem for those like Musk, who want to see the bill revamped to cut the debt is not just that GOP margins in Congress are as narrow as a coin slot, it's that Trump’s base, the only group of people he consistently pleases, like the bill, and they like it a lot. Left: Elon Musk looks on during a Cabinet Meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House March 24, 2025 in Washington, DC; Right:  U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) speaks during a news conference on Senate Republican’s Budget Resolution legislation at the U.S. Capitol on April 04, 2025 in Washington, DC(Left: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images; Right:  Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) Arecent pollshowed that 44% of Americans approve of the bill, while 38% oppose it, pretty decent numbers already, but among those polled who \"support Trump-like policies,\" the number is a whopping 78%. The most popular provisions of the bill, as I have reported numerous times on the ground, are no tax on overtime and tips, which polls at nearly 80% approval among all American voters. Santa Claus wishes he was that popular. This is a real impasse between Musk and Trump’s base, and Musk has proven to be a very valuable ally not just for Trump but for the GOP in general. His purchase of Twitter and its transformation into free speech champion X has been a major shift in our political discourse. One for the better for conservatives and the country. Musk also has the money needed to bankroll any campaign he chooses to, and conversely, to use that money to primary those Republicans he deems ineffective on the debt, a threat he made explicit this week. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt struck the right tone when asked about the disagreement between Trump and Musk.(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Money carries a lot of water, but at the end of the day, if you are a candidate for Congress in a GOP primary, what do you want more, a blank check from Elon Musk, or an endorsement from Donald Trump? For now, obviously the latter. Trump has been wise to play it cool, not clapping back at Musk. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt took the right tone in saying, the president was aware of the criticism, but, \"this is one big, beautiful bill, and Trump is sticking to it.\" In other words, they will have to agree to disagree. This puts the ball in Musk’s court. Even after his outbursts against the bill, there is no reason he cannot continue to work with Trump, as he promised in their press conference in the Oval Office together last week. No lasting harm has been done here. Democrats are trying to make hay out of Musk’s opposition, but after spending a year demonizing him, the effort is simply laughable. enate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY, look like fools as they furiously scratch out, \"is a fascist,\" on their Musk protest signs and write in, \"is absolutely right.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY, look like fools as they furiously scratch out, \"is a fascist,\" on their Musk protest signs and write in, \"is absolutely right.\" You can’t call a guy a Nazi and then say, \"Hey look, the Nazi agrees with me!\" Much like Trump himself, Musk is a man who knows how to draw attention. But unlike Trump, he does not have a vast constituency of voters across America. What Musk has is a constituency of the powerful. In populism, you have to do what is popular. It's right there in the name. To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin, what Republicans have right now is a winning coalition, if they can keep it. There’s a reason that so many ex-Democrats voted for Trump, and the GOP can’t just suddenly shove massive austerity measures down their throats. Back in the 1990s, then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich balanced the federal budget four times, but he didn’t do it by fear-mongering. His Contract With America was not gloom and doom, it was hope, a hope for better government, better lives. Gingrich, who served as the 50th speaker of the House from 1995 to 1998, helped the government achieve balanced budgets.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Ultimately, this is what is missing from Musk’s impassioned and quite possibly correct howling from the rooftop about the debt. Voters need to hear the upside. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The one thing that every Republican agrees on is that, in some form, this bill has to pass. Otherwise they are presiding over a massive tax hike. It is likely, even with changes, Musk will not be pleased. The question then becomes, now what? On every issue Musk holds dear, from not transing kids, to immigration, to birth rates, he is aligned with the GOP and in stark opposition to Democrats, who he has often accused of being afflicted with the \"woke mind virus.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Musk has earned his place as an important voice in the Republican Party and conservative politics, but part of that role is also listening, and right now, the GOP base wants this bill. Hopefully, by the fall, with this vote long gone behind us, Musk, the Trump administration, and Congress can all work to fight against the debt, and that is why everyone should dearly hope that Elon Musk does not take his ball and go home.

    "article_text": "Video released by the Gaza Humanitarian Fund shows the distribution of aid to civilians in Gaza without incident. The IDF have denied reports that there were Palestinian casualties near the GHF site on Sunday. (Credit: Gaza Humanitarian Fund) It’s time to be honest about humanitarian assistance in Gaza. The incumbent system is morally bankrupt. Grift is not a bug—it is a feature. The decades-long cycle of empty statements, inflated budgets, and institutionalized failure has created a self-sustaining machine that feeds off misery, undermines peace, and instinctively demonizes America and Israel. The current system fuels fate. Here’s an example. Just days ago, the world should have celebrated the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's week of success. Over 7 million meals were delivered free to Gazans -- no trucks seized, no aid diverted, no violence at distribution sites. The system worked despite Gaza's volatility. Gazans spontaneously thanked America and President Donald Trump. Palestinians carry bags containing food and humanitarian aid packages delivered by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-backed organization approved by Israel in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, Sunday, June 1, 2025.(AP) Instead of celebrating GHF, the international press swallowed a Hamas disinformation campaign wholesale. Hamas falsely claimed 31 Gazans died at our distribution site. Global media printed headlines treating Hamas' claims as fact. When GHF's denials were questioned but Hamas' statements were believed, GHF released CCTV proving the truth. Yet fabricated headlines still deceive online, even fooling U.N. Secretary General Guterres, who spread them the next morning (and has yet to correct his mistake). Guterres’ statement came just hours after someone incited by this fake news set Jewish Americans on fire at a Colorado hostage vigil. US-BACKED GAZA AID GROUP PAUSES FOOD DISTRIBUTION AFTER DAYS OF VIOLENCE Whatthe mediashould be doing is joining us in telling the truth about the systemic failure for years in Gaza and theUnited Nationsshould be working with us to fix the system. The current systems, built to serve the Palestinian people, have not just been ineffective—they have been actively complicit in perpetuating suffering. These organizations speak of \"human rights,\" yet remain silent when terrorists steal international aid, embed rockets in schools, and use hospitals as human shields. What the media should be doing is joining us in telling the truth about the systemic failure for years in Gaza and the U.N. should be working with us to fix the system. The current systems, built to serve the Palestinian people, have not just been ineffective—they have been actively complicit in perpetuating suffering. From UNRWA to the Human Rights Council, bigotry has been wrapped in bureaucracy, funded by American and European tax dollars, and aimed squarely at helping terrorists wage a never-ending war with Israel. Palestinians carry aid supplies they received from the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, May 28, 2025.(REUTERS/Hatem Khaled) Activists disguised as humanitarians clutch their pearls and rush out press releases in support of these failed systems, exactly as terrorists hijack aid trucks or beat dissenting Palestinians in the street trying to get to humanitarian aid. The silence is deafening, but actually, it’s worse. They keep spreading with no scrutiny the profane lies of Hamas. ISRAELI AMBASSADOR SLAMS UN'S 'MAFIA-LIKE' TACTICS AGAINST US-BACKED GAZA FOUNDATION The fact is that there were Palestinians harmed last week, but not by GHF. They wereharmed by Hamaswhen they tried to break into warehouses where Hamas had been hoarding piles and piles of humanitarian aid meant for Gazans. We’re told by beneficiaries that Hamas was selling aid or using it for coercive purposes.  One beneficiary asked our aid workers five times if our aid was truly free, and we observed the decline in the price of sugar in the rudimentary markets of Gaza. Palestinians carry bags containing food and humanitarian aid packages delivered by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-backed organization approved by Israel in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, Sunday, June 1, 2025.(AP) Yet, this behavior is excused, explained away, or flat-out ignored while organizations like the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation are attacked constantly for trying to feed Gazans with no strings attached. What GHF is guilty of is exposing the whole charade for what it is. Unfortunately, instead of just focusing on feeding Gazans, GHF humanitarians must fight a profane information war naively parroted by those who should know better. We will press on. NEW US-BACKED AID GROUP BEGINS DISTRIBUTING FOOD IN WAR-TORN GAZA Our vision is that failure will no longer be rewarded. Instead, we demand results withSilicon Valley precision. The good-hearted taxpayers of rich countries should no longer be content to line the pockets of institutional elites with cushy jobs propping up failing systems. It’s time to do it differently. We understand this is a threat to the system. Because if even a sliver of hope is delivered through a model based on transparency, accountability, and realism, the entire cottage industry of perpetual process collapses. The lavish conferences, the donor summits, the panel discussions where nothing gets done—gone.

And for those who have grown rich, powerful, and respected by keeping Palestinians poor, hopeless, and angry—that’s the real threat. We say: good. Let them be afraid.

    "title": "The ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ urgently needs a makeover to usher in Trump’s Golden Age",
    "article_text": "Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought testifying in a House budget hearing as Congress moves to codify DOGE cuts. PresidentDonald Trumpis working to usher in a new Golden Age for America. But he needs Congress to do its part by ensuring that the\"One Big, Beautiful Bill\"isn’t neutered by shortsighted compromise. Recently, Trump gave Senate Republicans the green light to make changes to the House version of his signature legislative initiative, openly acknowledging that there is room to significantly improve on its current form. I’ve been working publicly and privately to advocate for this bill since before Trump’s reelection, collaborating with some of the greatest business leaders and economists in the country to ensure that we make the absolute most of this rare opportunity to set this country up for long-term economic prosperity. TRUMP PUSHES 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AS SOLUTION TO FOUR YEARS OF BIDEN FAILURES: 'LARGEST TAX CUT, EVER' We’ve identified several provisions that add significantly to the bill’s \"score\" from the Congressional Budget Office (a measure of how much the legislation is projected to affect the federal budget) without offering commensurate economic benefits. Addressing these provisions would free up space to expand the bill’s most impactful pro-growth elements — most significantly by creating the budget room to make theTrump tax cutspermanent. House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans celebrated passing Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\"(Getty Images) One element of theHouse billthat needs to be eliminated is a provision offering full expensing for new structures. While it might sound like a good, pro-growth idea to allow companies to deduct the entire cost of a new building the year it’s placed into service, in practice no public company would ever take advantage of it — because taking the deduction would slash their reported earnings, harming their stock value and investor confidence. Even private businesses face structural hurdles, including the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT), income mismatches and the reality that bonus depreciation already provides ample incentive. Buildings are long-term investments. A one-year tax write-off simply isn’t the deciding factor. GOP SENATORS EXPRESS 'CONCERNS,' 'SKEPTICISM' OVER TRUMP'S SPENDING BILL AFTER MUSK RANT According to the CBO, however, this provision alone adds $148 billion to the projected cost of the \"Big, Beautiful Bill.\" That’s a huge chunk of change that crowds out other worthwhile provisions that companies would actually use to increase productivity and output. Blue state Republicans successfully fought for the inclusion of a much more generous cap onstate and local tax (SALT) deductions,which the House bill raises from $10,000 to $40,000. The increased cap means that about 90% of filers will be able to deduct the full value of their state and local taxes from their federal income tax, adding an estimated $320 billion to the cost of the legislation. Once again, however, the projections fail to account for the actual, real-world implications of the provision. Because of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), very few filers would even be able to claim the full deduction at the $40,000 cap used in the House bill. In other words, blue state Republicans are sabotaging this legislation for the sake of political theater — they don’t expect voters to understand the nuances of tax law, and when they run for re-election next year, they want to be able to tell their constituents that they went to bat for them. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In fact, raising the SALT cap could ultimately hurt many blue state taxpayers, because Democrat elected officials in those states would use the increased cap to justify raising taxes even higher while telling voters that Uncle Sam will be offsetting a significant portion of the cost. TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' FACES RESISTANCE FROM REPUBLICAN SENATORS OVER DEBT FEARS We’re fortunate that theTrump tax cutsare coming up for renewal at a time when Republicans control the White House and both Houses of Congress. But who will be in charge the next time the tax cuts are due to expire? We should not be forcing American families to live with the anxiety of wondering whether their taxes will automatically shoot up if the political winds aren’t blowing the right way in the future. Likewise, we can’t expect businesses to make the long-term investments oureconomyneeds if they can’t reliably project tax rates even just a few years into the future. Certainty and stability are essential to sound economic policy. With the savings from eliminating full and immediate expensing of structures and lowering the SALT cap back to $10,000,Congressshould be able to make the individual and corporate tax reductions permanent, creating the conditions for long-term growth. The White House launched a new website tabulating how much the big beautiful bill is anticipated to save Americans.(White House ) The fixes outlined above could also create room in the budget forfull and immediate expensing of R&Dinvestments. Unlike expensing of new structures, companies would eagerly take advantage of tax write-offs on their research and development costs. This was included in the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, but is currently in the process of being automatically phased out. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Competitors such as Great Britain and China are already offering permanent, full and immediate expensing of domestic R&D investments. If America intends to keep up in the race to develop and perfect world-changing new technology like artificial intelligence, we can’t afford to be out-competed by the incentives offered by other countries. Thanks to President Trump’s visionary leadership, America is on the precipice of a new Golden Age — if only Congress can get tax policy right. We only have one chance.

    "title": "Antisemitic violence erupts in America as some invoke intifada and target Jews",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn reports on calls to revoke the tax-exempt status of anti-Israel activist organizations on 'Special Report.' Vitriolicantisemitic violence– driven by hate and ignorance – is becoming commonplace in American society, and far more must be done to confront it. Within the past two weeks, two cowardly criminal acts of violence aimed at Jews occurred within the \"safety\" of our borders. On June 1, 2025, a group of Americans in Colorado were attacked while marching to raise awareness about hostages held by Hamas for the last 20 months. Twelve Americans, including one who is reportedly a Holocaust survivor, were wounded when Mohamed Soliman targeted them with a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices while yelling \"Free Palestine.\" On May 21, 2025, two young Israeli Embassy staff members were fatally shot outside a Jewish museum in our nation’s capital. The victims – a man and a woman who were planning to get engaged the following week – were attending a \"Young Diplomats Reception\" hosted by the American Jewish Committee when Elias Rodriguez, shouting \"Free Palestine,\" shot the two of them 21 times. FATAL SHOOTING OF ISRAELI EMBASSY WORKERS IN DC SPARKS OUTRAGE FROM TRUMP, ISRAELI PRESIDENT Metropolitan Police Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation officers stand guard at a perimeter near the Capital Jewish Museum on May 22, 2025 in Washington. D.C. Two Israeli Embassy staff members were shot after attending an event at the Capital Jewish Museum earlier in the evening.(Tom Brenner For The Washington Post via Getty Images) Tragically, there is nothing new about Jew-hatred. For millennia, Jews have been targeted with false accusations of greed, deicide and dual loyalty – just to name a few. Unfortunately, we are now witnessing the rise of a new trend of antisemitism that ironically appeared shortly after Hamas’ terror attack against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. On that day, Hamas – a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization – crossed into Israeli territory and murdered 1,200 innocent victims and abducted 251 others. Fifty-eight of those abductees remain in Hamas captivity today. Forty-five of those killed and 12 of those abducted were American. Four of the Americans abducted were already dead when their bodies were taken hostage – and their bodies remain in Hamas captivity to this day. After Oct. 7, antisemitic rhetoric and acts of violence throughout the world increased dramatically, and American Jews have not been spared from experiencing this horrific trend. Statistics from theAnti-Defamation Leagueshow antisemitic incidents in the U.S. reached over 10,000 from October 2023 to September 2024. This is an increase of more than 200% in the year immediately following the tragedy of Oct. 7. Police work at the scene after an attack that injured multiple people in Boulder, Colorado, on June 1, 2025.(Boulder Police Dpt.) In both recent attacks, the attackers shouted, \"Free Palestine.\" According to witnesses at the scene of the murder in Washington, D.C., the attacker also shouted, \"There is only one solution, intifada revolution.\" Encouraged by some university faculty members and praised by Hamas and Iran, thousands of American students have been chanting these exact phrases at protests and rallies on campuses across the country since Oct. 8, 2023. SIGN UP FOR ANTISEMITISM EXPOSED NEWSLETTER For many, these chants are not innocuous calls for Palestinian self-determination or a vision for a two-state solution. For some, the chant \"Free Palestine\" promotes the idea that the entire country of Israel should be only a Palestinian state, free of Jews – a call for genocide. The chant, \"There is only one solution, intifada revolution,\" glorifies violence, as it refers to the first and second intifadas – or uprisings – in Israel and the West Bank/Gaza in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, when hundreds of terror attacks, including suicide bombings, resulted in thousands of civilian casualties for both Israelis and Palestinians. This chant implies a call for this type of violence to reoccur, targeting Israelis and Jews everywhere. Elias Rodriguez, the 31-year-old suspect accused of shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers on Wednesday, May 21, 2025 in Washington D.C.(Instagram/@shinewithIsrael) PresidentDonald Trumphas vowed to combat antisemitism and has demonstrated his commitment by signing multiple executive orders, cutting federal funding to universities that fail to address campus antisemitism, deporting visa holders who are engaged in antisemitic activity and creating a multi-agency task force to combat the issue. After two recent shocking examples ofpost-Oct. 7 actsof antisemitic violence here at home, clearly more needs to be done to combat antisemitism in America. Hatred, lies and threats are rampant on social media and tech companies have an obligation to do more to ensure users comply with online terms of service. Law enforcement must be trained to understand symbols and phrases that are dog whistles for antisemitic violence. An anti-Israel sign with the phrase \"from the river to the sea Palestine will be free\" at a protest near Tulane University in New Orleans. The phrase has been criticized as calling for the destruction of Israel.(Credit: Ryan Zamos) CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Hate speech is protected speech, but incitement to imminent violence cannot be ignored. Universities must ensure both students and faculty comply with campus policies regarding antisemitism – and they must be held accountable. Urgent action is needed – a much brighter spotlight must be aimed at the antisemitic poison flooding into our society. Jews in America fear what will happen next. They continue to ask why they are being targeted simply for being Jews. Is this any way for an American citizen – or a citizen of any country – to live?

    "article_text": "Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons explains the mission of finding and removing individuals who have overstayed visas and discusses the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student in Massachusetts. Nashville is not, nor is any other city inTennessee,a sanctuary city. I intend to make certain that remains the case. In May in Nashville, ICE conducted a successful operation with Tennessee Highway Patrol to arrest 196 criminal illegal aliens, including a convicted rapist and a suspected murderer. While I have received every assurance thatNashvilleand every other city in Tennessee will work in a cooperative manner with law enforcement, make no mistake: I will make certain those commitments are not just lip service. TENNESSEE REP SAYS NASHVILLE MAYOR'S ICE POLICIES AMOUNT TO 'AIDING AND ABETTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION' After the operation,Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connellcondemned ICE’s good work, promoted a fund to provide support dollars for illegal immigrants and their families in Nashville, and even updated an executive order to fast-track the collection of all Nashville government employees’ interactions with ICE. Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell criticized ICE raids in Nashville, saying they are not focused on making the city safer, but instead leave the community fearing law enforcement interaction.(Associated Press / Getty Images) The mayor’s executive order has – unsurprisingly – led to the doxxing of ICE agents, who have faced a 413% increase in assaults against them while on the job. In Nashville, we know that activists are monitoring ICE activity in the city and alerting each other of ICE’s movements using encrypted group chats. Did these groups see the doxxed ICE agents’ personal information? How will they use it? How does the mayor ensure these lists of ICE agents do not end up in the wrong hands? These are all questions we shouldn’t have to ask, but now we do. HOUSE GOP TARGETS ANOTHER DEM OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF BLOCKING ICE AMID DELANEY HALL FALLOUT The cloud of confusion that has arisen from this misstep is unfortunate, and the facts need to be made clear: the state of Tennessee is a state that stands for law enforcement and the protection of its citizens. The leftwing mediais adding fuel to the fire. For example, New York Times opinion writer Margaret Renkl explicitly compares ICE raids in Nashville to the Jim Crow South and the Trail of Tears. Her article – littered with cherry-picked stories from immigrant activists – uses such ridiculous words as \"hunt\" to suggest that what is happening in my state is not legal. Let me be clear: the only illegality is from those who chose to cross the border illegally. We know where this all leads: In 2019, an Antifa activist attempted to firebomb an ICE facility in Tacoma, Washington. Thankfully, he was stopped before he could succeed. But his intentions and motivation were clear. In his manifesto, he slandered ICE as \"the forces of evil,\" and compared their detention facilities to \"concentration camp[s].\" DHS FIRES BACK AT BLUE-CITY MAYOR UNHAPPY ABOUT ICE OPERATION, PROVIDES RAP SHEETS FOR THOSE CHARGED Even when such rhetoric from the media and mismanagement on the part of local officials does not inspire acts of domestic terrorism, it still leads to harassment and threats against ICE and other federal law enforcement officers. In the first Trump presidency, the left shamelessly engaged in doxxing of ICE agents, sharing their personal information in an effort to intimidate them out of their jobs, or even cause direct harm to them. Such private information was even shared by college professors, published by WikiLeaks, and disseminated by the far-left domestic terrorist organization Antifa.

Yet some, like Nashville Mayor O’Connell, whether intentional or not, are inhibiting the president’s mission. This will not stand. BLUE CITY MAYOR SAYS ICE ARRESTS OF DANGEROUS CRIMINALS ARE NOT ‘FOCUSED ON MAKING US SAFER’ The Trump administration and the men and women of ICE have a Herculean task before them in cleaning up what former President Joe Biden facilitated: thelargest invasion of our Southern borderin history. For four years, we watched Biden sacrifice our national sovereignty to allow millions to illegally flood our country.

    "title": "Founding Fathers understood parental rights are natural rights. Trump knows it, too",
    "article_text": "Fox News chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream breaks down a judge's ruling to proceed with Mahmoud Khalil's deportation and teases her upcoming special 'From the Heartland' on 'Fox News Live.' One hundred years ago, in 1925, theU.S. Supreme Courtdelivered a powerful message in Pierce v. Society of Sisters: \"The child is not the mere creature of the state,\" and parents have the fundamental right \"to direct the upbringing and education of\" their children. This wasn’t just a legal victory—it was a triumph for families, a declaration that parents, not bureaucrats, know what’s best for their kids. As we mark this milestone, we celebrate President Donald Trump, a leader whose fight for parental rights echoes the wisdom of our Founding Fathers, who saw the family as sacred and rooted in natural law. With a Supreme Court ruling on Mahmoud v. Taylor on the horizon, let’s reflect on why this matters and why the legacy of Pierce resonates at kitchen tables across America. Parental rightsare more than a legal concept—they’re a God-given responsibility, woven into the fabric of human nature. The Founding Fathers understood this deeply. John Adams wrote in 1778, \"The foundation of national morality must be laid in private families,\" emphasizing that parents are the first teachers of virtue, shaping children into citizens capable of sustaining a free republic. Thomas Jefferson, inspired by natural law, believed parents' role in guiding their children’s education and morals was essential to liberty. Drawing from John Locke’s philosophy, they saw parental authority as a natural right, predating government itself—a right to raise, love, and prepare children for the world without state overreach. This belief is why the Constitution, through the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, protects unlisted rights like those of parents, ensuring families remain free from arbitrary control. EDUCATION DEPARTMENT RESCINDS RECORD $37 MILLION FINE AGAINST GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY: ‘WRONGFULLY ACCUSED’ The Pierce decision brought thisvision to life, striking down an Oregon law that tried to force children into public schools, sidelining parents ’choices. The Court affirmed that parents have the right to decide how their kids are educated—whether through public schools, private institutions, homeschooling, or faith-based learning. This ruling speaks to every Mom and Dad sitting down with their kids, teaching them values, faith, and the skills to thrive. It’s about ensuring your daughter’s school respects your family’s beliefs or that your son’s education aligns with your vision for his future. It’s a promise that your children belong to you, not the government. President Trump embodies this legacy. Like the Founders, he respects natural law and the sanctity of the family as the cornerstone of a strong America. Last August, at the Joyful Warriors Summit in Washington, D.C., I had the privilege of interviewing him while he was on the campaign trail. In between Lee Greenwood’s Proud to be an American filling the room with patriotic pride and us dancing together to YMCA, I asked him about the injustice of parents being labeled domestic terrorists for simply questioning what their children were learning in school. His response was unwavering: he promised to stop that on day one. True to his word, President Trump has kept that promise, putting parents firmly in the driver’s seat. His push forschool choice empowers parentsto pick the best education for their kids, not just the one the government dictates. He’s fought to keep Washington out of your family’s business, protecting your right to pass on your religious values and ensuring schools don’t push agendas without your consent. Furthermore, through his leadership in empowering the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement, Trump is championing efforts to end chronic childhood disease, giving parents the tools and support to safeguard their children’s health from preventable illnesses. As John Adams believed parents shape the nation’s moral foundation, Trump’s policies—cutting red tape in education, supporting family-friendly tax breaks, defending religious freedom, and promoting health initiatives through MAHA—reflect that same conviction. When schools or officials try to sideline parents, Trump’s been clear: \"Not on my watch.\" His leadership mirrors the Founders' warning against government overreach, like Samuel Adams' 1772 call to protect personal liberties from arbitrary state control. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Parental rightscome with profound responsibilities. It’s not just about the freedom to raise your kids—it’s about the duty to prepare them for life, making tough calls about their schooling, values, and well-being. This duty, as Locke and the Founders saw it, is written in our hearts, not granted by any law. Pierce protects your ability to fulfill that calling, ensuring you can guide your children with love and conviction. A Supreme Court decision in Mahmoud v. Taylor to allow opt-outs would further cement this right, empowering parents to protect their children’s moral and religious upbringing. Cases like Mahmoud v. Taylor offer a chance to strengthen this protection, reinforcing that schools and officials must respect your voice in your kids ’education and upbringing. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Why does this matter? Because strong families build a strong America. When parents are free to raise their children as they see fit, communities flourish, and kids grow up ready to lead. But when the government meddles—pushing rules or ideas that exclude parents—it erodes the liberty the Founders fought for. Pierce stopped that overreach a century ago, and Trump’s fight keeps that spirit alive, ensuring parents have a say in a world where it’s easy to feel drowned out. His broader vision—tax cuts that let families keep more of their hard-earned money, protecting faith-based groups, demanding transparency in schools, and empowering MAHA to tackle chronic childhood disease—shows he understands families are America’s backbone. As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of Pierce v. Society of Sisters, let’s honor the Founders' belief in the family as a sacred institution and Trump’s commitment to keeping parents first, including his efforts through MAHA to ensure children grow up healthy and free from chronic disease.

Here’s a roundup ofthe most notable features rumored to be coming to iOS 19. Sources told Bloomberg thatApple plans to rename its operating systemsto reflect the release year rather than using version numbers. This means that iOS 19 will be renamed iOS 26, similar to how car model years are designated. This name change will also apply to other software updates, such as iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. Anticipated to be the most significant design change since iOS 7, the operating system may feature a complete visual overhaul, one that’s reportedlyinspired byApple’s Vision Pro headset, according to Bloomberg. This could include translucent panels for navigation and circular app icons. The visionOS-inspired design will be made across Apple’s entire ecosystem with the goal of creating a more cohesive experience. Apple is alsorumoredto be releasing agaming appthat will integrate Apple Arcade and the App Store’s game offerings, featuring a central hub for achievements, leaderboards, and App Store content. This comes after the companyacquired its first game studio, RAC7, according to DigitalTrends. Apple may also be developing an AI feature to serve as apersonal health coach. This new chatbot is expected to suggest lifestyle changes and provide health advice based on user data collected from the Health app. Additionally, the Health app may be revamped to include a food-tracking feature, allowing users to log their carbohydrate and caffeine intake. Apple could improve iPhone battery health withAI-powered battery management.This new feature is reported to analyze device usage and make adjustments to conserve battery life. There may also be a new charging icon on the lock screen that gives an estimated time for when it’s fully charged. Another rumor suggests thatreverse wireless chargingis being tested on the iPhone 17 Pro models, allowing users to charge accessories such as AirPods or the Apple Watch directly from their iPhone. According to9to5Mac, the Messages app is set to get an Apple Intelligence-powered translation feature that can automatically translate messages as soon as they hit users’ inboxes.9to5Mac also reports that Apple Intelligence couldpower a polling featurethat lets people in group chats vote and offers AI-generated poll suggestions. One notable absence from all the rumors is the impressiveSiri capabilitieshighlighted in Apple’s 2024 presentation, which featured a more context-aware assistant that can gather information and perform actions across different apps. The companystatedin March that the new features are delayed. While we can expect some AI-related announcements, the primary focus is likely to be on design changes. Reports indicate that improvements to existing Apple Intelligence features will also be introduced, along with some new additions.

Earlier this week, AI dev platform Hugging Face released an open AI model for robotics calledSmolVLA. Trained on “compatibly licensed,” community-shared datasets, SmolVLA outperforms much larger models for robotics in both virtual and real-world environments, Hugging Face claims. “SmolVLA aims to democratize access to vision-language-action [VLA] models and accelerate research toward generalist robotic agents,” writes Hugging Face in ablog post. “SmolVLA is not only a lightweight yet capable model, but also a method for training and evaluating generalist robotics [technologies].” SmolVLA is a part of Hugging Face’s rapidly expanding effort to establish an ecosystem of low-cost robotics hardware and software. Last year, the company launched LeRobot, a collection of robotics-focused models, datasets, and tools. More recently, Hugging Face acquiredPollen Robotics, a robotics startup based in France, and unveiled severalinexpensiverobotics systems, includinghumanoids, for purchase. SmolVLA, which is 450 million parameters in size, was trained on data from LeRobot Community Datasets, specially marked robotics datasets shared on Hugging Face’s AI development platform. Parameters, sometimes referred to as “weights,” are the internal components of a model that guide its behavior. Hugging Face claims that SmolVLA is small enough to run on a single consumer GPU — or even a MacBook — and can be tested and deployed on “affordable” hardware, including the company’s own robotics systems. In an interesting twist, SmolVLA also supports an “asynchronous inference stack,” which Hugging Face says allows the model to separate the processing of a robot’s actions from the processing of what it sees and hears. As the company explains in its blog post, “[b]ecause of this separation, robots can respond more quickly in fast-changing environments.” SmolVLA is available for download from Hugging Face. Already, a user on X claims to have used the model to control a third-party robotic arm: 🚀 SmolVLA — feels like a BERT moment for robotics 🤖I tried it on the Koch Arm:Inference on RTX 2050 (4GB), fine-tuned with just 31 demos, and matches/outperforms single-task baselines 🔥Big thanks to@RemiCadene@danaubakirova @mustash97 @francesco__capu 🙌pic.twitter.com/TiBkAZGwkM It’s worth noting that Hugging Face is far from the only player in the nascent open robotics race. Nvidia has a collection of tools for open robotics, and startup K-Scale Labs is building the components for what it’s calling “open-source humanoids.” Other formidable firms in the segment include Dyna Robotics, Jeff Bezos-backed Physical Intelligence, andRLWRLD.

Other stolen data includes employee data and the contents of shared drives. One of the folders contains documents, such as background files, polygraphs, and other private identifying information of police officers with Kettering Health Police Department. On Monday, Kettering Healthpublished an updateon the cyberattack, saying the company was able to restore “core components” of its electronic health record system, which is provided by Epic, a healthcare software company.

Reddit claims in the complaint that Anthropic’s unauthorized use of the site’s data for commercial purposes was unlawful, and alleges the AI startup violated Reddit’s user agreement. Reddit’s lawsuit makes it the first Big Tech company to legally challenge an AI model provider over its training data practices, joining a litany of publishers that have sued tech companies on similar grounds. The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft for training on its news articles without payment or permission. Meanwhile, Sarah Silverman and other book authors havesued Meta for training AI modelson their books without approval. Music publishers and artists have also brought similar claims against AI audio, video, and image generation startups, alleging misuse of their content. “We will not tolerate profit-seeking entities like Anthropic commercially exploiting Reddit content for billions of dollars without any return for redditors or respect for their privacy,” said Ben Lee, Reddit’s chief legal officer, in a statement to TechCrunch. Notably, Reddit has inked deals with other AI model providers, includingOpenAIandGoogle, that allow these companies to train AI models on Reddit’s data and have the site’s posts appear in their respective AI chatbots’ answers. However, in the filing, Reddit says it subjects OpenAI and Google to certain terms that protect its users’ interests and privacy. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has an8.7% stake in Reddit, making him the third-largest shareholder, and was once a member of the company’s board of directors. In the filing, Reddit claims that it approached Anthropic and made it clear that the AI startup did not have authorization to scrape or use Reddit’s content. However, Reddit alleges that Anthropic “refused to engage.” “We disagree with Reddit’s claims and will defend ourselves vigorously,” said Anthropic spokesperson Danielle Ghighlieri in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. Reddit claims in its complaint that Anthropic’s scraper bots ignored the social network’s robots.txt files, a standard that signals to automated systems not to crawl websites. The online community platform alleges that, after Anthropic claimed to block its bots from scraping Reddit in 2024, Anthropic’s bots continued to scrape the platform more than 100,000 times. Reddit is asking Anthropic to pay compensatory damages, as well as restitution for the amount by which Anthropic has been enriched by scraping Reddit’s content. Reddit also requests an injunction prohibiting Anthropic from continuing to use Reddit’s content. Topics Senior Reporter, Consumer Think you know AI? Prove it.

He was addressing the headlines about the companylooking to hire human workersafter previously saying Klarnaused artificial intelligenceto do work that would equate to 700 workers. “Two things can be true at the same time,” he said. Siemiatkowski said it’s true that the company looked to stop hiring human workers a few years ago and rolled out AI agents that have helped reduce the cost of customer support and increase thecompany’s revenue per employee.The company had 5,500 workers two years ago, and that number now stands at around 3,000, he said, adding that as the company’s salary costs have gone down, Klarna now seeks to reinvest a majority of that money into employee cash and equity compensation. But, he insisted, this doesn’t mean there isn’t an opportunity for humans to work at his company. “We think offering human customer service is always going to be a VIP thing,” he said, comparing it to how people pay more for clothing stitched by hand rather than machines. “So we think that two things can be done at the same time. We can use AI to automatically take away boring jobs, things that are manual work, but we are also going to promise our customers to have a human connection.” He spoke about how the company plans to balance employees and AI workers. Siemiatkowski said that right now, engineering positions at the company haven’t shrunk as much as those in other departments, but he notes that this could shift. “What I’m seeing internally is a new rise of businesspeople who are coding themselves,” he said, adding that the challenge many engineers have these days is that they are not business savvy. “I think that category of people will become even more valuable going forward,” Siemiatkowski continued, especially as they can use AI and put their business understanding to good use. He himself is using ChatGPT to help him learn to code and help him understand more of the data side of Klarna. He said doing this has helped Klarna become a better company. Before, he thought he would never catch up in learning what was needed to take a more present role in database conversations at the company. “I’ll take a Slack thread, I’ll throw it in ChatGPT and say, ‘This makes sense, right?’” he said, adding that he uses ChatGPT like a private tutor. But he is also aware that AI isn’t just about employees. He spoke of the increase in scams and how it impacts high-trust societies like his native Sweden. TheFinancial Times recently reportedon the rise of fintech scams, pointing out, for example, how susceptible residents in Singapore can be to them because they are more naturally trusting of various institutions. “And AI is obviously accelerating this,” Siemiatkowski said. Siemiatkowski also once again addressed why the company stopped using Salesforce and Workday, saying it was because Klarna wanted to consolidate its data in a way that would be easier to feed into AI. He said, for example, if Klarna wanted to gather information about one of its clients, it would have to go through the Google Suite, Slack, Workday, Salesforce, and so forth. “We realize that the only way forward is going to be to consolidate [data],” he said, adding that the company stopped using around 1,200 small software services. About its pending IPO?He indicated that Klarna could soon move ahead with it but was otherwise noncommittal. “I can say that I’m happy there’s less turbulence in the market,” he said with a smile. And if he had a magic wand and could change one thing? He would make the U.K. part of the EU again. The crowd then erupted into applause.

Semiconductor giantAMD on Wednesday announcedit acquired AI software optimization startupBrium. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Brium is a startup that appears to be in stealth mode. The startup builds machine learning applications to enable AI inference, the process a trained AI model uses to draw conclusions from new data, across a variety of different hardware options, according to a blog post onBrium’s bare-bones website. Cutting through that jargon a bit, Brium can help retrofit AI software to work with different AI hardware than it might have been designed for originally. In a press release, AMD said its acquisition of Brium will help its commitment to “building a high-performance, open AI software ecosystem that empowers developers and drives innovation.” While AMD is saying that this acquisition helps create a more open AI ecosystem, which isn’t wrong, it seems clear that it’s also meant to help AMD overcome one of its biggest roadblocks: a large percentage of AI software is being designed for Nvidia hardware and chips. Brium’s sole blog post, which came out in November 2024, talked about the industry’s reliance on Nvidia and called out AMD specifically. “In recent years, the hardware industry has made strides towards providing viable alternatives to Nvidia hardware for server-side inference,” the blog post reads. “Solutions such as AMD’s Instinct GPUs offer strong performance characteristics, but it remains a challenge to harness that performance in practice as workloads are typically tuned extensively with Nvidia GPUs in mind. At Brium, we intend to enable efficient [model] inference across a range of hardware architectures.” This is AMD’s fourth strategic acquisition in the past two years, with the company’s goal being to foster an open source AI ecosystem, according to the press release. The company previously acquiredSilo AI(in July 2024),Nod.AI(October 2023), andMipsology(August 2023). TechCrunch has reached out to AMD for more information.

Up until now, Lens Studio has only been accessible via a desktop application for professional developers. While the desktop application will remain the primary tool for professionals, Snap says that the new iOS app and web tool are designed to allow people at all skill levels to create Lenses. “These are experimental new tools that make it easier than ever to create, publish, and play with Snapchat Lenses made by you,” Snap wrote in ablog post. “Now, you can generate your own AI effects, add your dancing Bitmoji to the fun, and express yourself with Lenses that reflect your mood or an inside joke — whether you’re on the go or near your computer.” While Snap currently has an ecosystem of over 400,000 professional AR developers, the company is looking to attract more people who are interested in creating Lenses with the launch of these simpler tools. Snap is considered a leader in AR thanks to its early adoption of the technology through its AR filters and Lenses, and it’s clear the company is committed to investing in the space, even as others may be retracting from it. Last year, Meta angered creators after it decided toshut down its Spark AR platform, which allowed third parties to build augmented reality (AR) effects. By opening up access to AR creation, Snap is doubling down on its vision for the technology. As Snap is bringing AR creation into the hands of more people, the company is also rolling out advanced tools for professionals.

In that case, the new integration offers a more seamless path to web monetization, the companies explain. “There’s a huge opportunity for subscription apps to grow revenue by expanding to the web — but that shift brings new technical and operational challenges,” said Jimmy Fitzgerald, CEO of Paddle, in a statement shared with TechCrunch. “By partnering with RevenueCat, we’re making it easier for developers to manage subscriptions across platforms, while giving them more control over how and where they monetize.” RevenueCat co-founder and CEO Jacob Eiting, whose service today powers over 70,000 apps, added that Paddle was a great partner on the new effort, which will allow developers to offer web-based payments alongside traditional app stores.

On Wednesday, the PayPal-owned payment platform debuted several new debit card benefits and expanded the ability to make payments with retailers such as TikTok Shop and Uber. The updates signal Venmo is trying to become more of a full-service fintech service, not just a peer-to-peer payments app. The revamped Venmo Debit Card, which was first introduced in 2018, now features a tap-to-pay capability, which could help Venmo position itself to capture a larger share of everyday transactions. Additionally, cardholders now get 15% cash back at Lyft, McDonald’s, Sephora, Walgreens, and Walmart. Venmo also rolled out the option for cardholders to initiate automatic transfers, enabling them to schedule transfers and set specific balance thresholds that automatically trigger reloading when the balance falls below a certain level. Users can also make international purchases without incurring foreign transaction fees, a notable perk for frequent travelers. For all shoppers, Venmo now allows users to make payments at brands such as Domino’s, Instacart, TikTok Shop, and Uber. These updates come after Cash App’sQ1 shortfall, as its parent company, Block, revealed that consumers used the app less than anticipated, resulting in a gross profit of $1.38 billion, which was below its expectations. In contrast, Venmo reported a 20% increase in revenue compared to the previous year. The usage of paying with Venmo jumped, with total payment volume increasing by over 50%, and the number of monthly active accounts rising by 30%. Although Venmo has seen success, Zelle continues to maintain a significant portion of the U.S. peer-to-peer payments market, achieving a record high of over$1 trillionin payment volume in 2024.

As part of the launch, ChatGPT is gaining connectors for Dropbox, Box, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Google Drive. This allows ChatGPT to look for information across users’ own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company’s slide deck and documents to build out an investment thesis. OpenAI said that the new feature will follow an organization’s access control hierarchy. Recording and transcription of meetings, now a table-stakes feature of the productivity suites, is also now available. The feature can generate notes with time-stamped citations and suggest actions. Users will be able to query for information in their meeting notes, as they can with documents and files across the integrated services. Plus, users can convert action items into a Canvas document,OpenAI’s tool for writing and coding projects. The feature competes with ClickUp, Zoom, and, more recently,Notion, which have all added some type of transcription and meeting summarization features to their products. In addition, the company is introducing deep research connectors for HubSpot, Linear, and select Microsoft and Google tools in beta. OpenAI said that users can now prepare detailed research reports through Deep Research using knowledge and data from these sources, along with web information. OpenAI said connectors are available to all paid users. Customers can also use MCP (model context protocol) to connect to other tools for deep research. MCP support will be available to Pro, Team, and Enterprise users, the company said. The addition of these features indicates that OpenAI wants businesses to use ChatGPT even more than they already might be in their enterprise workspaces. The company is likely to succeed here. While startups likeNotionandLux Capital-backed Contextare also trying to build AI-powered office tools that provide research and analysis features, OpenAI has a first-mover advantage.

Then, a few weeks ago, House Republicans passed a bill with provisions that would kneecap Tesla. Now Musk is fuming that the bill is “a disgusting abomination.” Plenty has been written about Musk’s motivations for cozying up to President Donald Trump; for spending 130 days as a special government employee; for spending time away from Tesla, the main source of his wealth. Whatever his reasons, Musk did come away with some wins: He managed to secure somefree advertisingfor Tesla, and Starlink isslowly embedding itselfinto the federal government. But his time roaming the halls of power and standing alongside the president hasn’t exempted Tesla from Republicans’ desire to sink clean energy and electric vehicles. On Tuesday, Musk let loose. “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” hewroteon X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.” I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore.This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it. The Congressional Budget Office has yet to score the bill and its impact on the deficit, but this week the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit organization,estimatedthat the legislation would add $3 trillion in debt. Musk might be publicly denouncing the reconciliation bill for its inability to rein in federal deficits — there’s no reason to think he doesn’t believe its a problem — but it’s hard to imagine he doesn’t feel personally slighted by the legislation. AnAxios reportbacks up that take on the situation, saying that Musk was “frustrated at failing to win favorable treatment in the bill and the administration at large.” “Elon was butthurt,” a source with knowledge of Musk’s feelings told Axios. It’s not just Musk’s feelings that could be bruised: His fortune could be dented if provisions hostile to Tesla survive the Senate. Tesla’s biggest hit would come fromrevisionsto the EV tax credit. Today, consumers who buy an eligible EV can claim up to $7,500, a provision that runs through 2032. Republicans want to end it in 2026 and reinstate the per-manufacturer cap of 200,000 vehicles. The cap almost feels targeted at Tesla, since the automaker was among the first to exceed that figure. But Republicans didn’t stop there. They also took a hammer to clean energy, severely constraining the ability of rooftop solar installations to qualify for 30% tax credits. If passed, the changes would undercut Tesla’s energy division, which recently has grown 67% year-over-year. The business line has already been threatened by Trump’s tariffs, which “will have a relatively larger impact on our energy generation and storage business compared to our automotive business,” Tesla said in itsquarterly report. In a parting shot, the White House announced Saturday, the day after Musk’s departure, that it was pulling Jared Isaacman’s nomination to be NASA administrator, something Musk had championed.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Airtime, the video startupfrom Evernote’s founder Phil Libin, has laid off dozens of employees, TechCrunch has learned, and Airtime confirmed. According to the company, 25 people were let go from the 58-person team — a change Airtime described as “bigger than usual.” WhileAirtimecharacterizes the departures as part of its typical seasonal approach to employment, sources inside the company said staff were surprised by the announcement. Many were under the impression the startup intended to raise funds this year and were previously told no cuts were planned, they said. Formerly known as mmhmm, Airtime was launched in 2020 by Libin, whose Evernote, a note-taking startup, wasvaluedat nearly a $1 billion at its height before being sidelined by newer competitors like Notion. (The company latersold to Bending Spoonsin 2022 for a decidedly smaller figure.) Firstlaunchedamid the COVID pandemic, when all office work had suddenly shifted to video, Airtime today offers two key tools for online meetings. Its “Airtime Creator” lets users present a deck while appearing on screen at the same time, while its “Airtime Camera” allows users to create custom looks to stand out in meetings. The startup introduced a “seasons”-focused employment structure in late 2022, following a layoff of around 10%-15% of the staff, which had capped the company’s headcount at 100 while it searched for product-market fit. The idea was introduced so staff wouldn’t face any surprise firings or layoffs. Instead, the company would decide roughly every six months who would be invited back for the next “season.” This plan allowed Airtime to give staff a longer heads-up if they weren’t going to return, so they had time to seek other employment. And ideally, employees would work throughout a full season before choosing to quit. Such a structure, as you can imagine, was controversial. But the deal had been honored on both ends since its launch. The recent layoffs have frustrated staff because, typically, their “season” would have ended on the last day of June, according to what their managers told them, sources told us. But impacted employees have been given an end date of Friday, June 6. That means their severance covers at least some of what would have normally been offered if they were employed through the period they were promised under the “seasons” arrangement. Libin, however, says that people’s departure dates vary. Some stay an extra two weeks to finish up, and others leave sooner. And everyone is receiving six weeks of severance from their last day, so the issue here could be employee confusion or miscommunications. The layoffs themselves were hashed out by leadership over two eight-hour sessions at Nobu in Palo Alto, sources claim. Staff were told on Tuesday, June 3, while their managers were told the night prior. An unknown number of independent contractors were also let go, they said. As to what necessitated the cuts, company insiders said Airtime’s product never really took off and experienced quite a bit of churn. User acquisition ad spend also cost Airtime high tens of thousands of dollars per month, and employees report that Libin was often absent from day-to-day decisions as hefocused his attention on his restaurant in Arkansas. Airtime, meanwhile, said the larger cuts had to do with the company’s changing focus. In an emailed statement attributed to Libin, Airtime said the following: Since 2022, Airtime has operated on a ‘seasonal’ structure: two five-and-a-half-month work seasons per year, with a shared two-week break in between. Near the end of each season, we decide who comes back based on plans for the following season. The company invites some people back, and they decide whether they want to return. There’s a mutual commitment that people who return will not leave mid-season and that the company won’t terminate anyone mid-season other than for serious misbehavior. We treat everyone who departs at the end of a season equally, whether or not they were invited back. Product releases, hiring, departures, promotions, and other events are also timed around the seasons to provide people with a predictable cadence. We’re currently in our sixth seasonal transition, and we’ve made changes to the team every time. This change is bigger than usual because our focus changed more than usual. Of 58 employees, we’ve asked 33 to come back next season to work on our new products and partnerships. To date, Airtime has raised nearly $135 million in venture funding across multiple early-stage rounds. Some of those funds were used for M&A, as with the deal toacquire filter-maker Memix in 2020, thenacquire Macro, a maker of filters and reactions for online meetings, in 2021. The latter deal was focused on bringing in founders with product chops,Ankith HarathiandJohn Keck. (The pair has since left Airtime, according to their LinkedIn profiles.) Airtime parent All Turtles also brought inAlexander Pashintsev, who previously worked on AI at Evernote, but Airtime itself has not yet made a significant AI push. Sarah Perez can be reached at sarahp@techcrunch.com and @sarahperez.01 on Signal. TechCrunch also offers secure tip lineshere. Correction: Airtime raised ~$135M, not $235M.

Labour has faced scrutiny over plans to tackle child poverty in recent weeks, and is yet to decide whether to scrap the two-child benefit cap. Ministers said the changes to free school meals would save parents £500 a year and \"lift 100,000 children out of poverty\". They have also pledged £13m to a dozen food charities across England to \"fight food poverty\", by redistributing food from farms which might otherwise go to waste. \"Feeding more children every day, for free, is one of the biggest interventions we can make to put more money in parents' pockets, tackle the stain of poverty, and set children up to learn,\" said Sir Keir. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank said that while the rule change would cut child poverty to a degree and would be cheaper than making free school meals universal, \"other measures - such as lifting the two-child limit - would have a lower cost per child lifted out of poverty\". Christine Farquarson, Associate Director of the IFS, said in a statement that \"today's announcement will not see anything like 100,000 children lifted out of poverty next year\". She said fewer pupils would be affected than the government's estimate due to protections put in place in 2018.  They ensure children don't lose eligibility for free school meals when their family circumstances change. The changes are due to come into effect at the start of the 2026 academic year. The announcement has been largely welcomed by the education sector and organisations campaigning against child poverty. Nick Harrison, chief executive of the Sutton Trust charity, said it was a \"significant step towards taking hunger out of the classroom\". Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders union, said it was \"great news\". \"There is much more to be done - but this is a welcome step forward,\" he added. Kate Anstey, head of education policy at the Child Poverty Action Group, said the extension would cover \"all children in poverty and those at risk of poverty\", with the current criteria only accounting for around two-thirds of those children. She called it a \"game-changer for children and families\", but called on the government to go further. \"We hope this is a sign of what's to come in the autumn's child poverty strategy, with government taking more action to meet its manifesto commitment to reduce child poverty in the UK,\" she said. Liberal Democrats spokesperson Munira Wilson said: \"This can only be a first step. To end the cost of learning crisis, the government needs to commit to auto-enrolling eligible children for free school meals, lifting the two-child benefit cap, and capping uniform costs to truly change the lives of children in poverty.\" Last week, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the governmentwas looking at scrapping the two-child benefit cap, which prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. She said the policy had pushed people into poverty, but scrapping it would \"cost a lot of money\". Charities have called for the cap to be abolished innext week's spending review. The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, when it publishes its child poverty strategy. Sir Keir said he was \"absolutely determined that we will drive down child poverty\" duringPrime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. But Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused him of \"causing confusion\" over the policy. The total number of children registered for free school meals in England is about 2.1 million, or 24.6% of the total pupil population, according to thelatest data. Families in England need tomeet certain criteriafor their children to be eligible. That can include receiving Universal Credit but, until the changes are implemented next September, parents also must have a household income of less than £7,400 a year, after tax. Parents have to apply for their children to receive them and eligible children are not automatically enrolled. In February, MPs on the cross-party education committeecalled for that to change. They said tens of thousands of eligible children were missing out on free school meals because their parents were not claiming them - often because of language barriers or difficulty with the administrative process. Children's eligibility for free school meals varies across the UK. All primary school childrenin Londonandin Walescan access free meals. In Scotland,all children in the first five years of primary school are eligible, as well as all children from families receiving the Scottish Child Payment benefit. Parentsin Northern Irelandcan apply if they receive certain benefits and are below an income threshold which is approximately double the current England level, at £15,000. Watchdog Estyn expresses concern that not enough pupils are reaching their full potential in maths. A final decision on whether the primary school in Shackleford will close is still expected. The proposed change at Honywood School in Coggeshall has resulted in feedback from parents. Spanish overtakes French as the most widely taught language in schools in Northern Ireland. The National Deaf Children's Society says deaf children could fall behind without the support.",

    "title": "Are the surprise airfield attacks a turning point for Ukraine?",
    "article_text": "Three days on, and Ukraine is still digesting the full implications of Operation Spider's Web, Sunday's massive assault on Russia's strategic aviation. On Wednesday, the agency which orchestrated the attack, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), released additional, vivid footage of the attacks in progress, as well as tantalising glimpses into how the whole complex operation was conducted. Satellite images that have emerged since Sunday, showing the wrecked outlines of planes sitting on the tarmac at the Olenya, Ivanovo, Dyagilevo and Belaya airbases, also help tell the story of the operation's unprecedented success. For Ukrainian observers, the whole operation, a year-and-a-half in the making, remains a marvel. \"This can be considered one of the most brilliant operations in our history,\" Roman Pohorlyi, founder of the DeepState, a group of Ukrainian military analysts, told me. \"We've shown that we can be strong, we can be creative and we can destroy our enemies no matter how far away they are.\" It's important to note that almost all the information that has emerged since Sunday has been released by the SBU itself. Flushed with its own success, it is keen to cast the operation in the best possible light. Its information campaign has been helped by the fact that the Kremlin has said almost nothing. Speaking to the media on Wednesday after handing out medals to SBU officers involved in the operation, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky repeated the claim that 41 aircraft had been damaged or destroyed. \"Half of them cannot be restored,\" he said, \"and some will take years to repair, if they can be restored at all.\" Had a ceasefire been in place, he added, Operation Spider's Web would not have happened. The latest four-minute compilation released by the SBU shows a number of key details. Shot from the perspective of some of the 117 drones involved, we see Russian strategic bombers, transport aircraft and airborne warning and control (AWACS) being hunted down. Fires can be seen raging on a number of stricken planes. For the first time, we get glimpses under the wings of some of the bombers, revealing that they were already armed with cruise missiles, which Russia has used to devastating effect in its air raids on Ukraine. The drones, many flown remotely by a separate pilot, sitting far away in Ukraine, are carefully and precisely aimed at vulnerable points, including fuel tanks located in the wings. Some of the resulting fireballs also suggest the tanks were full of fuel, ready for take off. One significant section of the video shows drones homing in on two Beriev A-50s, giant AWACS aircraft first produced in the Soviet Union. Of all the aircraft targeted by Operation Spider's Web, the A-50, with its radar capable of seeing targets and threats more than 600km (372 miles) away, is arguably the most important. Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, Russia was thought to operate around nine A-50s. Before last Sunday, as many as three had been shot down or damaged in an earlier drone attack. The latest footage strongly implies that drones hit the circular radar domes of the two A-50s parked at the Ivanovo Severny airbase, north-east of Moscow. However, since the video feed cuts out at the moment of impact, this is hard to completely verify. Satellite imagery, which clearly displays the wreckage of numerous bombers, is inconclusive when it comes to the A-50. But Russia's fleet of these crucial aircraft could now be down to as few as four. \"Restarting production of the A-50 is presently highly unlikely, due to difficulties with import substitution and the destruction of production facilities,\" defence analyst Serhii Kuzan told me. \"As such, every loss of this type of aircraft constitutes a strategic problem for Russia, one it cannot quickly compensate for.\" Earlier on Wednesday, the SBU offered a brief glimpse into another of Sunday's remarkable features: the use of specially constructed containers, mounted on flatbed trucks, to transport armed drones to sites close to the four Russian airbases. Two videos show a truck carrying what appear to be two wooden mobile homes, complete with windows and doors. In one video, roof panels are clearly visible. Reports suggest these were retracted or otherwise removed shortly before the attacks began, allowing dozens of drones stored inside to take off. It's not known when or where the videos were filmed, although snow visible beside the road in one suggests it could have been weeks or months ago. In another video, posted on a Russian Telegram channel on Sunday, a police officer was seen entering the back of one of the containers in the wake of the attack. Seconds later, the container exploded, suggesting it may have been booby-trapped. How to assess the impact of such a spectacular operation? \"From a military point of view, this is a turning point in the war,\" aviation expert Anatolii Khrapchynskyi told me. \"Because we have dealt a significant blow to Russia's image and the capabilities of the Russian Federation.\" A little over three months after Donald Trump berated Volodymyr Zelensky, telling him he had \"no cards,\" Ukraine has offered an emphatic riposte. \"Ukraine has shown the whole world that Russia is actually weak and cannot defend itself internally,\" Khrapchynskyi said. But that doesn't mean that Russia is about to change course. After his latest conversation with Vladimir Putin,Donald Trump said the two leaders had discussed Ukraine's attacks. \"It was a good conversation,\" President Trump posted on Truth Social, \"but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.\" \"President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.\" Around £1m of damage was caused by the blaze at the warehouse, the Old Bailey hears. The two warring sides remain far apart on how to end the conflict after a second round of talks in Turkey. On 1 June, more than 100 Ukrainian drones struck strategic targets deep into Russia in an elaborate and audacious operation. The activists hid the waxwork under a blanket before taking it out through an emergency exit, reports say. President Volodymyr Zelensky claims the operation is Ukraine's biggest long-range attack of the war so far.",

    "title": "The country where the left (not the far right) made hardline immigration laws",
    "article_text": "Think, Denmark. Images of sleek, impossibly chic Copenhagen, the capital, might spring to mind. As well as a sense of a liberal, open society. That is the Scandinavian cliché. But when it comes to migration, Denmark has taken a dramatically different turn. The country is now \"a pioneer in restrictive migration policies\" in Europe, according to Marie Sandberg, Director of the Centre for Advanced Migration Studies (AMIS) at the University of Copenhagen - both when it comes to asylum-seekers and economic migrants looking to work in Denmark. Even more surprising, perhaps, is who is behind this drive. It's generally assumed 'far right' politicians are gaining in strength across Europe on the back of migration fears, but that's far from the full picture. In Denmark – and in Spain, which is tackling the issue in a very different but no less radical way by pushing for more, not less immigration - the politicians taking the migration bull by the horns, now come from the centre left of politics. How come? And can the rest of Europe -  including the UK's Labour government - learn from them? Migration is a top voter priority, right across Europe. We live in really unsettling times. As war rages in Ukraine, Russia is waging hybrid warfare, such as cyber attacks across much of the continent. Governments talk about spending more on defence, while most European economies are spluttering. Voters worry about the cost of living and into this maelstrom of anxieties comes concern about migration. But in Denmark, the issue has run deeper, and for longer. Immigration began to grow apace following World War Two, increasing further – and rapidly - in recent decades. The proportion of Danish residents who are immigrants, or who have two immigrant parents, has increased more than fivefold since 1985, according to the Migration Policy Institute (MPI). A turning point was ten years ago, during the 2015 European migration and refugee crisis, when well over a million migrants came to Europe, mostly heading to the wealthier north, to countries like Denmark, Sweden and Germany. Slogans like \"Danskerne Først\" (Danes First) resonated with the electorate. When I interviewed supporters of the hard-right nationalist, anti-immigration, Danish People's Party (DPP) that year they told me, \"We don't see ourselves as racists but we do feel we are losing our country.\" Denmark came under glaring international attention for its hardline refugee stance, after it allowed the authorities to confiscate asylum seekers' jewellery and other valuables, saying this was to pay towards their stay in Denmark. The Danish immigration minister put up a photo of herself on Facebook having a cake decorated with the number 50 and a Danish flag to celebrate passing her 50th amendment to tighten immigration controls. And Danish law has only tightened further since then. Mayors from towns outside Copenhagen had long been sounding the alarm about the effects of the speedy influx of migrants. Migrant workers and their families had tended to move just outside the capital, to avoid high living costs. Denmark's famous welfare system was perceived to be under strain. Infant schools were said to be full of children who didn't speak Danish. Some unemployed migrants reportedly received resettlement payments that made their welfare benefits larger than those of unemployed Danes, and government statistics suggested immigrants were committing more crimes than others. Local resentment was growing, mayors warned. Today Denmark's has become one of the loudest voices in Europe calling for asylum seekers and other migrants turning up without legal papers to be processed outside the continent. The country had first looked at detaining migrants without papers on a Danish island that used to house a centre for contagious animals. That plan was shelved. Then Copenhagen passed a law in 2021 allowing asylum claims to be processed and refugees to be resettled in partner countries, like Rwanda. The UK's former Conservative government attempted a not dissimilar plan that was later annulled. Copenhagen's Kigali plan hasn't progressed much either but it's tightened rules on family reunions, which not long ago, was seen as a refugee's right. It has also made all refugees' stay in Denmark temporary by law, whatever their need for protection. But many of Denmark's harsh measures seemed targeted as much at making headlines, as taking action. The Danish authorities intentionally created a \"hostile environment\" for migrants\", says Alberto Horst Neidhardt, senior analyst at the European Policy Centre. And Denmark has been keen for the word to spread. It put advertisements in Lebanese newspapers at the height of the migrant crisis, for example, warning how tough Danish migration policies were. \"The goal has been to reduce all incentives to come to Denmark,\" says ⁠Susi Dennison, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"The Danes have gone further than most European governments,\" she explains. Not just honing in on politically sensitive issues like crime and access to benefits but with explicit talk about a zero asylum seekers policy. And yet \"before the 2015 refugee crisis, there was a stereotype of Nordic countries being very internationalist… and having a welcoming culture for asylum seekers,\" says Ms Dennison. Then suddenly the reaction was, \"No. Our first goal is to provide responsibly for Danish people.\" The turning-point was, she argues, also triggered by Denmark's neighbour, Germany, allowing a million refugees and others to stay in the country, during the migrant crisis. \"That was a political choice that had repercussions across Europe.\" By 2015 the anti-migration Danish People's Party was the second biggest power in Denmark's parliament. But at the same time, the Social Democrats - under new leader Mette Frederiksen – decided to fight back, making a clear, public break with the party's past reputation of openness to migration. \"My party should have listened,\" Frederiksen said. Under her leadership, the party tacked towards what's generally seen as the political \"far right\" in terms of migration and made hardline DPP-associated asylum policies, their own. But they also doubled down on issues more traditionally associated with the left: public services. Danes pay the highest tax rates in Europe across all household types. They expect top notch public services in return. Frederiksen argued that migration levels threatened social cohesion and social welfare, with the poorest Danes losing out the most. That is how her party justify their tough migration rules. Frederiksen's critics see her 'rightwards swing' as a cynical ploy to get into, and then stay in, power. She insists her party's convictions are sincere. Whatever the case, it worked in winning votes. Federiksen has been Denmark's prime minister since 2019, and in last year's election to the European Parliament, the populist nationalist Danish People's Party scrambled to hold on to a single seat. The political labels of old are blurring. It's not just Denmark. Across Europe, parties of the centre - right and left - are increasingly using language traditionally associated with the \"far right\" when it comes to migration to claw back, or hold on to votes. Sir Keir Starmer recently came under fire when, during a speech on immigration, he spoke of the danger of his country becoming 'an island of strangers'. At the same time in Europe, right-wing parties are adopting social policies traditionally linked to the left to broaden their appeal. In the UK, the leader of the anti-migration, opposition Reform Party Nigel Farage has been under attack for generous shadow budget proposals that critics say don't add up. In France, centrist Emmanuel Macron has sounded increasingly hardline on immigration in recent years, while his political nemesis the National Rally Party leader Marine Le Pen has been heavily mixing social welfare policies into her nationalist agenda to attract more mainstream voters. But can Danish - and in particular, Danish Social Democrat - tough immigration policies be deemed a success? The answer depends on which criteria you use to judge them. Asylum claim applications are certainly down in Denmark, in stark contrast to much of the rest of Europe. The number, as of May 2025, is the lowest in 40 years, according to immigration.dk, an online information site for refugees in Denmark. But Nordic Denmark is certainly not what's seen as a frontline state - like Italy - where people smugglers' boats frequently wash up along its shores. \"Frederiksen is in a favourable geographical position,\" argues Europe professor, Timothy Garton Ash, from Oxford University. But he also praises Denmark's prime minister for addressing the problem of migration, without adopting \"hysterical rhetoric\". But others say new legislation has damaged Denmark's reputation for respecting international humanitarian law and the rights of asylum-seekers. Michelle Pace of Chatham House says it has become hard to protect refugees in Denmark, where \"the legal goalposts keep moving.\" Danish citizens with a migrant background have also been made to feel like outsiders, she notes. She cites the Social Democrats' \"parallel societies\" law, which allows the state to sell off or demolish apartment blocks in troubled areas where at least half of residents have a \"non-Western\" background. The Social Democrats say the law is aimed at improving integration but Ms Pace insists it is alienating. The children of immigrants are told they aren't Danish or a \"pure Dane,\" she argues. In February this year, a senior advisor to the EU's top court described the non-Western provision of the Danish law as discriminatory on the basis of ethnic origin. Whereas once a number of European leaders dismissed Denmark's Social Democrats as becoming far right, now \"the Danish position has become the new normal - it was the head of the curve,\" says Alberto Horst Neidhardt. \"What's considered 'good' migration policies these days has moved to the right, even for centre left governments, like the UK.\" Before Germany's general election this year, then centre-left Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, pledged to tighten asylum regulations, including reducing family reunification. And earlier this month, Frederiksen teamed up with eight other European leaders - not including the UK - to call for a reinterpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights, whose tight constraints, they claim, prevent them from expelling foreign nationals with criminal records. Contesting international laws on asylum is a trend Denmark is establishing at a more European level, says Sarah Wolff, Professor of International Studies and Global Politics at Leiden University. \"With the topic of migration now politicised, you increasingly see supposedly liberal countries that are signatories to international conventions, like human rights law, coming back on those conventions because the legislation no longer fits the political agenda of the moment,\" says Ms Wolff. Despite the restrictive migrant legislation, Denmarkhascontinued to admit migrant workers through legal channels. But not enough, considering the rapidly aging population, say critics like Michelle Pace. She predicts Denmark will face a serious labour shortage in the future. Spain's centre-left government, meanwhile, is taking a very different road. Its Social Democrat prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, loves pointing out the Spanish economy was the fastest growing amongst rich nations last year. Its 3.2% GDP growth was higher than America's, three times the UK's and four times the EU average. Sanchez wants to legalise nearly a million migrants, already working in Spain but currently without legal papers. That extra tax revenue plus the much-needed extra workers to plug gaps in the labour market will maintain economic growth and ensure future pension payments are covered, he says. Spain has one of the lowest birth rates in the EU. Spanish society is getting old, fast. \"Almost half of our towns are at risk of depopulation,\" he said in autumn 2024. \"We have elderly people who need a caregiver, companies looking for programmers, technicians and bricklayers... The key to migration is in managing it well.\" Critics accuse Sanchez of encouraging illegal migration to Spain, and question the country's record of integrating migrants. Opinion polls show that Sanchez is taking a gamble: 57% of Spaniards say there are already too many migrants in the country, according to public pollster 40dB. In less than 30 years, the number of foreign-born inhabitants in Spain has jumped almost nine fold from 1.6% to 14% of the population. But so far, migration concerns haven't translated into widespread support for the immigration sceptic nationalist Vox party. The Sanchez government is setting up what Ms Pace calls a \"national dialogue\", involving NGOs and private business. The aim is to balance plugging labour market gaps with avoiding strains on public services, by using extra tax revenue from new migrant workers, to build housing and extra classrooms, for example. Right now the plan is aspirational. It's too early to judge, if successful, or not. \"Successful\" migration policy depends on what governments, regardless of their political stripe, set as their priority, says Ms Dennison. In Denmark, the first priority is preserving the Danish social system. Italy prioritises  offshoring the processing of migrants. While Hungary's prime minister Victor Orban wants strict migrant limits to protect Europe's \"Christian roots\", he claims. Overstaying visas is thought to be the most common way migrants enter and stay in Europe without legal papers. But recent UK governments have focused on high profile issues like people smugglers' boats crossing the Channel. Ms Dennison thinks that's a tactical move. It's taking aim at visible challenges, to \"neutralise public anger\" she says, in the hope most voters will then support offering asylum to those who need it, and allow some foreign workers into the UK. It would be hard for Starmer to pursue the Denmark approach, she adds. After taking over from previous Conservative governments, he made a point of recommitting the UK to international institutions and international law. So, does the 'ideal' migration plan exist, that balances voter concerns, economic needs and humanitarian values? Martin Ruhs, deputy director of the Migration Policy Centre, spends a lot of time asking this question to voters across the UK and the rest of Europe, and thinks the public is often more sophisticated than their politicians. Most prefer a balance, he says: migration limits to protect themselves and their families, but once they feel that's in place, they also favour fair legislation to protect refugees and foreign workers.

    "title": "Musk turns on Republicans - and gives Trump's big bill a harder path",
    "article_text": "For 130 days, tech billionaire Elon Musk was a \"special government employee\" working inside the Trump administration to slash what he said were wasteful government programmes and bloated departments. Now, after his exit last week, he is back on the outside. And it is the Trump administration – and the massive spending legislation the president is currently pushing – that is drawing the ire of this new, seemingly unshackled Musk. In a series of social media posts on Tuesday, he took aim at Trump's signature tax and spending bill that is being considered by the Senate after House Republicans passed it last month. After saying he couldn't \"stand it anymore\", Musk called the bill a \"disgusting abomination\". \"Shame on those who voted for it,\" he said. \"You know you did wrong.\" And on Wednesday afternoon he went a step further, calling on voters to contact their representatives in Congress to voice their opposition. \"Bankrupting America is not OK!\" he wrote on X. \"KILL the BILL.\" Musk's diatribe against the Trump-backed bill, which includes huge tax breaks and more investment in defence, comes after he spent months pushing for cuts to government spending. In his posts, he said the legislation would add to the US budget deficit and saddle Americans with debt. He also warned Republicans who supported, or are planning to support, the bill that \"we [will] fire all the politicians who betrayed the American people\" in next year's midterm elections. And it is that line that could be the most concerning for Republicans. In the House, all but three Republican members backed the bill, which passed by a single vote over unified Democratic opposition. If Musk turns on the majority of Republicans - after spending hundreds of millions to support their campaigns last year - it could cause headaches for incumbents worried about facing challenges in party primaries and represent a devastating blow to Republican hopes of retaining control of Congress for the second half of Trump's second term. Although Musk had offered more measured criticism in an interview last week, this week  marks a stark change from the chummy meeting he had with Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday, where he stood, smiling, as Trump expounded on the importance of what he said will be his defining legislative achievement. The president has yet to respond to Musk, but he is sure to be asked about the comments. So far, however, the White House has been handling the situation delicately. According to US media reports, the White House is attempting to explain Musk's vocal opposition as a response to the bill's cuts to green energy subsidies, including tax credits for electric vehicles like Musk's Tesla cars. Axios, meanwhile, reportedthat another source of tension is Trump's decision to pull the nomination of Jared Isaacman – a Musk ally – to be head of the US space agency Nasa. In the halls of Congress on Wednesday, established Trump allies were treading a similarly careful path. \"The bill can be made better, but it's not an abomination,\" Senator Lindsey Graham, a leading figure within the Republican Party and loyal backer of Trump, told the BBC. \"Let's pass this bill,\" he said. \"We can make additional cuts to spending as necessary, but I want to put some points on the board. Get the tax cuts, make them permanent, get money, do the border. But [Musk] is right, we should cut more.\" Speaker Mike Johnson, meanwhile, reportedly spent time pushing back on Musk's criticism of the bill in a closed-door meeting with Republicans. He also tried to reassure members over the billionaire's threats to oust supporters of the bill,according to Politico. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump \"already knows\" Musk's view on the legislation. \"This is one big, beautiful bill, and he's sticking to it,\" she added. Trump may be standing by the legislation, but his task of convincing Senate Republicans to sign off on it will only be more difficult in the face of Musk's opposition. His criticism could encourage Republican budget hardliners in the Senate who were already expressing concern about how Trump's bill will spike the federal deficit by trillions of dollars over the next decade. Several, including Rand Paul of Kentucky, Mike Lee of Utah and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, have said they cannot vote for the House legislation unless it undergoes significant changes. Musk has been amplifying a steady stream of posts by Paul and Lee on X, including one article headlined \"It's Rand Paul and Elon Musk vs Donald Trump\". If those hardliners have their way and get new spending cuts to popular social programmes, however, centrist Republicans like Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine are likely to revolt. That matters because, assuming unified Democratic opposition in the US Senate, Republicans can only afford to lose three of the 53 Republicans if they want Trump's bill to pass. Murkowski would not be drawn on the potential impact of Musk's comments on Wednesday, but she told the BBC he is \"an influencer out there, and his words have impact\". Liberated from the constraints of his quasi-governmental job, Musk has tossed a powder keg into all these delicate deliberations to bring the disparate Republican factions into some kind of agreement – and it is not the first time. His criticism sank a government spending bill last year, creating problems it took months for Republicans to solve. Trump has said he wants the legislation on his desk to sign by the Fourth of July congressional recess. That could prove to be a tall task, but it is one that has a pressing deadline behind it. His \"big, beautiful bill\" contains a $4tn increase in the US debt-limit borrowing authority. Treasury department officials say that if that limit is not increased by sometime in August, the nation would face the unprecedented prospect of defaulting on its national debt.

    "title": "Stores open at midnight as fans rush to buy Nintendo Switch 2",
    "article_text": "The Nintendo Switch 2 has been released worldwide, with stores opening at midnight so fans could get their hands on the long-awaited console the moment it became available. Some shops have the devices available to buy off the shelf - but in most cases customers have been picking up consoles they had ordered in advance, with UK retailer Currys calling it its \"biggest gaming pre-order ever.\" Despite the excitement there have been some setbacks, with one supplier, Game,cancelling some pre-orders. In the US, Nintendo briefly pulled Switch 2 pre-orders in Aprilover concerns around tariffsbefore starting again a few weeks later. There are also questions over whether the Switch 2 will match the success of its predecessor - the third-best selling console in history - because of its high game prices. A physical copy of its most high-profile game, Mario Kart World, comes in at £74.99 - £15 more expensive than a typical Switch title. The early signs though are that there is considerable customer interest. Currys told the BBC it had sold 30,000 units - which it attributed to the \"incredible excitement\" associated with the launch. The original Nintendo Switch has shifted more than 150 million units since its 2017 release. A successor has been in the works for years - so perhaps unsurprisingly Tushar Sandarka, the President of the University of York's Mario Kart society, is among those excited about the launch, and the new version of Mario coming with it. \"It's coming out with Mario Kart World - which is the first since 2014 - it's a big deal for us,\" the 19-year-old said. \"Securing a pre-order was such a tough decision because it's so expensive. \"Even if it's a bit higher than I would have wanted to pay for it, it's going to serve me well for the next 7 or 8 years.\" But not everyone the BBC spoke to said they would be picking up the console on launch. Mae and Lottie, both students in York, said they would stick to the original Switch because of the cost. \"It's quite spenny,\" Mae said. \"What we've got is fine.\" Lottie agreed, but said she was disappointed not to play on the new Mario Kart game - which she said could cost her as much as \"a day's pay\". \"I'm not spending that on a game,\" she said. For Nintendo, the Switch 2 represents a change in strategy - in the past its new devices have been given an entirely new name. \"This is the first time Nintendo has ever launched a straight sequel,\" GamesRadar+ brand director Sam Loveridge told the BBC. \"It's a clear proposition for consumers - they know exactly what they're getting from this console if they are familiar with the original Switch.\" She said \"everything is pointing to\" pre-orders having sold well. \"When pre-orders first went live, it was an absolute scramble to find any stock, but Nintendo was clearly prepared and since those early weeks, it's been a lot easier to secure yourself a console for launch day,\" she said. I was one of the lucky few to get my hands on the Switch 2 at an event in April. Like its predecessor, it is a \"hybrid\" console - a handheld device which can also be plugged into a TV to play on the big screen. But it has a bigger and brighter screen, along with lots more power and storage. It still has a bit of innovation - you can use the controller like a computer mouse by twisting it on its side, making PC games such as Civilization VII a more enjoyable experience than using joysticks. But many of the showcase Nintendo games on display at that event  - including Metroid Prime 4, Donkey Kong: Bananza, and Super Mario Party Jamboree TV - won't be available at launch. Instead the only new Nintendo game on the new console will be Mario Kart World, barring a small title called Welcome Tour which showcases some of the new hardware. \"It might seem like an odd bet, but with the original Mario Kart 8 being the best-selling Wii U game and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe being the best-selling Nintendo Switch game, there's a very established audience there,\" Ms Loveridge said. The gaming giant is also releasing on day one upgraded versions of the Switch's Legend of Zelda games, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, which take advantage of the console's greater power. Beyond that, gamers will have to look to third-party games for alternatives on launch. The range of games includes Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, Cyberpunk 2077, and Bravely Default. \"This more powerful console offers plenty of opportunities for third-party games publishers bringing Nintendo into more direct competition with Sony and Microsoft,\" said Katie Holt, senior games industry research analyst at Ampere Analysis . And fans can expect more from third-party games as the console develops too - with Nintendo senior director Takuhiro Dohta telling me he expected games to get even better. \"When there are software titles set for the launch of the hardware, the developers still don't fully know the capabilities and hardware well enough,\" he said. \"As developers continue to develop, they start to understand how it works and what it's capable of, so I think we can expect improvements not only in graphics but in gameplay too.\" Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletterto follow the world's top tech stories and trends.Outside the UK?

More than a million people watched online as details of the long awaited successor to the hit console were announced.

    "title": "New satellite images show Russian bombers destroyed in Ukraine attack",
    "article_text": "New satellite images and drone footage show serious damage inflicted on aircraft at several Russian airbases during Ukraine's surprise drone strike on Sunday. The images of two Russian airbases in north-western and central Russia, taken on Wednesday morning, show 12 aircraft damaged or destroyed. Meanwhile, drone footage, released by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Wednesday, showed attacks on these two bases as well as two more targeted elsewhere. Ukraine claims that it targeted 41 strategic bombers in the operation, adding that \"at least\" 13 were destroyed. Security officials say the shock incursion took 18 months to plan and saw many drones smuggled into Russia. The SBU video is almost five minutes long and consists of edited footage taken by drones in the process of conducting attacks on Olenya, Ivanovo, Dyagilevo and Belaya airbases. In each shot the feed cuts out before any explosion, but in some instances we see other planes on fire in the background. At no point do we see any indication of defensive measures from Russian forces, even after the attack was clearly well underway. Many of the aircraft are covered in tyres - a Russian tactic said to be aimed at mitigating against drone strikes. Some of the aircraft are seen apparently loaded with cruise missiles and well fuelled - judging by the extent and spread of fires. This suggests they were prepared to conduct strikes. The clearest satellite imagery covers Olenya and Belaya and shows five damaged or destroyed planes at the former and seven at the latter. Olenya is a major Russian airbase in the north-west of the country. The SBU footage shows smoke pouring from three aircraft, identified as Tu-95 strategic bombers and an approach to a fourth. Video footage also shows a drone approaching a Tu-22M strategic bomber sitting on the runway in this very same position. Satellite imagery from Maxar clearly shows a destroyed aircraft sitting beside a row of Tu-22M type aircraft. Manufacturing of both the Tu-95 and Tu-22 ended at the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, which will make repair difficult and replacement near impossible. Elsewhere in the SBU video, an AN-12 Transporter can be seen being approached. The Maxar satellite image does not show the aftermath of this, but other imagery reviewed by BBC Verify from AviVector - a satellite image analyst on X - suggests that it too was destroyed. Imagery provided by Planet Labs from this morning shows the entirety of Belaya airbase in Irkutsk Oblast, nearly 3,000km from the Ukrainian border. It shows three damaged Tu-95s and four Tu-22s and in various parts of the base. The SBU footage shows many of the same aircraft being approached. In two instances we see the drone carefully position itself on the wing of a Tu-95 - next to one of its fuel tanks. The final shot of the footage shows smoke rising from numerous sites across the base. At Ivanovo airbase two A50-AWACS planes are seen being targeted. The aircraft serves as an early warning and control asset - or spy plane -  and is identifiable by the sizeable radar system on its fuselage. Ukraine previouslyshot down two of these aircraftin January and February 2024. As yet we have not seen any imagery or footage that captures any damage to these aircraft at Ivanovo. While satellite imagery from the site does show wreckage, BBC Verify has confirmed that the damage was present at the site before Sunday's attack and is likely from another incident. The SBU footage from Dyagilevo in Ryazan region shows three Tu-22s being approached, but there is no clear indication of damage sustained in either the footage or available satellite imagery.

    "title": "Gaza now worse than hell on earth, humanitarian chief tells BBC",
    "article_text": "Gaza has become worse than hell on earth, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross has told the BBC. In an interview at the ICRC's headquarters in Geneva, the organisation's president Mirjana Spoljaric said \"humanity is failing\" as it watched the horrors of the Gaza war. Speaking in a room close to a case displaying the ICRC's three Nobel Peace Prizes, I asked Ms Spoljaric about remarks she made in April, that Gaza was \"hell on earth\", and if anything had happened since to change her mind. \"It has become worse… We cannot continue to watch what is happening. It's surpassing any acceptable, legal, moral, and humane standard. The level of destruction, the level of suffering. \"More importantly, the fact that we are watching a people entirely stripped of its human dignity. It should really shock our collective conscience.\" She added that states must do more to end the war, end the suffering of Palestinians and release Israeli hostages. The words, clearly carefully chosen, of the president of the ICRC carry moral weight. The International Red Cross is a global humanitarian organisation that has been working to alleviate suffering in wars for more than a century and a half. It is also the custodian of the Geneva Conventions, the body of international humanitarian law that is intended to regulate the conduct of war and protect civilians and other non-combatants. The most recent version, the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, was adopted after the Second World War and was intended to stop the mass killing of civilians from happening again. Israel, I reminded her, justifies its actions in Gaza as self-defence. \"Every state has a right to defend itself,\" she said. \"And every mother has a right to see her children return. There's no excuse for hostage-taking. There is no excuse to depriving children from their access to food, health, and security. There are rules in the conduct of hostilities that every party to every conflict has to respect.\" Did that mean that the actions of Hamas and other armed Palestinians on 7 October 2023 - killing around 1200 and taking more than 250 hostage - did not justify Israel's destruction of the Gaza Strip and the killing of more than 50,000 Palestinians? \"It's no justification for the disrespect or hollowing out of the Geneva Conventions. Neither party is allowed to break the rules, no matter what, and this is important because, look, the same rules apply to every human being under the Geneva Convention. A child in Gaza has exactly the same protections under the Geneva Conventions as a child in Israel.\" You never know, Ms Spoljaric added, when your own child might be on the weaker side and will need these protections. The ICRC is a reliable source of information about what is happening in Gaza. Israel does not allow international news organisations, including the BBC, to send journalists into the territory. The reporting of the more than 300 ICRC staff in Gaza, 90% of whom are Palestinians, forms a vital part of the record of the war. Ms Spoljaric, the ICRC president, has been talking every day to their team leader in Gaza. The ICRC surgical hospital in Rafah is the closest medical facility to the area where many Palestinians have been killed during chaotic aid distribution by the Israel and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Like the UN, the ICRC is not taking part in the new operation. A fundamental flaw of the new system is that it funnels tens of thousands of desperate, starving civilians through an active war zone. Ms Spoljaric said there was \"no justification for changing and breaking something that works, with something that doesn't seem to be working\". In the last few days, the ICRC surgical teams at their field hospital in Rafah near the GHF zone have been overwhelmed at least twice by the volume of casualties in the turmoil of the food operation. \"Nowhere is safe in Gaza. Nowhere. Not for the civilians, not for the hostages,\" said Ms Spoljaric. \"That's a fact. And our hospital is not safe. I don't recall another situation that I have seen where we operate in the midst of hostilities.\" A few days ago, a young boy was hit by a bullet coming through the fabric of the tent while he was treated. \"We have no security even for our own staff… they are working 20 hours a day. They are exhausting themselves. But it's too much, it's surpassing human capabilities.\" The ICRC said that in just a few hours on Tuesday morning its Rafah surgical teams received 184 patients, including 19 people dead on arrival and eight others who died of their wounds shortly afterwards. It was the highest number of casualties from a single incident at the field hospital since it was established just over a year ago. It happened around dawn on Tuesday. Palestinian witnesses and ICRC medics reported terrible scenes of killing as Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinians who were converging on the new aid distribution site in southern Gaza. It was \"total carnage\" according to a foreign witness. An official statement from the Israeli military described a very different picture. It said \"several suspects\" moved towards Israeli forces \"deviating from the designated access routes\". Troops \"carried out warning fire… additional shots were directed near a few individual suspects who advanced towards the troops\". A military spokesperson said they were investigating what happened. It has denied shooting Palestinians in a similar incident on Sunday. Ms Spoljaric said the ICRC was deeply concerned about talk of victory at all costs, total war and dehumanisation. \"We are seeing things happening that will make the world an unhappier place far beyond the region, far beyond the Israelis and the Palestinians, because we are hollowing out the very rules that protect the fundamental rights of every human being.\" If there is no ceasefire, she fears for the future of the region. \"This is vital. To preserve a pathway back to peace for the region. If you destroy that pathway forever for good, the region will never find safety and security. But we can stop it now. It's not too late.\" \"State leaders are under an obligation to act. I'm calling on them to do something and to do more and to do what they can. Because it will reverberate, it will haunt them, it would reach their doorsteps.\" The ICRC is considered the custodian of the Geneva conventions. The fourth, agreed after the Second World War, is designed to protect civilians in wars. The Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 were, she said, no justification for current events. \"Neither party is allowed to break the rules, no matter what,\" Ms Spoljaric said. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas' cross-border attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,607 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 4,335 since Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March, according to the territory's health ministry. Appealing to parties to stop the hostilities, she said: \"We cannot continue watching what is happening. \"It defies humanity. It will haunt us.\" She called on the international community to do more. \"Every state is under the obligation to use their means, their peaceful means, to help reverse what is happening in Gaza today,\" she said. Mandy Blackman is currently the nurse-in-charge of a field hospital in al-Mawasi run by UK-Med. The White House says Columbia violated anti-discrimination laws and should be cut off from government funds. The prime minister faces calls from some of his own MPs to take further action against Israel. BBC Verify examines three deadly incidents which left dozens dead near a controversial aid site in Gaza. Community leaders say people are anxious after recent attacks in Boulder and Washington DC showed that “anyone, anywhere” could be targeted.",

    "title": "How airline fees have turned baggage into billions",
    "article_text": "With Air Canada and Southwest the latest airlines to charge passengers for check-in luggage, the ballooning cost of such ancillary or \"junk fees\" is provoking anger among politicians and consumer groups. At the same time, sales of suitcases small enough for passengers to take on the plane as hand luggage are booming. Standing outside Toronto's downtown airport, Lauren Alexander has flown over from Boston for the weekend. She describes such additional charges as \"ridiculous\". \"It feels like a trick,\" says the 24-year-old. \"You buy the ticket, you think it's going to be less expensive, then you have to pay $200 (£148) extra [to bring a suitcase].\" To avoid the fee, Ms Alexander instead travelled with a small backpack as hand luggage. Sage Riley, who is 27, agrees, telling the BBC, \"It can be pricey.\" There was a time when checked bags, seat selection and your meals all came as standard on commercial flights. But that all changed with the rise of the budget airlines, says Jay Sorensen of US aviation consultancy IdeaWorks. It was in 2006 when UK low-cost carrier FlyBe became what is believed to be the world's first airline to start charging passengersto check in bags.It charged £2 for a pre-booked item of luggage, and £4 if the customer hadn't paid in advance. Other budget carriers then quickly followed suit, with the so-called flag carriers or established airlines then also doing so, at least on shorter flights. In 2008 American Airlines became the first US airline to charge a fee, $15, for the first checked bag on its domestic routes. Mr Sorenson says such traditional airlines felt they had no choice when they \"began to realise that the low-cost carriers were providing very significant competition\". He adds: \"They felt they had to do something to meet that.\" Fast forward to today, and US airlines alone made $7.27bn from check-in baggage fees last year,according to federal figures.That is up from $7bn in 2023, and $5.76bn in 2019. Little wonder then that more of us are trying to just take carry-on. Kirsty Glenn, managing director of UK luggage firm Antler, confirms that there is an ongoing surge in demand for small suitcases that meet airline dimension limits for carry-on luggage. \"We have seen huge spikes in searches online and on our website,\" she says. Describing a new small-dimension case her company launched in April, Ms Glenn adds: \"Testament to the trend of only travelling with hand luggage, it's sold like crazy.\" At the same time, social media content about travel packing \"hacks\" and luggage that meets airlines' carry-on size measurements, have soared according to travel journalist Chelsea Dickenson. She makes this content for TikTok. \"Social media has really propelled this idea of needing a bag that fits the baggage allowance requirements, says Ms Dickenson. \"It's become a core part of the content that I create and post on social media.\" Ms Dickenson, whose social media following has ballooned to close to a million followers, adds that her luggage videos have become a \"core part of the content\" she creates. \"It blows my mind,\" she says. \"I could spend weeks and weeks researching a big trip, and the resulting videos will not come close to doing as well as me going and buying a cheap suitcase, taking it to the airport, testing it in one of those baggage sizes and reporting back.\" The overall global cost of all airline extra fees, from luggage to seat selection, buying wifi access, lounge access, upgrades, and food and drink, isexpected to reach $145bn this year,14% of the sector's total revenues. That's according to the International Air Transport Association, which represents the industry. This compares with $137bn last year. These numbers have caught the attention of some politicians in Washington, and last December airline bosses were grilled before a senate committee. It was a Democrat senator who used the term\"junk fees\". He wants the federal government to review such costs and potentially fine airlines. We asked the US Department of Transportation for a comment, but did not get a response. But if having to pay for check-in wasn't enough, a growing number of airlines are now charging for hand luggage. For example, Irish budget airline Ryanair will only allow you to carry a small bag that fits under the seat in front of you for free. If you want to take a bigger bag or suitcase to go in the overhead locker that will cost you from £6. Other European airlines that now have similar charges for hand luggage are Easyjet, Norwegian Airlines, Transavia, Volotea, Vueling, and Wizzair. This has annoyed pan-European consumer group Becu (The European Consumer Organisation), which last month filed a complaint with the European Commission. Becu cites a 2014 EU Court of Justice ruling, which said \"carriage of hand baggage cannot be made subject to a price supplement, provided that it meets reasonable requirements in terms of its weight and dimensions, and complies with applicable security requirements\". However, what determines \"reasonable requirements\" continues to be a grey area in need of an official ruling. There can, however, be a different way of doing things, as shown by Indian airline IndiGo. Its boss Pieter Eibers says that it does not charge for check-in luggage. \"The entire philosophy here is different,\" he says. \"We don't want long lines, and endless debates at gates about the weight of luggage. We don't have any of that. We turn our planes around in 35 minutes.\" The plane maker has agreed to pay $1.1bn to avoid prosecution over two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. The mayor says it \"can't replace every commercial route\" as five others are at risk of being withdrawn. Rail cash could be en-route to Wales next week, but rail money that's not will keep causing a row. An inquiry found \"disproportionate\" punishments for often innocent mistakes. A Labour councillor says the scheme was dropped with \"some reluctance\".",

    "title": "Putin will seek revenge for Ukraine drone attack, warns Trump",
    "article_text": "Vladimir Putin has said he will have to respond to Ukraine's major drone attack on Russian airbases, US President Donald Trump has warned. Speaking after a phone call with the Russian president, Trump said: \"President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.\" Russian officials declined to confirm this on Wednesday night, but Moscow had earlier said that military options were \"on the table\" for its response. Trump warned in a social media post that the phone call, which lasted more than an hour, would not \"lead to immediate peace\" between Russia and Ukraine. Russia's RIA Novosti, a state-owned news agency, said Putin told Trump that Ukraine has tried to \"disrupt\" the negotiations and that the government in Kyiv has \"essentially turned into a terrorist organisation\". The two also \"exchanged views on the prospects for restoring cooperation between the countries, which has enormous potential,\" it said. The conversation between the two leaders marks the first since Ukrainelaunched a surprise attack using smuggled drones to strike Russian airbaseson 1 June, targeting what it said were nuclear-capable long-range bombers. Trump told Putin in the call that the US was not warned in advance of the attack, Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said. Ukraine's Minister of Strategic Industries Yuriy Sak told Radio 4's World Tonight programme his country had hoped the US would respond to the \"incessant Russian missile and drone attacks\" with \"more sanctions and with more pressure\". Last week, Trump appeared to set a two-week deadline for Putin, threatening to change how the US is responding to Russia if he believed Putin was still \"tapping\" him along on peace efforts in Ukraine. The comment was one of a string of critical remarks by Trump, who on 26 May said that Putin had gone \"absolutely crazy\" and was \"playing with fire\" afterRussia escalated drone and missile attacks on cities in Ukraine, killing dozens of civilians. Trump made no mention of a deadline or his previous remarks in Wednesday's post on his Truth Social platform. In a post on X, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky talked about the scale Russian attacks on his country since Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022. \"Many have spoken with Russia at various levels. But none of these talks have brought a reliable peace, or even stopped the war,\" Zelensky wrote. \"If the world reacts weakly to Putin's threats, he interprets it as a readiness to turn a blind eye to his actions,\" he added. On Wednesday, a delegation of Ukrainian officials including Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko and Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak were set to meet with US senators in Washington to discuss arms purchases and efforts to stop the fighting. In a social media post, Yermak said that the delegation planned to discuss \"defense support and the situation on the battlefield\", sanctions against Russia and a previously signed reconstruction investment fund. The post also comes just days after a second round of direct peace talks in Istanbul between the warring sides ended without a major breakthrough, although they agreed to swap more prisoners of war. Ukrainian negotiators said Russia rejected an \"unconditional ceasefire\" - a key demand of Kyiv and its Western allies including the US. The Russian team said they had proposed multi-day ceasefires in \"certain areas\" of the frontline in Ukraine, although they gave no further details. Trump has previously - and repeatedly - said he believes the two sides are making progress, despite ongoing fighting on the frontline and aerial attacks carried out in both Russia and Ukraine. Separately on Wednesday, Putin also had a call with the US-born Pope Leo XIV. The Vatican confirmed that \"particular attention\" was paid to peace in the Ukraine war. In Putin's call with Trump, the two leaders also discussed Iran. Trump said he believed the two \"were in agreement\" that \"Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon\". The US reportedly proposed Iran halt all production of enriched uranium - which can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons - and instead rely on a regional consortium for supplies. Iran has not yet responded to the plan presented at talks last Saturday. According to Trump, Putin \"suggested that he will participate in discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion\". \"It is my opinion that Iran has been slow walking their decision on this very important matter,\" Trump wrote. \"We will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time.\" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamanei has criticised the US proposal and said it will not stop enriching uranium. Donald Trump accuses the former president's aides of covering up his \"mental state\" - a claim Biden says is \"ridiculous\". US president says the move to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard is to safeguard national security. President Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the US from nationals of 12 countries. Billionaire says the bill, which faces a key test in the Senate, undercuts efforts to slash federal spending. A judge blocked the move one day after the White House promised to swiftly deport the Egyptian family.",

    "title": "Witness testifies that Diddy dangled her over apartment balcony",
    "article_text": "Graphic designer Bryana Bongolan testified that Sean \"Diddy\" Combs once dangled her off a 17th floor apartment balcony, and that she saw him throw a knife at her friend Casandra Ventura. On Wednesday, prosecutors displayed photos taken by Ms Bongolan and her then-girlfriend of Ms Bongolan's bruises, which she claimed she sustained during the alleged 2016 incident. Combs' attorneys worked to cast doubt on Ms Bongolan's credibility before the jury under intense cross-examination, during which she responded that she could not recall past statements she gave the government. Combs faces charges of racketeering, conspiracy and sex trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty. The federal case, now in its fourth week of testimony, followed dozens of civil lawsuits filed against him by men and women accusing him of abuse, including both Ms Ventura, who is Combs' ex-girlfriend, and Ms Bongolan. Ms Bongolan said she met Ms Ventura in 2014 when she worked for the brand, Young and Reckless. Later, as the head women's designer at Diamond Supply Co., she was assigned to work with Ms Ventura on creating a collection and the two became close. Ms Bongolan testified they often took drugs like cocaine, ketamine and marijuana together. She later alleged that she procured drugs for Ms Ventura, and that the R&B singer paid her for them. She also acknowledged that she and Ms Ventura had a \"problem\" with drug use, but that she was currently sober. Ms Bongolan testified that during the friendship, she saw signs of Combs' alleged violence. She said once saw Ms Ventura on FaceTime with a black eye, and that the rapper would often pound on Ms Ventura's apartment door at night. In September 2016, Ms Bongolan testified that she heard banging on Ms Ventura's front door when she and her girlfriend were sleeping on the couch. She hid her girlfriend in a bathroom and went to the balcony, then Mr Combs entered the apartment, and allegedly picked her up and lifted her onto the ledge, she told the court. She said he repeatedly yelled, \"You know what the (expletive) you did\", and then threw her into the balcony furniture. Prosecutors showed the jury photos of a puncture and bruise on Ms Bongolan's leg, along with accompanying metadata displaying the date they were taken. She also testified she suffered night terrors and paranoia as a result of the evening. In another incident she described, Combs burst into Ms Ventura's apartment and allegedly threw a knife at the R&B singer. Ms Bongolan said Ms Ventura picked the knife up and threw it back. Neither of them was injured, she said. Once during a photoshoot in Malibu with Ms Ventura, Ms Bongolan alleged that Mr Combs got in her face and told her, \"I'm the devil and I could kill you\". \"I was terrified,\" she told the court. During cross examination, Mr Combs' defence attorney sought to undercut Ms Bongolan, who struggled to answer questions about her statements in previous meetings with prosecutors. Nicole Westmoreland repeatedly asked Ms Bongolan about what she told government prosecutors when she first met with them in January 2024. Several times, she asked her about the alleged balcony incident, but the witness struggled to recall details she described at the initial meeting. During her testimony two weeks ago, Ms Ventura,the prosecution's key witnesstold the court, \"I saw him bring her back over the railing of the balcony and then throw her onto the patio furniture.\" Ms Westmoreland also asked Ms Bongolan about her initial account of the incident in Malibu. The defence attorney said Ms Bongolan originally told government prosecutors that Combs made that threat at a party, and Ms Bongolan testified she could not recall that conversation. As the afternoon wore on, Ms Bongolan increasingly repeated that she could not recall details of previous conversations with prosecutors.  At one point, Ms Westmoreland asked Ms Bongolan to recall her conversations with prosecutors two days prior. Asked about specifics, Ms Bongolan answered that she could not remember. The court also heard on Wednesday from forensic video editor Frank Piazza, who took the jury through recordings of the \"Cassie video\", which shows Mr Combs beating Ms Ventura in a hotel hallway in 2016. He explained that the recordings were untampered with and were an accurate depiction. Ms Bongolan is expected to return to the stand Thursday. She will likely be  followed by \"Jane\", whose testimony under a pseudonym could take several days. Donald Trump accuses the former president's aides of covering up his \"mental state\" - a claim Biden says is \"ridiculous\". US president says the move to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard is to safeguard national security. President Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the US from nationals of 12 countries. Billionaire says the bill, which faces a key test in the Senate, undercuts efforts to slash federal spending. A judge blocked the move one day after the White House promised to swiftly deport the Egyptian family.",

    "title": "A-ha star Morten Harket diagnosed with Parkinson's",
    "article_text": "A-ha frontman Morten Harket has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The news was announced on Wednesday on the Norwegian synth-pop band'sofficial websitein an article written by their biographer Jan Omdahl, which also revealed the singer had already undergone brain surgery twice. Harket, 65, said he had \"no problem accepting the diagnosis\", adding: \"With time, I've taken to heart my 94-year-old father's attitude to the way the organism gradually surrenders: 'I use whatever works'.\" A-ha are best known for their megahitTake On Me, which features Harket's famous falsetto, taken from their 1985 debut album Hunting High and Low. Omdahl, who penned the A-ha biography The Swing of Things, wrote: \"You know him as A-ha's iconic frontman, a divinely gifted singer, reluctant pop star, solo artist, songwriter, eccentric thinker, father of five and a grandfather too, but in recent years Morten Harket has also been a man battling his own body. \"This isn't the sort of news anyone wants to deliver to the world, but here it is: Morten has Parkinson's disease.\" He went on to note how the singer's condition had until now remained strictly private, but for a few people in his immediate circle who knew he was ill. Omdahl also wrote about how the \"unpredictable consequences\" and stress of going public with the illness had led to him holding off making an announcement. \"Part of me wanted to reveal it,\" Harket told him. \"Like I said, acknowledging the diagnosis wasn't a problem for me; it's my need for peace and quiet to work that has been stopping me. \"I'm trying the best I can to prevent my entire system from going into decline. It's a difficult balancing act between taking the medication and managing its side effects.\" He noted: \"There's so much to weigh up when you're emulating the masterful way the body handles every complex movement, or social matters and invitations, or day-to-day life in general.\" According to theNHS website, Parkinson's diseaseis caused by \"a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra\" which leads to \"a reduction in a chemical called dopamine in the brain.\" Dopamine plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body, and so symptons can include involuntary shaking, slow movement, and stiff and inflexible muscles; as well as depression and anxiety. Omdahl stressed that while Harket will have to live with the disease for the rest of his life, medication and brain surgery at the Mayo Clinic in the US have, he said, \"softened the impact of his symptoms\". He said the star underwent an advanced neurosurgical procedure - called deep brain stimulation (DBS) - in June last year, in which \"electrodes were implanted deep inside the left side of his brain.\" In December 2024, Harket underwent a similar procedure on the right side of his brain, he added, which was also successful. While he can still drive his car, Harket is less sure about his future as a singer. \"The problems with my voice are one of many grounds for uncertainty about my creative future,\" he said. His group's biographer described how, on good days, Harket shows \"virtually no sign of many of the most familiar physical symptoms of Parkinson's\" but still requires a \"round-the-clock effort\" to balance medication, signals from the electrodes in his brain, sleep, blood sugar and his mindset - to keep the symptoms at bay. \"This isn't always successful, and is more like a never-ending rollercoaster ride,\" added Omdahl. Asked by the writer if he can sing now at all, Harket replied: \"I don't really know. I don't feel like singing, and for me that's a sign. \"I'm broadminded in terms of what I think works; I don't expect to be able to achieve full technical control. The question is whether I can express myself with my voice.\" He added: \"As things stand now, that's out of the question. But I don't know whether I'll be able to manage it at some point in the future.\" Other stars who have lived with Parkinson's include fellow singer Ozzy Osbourne, actor Michael J Fox and late boxing champion Muhammad Ali. Harket said he was now going to \"listen to the professionals\", urging fans \"don't worry about me\". \"Spend your energy and effort addressing real problems, and know that I am being taken care of.\" He revealed he has been working on new song lyrics but was \"not sure\" if he'll be able to finish and release them. \"Time will tell if they make it. I really like the idea of just going for it, as a Parkinson's patient and an artist, with something completely outside the box. \"It's all up to me, I just have to get this [announcement] out of the way first.\" Harket, who has also enjoyed a solo career and co-hosted the 1996 Eurovision Song Contest in Oslo, was knighted in Norway in 1992 - alongside his A-ha bandmates Paul Waaktaar-Savoy and Magne Furuholmen - for their services to Norwegian music, and international success. Furuholmen posted a message of support on Instagram, alongside an old picture of the band together, writing: \"Our thoughts are first and foremost with Morten and his family at a difficult time adjusting to the changes that this condition has brought into their lives.\" He said that while the news \"brings sadness\" they all remained grateful for \"all the amazing memories\" and felt \"lucky\" that \"people continue to find meaning, hope and joy in our shared musical legacy.\"",

    "title": "Scammers steal £47m from HMRC by accessing 100,000 taxpayers' accounts",
    "article_text": "Scammers stole £47m from the online accounts of 100,000 people after posing as taxpayers, HMRC has revealed. The tax authority said it is writing to those affected to confirm it has secured their accounts, they haven't lost any money, and they don't need to do anything. \"These are attempts to claim money fraudulently from HMRC, not from customers,\" HMRC said. There has already been a criminal investigation with arrests made last year, HMRC confirmed. It said the scammers used phishing attacks to gain customer details and attempted to claim rebates. Phishing is when criminals use personal information gathered externally to imitate a person and access services. The tax authority said this was not a cyber or hacking attack, the likes of which have affected major retailers in recent weeks. Angela MacDonald, HMRC's deputy chief executive, told MPs at an Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday that a \"lot of money\" was taken and \"it's very unacceptable\". HMRC's permanent secretary and chief executive John-Paul Marks told the committee \"a lot of work [was] then done to intercept this incident. We identified and locked down the compromised accounts.\" HMRC's representatives were reprimanded by MPs for not writing to the committee about the fraud at the time. Treasury Select Committee Chair Dame Meg Hillier said the committee had only heard about the scam when it was reported in the news. \"A word to the wise... let me use my position as chair just to remind you, gently – well perhaps not so gently – that it would be normal to advise parliament of things if you're appearing in front of a committee. Not to have it announced during the committee hearing,\" she added. \"Money was got. By criminals. By penetrating the digital system. A lot of people would consider that a cyber crime, however you define it\", she said. Much of the scam centred on criminals setting up new accounts using phished information, Ms MacDonald said. She added many of those in whose name accounts had been set up didn't have a need for an online tax account, and had never had one before, so would not have known they were part of the scam. Ms MacDonald told the committee that \"the nature of the attack altered through the year, as we were closing it down, and closing accounts down.\" \"They were moving their MO [method] over… We took a lot of action to actually tackle the perpetrators,\" she added. \"What has been a challenge in terms of... cleaning the accounts up is being clear that we were then talking to the genuine customer and not in fact talking to the criminal who was on the other end of the account.\" She said she was \"clear with the information commissioner\" and had been taking its advice on the handling of the incident. \"We are living in a environment where every single organisation was facing some kind of cyber threat,\" she said, adding \"it is a continuing piece of work for us to invest in our systems... to try to outpace the criminals\". The BBC understands that the government will be making further investments in the HMRC IT systems at next week's spending review. Workers, who have been on strike since just before Christmas, want sacked union reps reinstated. Thirteen companies are currently being wound up after Green Jellyfish was raided by HMRC last year. Around 2.7 million non-UK duty paid cigarettes were discovered during a search in Camlough, near Newry Remedy Payroll Solutions declared just a tenth of the VAT it owed over a 15-month period, HMRC says. Home buyers in England and Northern Ireland will pay more stamp duty from 1 April when thresholds rise.",

    "title": "Winter fuel payments to be reinstated this year as PM challenged over U-turn",
    "article_text": "Changes to the winter fuel payment to allow more people to receive it will be in place this year, the chancellor has said. Rachel Reeves said more people would qualify for the allowance \"this winter\", however details of the changes and who will be eligible remain unclear. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he wanted towiden the thresholdfor winter fuel in a U-turn on one of his government's first major policies, but failed to confirm on Wednesday how many would now get it. The payment, worth up to £300 to help with energy bills during the coldest months, was paid only to those on pension credit last year, but the policy was widely blamed for Labour's poor local election results. It meant 10 million fewer pensioners received the money in 2024. There was particular concern among charities and some MPs about those whose income was slightly too high to qualify, but were hit by the loss of the payment as energy costs remained expensive. Sir Keir did not confirm during Prime Minister's Questions who would be eligible for the revised policy, having previously admitted in a recent BBC interview that clarity was needed as soon as possible. \"We will look, again, as I said two weeks ago, at the eligibility for winter fuel, and of course, we'll set out how we pay for it,\" when quizzed by Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch on how many of the 10 million pensioners who lost the allowance would get it back. The questions came after Reeves said earlier that people \"should be in no doubt that the means test will increase and more people will get winter fuel payment this winter\". Badenoch said the Chancellor was \"rushing her plans because she just realised when winter is\". If the government waits until the Budget to announce the changes, it would be just before payments are typically made. Eligible pensioners receive payments automatically in November or December. Under the short-lived current system, people are required to claim pension credit - which is a top-up to the state pension for those on low incomes. Households with a person under 80 receive £200 a year, while homes with a person over 80 receive £300. In response to growing questions over the changes, Downing Street said it would provide \"clarity\" on how it would expand payments \"as soon as we can\". Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: \"We are encouraged by the chancellor's words, but will wait to see the detail, which needs to be published very soon if changes are to be made in time for this winter, something that is absolutely crucial if we're to protect the pensioners at greatest risk.\" Earlier on Wednesday, pensions minister Torsten Bell said there would be no return to the previous system in which the payment was made to all 11.4 million pensioners. \"It's not a good idea that we have a system paying a few hundreds of pounds to millionaires, and so we're not going to be continuing with that,\" he said. The government has not provided details of who would qualify as a millionaire. Sir Keir told Parliament that the reason the government could expand the number of people receiving the payment was because Labour had \"stabilised the economy\". Reeves said the economy was now in a \"better shape,\" and that the government \"had listened to the concerns people had about the level of the means test\" in a speech in Greater Manchester announcingbillions of pounds of investment in transport infrastructure in England. But Daisy Cooper, treasury spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said pensioners deserved an apology from the government. \"This whole debacle has caused needless misery for millions of pensioners,\" she said. The decision to means-test the previously universal payment was one of the first announcements by the chancellor after Labour's landslide election victory last year. The practicalities of changing the system again are complicated. One option would be a system in which people on certain incomes can make a claim. Clawing back a payment via the tax system for those on higher incomes is another possibility. The government has yet to outline which mechanics it intends to use to enact its change of policy. In Scotland, ministers have alreadyoutlined a different policy. Those in receipt of qualifying benefits like pension credit would get the payment as before, while others would get £100. The funds - which are limited to one payment per household - will be paid through a new Scottish Parliament benefit, which will not be ready until late 2025. The confirmation that more people will receive winter fuel payments this winter comes ahead of the UK government's spending review, which will be announced on 11 June. The review will outline day-to-day departmental budgets over the next three years and investment budgets over the next four. Whitehall insiders have told the BBC they expect it will be \"ugly\", and on Wednesday, Reeves said\"not every department will get everything that they want next week\",suggesting she had turned down requests for funding from ministers. Reeves's position on ruling out borrowing for day-to-day spending and not raising taxes again has fuelled speculation that spending cuts will be made. During PMQs, Sir Keir sidestepped calls to say whether he will scrap the two-child benefit cap. The cap was introduced in 2015 by then-Conservative chancellor George Osborne and restricts child welfare payments to the first two children born to most families. Money will be spent on tram, train and bus projects in England across the Midlands, North and West Country. The chancellor defends her decisions and confirmed winter fuel payments will be restored to some pensioners this year. The government has confirmed it will reverse some of the recent changes to the winter fuel payment. Grahame Lucas says that in Worcester \"an awful lot of families just haven't got sufficient money\". The Chancellor faces tough choices about spending across different government departments.",

    "title": "How Chelsea won the race to sign £30m Delap",
    "article_text": "Liam Delap spent one season at Ipswich after leaving Manchester City Champions League football; the chance to play alongside Cole Palmer; the youngest squad in the Premier League. They were three of the reasons that helped Chelsea win the race to sign Liam Delap. Manchester United, Everton, Nottingham Forest and Newcastle all showed strong interest in the England Under-21 striker after a Â£30m release clause was activated following Ipswich's relegation from the Premier League. Manchester City had a buy-back option afterselling Delap for Â£20m last summer,but opted not to use it. Earlier this month, Delap wasgiven permission by Ipswichto speak to several interested clubs. Over the past week it became evident the choice was between Manchester United and Chelsea, but theBlues' final-day victory over Nottingham Forest- which confirmed Champions League qualification - proved a deciding factor. Interested parties were told a week ago that the 22-year-old had made his decision, and he was spotted at Stansted Airport that evening before a medical. He is now likely join up with his new club for the inaugural summer Club World Cup - instead of play for England at the European Under-21 Championship. Delap has been a key target for Chelsea all season and it is understood co-owner Behdad Eghbali met David Manasseh, the player's key agent, in Dubai. Eghbali even expressed his fondness for the player to Chelsea fans in Wroclaw before theConference League final. Head coach Enzo Maresca also pitched directly to Delap - as did at least one other manager - in face-to-face talks once Ipswich granted permission. Chelsea sign Ipswich striker Delap in Â£30m deal Delap will link up with former England Under-21 team-mates Palmer (top left) and Noni Madueke (bottom right) Delap has been impressed with Chelsea's style of play and feels the club will be a good fit. He was also urged to make the move by several former City academy graduates he will join at Stamford Bridge - such as Jadon Sancho, Romeo Lavia, Tosin Adarabioyo and Palmer. Maresca worked with Delap in City's elite development squad, while Chelsea's key recruiter Joe Shields is also known to have a good relationship with the player and his family, and academy director Glenn van der Kraan is one of several other connections between the two Premier League clubs. Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna also retains good relations with the Chelsea hierarchy after being interviewed for their manager's job last summer. And he will hope that helps in a potential move for striker Marc Guiu, who interests Ipswich as a loan replacement for Delap. The 19-year-old Spaniard scored six goals in 14 appearances for Chelsea this season but has missed most of 2025 with a muscle injury. He returned as a late substitute during the Conference League final in Wroclaw. As ever with these situations, Manchester United can draw a positive out of a negative. They felt earlier last week it was coming towards the end game in their pursuit of Delap, and it was between them and Chelsea. Now they know they have lost out. The positive is, with the decision made, they can move on. That is in stark contrast to 2022, when then manager Erik ten Hag delayed for months in a fruitless attempt to sign Frenkie de Jong and United ended up panicking at the end of the transfer window and spent Â£150m on Casemiro and Antony. But that does not answer the pertinent question: who now? Delap fitted their template of an improving, hungry young player, with scope to reach a high standard - at a set fee. Rasmus Hojlund - who is four days younger than Delap - fitted the same criteria, apart from the last one. And it has not worked out. Nothing I have seen on their post-season trip to Asia makes me feel United have the answer to their goalscoring issues within the club. In fact, it is quite the opposite. The 'safe' but expensive options are Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo and Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta. But Mateta is 27 and Mbeumo will be at the Africa Cup of Nations for a month with Cameroon. After that, it is a risk. Former United striker Danny Welbeck scored 10 goals in the Premier League at the age of 34. Is there any merit in bringing him back and taking some of the pressure off Hojlund - or has Ruben Amorim concluded the 22-year-old Denmark international will never be good enough? If so, it is back to Europe to sign another promising forward with no guarantee it will work. Newcastle, Nottingham Forest and Everton also showed interest in Delap. It is understood the pitch by Everton and Moyes made a positive impression on Delap, but the club always understood they were underdogs. Before the penultimate fixture of the season against Ipswich at Goodison Park, Moyes said: \"We would certainly be interested if he was interested in us.\" After the game, Everton fans did their best to persuade Delap to join them at the new Hill Dickinson Stadium - despite a hostile reception following run-ins with Jake O'Brien and Jarrad Branthwaite. Supporters urged him to move to Merseyside as he visited 37 Goodison Road - a house across from the stadium which has a wall featuring footballers' signatures. Ultimately, though, the lure of Champions League football means he plumped for Chelsea. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page",

    "title": "Where Swiatek v Sabalenka showdown will be decided",
    "article_text": "Iga Swiatek (left) and Aryna Sabalenka have won six of the past 10 Grand Slam titles between them When the French Open draw was made a fortnight ago, it was the potential women's match that everyone had their eye on. Iga Swiatek - the reigning champion known as the 'Queen of Clay' - against world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the semi-finals. The pair have dominated the WTA Tour over the past three years, leading to an era-defining rivalry that resumes when they meet in the last four at Roland Garros on Thursday. \"It is the blockbuster of the entire tournament on the women's side,\" said former world number nine Andrea Petkovic, who will be analysing the match for BBC Radio 5 Live. Poland's Swiatek, seeded fifth, is bidding for a fourth straight title while Belarusian rival Sabalenka is seeking to snatch the crown for the first time. They have never played each other at the clay-court Grand Slam and it will be the first time they have met competitively since the Cincinnati Open last August. Swiatek, 24, leads their head-to-head record, with eight wins from 12 matches, including five of six meetings on clay. But with questions still lingering over the four-time champion's game, can 27-year-old Sabalenka end her rival's formidable record? Boisson beats Andreeva to continue Paris fairytale Gauff battles past Keys to reach semi-finals Coming into Roland Garros, it was clear to see Swiatek's reign was under threat. The former world number one has dropped to her lowest ranking since 2022, having not reached a tour-level final since claiming last year's French Open. It was the first time she arrived in Paris without winning a title in the clay-court swing since her maiden major triumph in 2020. After a humbling defeat by Danielle Collins in the Italian Open third round, Swiatek insisted her previous French Open record would count for nothing. But she has improved match by match, and the manner with which she fought back from a set down against Elena Rybakina in the last 16 felt like a renaissance moment. \"Before the tournament started I put Iga as third favourite - after Aryna and Coco Gauff,\" said Petkovic. \"But I changed my opinion after I saw her match against Rybakina. I saw the old mental strength of Iga in the most important moments.\" While it feels like Swiatek is still short of her very best level, the frustration she showed earlier in the clay-court swing has rarely been evident. She has regained more trust in her damaging top-spin forehand, taking it more regularly from the centre of the court. \"Against the best movers in the world, you won't hit as many winners on the backhand, no matter how good it is - so you have to go with your forehand,\" said Petkovic. \"Her forehand is the biggest weapon on the clay courts because it has more spin, more margin and can really jump out of the strike zone of Sabalenka.\" Stepping back in her returning position - like she did against Rybakina - may also be a key tactic against another big server. \"Swiatek always returns from the same position every single time, no matter who is serving. That works well against players who don't serve well,\" Petkovic added. \"But against the Rybakinas - and the Sabalenkas - this is a dangerous thing. \"If you don't see the ball early enough you will be under pressure right away.\" Three-time Grand Slam champion Sabalenka replaced Swiatek at the top of the rankings last year and has opened a commanding lead over her rivals this season. With 39 wins from 45 matches, her powerful style transcends surfaces and is backed up by an unparalleled consistency. Sabalenka, who has won three WTA titles this year, is the first player to reach the quarter-finals at 10 consecutive Grand Slams since American great Serena Williams between 2014 and 2017. To reach her first French Open final, she will have to find a way to end Swiatek's 26-match winning streak on the Paris clay. \"The most important thing for Aryna - against anybody in the world - is whether she can control the first two to three shots. That's where she makes the difference,\" said Petkovic. \"It doesn't mean she has to win the point in the first two or three shots, but she has to be able to gain control. \"If she is able to do that, I think it will be very hard for Iga to win.\" Sabalenka, whose also reached the 2023 semi-finals, is becoming more than just a ball crusher as she looks to evolve her game. She is playing with increasing variety and has used the drop-shot effectively in Paris, although the speed of Swiatek may be able to neutralise that option. \"I'm going to play with my power, because this is something where I feel the most comfortable,\" said Sabalenka. \"But when you put the other player on the back foot, it's really important to mix it up little bit just so they guess every time.\" To paraphrase an old saying, Swiatek and Sabalenka appear to have decided it is better to keep your rivals even closer than your friends. The pair practised together in the off-season and shared a court again at Roland Garros before the tournament started. Swiatek played down the significance of the session, which took place as she looked to rediscover her game. \"It's great always to practice with Aryna. She gives a great rhythm and the practice will have quality,\" said Swiatek, who has dropped just one set in the tournament so far. \"But, honestly, it was two weeks ago. It was the first points that I played after Rome. I think a lot has changed since then.\" Swiatek and Sabalenka share a joke at the WTA Finals in Saudi Arabia last year Swiatek believes the rivalry is \"pushing\" both players to greater heights, while Sabalenka says they have also bonded more away from the court. On the face of it, the pair have little in common. Swiatek is the bookish introvert, Sabalenka is the Tiger-monikered extrovert. Doing a TikTok video together at last year's WTA Finals has helped forge what Sabalenka described as a \"better relationship\". But, on Thursday, it will be strictly business. \"I love these challenges. I am always excited to face someone strong who can challenge me,\" said Sabalenka. \"I go out there and I fight, and I'm ready to leave everything I have to get the win.\" Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Ronaldo ends Germany duck - where next in his 1,000 goals pursuit?",
    "article_text": "Cristiano Ronaldo is the joint-second top scorer in the 2024-25 Nations League with seven goals There aren't many things Cristiano Ronaldo hasn't done but beating Germany was one of them - until now. When Ronaldo popped up with the winner in theNations League semi-final in Munich,it extended his record goalscoring total - and ended a long wait. It was the 40-year-old's 137th international goal in 220 caps, and his 937th strike in all football. All three of those totals are men's records. But until now Ronaldo had never experienced a worse record at international level against any other team. He played Germany five times, losing all five - with Portugal last beating them at Euro 2000. But that is now five from six. That means England take the record of the country Ronaldo has played the most times without beating - three (all draws). Although the biggest caveat in the world is needed here. Portugal won two of the three 'draws' on penalties - the Euro 2004 and 2006 World Cup quarter-finals. After Germany, the nation Ronaldo has suffered defeat against most is France - with four losses. But his Portugal side most famously beat France in the Euro 2016 final, and there have been three draws (although that includes a penalty shootout defeat). Ronaldo's goalscoring record against Germany was also poor with just one goal in those five meetings, a total of 450 minutes. That is now two in 540 minutes (so one every 270 minutes). Funnily enough it was against German clubs where he excelled the most in the Champions League, with 28 goals in 26 games. Since turning 30, Ronaldo has scored 85 goals for Portugal. By way of comparison only five other players have ever scored more than 85 goals. So that means in the second half of his international career he has scored more than legends like Ferenc Puskas, Pele, Diego Maradona and Gerd Muller - or current players like Neymar and Harry Kane - have in their entire international careers. \"It's difficult to put into words. He takes each day as an opportunity to get better,\" said Portugal boss Roberto Martinez. \"As a human, when you have success, you wake up and you have less hunger. But not Cristiano.\" While his international teammate, Bernardo Silva, added: \"It's his ambition to keep going. \"It's never easy - to still be hungry to go every day. \"He's been doing this for more than 20 years. It's tough, but he's here with us and we're happy he scored again.\" After Sunday's Nations League final against either France or Spain - who meet on Thursday in Stuttgart (20:00 BST) it is not entirely clear where Ronaldo's club future lies. Ronaldo has been playing for Saudi club Al-Nassr for the past two and a half years but his contract expires this summer. After their final game of the season, he wrote on social media: \"This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Grateful to all.\" That led many to presume Ronaldo was leaving Al-Nassr. Fifa president Gianni Infantino had said \"there are discussions\" over Ronaldo playing at the Club World Cup this summer. Al-Nassr had failed to qualify - but he would be able to join another team in it, even if just on a short-term deal. Brazilian side Botafogo were the most strongly linked. But now multiple media outlets report that Ronaldo is likely to sign a new contract with Al-Nassr, tying him to the club until he is 42. Ronaldo needs 63 more goals to become the first player to reach 1,000 ever. Brazil legends Pele and Romario both claimed to have scored more than 1,000 goals but they included many unofficial matches, including friendlies - so neither are recognised figures. Ronaldo scored 35 goals for Al-Nassr last season - so would reach the landmark in less than two years if he keeps up that goalscoring rate.

    "article_text": "Russell Martin was sacked by Southampton after a 5-0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur last December Rangers are close to finalising a deal with Russell Martin to become the club's next manager. The 39-year-old became the frontrunner in a process that included the club speaking to former Real Madrid assistant manager Davide Ancelotti and former Feyenoord manager Brian Priske. Martin will succeed interim manager Barry Ferguson, who took over from Philippe Clement in February. The former MK Dons, Swansea and Southampton manager is expected to bring his former assistants Matt Gill and Rhys Owens to Ibrox, along with former Rangers defender Maurice Ross. So, what could Rangers expect on the pitch if Martin takes charge? Who is Rangers frontrunner Martin & what might he bring? Rangers close in on manager for 'new chapter' 'Martin or Ancelotti just one of the questions Rangers can't get wrong' Martin himself told the BBC's Match of the Day last month that a key element of taking on any job would be \"how the style of play will fit\" and \"how convinced the ownership and people in charge are with how we do things\". That seems to suggest he retains faith in his philosophy. Football coach and analyst John Walker has undertaken extensive analysis of Martin's managerial career and believes many people misunderstand his style. \"I think there's a misconception of it being very passive in possession for possession's sake,\" he told BBC Scotland. \"To me, anytime I've watched MK Dons, Swansea or Southampton - more the latter  in the Championship - it was actually really forward attacking play. \"It was very fast forward. It wasn't too dissimilar, though not the exact same in patterns, to Postecoglou's Celtic. \"That's probably why I'm such a champion for him taking over Rangers because I believe it's a style of football, with aggression, that can work in Scotland.\" Ironically, it was in the aftermath of a 5-0 drubbing by Postecoglou's Tottenham Hotspur that Martin was sacked by Southampton. This video can not be played Match of the Day 2: Southampton sack Russell Martin A reluctance to adapt is an accusation Postecoglou and Martin both share. But the latter's former Norwich City team-mate, Angus Gunn, would dispute that. Gunn came up against Martin's Southampton team in the English Championship en route to, what turned into, their unsuccessful return to the Premier League. \"They were a tough team,\" the Scotland goalkeeper said. \"We had a couple of good games against them. One was 4-4, one was 1-1, so quite contrasting. \"When we first played them they were quite open. Then when we played them again, they were a little bit pragmatic and I think that shows a coach that can adapt and change the way his team plays. \"Watching his teams over the few years that he was there, I thought he did that even though some people probably said that he was reluctant to change a lot. \"I thought he did that quite well, especially in the Championship.\" The narrative around the former Scotland defender, particularly with Southampton in the Premier League, was that he was too stubborn and needed to adapt. The former Rangers defender's response was firm. \"There is a difference between being stubborn and having conviction,\" he told BBC Sport. \"If you really believe in something as a coach, manager, leader, then the logic for me is that you stick with it and try to be better at it.\" It suggests the principles of Martin's approach won't deviate if he gets the Ibrox job. It seems there will be a significant, if not seismic, change in squad personnel at Rangers, with fresh funds available after the takeover led by Andrew Cavenagh and 49ers Enterprises. But just how big would that need to be to allow Martin to implement his ideas? Walker believes wholesale change is required at Rangers, but insists Martin would be unfazed by such a task. \"I don't think many of the players that are currently there will survive,\" Walker said. \"When he went into Swansea, I think they had 18 players leave over the summer so they had to make 17 signings. \"When he went into Southampton there were 20 people wanting to leave. \"So he's got experience of building a squad and almost instantly implementing the style of play. I would expect a massive squad overhaul if he comes in. \"I think with the style of play, you're going to also experience teething problems, a lot of goals conceded to start with. \"I think the exciting part will be there'll be lots of goals for Rangers.\" Do you think Martin would be a success as Rangers manager?

    "title": "Djokovic beats Zverev to set up Sinner semi-final",
    "article_text": "Novak Djokovic is bidding to become the oldest Grand Slam men's champion in history French Open 2025 Dates:25 May-8 JuneVenue:Roland Garros Coverage:Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app Novak Djokovic continued his quest for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title by swatting aside third seed Alexander Zverev to reach the French Open semi-finals. The 38-year-old sixth seed won 4-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 to set up a meeting with world number one Jannik Sinner on Friday. Djokovic, who has three Roland Garros titles, lost the opening set to 2024 runner-up Zverev after being broken in the first game of the match. But the Serb great did not drop serve again, although he had to survive a 41-shot exchange on break point at 3-2 in the fourth set on his way to sealing a record-extending 51st Grand Slam semi-final appearance. \"My way of playing is based on running, but at my age it's not so easy to run so much,\" said Djokovic, who is the second oldest man to reach the French Open semi-finals. There he will face Sinner, who cruised into the last four with a ruthless straight-set victory over Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik earlier on Thursday. The Italian is still yet to drop a set at Roland Garros after winning 6-1 7-5 6-0 and bringing 62nd-ranked Bublik's remarkable run to an end. Sinner is hunting a first title on the Paris clay after previously only gone as far as the semis, losing a five-set thriller to Spain's Carlos Alcaraz last year. Djokovic or Sinner will meet the winner of defending champion Alcaraz and Italian eighth seed Lorenzo Musetti, who also play on Friday. Where Swiatek v Sabalenka showdown will be decided Boisson beats Andreeva to continue Paris fairytale Gauff battles past Keys to reach semi-finals While age is clearly catching up on Djokovic, his insatiable appetite for Grand Slam success shows no signs of slowing down. A patchy season by his lofty standards has led to questions about his stamina and motivation, while the departure of rival-turned-coach Andy Murray from his team also indicated things were not functioning as he hoped. But when the major tournaments come around, Djokovic is always still primed to challenge in the latter stages. In Melbourne, he defied the odds to beat Alcaraz and reach the semi-finals, although the physical exertions led to a hamstring tear which meant he had to retire injured against Zverev in the last-four encounter. Nevertheless, it showed he still had the desire and capability to beat the younger generation over the five-set format. \"I think the win against Alcaraz and against Zverev tonight proves to myself and others that I can still play at the highest level,\" Djokovic said. \"I just thrive on these occasions. This is where I lock in and really give my best.\" Zverev, 28, was once part of the first crop expected to replace Djokovic, Murray, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. This defeat was another illustration of how the German is often unable to problem-solve against Djokovic, who won four of his eight break points. Often accused of being too passive, Zverev was rooted deep behind the baseline for much of the contest and paid the price as Djokovic took control with his craftmanship. With belief or focus rarely wavering, the Serb started dictating the patterns of play and used the drop shot effectively to unsettle Zverev. When the three-time Grand Slam runner-up finally thought his chance of a comeback had arrived midway through the fourth set, he was denied in arguably the point of the tournament. Djokovic showed all his elasticity and endurance to stop Zverev putting the set back on serve. It enabled Djokovic to serve out victory after three hours and 17 minutes as another deft drop shot, fittingly, caught out Zverev again. Sinner is aiming for a first title at Roland Garros to add to his US Open and two Australian Open titles The manner in which Sinner continues to tear his way through the draw - in only his second tournament back from a three-month ban for failing two doping tests - is an ominous sign for his rivals. The 23-year-old world number one has been the dominant player on the ATP Tour over the past 18 months and, after reaching the Rome final last month, has simply carried on from where he left off. Victory over Bublik extended Sinner's winning run at the majors to 19 matches after triumphs at last year's US Open and the Australian Open in January. The Italian, who won the first of his three majors in Melbourne last year, needed only one hour and 51 minutes to dismantle the unorthodox Bublik. After what he described as a \"disgraceful\" period in his career, Bublik's surprise run at the French Open - in which he became the first Kazakh to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final - has seen him return to the top 50 in the rankings. Refreshed from a recent trip to Las Vegas which proved to be a turning point in his form, Bublik has enjoyed his best run at Roland Garros and said his fourth-round win over British number one Jack Draper was the \"best moment of my life\". But a match against the world number one proved a bridge too far. \"We have faced each other a few times so I know him quite well, but with him [Bublik] you never know what's happening,\" said Sinner. \"He deserves to be in the quarter-finals, he beat very tough players. I tried to stay focused on my side and play as solidly as possible because he can have ups and downs so I tried to stay consistent.\" Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "How a chaotic 10 days unfolded for Lionesses as Euros loom",
    "article_text": "Millie Bright has made 88 appearances for England With Sarina Wiegman naming her Euro 2025 squad at 14:00 BST on Thursday, two senior international retirements and the withdrawal of her World Cup captain is not exactly ideal. It has been a chaotic and unsettling 10 days for the Lionesses, with distractions off the pitch dominating the end of their Women's Nations League campaign, which was brought to a close withdefeat by Spain. Goalkeeper Mary Earps stunned supporters when she stepped away from international duty, informing players four days before England's win over Portugal. Fran Kirby followed suit a week later, announcing her decision within an hour of England's defeat by world champions Spain late on Tuesday. And, with several players still on a flight home when the news dropped on Wednesday, Millie Bright revealed she was withdrawing from selection because of \"personal reasons\" - having taken an \"extended period of recovery\" this week. It has led to some questioning over what is happening within the squad, and what repercussions there will be - with England attempting to defend their Euros crown. They have been drawn in a tough group at the tournament, which starts on 2 July, facing the Netherlands, France, who are ranked 10th and 11th in the world, and neighbours Wales. Only two from the group will advance to the quarter-finals. The squad were rocked when Earps, following conversations with manager Wiegman, decided to step down from international duty with her position as England's number two all but confirmed. She had fallen down the pecking order since her heroics at Euro 2022 and the 2023 Women's World Cup and, with Chelsea's Hannah Hampton having started three successive matches, her role in Switzerland was expected to be a different one. That played a large part in Earps' sudden decision, which clearly disappointed Wiegman - who described it as a \"hard\" week for the Lionesses. Meanwhile, Bright had already withdrawn from the squad to focus on her wellbeing, but Wiegman hoped she would feel well enough to rejoin the group for the Euros. Players reached out to Bright while at St George's Park in the build-up to their 6-0 win over Portugal last Friday, but Wiegman's doubts were clear as she admitted she \"did not know\" whether the Chelsea captain would return in time. Kirby's retirement rubbed salt into England's wounds after an eye-opening defeat by Spain - who are seen as strong favourites for the Euros title next month. Her decision was understandable, given she had had \"honest conversations\" with Wiegman throughout the past few weeks and was told she was not set to make the squad. With retirement in the summer already in mind Kirby accelerated her decision, but the timing only fuelled the chaos that existed during England's preparations. Bright selflessly confirmed 12 hours later that she was \"unable to give 100% mentally or physically\", and that was the final blow in a damaging week for England. She had started every game as England won the Euros in 2022, and again as she captained the Lionesses to the World Cup final in 2023. When fit, she is one of the first names on Wiegman's teamsheet and would have been a shoo-in for the squad. Why time is right for resilient 'Mini Messi' Kirby to end England career 'Very good week' for England or 'back to the drawing board'? Tackling a sportswear giant & making goalkeeping cool - Earps' legacy Each situation has come about in different circumstances but, combined, it makes for a grim picture. Kirby's choice felt like the right one after the 31-year-old's efforts to move from the fringes into the final 23-player Euros squad ultimately did not pay off. She had struggled with injury since starting every game at Euro 2022, missing the World Cup after knee surgery and withdrawing from recent squads with minor issues - her place in the squad was up for debate and Wiegman made her call. Wiegman spoke highly of Kirby in the moments after she had informed her team-mates in the dressing room in Barcelona. She had been left out of the squad for the 2-1 defeat by Spain and Wiegman addressed media, saying she was \"proud\" of Kirby's career and calling her an \"inspiration\". Both Kirby and Wiegman said they had \"honest conversations\" and had communicated frequently in recent weeks. It ended on good terms, with full transparency. There was also sympathy from Wiegman regarding Bright's wellbeing, with the Dutchwoman saying last week the priority was \"to take care of herself\". \"She has to take the time that will help her settle. We'll stay in contact and I hope she feels better soon. We have people around who can give that support,\" Wiegman added. Captain Leah Williamson said Bright's decision to speak out about her mental health was a \"brave thing to do\". \"I think it encourages other people to do the same,\" said Williamson. \"She's leading by example. Anything that she needs from the team, we will be there to give it to her.\" There were mixed views when Earps' retirement was announced two weeks ago - some among the media and fanbase calling it a \"selfish\" decision. She was still a valuable member of Wiegman's squad - the manager said so herself - and she wanted Earps to be in Switzerland, using her experience to aid Hampton. Wiegman admitted she was\"really disappointed and sad\",and that the news had come as a \"shock\" to the players. She was hesitant to discuss details around the timing of Earps' decision but it was clear Wiegman was emotional, stating: \"I find it hard\". This video can not be played 'Sad' Wiegman & 'devastated' Williamson on Earps' retirement Wiegman became the first coach to win the Euros with two different teams, and this summer will aim to become only the second to win three consecutive European Championships. She can only select 23 players and there are always difficult choices. She omitted former captain Steph Houghton from the squad in 2022, with the armband going to Williamson - who had played just seven minutes at a major tournament. Houghton later said she was disappointed by the lack of communication from Wiegman, but those close to the Dutchwoman say she is ruthless in her decision-making. Wiegman can be sharp and straight to the point, efficient with her time, and always insistent on decisions that are best for the squad - not based on sentiment. That ruthlessness is nothing new - Wiegman dropped Netherlands captain Mandy van den Berg after the first two group games at Euro 2017. Ultimately, she went on to win both tournaments, proving her worth as one of the world's leading coaches. \"When she first took the job I was looking into her thinking 'who is this, I want to know what her squad profile is',\" former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley told 5 Live. \"I looked at what she had done with the Netherlands and she culled loads of 30-year-olds. I thought I had no chance. \"I was out injured and I remember having a phone call with her and she was like 'where are you at?' I told her I was still injured. She said: 'I'm going to give you six weeks to let me know if you're going to be fit enough or not'. \"I thought that was quite an ultimatum. I tried to get back fit and I couldn't, so I had to call her and say I'm not going to make it. I'm going to have to retire. \"With the intensity she wants to play at, the game does catch up with you and it gets to a point where it moves beyond you.\" Wiegman said on Tuesday she is \"close\" to knowing her final squad for Euro 2025, but insists there is still time to work out her starting XI. A major dilemma is whether to gamble on the fitness of Lauren James. The Chelsea forward was not involved in the recent Lionesses camp because of a hamstring injury suffered in April, and she has not featured for club or country since. But Wiegman said she was \"pretty positive\" about James' Euros chances, saying numerous times this week that she is on track and \"ticking the boxes\". \"LJ is special. She can produce something that is quite extraordinary, that can spin a game on its head,\" said ex-striker White. \"Do you take a risk on someone that is talented, that could potentially come on for 10 or 15 minutes and do something completely special? It is a real headache for Sarina.\" Another outsider is 19-year-old Michelle Agyemang, who scored a stunning goal just 41 seconds into her senior debut in April. Bardsley believes the Brighton forward is worth a punt. \"When I saw her play for the under-23s I thought she was on another level. \"She is an incredible talent. I don't want to hype her up too much because she is young. \"She has put in her application and hopefully Sarina accepts, because I'd love to see her in Switzerland.\" Players face a nervous wait before Thursday's announcement and Bronze admitted there were \"a lot of big decisions\" for Wiegman to make. \"You can only pick 23 players. We have more than 23 players that deserve to be at the Euros based on talent, on effort and on experience,\" she added. Head here to get involved",

    "article_text": "This video can not be played England hammer West Indies to seal ODI series win Second ODI, Leicester England 366-6 (50 overs):Jones 129 (98), Beaumont 106 (109) West Indies 223 (45.4 overs):Grimmond 53 (72); Capsey 3-41 England won by 143 runs; go 2-0 up in three-match series Scorecard Openers Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont hit their second successive centuries as England hammered West Indies by 143 runs in the second one-day international in Leicester. Jones, whosehundred in Derby on Fridaywas her first in international cricket, made a sublime 129 from 98 balls having been dropped on 43, while Beaumont struck 106 in England's imposing 366-6. The pair added 202 in 29.2 overs, following their stand of 222 in the opener, before Emma Lamb's 55 and Sophia Dunkley's 31 from 19 balls capped another utterly dominant batting performance. In a contest made even more one-sided by the absence of Windies skipper Hayley Matthews because of a shoulder injury, the tourists trudged to 223 all out in 45.4 overs in reply. Opener Realeanna Grimmond made a spirited 53 from 72 balls with two sixes on her ODI debut, and Jannillea Glasgow added an entertaining 44 from 24, but the eventual result was a foregone conclusion, such is the gulf between the sides. Alice Capsey finished with 3-41, while Linsey Smith and Lauren Filer also took two wickets each, but England's bowling attack lacked threat in the middle overs as they struggled to create breakthroughs from West Indies' lack of attacking intent. The win also secures a comprehensive ODI series win for England under the new leadership of Nat Sciver-Brunt and Charlotte Edwards, with the third and final match taking place at Taunton on Saturday after the hosts also swept the T20s 3-0. England hopeful over Ecclestone despite new injury This video can not be played 'Outstanding innings' - Jones makes second century in consecutive matches Edwards' decision to reinstate Jones at the top of the order initially raised a few eyebrows, but it has proved to be a masterstroke. She whacked two fours in the opening over off Zaida James and did not look back. The roles were reversed from their previous partnership, with Jones hitting the accelerator throughout while Beaumont eased through the gears with a little more caution. There were signs of nerves when Jones reached the 90s at Derby, with dropped chances on 91 and 92, but here she oozed confidence from the minute she walked to the middle. The century came from just 76 balls - England's joint-third fastest in women's ODIs - with Beaumont's fifty coming from 64, before she kicked on to reach three figures from 106 balls with a six sent sailing over long-on. It was the first time an opening pair has hit back-to-back hundreds in the history of the format - men's and women's - and the hosts relentlessly punished West Indies' inexperienced bowling attack which struggled to build any consistency or dot ball pressure throughout. The bowling skewed both sides of the wicket in the first 10 overs which allowed their flying start, and Jones' chance should have been taken by Grimmond at cover. Both openers were eventually dismissed by spinner Karishma Ramharack but they had set a platform which ensured England had their record total of 378 in their sights, until Grimmond provided the tourists' highlight in the field with a spectacular one-handed catch to dismiss Lamb as England were accelerating into the final five overs. Despite the confidence that will come from posting scores of 346 and 366 in consecutive games, there will certainly be tougher tests to come for England's new opening pair and for number three Lamb, who made a 41-ball fifty. The first of those comes with India's arrival later this month, which will provide a much clearer indication of the team's batting approach under Edwards and how they deal with pressure. This video can not be played 'She does it in style!' - Beaumont hits century as England dominate with the bat This video can not be played Cross dismisses Alleyne to take 100th ODI wicket The situation felt ominous for West Indies from the moment Matthews' omission was announced at the toss, exemplified by the sight of her circling the boundary at Leicester, bundled in a coat and bobble hat with her arm in a sling, chatting to the fielders in what was likely an attempt to provide much-needed encouragement or advice. While their bowling effort did little to ease the concern, the hopes for their batting effort were virtually non-existent with her explosive opening partner Qiana Joseph also absent and the experienced duo of Deandra Dottin and Chinelle Henry missing the tour altogether. Grimmond stepped up admirably as a rare bright spark, in particular playing the short ball brilliantly as she whacked Lauren Bell for two mighty sixes over the leg side, while Glasgow struck nine fours in her cameo - but there was little else for England to genuinely judge their bowling on. England did not bowl badly, but considering their superiority in all aspects, they should have bowled West Indies out despite them barely playing a shot in anger from around the halfway mark. Filer bowled with lively pace, clocking up to 77mph, and could be forgiven for being a little wayward after returning from injury. When she was on target, she unsettled the batters and ripped through the defences of Jahzara Claxton for 18 and Afy Fletcher for eight in the space of one over which put England on the brink of victory. Smith's consistency and Capsey's useful part-time off-spin have given plenty for Edwards to consider once Sophie Ecclestone returns to fitness, but again, with the greater challenge of India looming, England will have to think more creatively during the middle overs where breaking partnerships becomes trickier. This video can not be played Watch the best shots of Lamb's innings West Indies captain Shemaine Campbelle:\"It's good to see the young players going out there playing today and playing a positive brand of cricket, that was a plus for us. \"Going into it, we wanted to bowl into good areas. We struggled to do that and unfortunately it didn't go the way that we wanted.\" Player of the match Amy Jones:\"It's quite funny how it's worked out, after a good number of games. I loved today, it's been cool to be in a big partnership with Tammy Beaumont. \"Opening's not that easy, you have to ride your luck. I did that today, but I'm pleased to pile the runs on with her.\" Former England spinner Alex Hartley on BBC Test Match Special: \"It's refreshing to see that the future is bright and that there is competition for the spots. \"There was a time when you knew who was going to be playing every game.

    "article_text": "TheHome Officehas been accused of a “racist crackdown on Nigerians” after refusing a visa to a man who runs one of the west African country’s top security firms for a holiday to see his family. Samuel Onyekachi Ibeawuchi runsBKay Security Ltd, which provides close protection for high-profile people in Nigeria and abroad. He and his wife, a successful businesswoman, had applied to come to the UK with their 18-month-old child for three weeks in the summer so they could spend time with his sister, Hope Ibeawuchi-Beales, and her husband, Nick Beales, who is head of campaigning at Ramfel, which supports vulnerable migrants. Despite Ibeawuchi-Beales and Beales undertaking to support the family during their trip, a Home Office official turned down the visit visa application. The refusal letter states: “This sponsorship does not satisfy me of your own intention to leave the UK on completion of your visit.” It adds that future visits are also likely to be refused. Officials also queried how Ibeawuchi, who provided the Home Office with his business registration certificate, derives an income from his business as a self-employed person. BKay Security has provided services to the former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan, senior UK and US politicians, celebrities and international footballers including Alex Iwobi, the former Arsenal and Everton player who currently plays for Fulham andNigeria. It wasreportedlast month that the government was planning to clamp down on visa applications for people from several countries, including Nigeria. Beales said: “There’s no doubt that the UK government refused these visa applications as part of their overtly racist crackdown on Nigerians. “Samuel and his wife both run successful businesses in Nigeria and have no interest in remaining here after visiting my family, and had we applied for their visas a year ago I have no doubt they’d have been granted. It sadly says a lot though when the Labour party is even more hostile to families such as ours than their Conservative predecessors.” Ibeawuchi said he was very disappointed that the Home Office was barring him and his family from coming to the UK. “I feel very bad that the Home Office refused us. I really wanted to take my family to the UK for a visit and we submitted all the necessary documents and photos of the two families spending time together. “We do not want to stay in the UK, just to come here to visit our family for three weeks.” Ibeawuchi-Beales said: “Our two kids were so excited for their little cousin, aunty and uncle to visit and had already planned all the things they wanted to show them in London. How do we explain to them that the UK government won’t let their family visit them because they’ve decided to target Nigerians like their mother? Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “I’ve previously sponsored several family members and all have come and gone without any problems. My brother would without question not stay here after his family holiday. I don’t believe the invite letter we provided to the Home Office was even read by the person who refused the applications.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Each application is assessed on its individual merits, based strictly on the evidence provided and in accordance with detailed guidance for decision-makers. If an application is refused, the reasons are clearly explained.” According to Home Office sources those whose visit visas have been refused can reapply addressing the concerns in the refusal notice.

    "article_text": "Smoke fromwildfires in Canadais spreading across multiple states in the US including the eastern seaboard, prompting multiple states to issue air-quality alerts. The poor air quality stretching across the US came as a result of dozens of wildfiresburning across Canadaas the country’s annualwildfireseason roars into destructive action. The fires, which have been sparked by bothhumans and natural causes, have prompted at least 25,000 residents in three Canadian provinces to evacuate in recent days. On Wednesday afternoon, a map from the US Environmental Protection Agency’sAirNow forecastshowed large swaths of moderate to unhealthy air quality across the east, midwest and southern parts of the US, featuring smoke and dust. Also on Wednesday, the New York state department of environmental conservationissuedan air-quality advisory from 11am to 11pm for multiple counties including parts of New York City. New York officials recommended that individuals consider limiting strenuous outdoor physical activity to reduce the risk of adverse health effects. Officials also said that people who may be especially sensitive to the effects of elevated levels of pollutants include the very young and those with pre-existing respiratory issues. Similarly, New Jersey’s department of environmental protectionissueda code orange air-quality alert for the multiple parts of the state on Wednesday. A code orange air-quality alert means that air pollution concentrations within the region may become unhealthy for sensitive groups including children, elderly people, and people with asthma, heart and lung diseases. Meanwhile, the Iowa department of natural resourcesissueda statewide air-quality alert on Tuesday that is set to last until Thursday. The department warned that intermittent thick smoke can be expected over the state. In New Hampshire, officialsdeclaredan air-quality action day on Tuesday, and in Maine, the state’s department of environmental protectionissuedan air-quality alert from 11am Wednesday to 11pm Thursday. It said people can be active outdoors but symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, throat irritation or an uncomfortable sensation in the chest should prompt them to limit their outdoor activities.",

    "article_text": "An Indigenous lawyer from the state of Oaxaca is set to become the president of Mexico’s supreme court following the country’sunprecedented elections to appoint its entire judicial system by popular vote. Activists hailed the election of Hugo Aguilar, a member of the Mixtec Indigenous group, as a symbolic victory – while noting that Aguilar, who topped the poll of candidates for the supreme court, had long since shifted from his own roots as an activist to a figure much more closely aligned with the state, and involved in controversial mega-projects such as theMaya Train. “[Aguilar] is a brilliant lawyer,”wroteJoaquín Galván, a defender of Indigenous rights in Oaxaca, on X. “But while they say we the Indigenous are represented in him, in reality he has spent almost 20 years operating for the government, not for [Indigenous] peoples.” Sunday’s vote was the result of a radical reform by the governing Morena party, which said it wouldreduce corruption and impunityin the judicial system by making it more responsive to popular opinion. But the concept was challenged by critics who said it would destroy the separation of powers and could flood the judicial system with unqualified candidates backed by opaque interests. Many career judges chose not to run. Roughly 2,600 posts, from local magistrates to supreme court justices, were up for grabs. Given the sheer number of positions and candidates involved, critics had warned that a low turnout was likely. Parts of the opposition also called for a boycott. In the event, just 13% of Mexicans voted, a record low in a federal election. “The turnout was frankly meagre,” said Javier Martín Reyes, a constitutional law professor at Mexico’s Unam university. “The government has tried to argue that voters were demanding this reform. But this has been proven false.” Sheinbaum described the process as “a complete success”, adding: “Mexico is the most democratic country in the world.” There was evidence of illegal party interference in the elections through the distribution ofcheat sheetstelling people how to vote, largely with the names of the government’s favoured candidates. All nine of the new justices on the supreme court were included onsuch cheat sheets. Most have ties to the governing party, meaning it may no longer act as a check on Morena’s executive power, as it has in the past. Aguilar is among them, having served as a senior official at the National Institute for Indigenous Peoples during the government of Sheinbaum’s predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. One of Aguilar’s campaign promises was to promote justice for Indigenous communities and the environment – yet under López Obrador he coordinated consultations for mega-projects such as the Maya Train and the Interoceanic Corridor, a train-and-port system to connect trade between the Pacific and the Atlantic, that wereriddled with irregularities. Two other candidates with previous ties to Morena are María Ríos, who served as legal counsel to López Obrador when he was president, and Irving Espinosa, who was an adviser to Morena lawmakers. Three sitting justices who decided to run were all re-elected: Lenia Batres, Yasmín Esquivel and Loretta Ortiz. All three were initially nominated by López Obrador and have largely voted in favour of Morena governments. It is not certain how justices with past ties to Morena will vote, but if they band together they could give Sheinbaum a decisive majority on Mexico’s highest court. Even those with more independent profiles might fear to go against the executive, said Martín Reyes. “Morena and its allies have a supermajority – they can change the constitution at any moment, start political trials, remove [the justices’] immunity,” said Martín Reyes. “These people will live under the threat of sanction.” The National Electoral Institute will continue to release results over the next week, including for the powerful new disciplinary tribune, tasked with supervising judges, and the top electoral court. Preliminary resultssuggest Morena may have significant influence in the first of those, too. “These elections were a failure and a success,” said Martín Reyes. “A failure in terms of democratic participation – but a success in terms of political capture.”",

    "title": "Three Salvadorian ex-military convicted of 1982 killings of Dutch reporters",
    "article_text": "A former defense minister ofEl Salvadorand two retired colonels have been convicted of the 1982 killings of four Dutch journalists during the country’s civil war, a lawyer for families of the deceased said. A five-member jury sentenced the defendants, now in their 80s or 90s, to 15 years in prison after an 11-hour session on the first day of the trial on Tuesday. In a crime that shocked the world, Koos Koster, Jan Kuiper, Hans ter Laag and Joop Willemsen were killed while filming a television documentary. More than 75,000 people were killed in El Salvador’s 1980-1992 civil war pitting the US-backed military against leftist guerrillas. The Dutch reporters worked for IKON TV, a Dutch channel founded by several churches. The accused are General José Guillermo García, 91, former police colonel Francisco Antonio Morán, 93, and ex-infantry brigade commander Mario Reyes Mena, 85. None of them were in court for the trial, which was conducted with press and held in the northern city of Chalatenango. “The fight against impunity took a long time, but it was won,” the Dutch ambassador for all of Central America, Arjen van den Berg, said outside the courthouse. In 1993, a UN-sponsored Truth Commission found the journalists had walked into an ambush planned by Reyes, who lives in the United States, and with the knowledge of other officers. The Salvadorian supreme court approved an extradition request for Reyes in March, but there has been no progress so far. García and Morán are under police surveillance in a private hospital in San Salvador. The defendants had faced up to 30 years in prison but got less time because of their age and ill health, the lawyer Cruz said. The NGOs Fundación Comunicándonos and the Salvadorian Association for Human Rights hailed the trial as a “decisive step” in the search for truth and justice. “We trust that this trial sets a historic precedent in the fight against impunity,” they said in a joint statement. The case remained unresolved for decades after the presiding judge received threats in 1988, prompting her to seek refuge in Canada. It was reopened in 2018 after the supreme court declared an amnesty law for civil war crimes unconstitutional, but relatives of the victims still had to wait years for the main hearing. Evidence such as a statement from a former US military attache and a military expert’s report “directly points” to the defendants’ responsibility, said lawyer Pedro Cruz, who represents the victims’ families. Garcáa led the Armed Forces from 1979 to 1983, when the worst massacres perpetrated by the military took place.",

    "title": "World won’t forget Tiananmen Square, US and Taiwan say on 36th anniversary of massacre",
    "article_text": "The world will never forget theTiananmen Square massacre, the US secretary of state and Taiwan president have said on the 36th anniversary of the crackdown, which China’s government still tries to erase from domestic memory. There is no official death toll but activists believe hundreds, possibly thousands, were killed by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the streets around Tiananmen Square, Beijing’s central plaza, on 4 June 1989. “Today we commemorate the bravery of the Chinese people who were killed as they tried to exercise their fundamental freedoms, as well as those who continue to suffer persecution as they seek accountability and justice for the events of June 4, 1989,” saidMarco Rubio, the US’s top diplomat, in a statement. “The CCP [Chinese Communist party] actively tries to censor the facts, but the world will never forget.” Responding to Rubio’s remarks on Wednesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said: “Erroneous statements by the US side maliciously distort historical facts, deliberately attack China’s political system and developmental path, and seriously interfere in China’s internal affairs.” Separately,Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory, also praised the bravery of the Tiananmen Square protesters. “Authoritarian governments often choose to silence and forget history, while democratic societies choose to preserve the truth and refuse to forget those who gave their lives – and their dreams – to the idea of human rights,” said Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te. Ahead of the 1989 massacre, protesters had been gathering for weeks in the square to call for democratic reforms to the CCP. The student-led movement attracted worldwide attention, which turned to horror as tanks rolled into the square to clear the encampment. Several protesters were also killed ata smaller demonstration in Chengdu, a city in south-west China. The date of 4 June remains one of China’s strictest taboos, and the Chinese government employs extensive and increasingly sophisticated resources to censor any discussion or acknowledgment of it inside China. Internet censors scrub even the most obscure references to the date from online spaces, and activists in China are often put under increased surveillance or sent on enforced “holidays” away from Beijing. New research from human rights workers has found that the sensitive date also sees heightened transnational repression of Chinese government critics overseas by the government and its proxies. The report published on Wednesday byArticle 19, a human rights research and advocacy group, said that the Chinese government “has engaged in a systematic international campaign of transnational repression targeting protesters critical of the Chinese Communist party”, with Uyghurs, Tibetans and Hongkongers particularly likely to be affected. The report citedFreedom House researchin 2023, which found that China had been responsible for about 30% all recorded acts of physical transnational repression since 2014. “Protesters targeted by [transnational repression] frequently live in fear of surveillance; targeting; abduction and forced repatriation, especially around embassies and consulates; and ‘collective punishment’ retaliation against relatives still in China, which also leads people to cut ties with their family,” the report said. The Article 19 researchers found that, with Tiananmen Square vigils snuffed out in China, pro-CCP agents appear to be targeting commemorations in other parts of the world. In 2022, a replica of a statue known as the Pillar of Shame, by the Danish artist Jens Galschiøt, was vandalised in Taipei. The statue is designed to memorialise the people who died on 4 June 1989. The original was on display at the University of Hong Kong for 23 years before it was removed by university authorities in 2021. For many years, Hong Kong, and to a lesser extent Macau, were the only places on Chinese territory where the event could be commemorated. But since the 2019 pro-democracy protests and the ensuing crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, the annual 4 June vigil in Victoria Parkhas been banned. In recent years some high-profile activists have been prosecuted over attempts to mark the day. For the last three years a government-sponsored food carnival has been held on the site during the week of the anniversary. On Tuesday there was a heavy police presence in Causeway Bay, near the park, Hong Kong Free Press reported. A performance artist, Chan Mei-tung, was stopped and searched, and later escorted from the area by police. She was standing on the road chewing gum, according to the outlet. In 2022 Chan was arrested after she stood in the same area peeling a potato. On Tuesday Hong Kong’s chief executive, John Lee, warned that any activity conducted on Wednesday must be “lawful”, but was not specific. A key criticism of Hong Kong’s national security laws are that they are broad and the proscribed crimes are ill-defined. One of the few groups of people in China who are still outspoken about the events of 36 years ago are the rapidly ageing “Tiananmen Mothers”, parents of young people killed in the massacre, who have called for an official reckoning. One of the founding members, 88-year-old Zhang Xianling, gave a rare interview this year with Radio Free Asia, saying that she still lives under close surveillance. Zhangsaid: “I don’t know why they are so afraid of me. I am 88 years old and I have to use a wheelchair if I can’t walk 200 metres. Am I that scary?” Earlier this week Li Xiaoming, an ex-PLA officer who has lived in Australia for 25 years, gave an interviewto Taiwan media, about his involvement at the Tiananmen crackdown as a junior soldier. Li said he was compelled to talk “as a warning to the world”, and also toTaiwan which is facing the threat of Chinese annexation. “Although the CCP leadership sees the 4 June incident as something shameful, what they learned from it is the need for strict control – eliminating any sign of unrest early on, controlling and blocking public opinion, and brainwashing to people. They work to crush all instability at the earliest stage,” he said according to Channel News Asia’s translation. Additional reporting by Oliver Holmes",

    "title": "Vietnam scraps two-child policy as it tackles falling birthrate",
    "article_text": "Vietnam has scrapped a longstanding policy limiting families to two children, as the communist-run country grapples with a declining birthrate. State media announced on Wednesday that couples could make their own decisions about how many children to have, and how much time to wait between births, reversing a decades-old preference for one- or two-child families. The promotion of two-child families dates back to the 1960s in communist North Vietnam, though this policy was further developed in the reunified Vietnam in the 1980s and 1990s, including through the country’s first decree on family planning in 1988. The two-child policy was not universally enforced, though members of the Communist party could face sanctions. Authorities are now searching for ways to boost families, as Vietnam’s birthrate fell to a record low of 1.91 children per woman in 2024, which is below replacement level. Officials fear the trend could lead to an ageing society, creating labour shortages, putting pressure on social welfare systems and threatening the country’s economic growth plans. Birthrates are especially low in urban centres, such as Ho Chi Minh City, where the rising cost of living was identified as barrier for young families. Its birthrate fell to 1.32 in 2023. Local provinces are offering various rewards and subsidies to encourage couples to have children. This includes certificates of merit and a financial reward of about 1m dong (£28) for women who have two children before the age of 35. Some provinces, such as Tien Giang in southern Vietnam, were also giving 30m dong to communes and wards in which 60% of couples of childbearing age had two children across three consecutive years, state media reported. Birthrates in the province are still falling, however. The national birthrate of 1.91 children per woman recorded in 2024 was down from 2.11 children per woman in 2021, 2.01 in 2022 and 1.96 in 2023. Neighbouring countries, such as Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia, have similar trends. In Japan, the government released figures on Wednesday showing the number of births in 2024 had fallen below 700,000 for the first time on record. Vietnam appeared to relax its two-child policy in 2003, but this wasreversed in 2008. Vietnam is also trying to tackle an imbalance in its sex ratio, driven by a historical preference for boys. On Tuesday the ministry of health proposed tripling a current fine to $3,800 “to curb foetal gender selection”, according to state media. The gender ratio at birth, though improved, remains skewed at 112 boys for every 100 girls.China ended its strict“one-child policy”in 2016 and in 2021 permitted couples to have three children, though its population fell for the third year running in 2024.

    "title": "Kremlin and Trump aides raise nuclear war fears after Ukraine drone strike",
    "article_text": "AsVladimir Putinpledges to retaliate against Ukraine for last weekend’sunprecedented drone attack, Kremlin advisers and figures aroundDonald Trumphave told the US president that the risk of a nuclear confrontation is growing, in an attempt to pressure him to further reduce US support forUkraine. Kirill Dmitriev, the head ofRussia’s sovereign wealth fund and an important intermediary between the Kremlin and Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff, called the Ukrainian drone strike an attack on “Russian nuclear assets”, and echoed remarks from Maga-friendly figures warning of the potential for a third world war. “Clear communication is urgent – to grasp reality and the rising risks before it’s too late,” Dmitriev wrote, adding a dove emoji. Ukraine claimed that the strike damaged more than 40 Russian planes, including Tu-95 and Tu-22M heavy bombers that have been used to launch cruise missiles at Ukrainian cities throughout the war, killing thousands and damaging crucial infrastructure that delivers heat and electricity to millions more. But those planes can also carry weapons armed with nuclear warheads, and are part of a nuclear triad along with submarine and silo-based missiles that form the basis for a system of deterrence betweenRussiaand the United States. After a phone call between the two leaders on Wednesday, Trump said: “President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.” Ukraine voluntarily gave up its nuclear weapons in 1994, in return for security assurances from the US, the UK and Russia. Those skeptical of US support for Ukraine are seizing on the risks of a nuclear confrontation to argue that the conflict could possibly spin out of control. Maga (Make America great again) influencers such asSteve Bannonand Charlie Kirk have openly condemned the drone attack, with Bannon likening the strike to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor and Kirk writing: “Most people aren’t paying attention, but we’re closer to nuclear war than we’ve been since this began in 2022.” But more centrist advisers within the Trump camp – including some who have closer links to Ukraine – are also warning that the risks of a nuclear conflict are growing as they seek to maintain Trump’s interest in brokering a peace. “The risk levels are going way up,” Keith Kellogg, Trump’s envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told Fox News. “When you attack an opponent’s part of their [nuclear] triad, your risk level goes up because you don’t know what the other side is going to do. And that’s what they did.” Kellogg also repeated rumours that Ukraine had struck the Russian nuclear fleet at Severomorsk, although reports of an explosion there have not been confirmed. He said the US was “trying to avoid” an escalation. Other current and former members of the administration skeptical of US support for Ukraine have also vocally opposed the drone strikes. “It is not in America’s interest for Ukraine to be attacking Russia’s strategic nuclear forces the day before another round of peace talks,” said Dan Caldwell, an influential foreign policy adviser who was a senior aide to Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon until he was purged amid a leaking scandal last month. “This has the potential to be highly escalatory and raises the risk of direct confrontation between Russia and Nato,” he said. “US should not only distance itself from this attack but end any support that could directly or indirectly enable attacks against Russian strategic nuclear forces.” It is not the first time that concerns over Russia’s use of a nuclear weapon have been used to try to temper US support for Ukraine. As Moscow’s forces were routed near Kharkiv and in the south at Kherson in September 2022, Russian officials sent signals that the Kremlin was considering using a battlefield nuclear weapon, senior Biden officials have said. National security officials said they believed that if the Russian lines collapsed and left open the potential for a Ukrainian attack on Crimea, then there was a 50% chance that Russia would use a nuclear weapon as a result. Ukrainian officials have responded by saying that Russia has embellished its threats of a nuclear attack in order to blackmail the US from giving greater support to Ukraine.",

    "title": "Putin tells Trump Russia ‘will have to respond’ to Ukraine drone attack",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumpspoke withVladimir Putinfor more than an hour on Wednesday, but he conceded the talks would not lead “to immediate peace” in Ukraine, and warned that Russia would respond toUkraine’s successful attacks this week on its airfields. The US president, who repeatedly claimed he could end theUkrainewar in 24 hours during his election campaign, did not attempt to discourage the Russian leader from retaliation, according to his description of the discussion on his Truth Social platform. He noted instead that Putin had offered to participate in US talks withIranabout its nuclear programme, which Trump claimed Tehran had been “slowwalking”. The programme has expanded considerably since 2018, when Trump withdrew from a multilateral agreement to constrain it in exchange for sanctions relief. In separate remarks on Wednesday, Putin once again ruled out a comprehensive ceasefire in Ukraine, claiming it would just give Kyiv time to regroup and rearm, while Ukraine’sVolodymyr Zelenskyydescribed Moscow’s peace proposals presented earlier this week as nothing more than an “ultimatum”. The comments from both leaders confirmednegotiations in Istanbul on Mondayhad made no headway towards a truce, but the two sides signalled progress on other issues, including the transfer of captives and bodies. Russia said it was “working” on the return of more than 300 Ukrainian children who the Kyiv government and the international criminal court (ICC) say were abducted by invading forces. It also confirmed there would be a prisoner exchange in the coming days, and there were continuing discussions on plans to repatriate thousands of bodies of fallen soldiers from both sides. Zelenskyy said he expected 500 PoWs to be swapped this weekend, but he said that the broader peace proposal put forward by Russia in Istanbul amounted to “an ultimatum from the Russian side to us”. Immediately after Monday’s meeting, Ukrainian officials said they needed more time to study the document handed over by the Russians, but press reports at the time said that it simply restated Russia’s maximalist demand that Ukrainian forces withdraw from four regions under partial Russian occupation. Putin stated his position on Wednesday in the form of a televised virtual meeting with his aides. After being informed that Ukraine had proposed an unconditional ceasefire of 30 to 60 days, Putin asked: “Why reward them by giving them a break from the combat, which will be used to pump the regime with western arms, to continue their forced mobilisation and to prepare different terrorist acts?” He pointed to recent Ukrainian attacks on bridges inside Russia,one of which helped cause a train crash that killed seven people. On Sunday, Ukraine also carried out aremote-controlled mass drone attackon four Russian airfields, which Kyiv claims knocked out more than a third of Moscow’s heavy bombers capable of firing cruise missiles. Ukrainian officials said 41 Russian warplanes, including strategic bombers and other types of combat aircraft, were destroyed or damaged in Sunday’s operation, which they claimed had taken 18 months to plan. On Wednesday, they released additional drone footage of the attack, codenamed Operation Spiderweb. Satellite photos analysed and published by the Associated Press showed aircraft wreckage and scorched areas at Belaya base, one of the four airfields targeted. It said the images showed at least three Tu-95 and four Tu-22M bombers – both capable of firing cruise missiles – had been destroyed on the runway. Other aircraft at the base appeared unscathed. In his Truth Social post, Trump said the drone attacks on Russian airfields had come up in his hour-and-15-minute conversation with Putin on Wednesday. “We discussed the attack on Russia’s docked airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides,” Trump said. “It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.” Trump told Putin that Ukraine did not inform him before the drone attacks, a Kremlin spokesperson said. Putin also spoke on Wednesday to Pope Leo XIV, in the US-born pontiff’s first call to the Russian leader since he became head of the world’s Catholics last month. The Vatican said in a statement that during the call, “the pope made an appeal for Russia to make a gesture that favours peace”. Before the Istanbul talks, Russia stepped up its aerial attacks on cities, and pushed further into Ukraine’s northern region of Sumy, seizing more than 150 sq km (58 sq miles) of the area in less than two weeks, according to Russian claims and Ukrainian open-source mapping. During his election campaign, Trump claimed more than 50 times he could end the Ukraine conflict within a day, but his comments on Wednesday did not involve any calls for restraint. While Putin has ruled out a comprehensive ceasefire, Russia has suggested two- to three-day local truces on different parts of the frontline, to allow the opposing armies to collect their dead, a proposal Moscow says Kyiv has rejected. However, both sides showed on Wednesday they were ready to continue with the exchange of PoWs, the bodies of dead soldiers, and to offer some cooperation on Kyiv’s priority, the return of Ukrainian children. In the televised government meeting on Wednesday, the chief Russian negotiator in Istanbul, Vladimir Medinsky, said Russia was “working” on the return of Ukrainian children, noting that Kyiv had presented a list of 339 of them. Russia has claimed Ukrainian children were taken to Russia for their safety, while Kyiv insisted they had been abducted. The Ukrainian view was underpinned by the ICC, whichissued arrest warrantsin March 2023 for Putin and his “commissioner for children’s rights”, Maria Lvova-Belova, for their role in the “unlawful deportation” of the Ukrainian children. After the Istanbul meeting, Zelenskyy said the Ukrainian delegation had handed the Russians a list of nearly 400 names of abducted Ukrainian children, but claimed that Russia had only offered to resolve the cases of 10 of them. After Monday’s talks, Turkey’s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, announced he wanted to host a Putin-Zelenskyy summit also involving Trump. Zelenskyy has been challenging his Russian counterpart to meet him face to face for some months. “We are ready for such a meeting any day,” the Ukrainian leader said on Wednesday, adding it was “pointless” to hold further talks with the midlevel Russian delegates Putin has sent to the talks – who Zelenskyy has previously dismissed as “empty heads” – since they were not empowered to agree a ceasefire. Putin maintained his opposition to a personal meeting with Zelenskyy, however, on the grounds of the recent attacks on railways in the Kursk and Bryansk border regions, which he described as “terrorist acts”. “How can any such [summit] meetings be conducted in such circumstances? What shall we talk about?” Putin asked in his video call with his officials. Since Trump’s return to the White House in January, European capitals have sought to take more of a leading role in bolstering Ukraine’s defence, and on Wednesday, a series of military industrial support measures were announced at a meeting of the 52-country strong Ukraine Defense Contact Group at Nato headquarters in Brussels, chaired jointly by the UK and Germany.",

    "title": "Hungary postpones vote on law to curb foreign-funded organisations",
    "article_text": "Hungary’s ruling party has postponed a planned vote on draft legislation aimed at organisations that receive foreign funding, following weeks of protests and warnings that the law would “starve and strangle” civil society and independent media. Viktor Orbán’s rightwing populist party, Fidesz,put forward legislationlast month that would allow the government to monitor, penalise and potentially ban organisations that receive any sort of foreign funding, including donations or EU grants. Any organisation could be targeted if it was deemed to “threaten the sovereignty ofHungaryby using foreign funding to influence public life”. The parliamentary vote had been expected to take place in mid-June. Despite critics likening the legislation to Russia’s “foreign agent” law, it was forecast to be passed by parliament as Fidesz holds a two-thirds majority. But on Wednesday, Fidesz’ parliamentary party leader, Mâté Kocsis, told local media that the vote would be postponed until autumn as the government had received several suggestions regarding the law. “We are united in our intentions, but there is still debate about the means,” he added on social media. Civil rights organisations celebrated the delay, with Amnesty International calling it a “huge joint success”. “Of course, we can only rest easy once this unlawful bill has been scrapped for good,” the group said on social media. “Unfortunately, one thing is certain: the government will not give up its attempts to silence independent voices, as has been its goal since 2010.” Previously, Zoltán Kovács, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government,had saidthe bill had been introduced amid worries that foreign-funded organisations, primarily from the US and Brussels, were shaping the country’s political discourse. The legislation takes a broad view of what constitutes a threat, describing it as acts undermining Hungary’s constitutional identity or Christian culture or challenging the primacy of marriage, the family and biological sexes. The proposal was swiftly slammed by opposition politicians, who said it would allow the government to potentially shut down all independent media and NGOs engaged in public affairs, while Transparency International described it as a “dark turning point” for Hungary. “It is designed to crush dissent, silence civil society, and dismantle the pillars of democracy,” the organisation noted. The warning was echoed by the Hungarian Helsinki Committee. “If this bill passes, it will not simply marginalise Hungary’s independent voices – it will extinguish them,” co-chair Márta Pardavisaid in a statementthat described the draft law as “Operation Starve and Strangle”. Scores of Hungarians took to the streets in protest while more than 90 editors-in-chief and publishers from across Europe, including from the Guardian, Libération in France and Gazeta Wyborcza in Poland,called on the EUto take action. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion The bill pushed by Orbán – who is facing anunprecedented challengefrom a former member of the Fidesz elite,Péter Magyar, ahead of elections next spring – has been described as one of his government’s boldest to date. “Its aim is to silence all critical voices and eliminate what remains of Hungarian democracy once and for all,” a joint statement, signed by more than 300 civil society and media organisations, recently noted. Magyar was quick to respond to the delayed vote, saying on social media that it would allow the government to “squeeze even more” out of the proposed bill and “further divert attention from … the livelihood and housing crisis, Orbán’s galloping inflation and the destruction of education”. The introduction of the draft law in Hungary’s parliament had marked an “escalation” in the government’s years of democratic backsliding, said Veronika Móra, the director of the Ökotárs-Hungarian Environmental Partnership Foundation. Many in the country’s steadily shrinking civic space had been left rattled by the proposed law and reeling from the uncertainty of what comes next. “And we’ve already felt the chilling effects, especially smaller, weaker organisations who were really frightened by the draft law and the potential consequences,” she said. “So even if it’s not passed – which would be great – it’s already had an impact.”",

    "title": "France plans to begin intercepting small boats at sea, says UK Home Office",
    "article_text": "The French government plans to begin intercepting small boats carrying asylum seekers even if they are already at sea, aHome Officesource has said. In a move that NGOs claim will endanger lives, it was claimed that French officials agreed this week to draw up plans to begin intervening in waters close to beaches and inland canals. A Home Office source said the plan was intended to clamp down on boats that “taxi” up to French beaches from nearby waterways. “The French have said this week they will intervene to tackle the taxi boats which are operating inland and near to French beaches to help prevent these dangerous crossings,” the source said. Keir Starmer is attempting to fight off a growing challenge from Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, andLabourparty officials are convinced that rising irregular immigration numbers will be a key issue in future elections. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, expressed her concern on Monday that French officials were not intercepting boats at sea “as swiftly as possible” after a record 1,195 people reached the UK in 19 small boats on Saturday. It took the total number of such arrivals so far this year to 14,812, the highest on record. It was reported that French officials stopped fewer than 200 people from making the journey, but Home Office sources said French authorities had intervened to stop nearly 500 people trying to get into small boats on that day. There was footage of a gendarmes looking on from the beach as people attempting to reach the UK ran into the water and climbed onboard small boats. Current guidelines prevent French police from intervening offshore unless it is to rescue passengers in distress. In practice, the policy means officers can stop boats leaving the beach by puncturing them, but are restricted once they are in the water. In February, Bruno Retailleau, the French interior minister, said he wanted a change to the rules to enable officers to intervene in the water up to 300 metres from the coast. “We have to review our organisation so that we can board these boats … arriving to pick up migrants,” he said. Le Figaro newspaper reported earlier this year that ministry officials were still working on what were being termed the “feet in the water” guidelines to implement the policy. However, the French maritime daily newspaper Le Marin said the proposed change of rules had been opposed by local police officers. Cooper has said she wants French border police to intercept the taxi boats not only in the shallow waters as they leave the beaches but also when they make their way from rivers and inland waterways to pick up people on the beach. With heatwaves forecast this summer, there are concerns still larger numbers of people will attempt the perilous crossing. Traffickers have circumvented rules by asking asylum seekers to wade waist-high into the Channel, where they are picked up by dinghies that were launched from inland canals. French government sourcestold the Telegraphon Wednesday that ministers overseeing migration policy had given the green light to stopping boats in the water while respecting the law of the sea. It is understood that the French authorities have said they will draw up plans to intercept boats in shallow waters within weeks. Cooper is also planning a new law to fast-track the removal of asylum seekers who arrivefrom countries deemed to be safe. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion A Home Office analysis released on Wednesday morning claimed that the record numbers of people arriving in the UK via small boats could be attributed to favourable weather and greater numbers being crammed into vessels. Figures show there were twice as many “red days” – when there are calmer conditions in the Channel, meaning crossings are more likely – in the first four months of this year as there were in the same period in 2024. In the year to April, 47% of boats crossing the Channel had 60 or more people onboard, compared with 2% in the year to April 2022. The Migration Observatory at Oxford University challenged the Home Office analysis, saying there was no evidence that weather was a major factor in long-term increases in arrivals. Priti Patel, then Tory home secretary, attempted to draw up plans for UK and French officers to intervene at sea in 2021, but her French counterpart said thatFrancewould not accept any practices contrary to the law of the sea. The plans were eventually shelved. Responding to the latest plans, Steve Smith, the chief executive of Care4Calais, said the plan would cost more lives at sea as gangs and asylum seekers took greater risks to reach the UK. “Last year saw a record number of refugees lose their lives on our border, and still our political leaders risk more deaths rather than create safe routes to claim asylum,” he said. “Interceptions in the sea, like the last Tory government’s failed attempt to implement pushbacks, have never been tried because they put lives at risk, and are most likely illegal. Like all the other so-called deterrents, and failed security initiatives, this is doomed to fail, but it will cost lives along the way.”",

    "title": "US vetoes resolution for unconditional Gaza ceasefire at UN security council",
    "article_text": "The United States has vetoed aUnited Nationssecurity council resolution calling for an “immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire” in Gaza while the 14 remaining countries on the council voted in favour. The vetoed resolution also called the situation inGaza“catastrophic”, and demanded the “immediate and unconditional lifting of all restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza and its safe and unhindered distribution at scale, including by the UN and humanitarian partners”. It was the fifth time that the US has vetoed a security council draft ceasefire resolution in order to protect Israel. Washington vetoed a similar resolution in November, under the Biden administration, on the grounds that the ceasefire demand wasnot directly linked to the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas. The text was co-sponsored by Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, South Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, and Somalia. Russia, China, France and the UK also voted in favour. “The Council was prevented from shouldering its responsibility, despite the fact that most of us seem to be converging on one view,” said France’s ambassador to the UN Jerome Bonnafont. “Today, the United States sent a strong message by vetoing a counterproductive UN Security Council resolution on Gaza targetingIsrael,” US secretary of state Marco Rubio said in a statement after the vote. He said Washington would not support any text that “draws a false equivalence between Israel and Hamas, or disregards Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States will continue to stand with Israel at the UN.” Israel also welcomed the US veto. “I thank @POTUS and the U.S. administration for standing shoulder to shoulder with Israel and vetoing this one-sided resolution in the UN Security Council,” wrote Gideon Saar, Israel’s minister of foreign affairs. “The proposed resolution only strengthens Hamas and undermines American efforts to achieve a hostage deal.” The UK supported the resolution. In a statement, its ambassador, Barbara Woodward, called Israel’s new aid system “inhumane” and said that Israel “needs to end its restrictions on aid now”. “This Israeli government’s decisions to expand its military operations in Gaza and severely restrict aid are unjustifiable, disproportionate and counterproductive,” she said. “And the UK completely opposes them.” Other security council members criticised the US for the veto. Pakistan’s ambassador to the UN said the failed resolution would “remain not only a moral stain on the conscience of this council, but a fateful moment of political application that will reverberate for generations.” China’s ambassador to the UN Fu Cong said: “today’s vote result once again exposes that the root cause of the council’s inability to quell the conflict in Gaza is the repeated obstruction by the US.” The resolution was put up for a vote as the UN and aid agencies have warned of famine conditions in Gaza after a protracted embargo on aid and the shambolic rollout of a US- and Israeli-backed scheme called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). “The world is watching, day after day, horrifying scenes of Palestinians being shot, wounded or killed in Gaza while simply trying to eat,” said the UN relief chief, Tom Fletcher, on Wednesday. GHF, which has murky political backing and funding, announced that itsdistribution centres in Gaza would remain closed for a second day on Thursday morning. At least 27 people were killed and hundreds injured on Tuesday by Israeli fire as they waited for food at a GHF distribution point. Woodward, the UK permanent representative to the UN, voiced support for a UN call for “an immediate and independent investigation into these events and for perpetrators to be held accountable”. “Israel needs to end its restrictions on aid now: let the UN and humanitarians do their job to save lives, reduce suffering and maintain dignity,” she said.",

    "title": "Gaza food hub stops operations for second day as access routes remain ‘combat zones’",
    "article_text": "A US-backed group operating food distribution sites in Gaza has announced that its operations would be suspended for a second day on Thursday, due to “maintenance and repair work”, as the Israeli army warned that roads leading to distribution centres were considered “combat zones”. After Israeli troops opened fire on a crowd of Palestinians,killing at least 27and injuring hundreds, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) pressed Israel to improve civilian safety beyond the perimeter of its distribution sites. GHF initially said its operations would be suspended for a single day, but after security talks with the Israeli army on Wednesday, the group posted a message on social media, saying operations would not resume on Thursday. “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is working to make the distribution of food boxes as safe as possible, despite the difficult circumstances. We strongly urge all those heading to our locations to follow the routes set by the IDF to ensure safe passage,” it said. It did not give any further details. The GHF had previously said it had asked the Israeli military to “guide foot traffic in a way that minimises confusion or escalation risks” near military perimeters, develop clearer guidance for civilians and enhance training to support civilian safety. “Our top priority remains ensuring the safety and dignity of civilians receiving aid,” said a GHF spokesperson. An Israeli military spokesperson warned civilians against moving in areas leading to GHF sites on Wednesday, deeming them “combat zones”. The previous day, GHF announced that its distribution points would be closed on Wednesday for “update, organisation and efficiency improvement work”. The killing of the 27 or more Palestinians was the third such shooting in three days, and Israel admitted on Tuesday for the first time that its forces shot at Palestinians. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops fired shots near a food distribution complex after noticing “a number of suspects moving towards them”. “The forces fired evasive shots, and after they did not move away, additional shots were fired near the individual suspects who were advancing towards the forces. The individuals were moving towards forces in a way that posed a threat to them,” the military said, without specifying who the suspects were. A spokesperson for the GHF, which has taken over the distribution of food in Gaza and is backed by Israel, told the Associated Press that the group “was saddened to learn that a number of civilians were injured and killed after moving beyond the designated safe corridor”. The shooting occurred at the same site where on Sunday more than30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli firewhile they were heading to the distribution hub. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, said the “deadly attacks” on civilians around food distribution points was a war crime. “Deadly attacks on distraught civilians trying to access the paltry amounts of food aid in Gaza are unconscionable,” Türk said. “Attacks directed against civilians constitute a grave breach of international law and a war crime.” Witnesses told the Guardian that the shooting started in the city’s Flag Roundabout area, about a kilometre from the food distribution hub. Fadi Abu Mohammad, 43, said his relative Mohammad Abu Shamala, 22, was killed near the food distribution site. “When gunfire opened on the civilians, he was struck by a bullet in the back and died instantly,” Fadi said. “He was supposed to get married next month. Going back to the aid distribution is a huge risk and a potential death sentence, but everyone who went had no other choice. If they aren’t killed by bullets or shelling, they will die of hunger.” Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, claiming Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters. The group denies this and aid officials in Gaza havedenied there is evidenceof any widespread diversion of supplies at any stage of the conflict. In May a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the Strip faced starvation. The GHF took over the handling of food relief despite objections from the UN and other humanitarian organisations, which criticised the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, and that it allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population. On Tuesday, an evangelical leader and adviser to Donald Trump on interfaith issues was appointed as thenew head of the GHF. Johnnie Moore, a member of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and founder of the boutique advisory firm Kairos Company, replaced Jake Wood, a former marine, who resigned saying hecould not guarantee the GHF’s independencefrom Israeli interests. Coverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war. Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza. Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over160 killedsince the conflict began. The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”. Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government. To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises. Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondent Moore has been a vocal defender of the GHF and has bristled at public criticism of the rollout, telling the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on X that reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking food supplies in Gaza were “a lie … spread by terrorists”. The UN security council is expected to vote on Wednesday on a demand for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and humanitarian access across Gaza, where malnutrition is widespread and food relief has only trickled in since Israel lifted an 11-week blockade in late May. “It is unacceptable. Civilians are risking – and in several instances losing – their lives just trying to get food,” a UN spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said on Tuesday, adding that the food distribution model backed by the US and Israel was “a recipe for disaster, which is exactly what is going on”. At least 48 people were killed by Israeli bombardment across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, including 14 in a single strike on a tent sheltering displaced people, the civil defence agency said. Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Reuters contributed to this report",

    "title": "Keir Starmer calls Israel’s recent actions in Gaza ‘appalling and intolerable’",
    "article_text": "Keir Starmer has called Israel’srecent actions in Gaza“appalling, counterproductive and intolerable”, as the UK government comes under mounting pressure to take stronger action after the killings of dozens of civilians at food points in recent days. The prime minister told MPs on Wednesday the UK was considering imposing sanctions on members of the Israeli government, but is so far resisting growing calls for a complete ban on arms sales and immediate recognition of Palestine. Starmer was speaking after several attacks at food distribution hubs in recent days left dozens of people dead and hundreds more injured. The attacks prompted British aid charities to step up calls for urgent humanitarian and political action, and the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) described conditions inGazaas “worse than hell on earth”. With protests taking place outside the Commons and growing unease from MPs inside it, Starmer said: “Israel’s recent action is appalling and, in my view, counterproductive and intolerable.” He added: “We will keep looking at further action, along with our allies, including sanctions, but let me be absolutely clear: we need to get back to a ceasefire, we need the hostages, who have been held for a very long time, to be released, and we desperately need more aid, at speed and at volume, into Gaza, because it is an appalling and intolerable situation.” The ICRC president, Mirjana Spoljaric, said what was happening in Gaza surpassed “any acceptable legal, moral and humane standard” that “humanity was failing” and that the Palestinian people had been “stripped of human dignity”. Oxfam UK said conditions in Gaza had reached a “level of inhumanity that is inconceivable in modern times”. It said there was a “massive disconnect” between public despair at events in Gaza and what it called the “complacency” of political leaders. Oxfam UK’s chief executive, Halima Begum, said: “It is beyond comprehension that aid distribution points should be turned into killing fields.” The Foreign Office minister Hamish Falconer said later on Wednesday that if Israel did not cease “the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in this place”. He added: “I will not say from the dispatch box today when that might be.” Falconer was confronted on Wednesday by angry MPs from multiple parties demanding stronger British action on sanctions, weapons sales and Palestinian recognition. Dozens ofLabourand Tory MPs have recently signed letters to the prime minister calling for Palestine to be recognised immediately but have so far not received a response. Paula Barker, a Labour backbencher, asked: “What more evidence do we need to call this exactly what it is – a deliberate policy of annexation and genocide?” Kit Malthouse, a Conservative MP, said: “We’re all, frankly, getting a bit fed up with the theatrics in this chamber. And, if I’m honest with the minister, it feels like the whole house is being played. He shows up, he mouths the words full of condemnation and being appalled, and very occasionally, the government leaks out just enough sanctions, frankly, I’m afraid, to keep the Labour benches from open revolt.” Malthouse’s Tory colleague Jeremy Wright added: “I now believe it’s necessary for the UK, hopefully, in conjunction with others, to recognise the state of Palestine. Why has it not yet?” The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn successfully passed a bill calling for an independent inquiry into British involvement in Israeli military action in Gaza. The inquiry is unlikely ever to happen, however, because the government will not support a substantive vote that would enable one to be set up. While MPs were debating in the Commons chamber, dozens of protesters gathered outside, one of whom was arrested after an altercation with a police officer at the gates of parliament. Falconer confirmed to MPs that the government was reconsidering its position on Palestinian statehood, and that ministers were open to the idea of immediate recognition. Government sources said one option wa to make an announcement at or after a UN conference later this month being hosted by France and Saudi Arabia to talk about a two-state solution. The government is keen to secure compromises in exchange, including an agreement by Hamas to leave Gaza entirely. On arms sales, ministers have already cancelled licences for many of the weapons Britain used to sell to Israel, saying it would only export “defensive” arms in the future. The Guardian revealed last month that British companies had managed to export thousands of military items to Israel, including munitions. Meanwhile, ministers are fighting a legal case to be allowed to continue making spare parts for American-made F-35s, which are used by Israel but also by many Nato allies. They argue that stopping such sales could harm other non-Israeli partners. The ICRC, which is in effect the guardian of the Geneva conventions governing the conduct of war, is carefully diplomatic in its dealings with warring parties and normally does not speak publicly about convention violations. However, Spoljaric told the BBC in an interview that Israel’s current actions in Gaza amounted to a “hollowing out” of international law and not enough was being done by to end the war, stop Palestinian suffering and release Israeli hostages. She highlighted the level of destruction and suffering in Gaza, and said the world was “watching a people being entirely stripped of its dignity” and this “should really shock our collective conscience”. She added: “State leaders are under an obligation to act. I’m calling on them to do something, and to do more, and do what they can, Because it will reverberate, it will haunt them, it will reach their doorsteps.” On Tuesdaythe ICRC reportedthat its Rafah field hospital in southern Gaza, which is close to a food distribution site, had received 184 patients in what it called a “mass casualty influx.” It said 19 patients were dead on arrival, the majority with gunshot wounds. Eight more died from their wounds.",

    "title": "Many of Dead Sea scrolls may be older than thought, experts say",
    "article_text": "Many of the Dead Sea scrolls could be older than previously thought, with some biblical texts dating from the time of their original authors, researchers say. The first of the ancient scrolls were discovered in the caves of Qumran in the Judean desert by Bedouin shepherds in the mid-20th century. The manuscripts range from legal documents to parts of the Hebrew Bible, and are thought to date from around the third century BCE to the second century CE. Now researchers have used artificial intelligence to glean fresh insights into the dates of individual scrolls – findings experts suggest could challenge ideas about when, where and by whom they were produced. “It’s like a time machine. So we can shake hands with these people from 2,000 years ago, and we can put them in time much better now, said Prof Mladen Popović, first author of the research from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. While some scrolls were radiocarbon dated in the 1990s, Popović said scholars did not tackle the problem of castor oil contamination – a substance applied in the 1950s to help experts read the manuscripts, but which could skew results. In addition, many of the scrolls had only been dated by handwriting analysis. Writing in the journal Plos One, the team report how they attempted radiocarbon dating of 30 samples from different manuscripts found at four sites and thought to span five centuries. Crucially, the team first cleaned the samples to remove the castor oil contamination. The researchers successfully radiocarbon-dated 27 samples, finding that while two were younger than handwriting analysis had suggested, many were older. Among other findings, the researchers discovered two different writing styles, known as Hasmonean and Herodian scripts, coexisted for a much longer period than previously thought, while a sample from a manuscript called 4Q114 – which contains verses from the book of Daniel – was older than traditional palaeography had suggested. “It was previously dated to the late second century BCE, a generation after the author of the Book of Daniel. Now, with our study we move back in time contemporary to that author,” said Popović. The team then used a type of AI known as machine learning to build a model they called Enoch – a nod to a biblical figure associated with scientific knowledge. The team trained Enoch by feeding it 62 digital images of ink traces from 24 of the radiocarbon dated manuscripts, together with the carbon-14 dates. They then verified the model by showing Enoch a further 13 images from the same manuscripts. In 85% of cases the model produced ages that tallied with the radiocarbon dates, and in many cases produced a smaller range of probable dates than obtained from radiocarbon dating alone. “What we have created is a very robust tool that is empirically based – based on physics and on geometry,” said Popović. When Enoch was presented with images from 135 undated manuscripts it had not previously seen, it realistically dated 79% of them – as judged by expert palaeographers. Popović added those deemed unrealistic might have had problematic data, such as poor quality images. The system has already produced new insights including that a copy of the biblical book Ecclesiastes dates from the time of the book’s presumed author. Popović said Enoch meant the age of further scrolls could now be uncovered without radiocarbon dating – a process that requires the destruction of small samples. “There are more than 1,000 Dead Sea scrolls manuscripts so our study is a first but significant step, opening a door unto history with new possibilities for research,” he said. Prof emerita Joan Taylor of King’s College London, said the results would have a major impact on Qumran studies. “These results mean that most of the manuscripts found in the caves near Qumran would not have been written at the site of Qumran, which was not occupied until later,” she said. However, Dr Matthew Collins of the University of Chester cautioned that radiocarbon dating only shed light on the age of the parchment, not when it was written on, while there were also questions about how stylistically representative the small number of training samples were for different periods in time. “Overall, this is an important and welcome study, and one which may provide us with a significant new tool in our armoury for dating these texts,” he said. “Nevertheless, it’s one that we should adopt with caution, and in careful conjunction with other evidence.”",

    "article_text": "‘Horrifying scenes’ of Palestinians being killed while trying to access food are result of ‘deliberate choices’, says Tom Fletcher, UN aid chief TheUN’s humanitarian chief said on Wednesday that recent “horrifying scenes” ofPalestiniansbeing killed while trying to access food aid were the result of “deliberate choices” to deprive them of essentials. “The world is watching, day after day, horrifying scenes of Palestinians being shot, wounded or killed inGazawhile simply trying to eat,” UN aid chiefTom Fletchersaid in a statement, adding: This is the outcome of a series of deliberate choices that have systematically deprived two million people of the essentials they need to survive. “No one should have to risk their life to feed their children,” said Fletcher. The UN has described the amount of aid allowed intoGaza, afterIsraelpartially lifted a more than two-month total blockade, as a trickle. “We must be allowed to do our jobs: we have the teams, the plan, the supplies and the experience,” said Fletcher, the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator. He added: Open the crossings – all of them. Let in life-saving aid at scale, from all directions. Lift the restrictions on what and how much aid we can bring in. Ensure our convoys aren’t held up by delays and denials. Release the hostages. Implement the ceasefire. It has just gone 6pm inGaza CityandTel Aviv. This blog will be closing shortly but you can find all the Guardian’sMiddle Eastcoveragehere. Here is a summary of the developments on today’s blog: The UN’s humanitarian chief said on Wednesday that recent “horrifying scenes” of Palestinians being killed while trying to access food aid were the result of “deliberate choices” to deprive them of essentials.“The world is watching, day after day, horrifying scenes of Palestinians being shot, wounded or killed inGazawhile simply trying to eat,” UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said in a statement, adding: “This is the outcome of a series of deliberate choices that have systematically deprived two million people of the essentials they need to survive.” Gaza is facing “dark days”, the UK prime minister has said, as he vowed to consider “further action” against Israel.On Wednesday, Keir Starmer described the Israeli government’s conduct in the 25 mile-long strip as “counterproductive and intolerable”. He added: “We will keep looking at further action along with our allies, including sanctions, but let me be absolutely clear: we need to get back to a ceasefire.” Starmer was also asked in the House of Commons whether he would repeat the position put forward by government lawyers that there is not a genocide taking place in Gaza, to which he replied: “I’ve said that we are strongly opposed and appalled by Israel’s recent actions, and have been absolutely clear in condemning them and calling them out, whether that’s the expansion of military operations, settler violence, or the dreadful blocking of aid, is completely unacceptable.” The UN security council will vote later today on a resolution calling for a ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access inGaza. It will be the first vote on the issue held by the council since November.The US is expected to exercise its veto to prevent the 15 nation body passing the resolution, as it did the last time the council voted on the subject ofIsraeland Gaza. Spain, which has strongly criticised Israel’s offensive in Gaza, has cancelled a contract to buy 168 firing posts and 1,680 anti-tank missiles from Israeli defence company Rafael, reported Spanish media. The deal was worth €287.5m ($327m), according to top-selling daily Spanish newspaper El País, which cited unnamed government sources. The equipment was to be manufactured in Spain under licence from Rafael. The UK has said Israel’s newly introduced measures for aid delivery in Gaza are “inhumane, foster desperation and endanger civilians”.Foreign Office minister Hamish Falconer described thekillings of Palestinians while trying to access aid sitesas “deeply disturbing” and called for and independent investigation into the incidents. The Gaza health ministry said on Wednesday that Israeli strikes had killed at least 95 Palestinians in the past 24 hours, including women and children at a school housing displaced families that was hit near the southern city of Khan Younis. “At least 12 people were killed, including several children and women, in a strike by an Israeli drone this morning on a tent for displaced persons” near Khan Younis, the agency’s spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told Agence France-Presse (AFP). The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced on Wednesday that a soldier had been killed in combat in the northernGazaStrip.Israel’s military said that 420 service personnel had been killed inside Gaza since its ground operation started on 27 October 2023. On TuesdayIsrael’s military warned residents of Gaza against travel in areas leading to the distribution centres, after at least 27 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire as they waited for food at the points set up by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said it had begun distributing drinking water with the support of the German Red Cross to displaced Palestinians in Gaza.In an update on Wednesday morning on X, PRCS said it had “launched an emergency campaign to provide desalinated water to the most vulnerable amid worsening shortages and an escalating humanitarian crisis”. Norway’s parliament on Wednesday rejected a proposal to have the country’s $1.9tn sovereign wealth fund divest from all companies with activities in the occupied Palestinian territories.“We have an established ethical regime for the fund,” finance minister Jens Stoltenberg told the chamber in a debate on several aspects of the way the fund is run before the vote. Israel’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that its arms exports hit an all-time high of more than $14.7bn in 2024, with a sharp rise in deals with Arab Gulf states, despite international criticism of Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza. TheBBC has defended its reporting on the war in Gaza and accused the White House of misrepresenting its journalismafter Donald Trump’s administration criticised its coverage of a fatal attack near a US-backed aid distribution site.SeniorBBCjournalists said the White House was political point-scoring after Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, accused the corporation of taking “the word of Hamas with total truth”. She also falsely claimed that the BBC had removed a story about the incident. An evangelical leader and adviser to Donald Trump on interfaith issues has been appointed thenew head of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Johnnie Moore, a member of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and founder of the boutique advisory firm Kairos Company, was appointed the new head of the GHF after Jake Wood, a former marine, resigned,saying that he could not guarantee the GHF’s independencefrom Israeli interests. Syrian authorities insisted on Wednesday they would “never be a threat” to anyone in the region, afterIsrael bombed the country’s southin retaliation for overnight rocket fire on the Golan Heights.Israeli defence minister Israel Katz held Syria’s leader “directly responsible”, while Syria condemned the Israeli shelling as a “blatant violation of Syrian sovereignty” that “aggravates tensions in the region”. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has detailed the harrowing account of one of its paramedics, who told the organisation he heard Israeli troops shoot first responders while they were still clinging to life.Asaad al-Nasasra, 47, was one of two first responders to survive the15 March attackon a convoy of emergency vehicles in which 15 other medics and rescue workers were killed. Iran’s supreme leader on Wednesday criticised an initial proposal from the US in negotiations over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear programme, though he stopped short of entirely rejecting the idea of agreement with Washington.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the US proposal as “100% against the idea of ‘we can’”, borrowing from an Iranian government slogan. He also said that Tehran needed to keep its ability to enrich uranium. BBC staff in London say their families are being “targeted and punished” by the Iranian regimeas it intensifies a campaign of intimidation against journalists and media outlets.There have been more than20 “threat-to-life” incidentsagainst people in the UK by Iran in recent years, according to the Metropolitan police counter-terrorism commander. Turkey is training and advising Syria’s armed forces and helping improve its defences, and has no immediate plans for the withdrawal or relocation of its troops stationed there, defence minister Yasar Guler told Reuters.In written answers to questions from the news agency, Guler said Turkey and Israel – which carried out its latest airstrikes on southern Syria late on Tuesday – are continuing de-confliction talks to avoid military accidents in the country. About 20 far-right protesters arrived at the Kerem Shalom crossing to block aid trucks from entering the Gaza Strip on Wednesday morning, Haaretz reported.The GHF announced on Tuesday that it would halt the limited food distribution operations permitted by Israeli authorities at centres in theGazaStrip for one day.

TheUN’s humanitarian chief said on Wednesday that recent “horrifying scenes” ofPalestiniansbeing killed while trying to access food aid were the result of “deliberate choices” to deprive them of essentials. “The world is watching, day after day, horrifying scenes of Palestinians being shot, wounded or killed inGazawhile simply trying to eat,” UN aid chiefTom Fletchersaid in a statement, adding: This is the outcome of a series of deliberate choices that have systematically deprived two million people of the essentials they need to survive. “No one should have to risk their life to feed their children,” said Fletcher. The UN has described the amount of aid allowed intoGaza, afterIsraelpartially lifted a more than two-month total blockade, as a trickle. “We must be allowed to do our jobs: we have the teams, the plan, the supplies and the experience,” said Fletcher, the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator. He added: Open the crossings – all of them. Let in life-saving aid at scale, from all directions. Lift the restrictions on what and how much aid we can bring in. Ensure our convoys aren’t held up by delays and denials. Release the hostages. Implement the ceasefire. Norway’s parliament on Wednesday rejected a proposal to have the country’s $1.9tn sovereign wealth fund divest from all companies with activities in theoccupied Palestinian territories. We reported on the story before the vote took place at 3pm local time (1pm GMT/2pm BST). You can read ithere. TheUKhas saidIsrael’s newly introduced measures for aid delivery inGazaare “inhumane, foster desperation and endanger civilians”. Foreign OfficeministerHamish Falconertold theHouse of Commons: We are appalled by repeated reports of mass casualty incidents in which Palestinians have been killed when trying to access aid sites in Gaza. Desperate civilians who have endured 20 months of war should never face the risk of death or injury to simply feed themselves and their families. We call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events for the perpetrators to be held to account. It is deeply disturbing that these incidents happened near the new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation distribution sites, they highlight the utterly desperate need to get aid in. The Israeli government says it has opened up aid access with its new system, but the warnings raised by the United Kingdom, United Nations, aid partners and the international community about these operations have materialised and the results are out. Israel’s newly introduced measures for aid delivery are inhumane, foster desperation and endanger civilians. Israel’s unjustified block on aid into Gaza needs to end – it is inhumane. Israel must immediately allow the United Nations and aid partners to safely deliver all types of aid at scale to save lives, reduce suffering and maintain dignity. Gazais facing “dark days”, theUKprime minister has said, as he vowed to consider “further action” againstIsrael. At the dispatch box,Keir Starmerdescribed the Israeli government’s conduct in the 25 mile-long strip as “counterproductive and intolerable”, reports the PA news agency. Leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party inNorthern IrelandClaire Hannaclaimed there was “more moral clarity coming from Ms Rachel on YouTube than there is from many world leaders who are complicit in silence”, referring to the children’s entertainer who has called on leaders to “be so ashamed” of what she described as their “anti-Palestinian racism”. Hanna asked theHouse of Commons: The prime minister said this week that Britain must be ready for war and, I ask, after tens of thousands of deaths, after a generation of Gazans stunted by hunger and trauma, when will it be ready for peace? When will it help to stop this genocide? When will it hold the Israeli government to account, and when will it recognise the state of Palestine? Starmer replied: She’s absolutely right to describe this as dark days. Israel’s recent action is appalling and in my view counterproductive and intolerable, and we have strongly opposed the expansion of military operations and settler violence, and the blocking of humanitarian aid. The prime minister added: You will have seen we’ve suspended the FTA [free trade agreement] talks and sanctioned extremists supporting violence in the West Bank. We will keep looking at further action along with our allies, including sanctions, but let me be absolutely clear: we need to get back to a ceasefire. We need the hostages who’ve been held for a very long time to be released, and we desperately need more aid at speed and at volume into Gaza, because it’s an appalling and intolerable situation. Several MPs wearing red badges, includingJohn McDonnell, the independent MP forHayes and Harlington, and Labour’s MPs forAlloa and GrangemouthandNottinghamEastBrian LeishmanandNadia Whittomesilently left the chamber after the exchange, reports the PA news agency. Liberal democrat leaderEd Daveyasked Starmer whether he would “push at the UN security council for humanitarian corridors to get the desperately needed aid urgently into Gaza”. He told the Commons: The US-Israeli programme is clearly failing and nothing short of lifting the full blockade on aid will do, but given the [Benjamin] Netanyahu government refuses to do that, will the prime minister take more decisive action today? Starmer replied that the government is “working at pace with our allies on that very issue, to take whatever measures we can to get that humanitarian aid in”. He gave Davet his “assurance we’ll continue to do that because that aid needs to get in at speed and at volume”. Israel’s defence ministrysaid on Wednesday that its arms exports hit an all-time high of more than $14.7bn in 2024, with a sharp rise in deals withArab Gulf states, despite international criticism of Israel’s ongoing war againstHamasinGaza. “Israel again reached an all-time peak in defence exports in 2024, marking the fourth consecutive record-breaking year in the scope of defence agreements,” the ministry, which oversees and approves the exports of Israel’s defence industries, said in a statement, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). On Sunday,at least 31 Palestinians were killedafter Israeli forces opened fire at a food distribution centre in Rafah, Gaza, according to witnesses. On Monday,another three Palestinians were killedby Israeli fire at the same site, according to health officials and a witness. And on Tuesday, 27 people were killed after Israeli forcesopened fire again, say Gaza officials. The incidents have intensified criticism of the new system for distributing supplies in Gaza, run by the Israeli- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) rather than by the UN or well-established aid organisations. The UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, said on Tuesday that Palestinians inGazanow faced an impossible choice: “Die from starvation or risk being killed while trying to access the meagre food that is being made available.” The attacks on civilians, he added, constituted a war crime. The Gaza health ministry said Israeli strikes had killed at least 95 Palestinians in the past 24 hours, including women and children at a school housing displaced families that was hit near the southern city of Khan Younis. It comes as Israel announced that one of its soldiers had died in the fighting after three deaths reported a day earlier, as its forces continued their months-long battle to eliminate Hamas militants and free the remaining hostages still held inGaza. TheUKprime minister has been asked whether he would repeat the position put forward by government lawyers that there is not a genocide taking place inGaza,reports the PA news agency. In a recent high court case challenging arms sales toIsrael, lawyers representing the government claimed there was no evidence of a genocide. Scottish National party (SNP)MPBrendan O’Hara(Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber) askedKeir Starmerwhether he would say that from the despatch box, asking during prime minister’s questions: The prime minister has repeatedly told this House that it is not for him or his government to determine what is and what is not a genocide. But that position is no longer tenable, because at the high court recently the prime minister instructed his lawyers to argue that in Gaza, and I quote ‘no genocide has occurred, or is occurring’. So the truth is, his government has made a determination. The question is, does he have the courage of his convictions and will he repeat from that despatch box what he told his lawyers to argue in the high court? Starmer replied: I’ve said that we are strongly opposed and appalled by Israel’s recent actions, and have been absolutely clear in condemning them and calling them out, whether that’s the expansion of military operations, settler violence, or the dreadful blocking of aid, is completely unacceptable. We must see a ceasefire, hostages must be released, and there must be aid into Gaza. BBCstaff inLondonsay their families are being “targeted and punished” by theIranianregime as it intensifies a campaign of intimidation against journalists and media outlets. There have been more than20 “threat-to-life” incidentsagainst people in theUKby Iran in recent years, according to theMetropolitan policecounter-terrorism commander. The officer, speaking to theparliamentary committee on transnational repressionlast month, saidthree men had been chargedunder theNational Security ActoverTehran’s threats towards Iran International, a UK-based television station. In March last year, an Iranian journalist wasstabbed outside his London homeand forced to move abroad, saying he no longer felt safe in the UK. TheBBCsays there has been a “sharp and deeply troubling escalation” this year in the targeting of its journalists’ families in Iran, orchestrated by Tehran. Staff withBBC Persian, the Farsi-language broadcasting subsidiary of the World Service, say they have been left paranoid and in tears about the fate of their parents and other family members in Iran, who have been dragged into long interrogations by Iranian officials and threatened with losing their jobs, being sent to prison and having family assets seized. Behrang Tajdin, a BBC Persian journalist, said: They are trying to make our families’ lives miserable. It’s not just harassment any more, it is punishment – and only for being related to someone. Syrianauthorities insisted on Wednesday they would “never be a threat” to anyone in the region, afterIsraelbombed the country’s south in retaliation for overnight rocket fire on theGolan Heights. Israeli media said the projectiles were the first launched from Syria into Israeli territory since the fall of longtime rulerBashar al-Assadin December, with two unknown groups claiming responsibility, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). The Israeli military said “two projectiles were identified crossing from Syria into Israeli territory, and fell in open areas”. It later said it struck “weapons” belonging to the Syrian government in retaliation. Defence ministerIsrael Katzheld Syria’s leader “directly responsible”. Syria condemned the Israeli shelling as a “blatant violation of Syrian sovereignty” that “aggravates tensions in the region”. “Syria has never been and will never be a threat to anyone in the region,” the foreign ministry said, in a statement carried by the official Sana news agency. The ministry denied responsibility and said it could not confirm whether rockets were launched towards Israel, blaming “numerous parties … trying to destabilise the region”.",

    "title": "US judge halts deportation of family of suspect in pro-Israel rally attack",
    "article_text": "A United States judge has temporarily blocked the deportation of family members related to a suspect accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at a pro-Israel rallyin Boulder, Colorado. The ruling on Wednesday came after the administration of President Donald Trump arrested the wife of Mohamed Soliman and their five children in an effort to deport them. Judge Gordon Gallagher wrote that Soliman’s wife, Hayam El Gamal, and her children cannot be removed from the country as long as his order stands. “Moreover, the Court finds that deportation without process could work irreparable harm,” the judge said. El Gamal, who has not been charged with a crime, had filed a legal petition for her release. Soliman, meanwhile,has been chargedwith a federal hate crime over the attack on Sunday, which injured 12 people. It is unclear if the Trump administration has any evidence that Soliman’s relatives committed wrongdoing, or if they were simply targeted for their association with him. Authorities have indicated that Soliman appears to have acted alone in the attack. Still, Trump officials signalled they would take an aggressive approach to investigating and deporting individuals they perceived to be linked to “terrorism”. “In light of yesterday’s horrific attack, all terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump Administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a social media post on Monday. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed on Tuesday the detention of Elgamal, her three daughters and her two sons, four of whom are minors. “We are investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack, if they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a video posted online. “Justice will be served.” According to DHS, Soliman and his family arrived in the US on temporary visas in 2022 before applying for asylum. Soliman’s visa expired in 2023. Media reports indicate that El Gamal, meanwhile, applied for an employment visa: She has a background as a network engineer. Critics say the tactic of penalising the relatives of a criminal suspect is a form of unlawful collective punishment. In the West Bank, for instance, human rights groups have denounced Israeli operations thatdemolished the homesof Palestinians related to suspects in armed attacks. The attack in Colorado has been linked to Israel’s war on Gaza, which United Nations experts have describedas a genocide. The suspect allegedly yelled “Free Palestine” during the fire-bombing. The Washington-backed war has also sparked other violent incidents on US soil. The incident in Colorado followed thekilling of twoIsraeli Embassy staff members in Washington, DC, last month. In October 2023, a six-year-old Palestinian boy wasstabbed to deathin the Chicago area in another crime linked to the war. The 73-year-old suspect reportedly told the boy’s mother that Muslims “must die” as he attacked them. He was sentenced to53 yearsafter being convicted of murder and hate crimes. Weeks later, three Palestinian American students were shot andseverely woundedin Vermont. The war on Gaza has killed at least 54,607 Palestinians, according to health officials.",

    "title": "White House makes misleading claims about Democratic opposition to tax bill",
    "article_text": "In a news statement this week, the White House cherry-picked personal income tax-related elements in the “big, beautiful bill”, the wide-ranging tax and spending bill being pushed by United States President Donald Trump, and claimed that, in opposing the legislation as a whole, the Democratic Party was opposed to every individual item contained within it. Such a tactic is misleading, particularly since the White House cited measures in the bill that have been championed by Democrats to improve the lives of Americans and are not the reasons the Democrats have given for opposing the “big beautiful bill”. Here’s a fact-check of what the White House claims Democrats oppose: “They’re opposing the largest tax cut in history, which will put an extra $5,000 in their pockets with a double-digit percent decrease to their tax bills. In fact, Americans earning between $30,000 and $80,000 will pay around 15% less in taxes.” The specifics of the tax bill have not been finalised. In its current form, it would cut taxes by an average of 2.4 percent, for middle-income households, according to analysis by the Tax Policy Center. While it is a significant tax cut, it is not the biggest in history. That was under Ronald Reagan in 1981 at 2.9 percent. It is accurate that there will be a double-digit percentage decrease in tax bills, at least in the immediate term, at a little more than 11 percent across all tax brackets. It is also true that people earning between $30,000 and $80,000 will pay 15 percent less, according to the Non-Partisan Joint Committee on Taxation. “They’re opposing NO TAX ON TIPS for the millions of Americans who work in the service industry and NO TAX ON OVERTIME for law enforcement, nurses, and more.” This is true only in their opposition to Trump’s tax and spending bill. Democrats and Republicans have supported the concept of no tax on tips. Both Donald Trump and the Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris pledged to do so on the campaign trail. Senate Democrats backed the No Tax on Tips Act, passed by the US Senate on May 20. The bill, authored by Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, was co-sponsored by notable Democrats, including Jacky Rosen of Nevada and passed unanimously. “They’re opposing historictax cutsfor senior citizens” Outside of the “big beautiful bill”, Democrats have generally not opposed tax cuts for seniors. Many Democrats have championed legislation that would expand tax cuts for seniors. California Democrat Jimmy Panetta co-sponsored a Republican led bill that would increase the standard deduction for adults over the age of 65 by $4,000. In 2024, House Democrats introduced the “You Earned It, You Keep It Act”, which would effectively eliminate taxes on social security benefits. The bill, however, has never made it past committee. “They’re opposing a boost to the child tax credit.” Again, they are opposing Trump’s “big beautiful bill”, not objecting to the child tax credit. In fact, Democrats have long pushed to expand the child tax credit. In April, Senate Democrats, including Georgia’s Raphael Warnock and Colorado’s Michael Bennett, introduced legislation that would expand the child tax credit. The bill would increase the tax credit, from $2,000 where it currently stands, to $6,360 for newborns, $4,320 for children ages one to six and $3,600 for children six to 17, permanently. While the “big beautiful bill” would also increase the child tax credit, it would do so only by $500. That temporary increase is meant to last through 2028 and will revert to $2,000 in 2029. “They’re opposing new savings accounts for newborns and the chance for children across America to experience the miracle of compounded growth.” In the “big beautiful bill”, House Republicans introduced new savings accounts for children. The accounts would include a $1,000 handout for every child born between January 1, 2025 and January 1, 2029. Democrats have not only been supporters of the idea for savings accounts for newborns, but prominent Democrats actually championed it. In 2018, Cory Booker of New Jersey introduced the American Opportunity Accounts Act, which would also give $1,000 to newborns and up to $2000 in annual contributions. He reintroduced the bill again in 2023. “They’re opposing expanded access to childcare for hardworking American families.” This appears to be false. The White House link refers to the Paid Family and Medical Leave Credit, not child care access. Trump’s bill offers up to 12 weeks of paid leave for employees who have worked a year and earn $57,600 or less. While that gives parents more time at home, Democrats have focused on expanding access to child care, including universal pre-K. In 2023, Republicans opposed a Democratic plan to keep child care centres open that struggled in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. “They’re opposing historic border security to keep their communities safe.” Last year, Trump pressured Republicans to vote against a bipartisan border security bill, a move that reportedly helped Trump’s chances of winning in November 2024. Democrats have opposed Republican plans to use US military bases for migrant detention, arguing that it misuses Department of Defense resources. Democrats have long opposed border wall funding, including during Trump’s first term. A 2018 Stanford University analysis estimated that a border wall would reduce migration by just 0.6 percent. Despite this, the “big beautiful bill” allocates more than $50bn to complete the wall and maritime crossings, $45bn for building and maintaining detention centres, and $14bn for transportation. “They’re opposing expanded health savings accounts that give Americans greater choice and flexibility in how they spend their money.” This is sort of true. Democrats have not been huge proponents of health savings accounts. The belief is that healthcare savings accounts do not help the socioeconomically disadvantaged, who may not have the financial resources to contribute to the accounts. Democrats have also objected to other cuts tohealthcare in the bill, includingthe potential $880bn that could be cut from essential government programmes like Medicaid. “They’re opposing scholarships that empower Americans to choose the education that best fits the needs of their families.” In the bill, the White House is conflating the longstanding debate on school choice with scholarships. Under school choice, funds otherwise allocated to the public school system can be re-allocated to private institutions, which Republicans argue will allow students to have potential access to a higher quality education. Democrats have opposed school choice because it diverts funds from public school systems, many of which are already drastically underfunded. In Texas, Senator Ted Cruz, for example, pushed legislation that would expand school choice, even as three out of fourschool districts in the state are underfunded, according to a Kinder Institute analysis.",

    "title": "Trump must facilitate legal challenges of deported Venezuelans: Judge",
    "article_text": "A federal judge in the United States has ruled that Venezuelan immigrants deported to El Salvador under anobscure 1798 lawmust be given the chance to challenge their removals and detention. The ruling on Wednesday by Judge James Boasberg is the latest setback to President Donald Trump’s efforts to use the Alien Enemies Act to quickly expel alleged gang members from the US without due process. Trump initially invoked the wartime law in March, arguing that the presence of the Tren de Aragua gang in the US represented an invasion. Trump’s use of the law to fast-track deportations was quickly blocked by Boasberg, but not before two planes carrying 238 deportees had already departed the US for El Salvador. The Trump administration refused the judge’s order to turn the plane around. Boasberg has since said he has found probable cause to believe the administration committed contempt of court. Upon landing in El Salvador, the deportees were locked up in El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Centre, known as the CECOT prison, as part of a deal with the Trump administration. In Wednesday’s order, Boasberg wrote that there was “significant evidence” indicating that many of the individuals imprisoned in El Salvador are not connected to Tren de Aragua. They “thus languish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations”, Boasberg said. Court documents previously indicated that some of the men may have been deported based only on their tattoos or clothing. Boasberg wrote that the administration “plainly deprived” the immigrants of a chance to challenge their removals before they were put on flights. He ruled that their cases must now be given the right to be heard before a court, as they “would have been if the Government had not provided constitutionally inadequate process”. “That process – which was improperly withheld – must now be afforded to them,” Boasberg wrote. “Absent this relief, the government could snatch anyone off the street, turn him over to a foreign country, and then effectively foreclose any corrective course of action.” The ruling did not expressly order the Trump administration to return the deported people to the US. The US Supreme Courtpreviously ruledthat people deported under the Alien Enemies Act must be given a chance to challenge their removal, and it paused certain planned deportations that would have been conducted using the law. A case currently being heard by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to eventually make its way to the top court for a final decision. Until then, various challenges have played out in lower courts, with three federal judges in New York, Texas and Colorado having so far ruled that Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act is illegal. A fourth federal judge, in Pennsylvania, has ruled that Trump was within his powers to invoke the law. Trump campaigned on a pledge to conduct a mass deportation of “criminal” non-citizens living in the US, but his efforts have been hampered by legal challenges and backlogged immigration courts. Immigration advocates say that has led the administration to seek various means of fast-tracking deportations, including by circumventing due process.",

    "title": "French Open: Djokovic downs Zverev to set up semifinal against Sinner",
    "article_text": "A crucial moment arrived more than two and a half hours into Novak Djokovic’s French Open quarterfinal victory over Alexander Zverev. It was the fourth set, and Djokovic led, but Zverev was in possession of a break point and a chance to get back into the match. They engaged in a 41-stroke exchange, the longest of a buggy and breezy Wednesday night, and Djokovic came out on top, smacking a forehand winner. He stayed in place afterwards, breathing heavily, with hands on his hips, scanning the standing ovation from thousands of Court Philippe-Chatrier spectators. Djokovic might be 38 now. He might have slogged through a pair of three-match losing skids this season and slid to sixth in the rankings. What has not changed is Djokovic’s determination or his ability to be his best on big stages — and now he is two wins from a record 25th Grand Slam title. Djokovic proved too much for third seed Zverev, a man who’s a decade younger and was last year’s runner-up at Roland-Garros, winning 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 to set up a semifinal showdown against top-seeded Jannik Sinner. Earlier on Wednesday, Sinner continued his overpowering run through the bracket by dismissing Alexander Bublik 6-1, 7-5, 6-0. Sinner has not only not dropped a set so far, but he has ceded a total of only 36 games through five matches. So Friday will bring a tantalising showdown between the player many consider the top player in tennis history, Djokovic, and the player who is at the top of the men’s game at the moment, Sinner. Djokovic and Sinner are tied 4-4 in their head-to-head series, but Sinner has won the last three matchups. No one has spent more weeks at number one in the rankings than Djokovic. No one has won more major championships or reached more major semifinals than his total that now stands at 51 after becoming the second-oldest man to get that far in Paris. Sinner, 23, is a three-time Grand Slam champion. That includes last year’s US Open and this year’s Australian Open, so his unbeaten streak at majors is now at 19 matches. He’s also won his last 26 sets at those events. “He’s playing fast. He’s playing smart,” Bublik said. “He’s in another dimension with all the aspects of the game.”",

    "title": "New York City mayoral race: All you need to know",
    "article_text": "In the New York City mayoral race, a young immigrant who identifies as a democratic socialist is taking on a centrist former governor from a political dynasty. With state legislator Zohran Mamdani and ex-Governor Andrew Cuomo leading the race, the New York Democratic primary is seen as a reflection of the battle between progressive activists and the conservative old guard of the United States Democratic Party. The Democratic candidates will meet for a debate on Wednesday night, ahead of the primary vote on June 24. Missing from the stage will be incumbent Eric Adams who was elected as a Democrat four years ago. The current mayor is running for re-election as an independent amid dwindling popularity. Here is a look at the elections in the Big Apple and what it could mean for the city and the country. New York City is solidly Democratic, so the party’s nominee is likely to cruise to victory in November. In 2021, then-Democratic candidate Eric Adams beat Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, by nearly 40 percentage points. Adams has since garnered a national profile. The next mayor will be the executive of the largest city in the United States – tackling numerous issues and pressing challenges, including housing, cost of living, congestion and public transport. The implications for New Yorkers are obvious, but the outcome of the race will also affect the nearly 65 million people who visit the city every year. New York is a major financial and cultural hub, not just for the US but for the entire world. Politically, the primary race could serve as a bellwether for theDemocratic Partyand the electoral viability of left-wing candidates ahead of the congressional midterm elections next year and the presidential vote two years later. The job comes with a national profile. The last three New York mayors ran for president. In the Democratic primaries, the two frontrunners are Cuomo, 67, and Mamdani, 33. The son of a former governor, Cuomo has an extensive resume. He served as the US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and New York attorney general before becoming the state’s governor in 2011. He resigned in 2021 after asexual harassmentscandal and is now staging what was once thought to be an unlikely political comeback, rebuilding alliances with politicians who called on him to step down a few years ago. He is running a campaign focused on improving the management of the city, addressing mental health issues and “combating anti-Semitism”. If Cuomo is the ultimate insider, Mamdani is his foil as a political insurgent. Born in Uganda to parents of Indian descent, Mamdani, who is endorsed by the Democratic Socialists for America (DSA), has been serving in the state assembly since 2021. He is running on a progressive platform that includes freezing rent, eliminating fees for public buses and establishing affordable, city-owned grocery stores. Mamdani’s rise in the polls has been fuelled by small donors and an “army” of left-wing volunteers. Also running on the Democratic side are city comptroller Brad Lander; New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams; former comptroller Scott Stringer; State Senator Jessica Ramos; State Senator Zellnor Myrie; Michael Blake, a political consultant and former state legislator; and Whitney Tilson, an investor. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent after the scandals and investigations that have plagued his tenure. Conservative activist Curtis Sliwa is the sole Republican in the race. The first Democratic debate will take place on June 4, and the second and final one is set to take place on June 12. Early voting starts on June 14, and the primary election is on June 24. The general election will be on November 4. In local elections in New York City, one can vote for as many asfive candidatesat once with the ranked-choice system. Here’s how it works: Voters choose their candidates in order of favourability. In the first round of counting, the top choice votes are tallied. If no candidate gets more than 50 percent, more counting ensues with the bottom candidate removed. With each new round, the votes of the eliminated candidate are counted by the next choice on the ballot. Cuomo is leading the race, according to most surveys. An Emerson College poll last week showed the former governor with 35.1 percent support as a first choice – ahead of Mamdani with 22.7 and Lander with 10.5. Mamdani may appear like a distant second, but his rise in the race has been stunning. He was polling at 1 percent in February, according to an Emerson survey. The democratic socialist lawmaker does have a path to victory – consolidating the anti-Cuomo vote in the later rounds of counting. The next New York City mayor will not be deciding how much military aid Israel gets or how the US will vote on United Nations Security Council proposals calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Yet, the conflict in the Middle East has been a factor in the local elections. Mamdani has been an outspoken supporter of Palestinian rights. He participated in ahunger strikeoutside the White House in November 2023 to demand an end to the war on Gaza. His positions have sparked outrage from Israel’s backers. Although Mamdani is a citizen, Republican New York City Council member Vickie Paladino called for his deportation on Monday. Paladino later doubled down in response to the outrage over her statement, claiming that Mamdani would not have been eligible for citizenship under the current regulations due to his involvement in pro-Palestine groups. For his part, Cuomo has positioned himself as Israel’s top defender, accusing several of his opponents – not just Mamdani – of being too critical of the US ally. “It’s very simple: anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism,” he said in April. Fix the City, a pro-Cuomo political group, has received large donations from pro-Israel donors, including $250,000 from billionaireBill Ackman, according to New York’s Campaign Finance Board. New York City – home toColumbia University– has seen waves of protests against US support for Israel’s war in Gaza, which has killed more than 54,600 Palestinians. The issue may sway some voters, in part because it is viewed by many Democrats as a litmus test for broader ideological leaning.",

    "title": "US vetoes UNSC ceasefire resolution as death, starvation consume Gaza",
    "article_text": "The United States has vetoed a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution that called for an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, as Israeli strikes across the enclave have killed nearly 100 Palestinians in the past 24 hours amid a crippling aid blockade. The US was the only country to vote against the measure on Wednesday while the 14 other members of the council voted in favour. The resolution also called for the release of Israeli captives held in Gaza, but Washington said it was a “non-starter” because the ceasefire demand is not directly linked to the release of captives. In remarks before the start of the voting, Acting US Ambassador Dorothy Shea made her country’s opposition to the resolution, put forward by 10 countries on the 15-member council, painfully clear, which she said “should come as no surprise”. “The United States has taken the very clear position since this conflict began that Israel has the right to defend itself, which includes defeating Hamas and ensuring they are never again in a position to threaten Israel,” she told the council. China’s Ambassador Fu Cong said Israel’s actions have “crossed every red line” of international humanitarian law and seriously violated UN resolutions. “Yet, due to the shielding by one country, these violations have not been stopped or held accountable.” Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara noted that the US veto makes it “so isolated.” “Clearly there is a gathering storm … with so many countries” that are standing against the US at the UNSC. “It’s only the US that is trying to block this converging and rising current against Israel and what it’s doing in Gaza … Israel is not defending itself in Gaza, Israel is defending its occupation and siege in Gaza,” Bishara added. Despite global demands for a truce, Israel has repeatedly rejected calls for an unconditional or permanent ceasefire, insisting Hamas cannot stay in power, nor in Gaza. It has expanded its military assault in Gaza, killing and wounding thousands more Palestinians and maintaining a brutal blockade on the enclave, only allowing a trickle of tightly-controlled aid in where a famine looms. At least 95 Palestinians have been killed on Wednesday and more than 440 injured, according to health officials in Gaza. Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said, “There has been a clear surge of attacks.” He said there were relentless Israeli strikes there in central Gaza and throughout the territory. Meanwhile, Israel’s militarywarnedstarving Palestinians against approaching roads to the US-backed aid distribution sites run by the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), saying the areas will be “considered combat zones” while it halted aid for a whole day. That move came after Israeli forces opened fire at aid seekers several times, killing more than 100 Palestinians and injuring hundreds more since the GHF started operating on May 27. Witnesses said Israeli soldiers opened fire on crowds that massed before dawn to seek food on Tuesday. Images of starving Palestinians scrambling for paltry aid packages, herded in cage-like lines and then coming under fire have caused global outrage. The Israeli military admitted it shot at aid seekers on Tuesday, but claimed that they opened fire when “suspects” deviated from a stipulated route. At a hospital in southern Gaza, the family of Reem al-Akhras, who was killed in Israel’s mass shooting on Tuesday, mourned her death. “She went to bring us some food, and this is what happened to her,” her son Zain Zidan said through tears. Her husband, Mohamed Zidan, said “every day unarmed people” are being killed. “This is not humanitarian aid – it’s a trap.” The new aid distribution process – currently from just three sites – has been widely criticised by rights groups and the UN, who say it does not adhere to humanitarian principles. They also say the aid model, which uses private US security and logistics workers, militarises aid. Ahead of the UNSC vote, UN aid chief Tom Fletcher again appealed for the UN and aid groups to be allowed to assist people in Gaza, stressing that they have a plan, supplies and experience. “Open the crossings – all of them. Let in lifesaving aid at scale, from all directions. Lift the restrictions on what and how much aid we can bring in. Ensure our convoys aren’t held up by delays and denials,” Fletcher said in a statement. The UN has long blamed Israel and lawlessness in the enclave for hindering the delivery of aid and its distribution in Gaza. Israel accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the group vehemently denies, and the World Food Programme says there is no evidence to support that allegation. UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) spokesman James Elder, currently in Gaza, described the “horrors” he witnessed within just 24 hours. Speaking from al-Mawasi, Elder told Al Jazeera that Gaza’s hospitals and streets are filled with malnourished children. “I’m seeing teenage boys in tears, showing me their ribs,” he said, noting that children were pleading for food. The UNSC has voted on 14 Gaza-related resolutions and approved four since the war began in October 2023. Wednesday’s vote was the first since November 2024. Hamas is still holding 58 captives, a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in previous short-lived ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.",

    "title": "Ronaldo fires Portugal past Germany and into Nations League final",
    "article_text": "Cristiano Ronaldo scored again as Portugal came from behind tobeat Germany 2-1in their Nations League semifinal on Wednesday. The 40-year-old Ronaldo captained Portugal and scored his 137th international goal five minutes after substitute Francisco Conceição equalised with a blistering shot in the 63rd. Ronaldo became the oldest player to ever score against Germany while ending his “curse” against the country. The former Real Madrid star lost each of the previous five games he played against Germany. Liverpool target Florian Wirtz had given the home team a 48th-minute lead with a perfectly placed header inside the right post, but Portugal coach Roberto Martínez made his changes count as he brought on Conceicao and Champions League winner Vitinha among the substitutes. Vitinha excelled as Portugal finished the game in the ascendancy just four days after he helped Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) win the Champions League final against Inter Milan in the same stadium on Saturday. Germany needed goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen at his best to prevent the visitors from scoring any more. PSG wing-backs Joao Neves and Nuno Mendes both started for Portugal, while Stuttgart forward Nick Woltemade started for his Germany debut. Conceicao only needed five minutes to make a mark with a brilliant long-range strike inside the far post after he surged past Robin Gosens like he was not there. Mendes gave Ronaldo a simple finish five minutes after that. “It could have been more,” Mendes said. The match was delayed by 10 minutes due to “adverse weather conditions” in Munich. Earlier in the day, UEFA warned matchgoers of possible thunderstorms in the Bavarian capital forecast for kickoff time. About an hour before the originally scheduled kickoff time of 9pm, a storm swept across northern Munich, lashing the stadium with rain and leaving the arena grass carpeted in hailstones. Goalkepers from both sides had begun their warm-up when the storm hit. France plays Spainin Stuttgart on Thursday in the other semifinal.",

    "title": "Syria to give IAEA access to suspected former nuclear sites: Report",
    "article_text": "Syria’s new government has agreed to give inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to suspected former nuclear sites immediately, according to the agency’s chief, as Damascus makes further inroads to rejoining the international fold. Rafael Grossi, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog’s director-general, was speaking Wednesday to The Associated Press news agency in Damascus, where he met with President Ahmed al-Sharaa and other officials. The visit was a key part of the IAEA’s efforts to restore access to sites associated with Syria’s nuclear programme since the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad in December. The agency’s aim is “to bring total clarity over certain activities that took place in the past that were, in the judgement of the agency, probably related to nuclear weapons”, Grossi said. He described the new government as “committed to opening up to the world, to international cooperation” and said he is hopeful of finishing the inspection process within months. Grossi’s visit also marks another step towards international acceptance of Syria’s new government after theUnited StatesandEuropean Unionlifted sanctions on the country last month. Israel has taken an opposite approach to its Western allies,launching more than 200 air, drone or artillery attacks across Syriaover the past six months, despite the two countries holding indirect talks in early May. An IAEA team visited some sites of interest last year. Syria under al-Assad is believed to have operated an extensive clandestine nuclear programme, which included an undeclared nuclear reactor built by North Korea in eastern Deir ez-Zor province. The IAEA described the reactor as being “not configured to produce electricity” — raising the concern that Damascus sought a nuclear weapon there by producing weapons-grade plutonium. The reactor site only became public knowledge after Israel, the region’s only nuclear power, launched air strikes in 2007, destroying the facility. Syria later levelled the site and never responded fully to the IAEA’s questions. Grossi said inspectors plan to return to the reactor in Deir az Zor and three other related sites. Other sites under IAEA safeguards include a miniature neutron source reactor in Damascus and a facility in Homs that can process yellow-cake uranium. While there are no indications that there have been releases of radiation from the sites, Grossi said, the watchdog is concerned that “enriched uranium can be lying somewhere and could be reused, could be smuggled, could be trafficked”. He said al-Sharaa had shown a “very positive disposition to talk to us and to allow us to carry out the activities we need to”. Grossi revealed that the IAEA is also prepared to transfer equipment for nuclear medicine and help rebuild the radiotherapy, nuclear medicine and oncology infrastructure in a health system severely weakened by nearly 14 years of civil war. “And the president has expressed to me he’s interested in exploring, in the future, nuclear energy as well,” Grossi added. A number of other countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan, are pursuing nuclear energy in some form.",

    "title": "Trump administration threatens Columbia University’s accreditation",
    "article_text": "The United States Department of Education has notified Columbia University’s accreditor that the Ivy League school allegedly broke federal anti-discrimination laws. In a statement on Wednesday, the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) claimed that Columbia University had “acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students”. As a result, they said that Columbia violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits recipients of federal funding from discriminating on the basis of race, colour or national origin. “Specifically, OCR and HHS OCR found that Columbia failed to meaningfully protect Jewish students against severe and pervasive harassment on Columbia’s campus and consequently denied these students’ equal access to educational opportunities to which they are entitled under the law,” the statement said. It quoted Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, who accused Columbia University of ignoring the ongoing harassment of Jewish students on its campus since Israel’s war on Gaza began on October 7, 2023. “This is not only immoral, but also unlawful,” McMahon said She added that the accreditor, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, has “an obligation to ensure member institutions abide by their standards”. The commission is one of seven regional bodies that reviews colleges, universities and other institutions of higher education to ensure they meet the standards needed to grant degrees. McMahon described accreditation institutions as the “gatekeepers of federal student aid” and explained that they decide which schools are eligible for student loans. “We look forward to the Commission keeping the Department fully informed of actions taken to ensure Columbia’s compliance with accreditation standards including compliance with federal civil rights laws,” McMahon said. The statement specified that the Education Department and HHS had come to their determination about Columbia University’s civil rights compliance on May 22. The Ivy League school had been anepicentre for pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel student protest movements, with some of the first student encampments cropping up on its lawn in April 2024. The university has remained in the news with arrests of high-profile student activists like Mahmoud Khalil in March and Mohsen Mahdawi in April. Mahdawi has since been released, though he, like Khalil, continues to face deportation proceedings. The administration of President Donald Trump has accused the demonstrators of creating unsafe conditions for Jewish students on campus, something the protest leaders have denied. It reiterated that allegation in Wednesday’s statement, where it summed up the “noncompliance findings” that allegedly show Columbia at odds with civil rights law. “The findings carefully document the hostile environment Jewish students at Columbia University have had to endure for over 19 months, disrupting their education, safety, and well-being,” said Anthony Archeval, acting director of the Office for Civil Rights at HHS, in the statement. “We encourage Columbia University to work with us to come to an agreement that reflects meaningful changes that will truly protect Jewish students.” The university did not immediately respond to a request by the Reuters news agency for comment. The Trump administration and Columbia University were in negotiationsover $400m in federal fundingfor the New York-based Ivy League school. Columbia agreed to a series of demands from the administration in a bid to keep the funds flowing, but the US government has not confirmed whether it will restore the contracts and grants that it paused. In March, McMahon had said Columbia University was “on the right track” toward recovering its federal funding.",

    "title": "Key Ivory Coast opposition figures banned from October presidential vote",
    "article_text": "Four prominent opposition figures in the Ivory Coast have been excluded from the final electoral list, according to the Electoral Commission, leaving them ineligible to contest pivotal October presidential elections in a nation with not-too-distant memories of civil war and coup attempts. “My elimination from the electoral list by the Independent Electoral Commission [CEI] is a sad but eloquent example of Ivory Coast’s drift towards a total absence of democracy,” Tidjane Thiam, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI), said in a statement on Wednesday. Thiam’s statement came two days after CEI head Ibrahime Kuibiert Coulibaly announced that no revision of the electoral register would take place before the vote. Thiam, who was widely seen as the main challenger to President Alassane Ouattara, was struck from the voter roll in April after a court ruled that he was not eligible to run for president because of his dual Ivorian-French nationality. Thiam, who was born in Ivory Coast, received French nationality in 1987 but renounced it in March. Other major Ivorian candidates excluded from the vote include former President Laurent Gbagbo and his close ally Charles Ble Goude, who was charged with crimes against humanity related to the civil war. The former prime minister and rebel leader Guillaume Soro is also barred. He was sentenced in absentia to life in prison for organising a coup. None of the four will be able to run in the October 25 presidential race or vote. Ouattara, who has been in power since 2011, is included on the electoral register but has yet to announce if he will seek a fourth term. In 2015 and 2020, Ouattara won with more than 80 percent of the vote. Thiam has appealed to the UN Human Rights Committee, his party said. His lawyer Mathias Chichportich said in a statement sent to the AFP news agency that depriving the opposition leader of “his political rights” was “a serious violation of Ivory Coast’s international commitments”. Gbagbo’s African Peoples’ Party-Ivory Coast (PPA-CI) complained that the authorities “did not choose to listen to the advice, the calls for discussion, for reason”, its Secretary-General Jean-Gervais Tcheide told AFP. “It’s a shame they chose to force their way through,” he said, adding: “We’re not going to let them do it.” Other opposition figures who announced their plans to run for the presidency are featured on the final electoral list. They include former First Lady Simone Ehivet Gbagbo, who, speaking on behalf of an opposition coalition, said that the conditions were not met for a “peaceful, calm election”. During the 2020 presidential election, a revision of the electoral list took place in June ahead of the October polling day. The final electoral register for this year’s ballot includes the names of 8.7 million voters, in a country with a high immigrant population and where nearly half of the 30 million inhabitants are under the age of 18. Authorities deny any political interference in the electoral process, insisting that they respect decisions made by an independent judiciary.",

    "title": "Leaders of Canada and Mexico lash out at Trump steel tariff hike",
    "article_text": "The leaders of Canada and Mexico have criticised the latest hike in steel and aluminium tariffs under United States President Donald Trump, who increased import taxes on the metal from 25 to 50 percent. The international condemnation came just hours after the latest tariff increasewent into effectearly on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the tariff increases were “unjustified”. “They’re illegal. They’re bad for American workers, bad for American industry and, of course, for Canadian industry,” he said. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, meanwhile, pledged to pursue countermeasures if the Trump administration refuses to grant tariff relief. She warned that the tariffs would have a “huge impact” on Mexico’s steel and aluminium industries. “This isn’t about an eye for an eye, but rather about protecting our industry and our jobs,” she added, without specifying what steps her government might take. Wednesday’s tariff hike had been unveiled last Friday, when Trump helda rally with steelworkersoutside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. That region of the US is a part of the Rust Belt, an area that has been heavily affected by the decline in US manufacturing. Trump pledged to use tariffs and other measures to bring jobs and investments back to the area. Previously, in March, Trump set tariffs on steel and aluminium at 25 percent. But he threatened to lift that rate to 50 percent specifically for Canadian imports of the metals, a plan he later appeared to walk back. Those threats, however,roiledrelations between the US and its northern neighbour in particular. Canada is the top supplier of steel to the US, followed by Brazil and then Mexico. South Korea and China also top the list. Canada is also responsible for about 40 percent of aluminium imports to the US, followed by the UAE, Russia and Mexico. Carney’s government has pledged to pursue retaliatory measures so long as Trump’s tariffs remain in place. On Wednesday, one of Canada’s largest labour unions, Unifor, called on Carney to take immediate action against the latest tariff hike, including by limiting the country’s exports of critical metals to the US. “Unifor is urging the federal government to act without delay to defend Canada’s manufacturing sector and counter the escalating trade assault,” the union said in a statement. Premier Doug Ford — who leads the top manufacturing province in Canada, Ontario — also called for Canada to respond in kind and “slap another 25 percent” on US steel imports. “It’s tariff for tariff, dollar for dollar. We need to tariff the steel coming into Canada an additional 25 percent, totalling 50 percent,” Ford told reporters. “Everything’s on the table right now.” Both Canada and Mexico have been hard hit by Trump’s aggressive tariffs, which include a blanket 25-percent tax on all imports not subject to the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement (USMCA), as well as a separate 25-percent levy on automobile imports. The three countries have highly integrated economies, with products like automobiles being built using supplies and factories from multiple locations. The USMCA pact was agreed upon during Trump’s first term, from 2017 to 2021. But he has since signalled he hopes to renegotiate the free-trade deal to get more favourable terms for the US. But the doubling of the US steel and aluminium tariffs is expected to have a global impact, well beyond North America. The European Union is also bracing for the increase. The bloc’s trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, met US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on the sidelines of a meeting for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Wednesday. “We’re advancing in the right direction at pace – and staying in close contact to maintain the momentum,” Sefcovic wrote on X afterwards. UK Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds also met with Greer, and he said steel and aluminium tariffs would remain at 25 percent for his country. The two countries have been in the process of forging a post-Brexit bilateral trade agreement,announcinga “breakthrough” last month. “We’re pleased that as a result of our agreement with the US, UK steel will not be subject to these additional tariffs,” a British government spokesperson said. Trump’s latest tariff hike comes days after a federal court ruled that his so-called reciprocal tariffs — which imposed customised taxes on nearly all US trading partners — were illegal. Trump had imposed those tariffs in April, only to pause them for 90 days. The court’s ruling was quickly paused while legal proceedings continued, and Trump’s tariffs have been allowed to remain in place for now. One of the hardest hit countries has been China, which saw US tariffs against its exports skyrocket to 145 percent earlier this year. The Trump administration, however, has since sought to reach a deal with China to end the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. The White House said on Monday that Trump would speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, raising hopes the duo could soothe tensions and speed up negotiations. But on Wednesday, Trump appeared to dampen hopes for a quick deal. “I like President XI of China, always have, and always will, but he is VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!” he posted on his Truth Social platform. When asked about the remarks during a regular news briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Beijing’s “principles and stance on developing Sino-US relations are consistent”.",

    "title": "Trump: Putin says Russia will ‘have to’ respond to Ukraine attacks",
    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has told Donald Trump in a telephone conversation that Moscow would have to respond to the recent Ukrainian drone attacks, the United States president said, as diplomatic overtures and momentum to reach a ceasefire have been overtaken by heavy aerial exchanges in the more than three-year war. Trump said on Wednesday that the two men “discussed the attack on Russia’s docked airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides.” Putin “did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields”, Trump said in a social media post. Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett said that Trump described his 85-minute phone call with Putin as “a good conversation but not one that would lead to immediate peace”. “You have to remember that Donald Trump, when he came into office, was very confident that he could end this war on day one, but here we are now in June and the fact is … this is far from resolved,” she said from the White House. Earlier Wednesday. Putin showed a flash of anger, referring to the suggestion of direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and to Ukraine’s recent “terrorist acts” on Russian rail lines in the Kursk and Bryansk regions on the countries’ border. “How can any such [summit] meetings be conducted in such circumstances? What shall we talk about?” Putin demanded in a video call with top Russian officials. Putin’s refusal to meet Zelenskyy, who while dismissing Russia’s ceasefire proposal as “an ultimatum”, for his part renewed a call for direct talks with his Russian counterpart. Zelenskyy on Wednesday also seemed to taunt Moscow by saying if it had accepted Kyiv’s offer of a ceasefire, there would have been no launching of the massive drone strike on Russian strategic bombers. The Kremlin insisted on Wednesday that military options were “on the table” for its response to theunprecedented Ukrainian attacksdeep inside Russia and accused the West of being involved in them. Russia also urged the United States and United Kingdom to restrain Kyiv after the attacks, which Ukrainian officials have lauded as showing Kyiv can still fight back after more than three years of war. British and US officials have said they had no prior knowledge of the weekend attacks on Russian nuclear-capable long-range bombers. In the meantime, Pope Leo held a first call with Putin Wednesday, urging Russia to take a step to support peace, the Vatican said. The pontiff also emphasized the importance of dialogue to find solutions to the conflict, it added. In his social media post, Trump said he and Putin also discussed Iran. Putin suggested he would participate in talks aimed at reaching a new nuclear deal with Tehran, Trump said. “I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and, on this, I believe that we were in agreement,” Trump said. He accused Iran of “slow-walking” decisions regarding the talks. Putin told Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian that Moscow was ready to help advance talks on a nuclear deal, the Kremlin said on Tuesday. But Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah AliKhameneisaid earlier on Wednesday that Washington’s proposal was against Tehran’s national interests, amid sharp differences over whether Tehran can continue to enrich uranium.",

    "title": "Canadian wildfire smoke spreads across a third of United States",
    "article_text": "Smoke from wildfires burning in three Canadian provinces has covered about a third of the United States, forecasters said, but had little effect on air quality except in New England and parts of New York state and the Midwest. Alerts were issued on Tuesday for parts of Canada and the neighbouring US, warning of the haze, which brought hazardous levels of particulate pollution to Minnesota, stretched from the Dakotas through the Ohio Valley, into the Northeast and as far south as Georgia, according to the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. It was especially thick in New York and New England. “Much of the smoke is aloft in the upper atmosphere, so in a lot of areas, there aren’t air quality issues,” said the National Weather Service’s Marc Chenard on Wednesday. “But there are air quality issues as far south as New York and Connecticut, where it’s thicker and in the lower atmosphere.” Scores of wildfires have spread across Canada since the start of May. More than 212 active fires were burning in the country as of Tuesday afternoon, half of which were out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. So far, 2 million hectares (4.9 million acres) have burned. Most of the fires were in the west-central provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. A water tanker air base was consumed by flames in Saskatchewan province, oil production has been disrupted in Alberta, and officials warned of worse to come, with more communities threatened each day. “We have some challenging days ahead of us,” Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe told a news conference, adding that the number of evacuees could rise quickly. Yang Liu, a professor of environmental health at Emory University in Atlanta, said infants, the elderly and other frail people were most susceptible to the smoke, but emphasised that everyone is at risk. “It will affect everyone at some level, all walks of life,” Liu said. “It’s bad.” He said the smoke is comprised of small particles, some of them toxic, that are smaller than 1/40th of the width of a human hair and can get into the lungs and even dissolve into the bloodstream. One of the worst spots for air quality in the northeastern US on Wednesday morning was Williamstown, Massachusetts, near the state’s borders with Vermont and New York. It registered a “very unhealthy” reading of 228, according to IQAir, a website that monitors air quality around the world. An air quality rating of below 50 is considered to be “good,” and readings between 100 and 300 are deemed “unhealthy” to “very unhealthy,” while higher than that is considered “hazardous,” according to the website. The ratings in other parts of the US Northeast were much lower, with New York City’s standing at 56 on Wednesday morning and Washington’s registering at 55. Air quality levels in some parts of the Midwest had also improved on Wednesday morning. Ely, near Minnesota’s border with Manitoba, registered a “moderate” reading of 65, down from 336 on Tuesday. Minneapolis, which had ranked as the third-worst city in the world for air quality on Tuesday, with a 168 reading, was registering at 96.",

    "title": "Will Wilders’s gamble to withdraw from governing Dutch coalition pay off?",
    "article_text": "He has been dubbed the “Dutch Donald Trump”. Geert Wilders has pulled his Party for Freedom (PVV) out of the coalition that governs the Netherlands in a row over immigration policy. It has plunged the NATO ally into political turmoil and new elections. After years in opposition, the PVV won the most votes in 2023 by tapping into rising populism in Europe with promises to reduce immigration. Wilders has pushed for a 10-point plan that calls for the militarisation of Dutch borders as well as the repatriation of all Syrian nationals – something his coalition partners rejected. Before resigning, Prime Minister Dick Schoof labelled Wilders’s actions “irresponsible”, coming at a critical time for Europe. So was this a reckless or strategic move by Wilders? And will it deepen uncertainty in the region, only weeks before a NATO summit in The Hague?

    "title": "Sweden tries ISIL member over burning death of Jordanian pilot in 2015",
    "article_text": "A convicted Swedish member ofISILhas gone on trial in Stockholm, accused of war crimes for his role in the horrific 2015 killing of a captured Jordanian pilot, who was burned alive in Syria. “Osama Krayem has, together and in agreement with other perpetrators belonging to IS [ISIL], killed Maaz al-Kassasbeh,” prosecutor Reena Devgun told the district court on Wednesday. “Osama Krayem, in uniform and armed, guarded and led the victim Moaz al-Kassasbeh to a metal cage, where the latter was then locked up. One of the co-perpetrators then set fire to Moaz al-Kassasbeh, who had no possibility to defend himself or call for help,” Devgun said. The case is considered unique as the other ISIL members involved in the brutal killing, which sparked international outrage at the time, are presumed dead, Swedish prosecutor Henrik Olin told the AFP news agency. Krayem, 32, wearing a dark blue shirt and with a thick beard and long, loose dark hair, had his back to the handful of journalists and spectators who followed Wednesday’s proceedings behind a glass wall in the high security courtroom in Stockholm’s district court. He appeared calm as the prosecution laid out the charges, which could result in a life sentence if Krayem is convicted. In the 22-minute video of the killing, the victim is seen walking past several masked ISIL fighters, including Krayem, according to prosecutors. The pilot, who was 26 years old, is then seen being locked in the cage and praying as he is set on fire. Prosecutors have been unable to determine the exact date of the murder, but the investigation has identified the location. The defendant’s lawyer, Petra Eklund, told AFP before the start of the trial that her client admitted to being present at the scene, but disputed the prosecution’s version. “He denies the acts for which he is prosecuted,” she said. “He acknowledges having been present at that place during the event, but claims not to have acted in the manner described by the prosecutors in the account of the facts,” she added. Krayem was identified thanks to a scar on the suspect’s eyebrow, visible in the video and spotted by Belgian police, which led to the investigation being opened, said Devgun when the charges were announced last week. The pilot’s father, Safi al-Kassasbeh, told AFP on Wednesday the family hoped Krayem would “receive the harshest penalty according to the magnitude of the crime”. “This is what we expect from a respected and fair law,” he said. Krayem is already serving long prison sentences for his role in the Paris andBrussels attacksin 2015 and 2016, 30 years and life respectively. He now faces charges of “serious war crimes and terrorist crimes” for his alleged participation in al-Kassasbeh’s killing. Al-Kassasbeh’s killing shocked Jordan, which at the time was participating in the US-led coalition’s strikes against ISIL positions in Syria –the reason ISIL gave for killing the Syrian pilot. Jordan had declared a period of mourning following the pilot’s death. On December 24, 2014, an aircraft belonging to the Royal Jordanian Air Force crashed in Syria. The pilot was captured the same day by ISIL fighters situated near the central city of Raqqa and burned alive in a cage sometime before February 3, 2015, when a gruesome video emerged, according to the prosecution. ISIL, which at the time controlled large chunks of Syria and Iraq, had been demanding the release of Sajida al-Rishawi – a woman held by Jordanian authorities since 2005 – in exchange for al-Kassasbeh’s life. Rishawi was sentenced to death “for conspiracy to carry out terror acts” after a triple bomb attack on the Radisson SAS hotel in the capital Amman. The propaganda video, in which ISIL also called for the killing of other Jordanian pilots, was one of the earliest videos released by the group. Krayem has been temporarily handed over to Sweden for the trial, which is scheduled to last until June 26.",

    "article_text": "In “China’s Pacific Wave”, the episode delves into the economic tug-of-war between the United States and China in the Pacific, seen through the experiences of locals like Jacob George, a Vanuatuan customary land owner confronting Chinese encroachment, and Maikolo Ikahihfo, a Tongan stall owner amid the rise of Chinese businesses. Highlighting the Pacific nations’ growing debts to China, this episode examines the vulnerabilities and economic sovereignty concerns of these aid-reliant island nations, which received more than $40bn in development assistance from 2008 to 2021. Ronna Lee’s story in Samoa adds a personal dimension, exploring cultural links between the Pacific and China. This episode underscores the challenges faced by Pacific nations, such as dependency on limited income sources and climate change threats, and questions their role in the larger geopolitical game: are they merely pawns, or active agents in their destiny amidst intense global power dynamics? Fight for the Pacific, a four-part series, showcases the Pacific’s critical transformation into a battleground of global power. This series captures the high-stakes rivalry between the US and China as they vie for dominance in a region pivotal to global stability. The series frames the Pacific not just as a battleground for superpowers but also as a region with its own unique challenges and aspirations.",

    "title": "Elon Musk discovers Trump doesn’t stay bought",
    "article_text": "Funny games. Funny games. byElizabeth Lopatto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. I have been watching, with some grim amusement, Elon Musk discovering the limits of being just another political donor. While he was at DOGE, he literally could control the Treasury and DOD — he effectively had the IT reins of the entire country, and could simply gut things he hated at will. There was a price for that: it destroyed what was left of his reputation. But it was real, true power — being able to stop payments at will makes you more powerful than the president. So much for that. These days, Musk isreduced to begging his followers on Xto call their senators and congressmen [sic, obviously] to vote down the Big Beautiful Bill. His nominal reason is that Donald Trump’s budget plan will increase the deficit, but reports indicate that Musk isannoyed an EV credit is getting cut. That makes it harder to sell Teslas in an environment where it’s already hard to sell Teslas. Also, Musk may be annoyed that he didn’tget to stay past his statutory limitas an unpaid advisor and that the FAA isn’t using Starlink, according to Axios. Even less powerful enemies can lead to political problems, which is why Musk doesn’t get his pet boy in NASA The cracks have been showing in the MAGA-tech alliance for some time now. WhenScott Bessent got Musk’s IRS pick ejectedin April, that was notable. (Bessent’s deputy now runs the IRS.) Musk wasn’t politically savvy enough to get Bessent on his side before installing his pick; an end-run like that is insulting and Musk had been making enemies. Take, for instance, Marco Rubio, who wasfurious when Musk destroyed USAID— that wasRubio’sdepartment and getting rid of it cut his power. Sean Duffy, the reality TV star who is for some reason running the Department of Transportation, had to interveneto stop DOGE from firing air traffic controllerswhile the lack of air traffic controllersremains a hot-button issue. These men should not have been especially difficult to finesse, but then Musk is known for his bull-in-a-china-shop approach. It is rare that a person in a position of power — a cabinet seat, say — willingly gives up even an inch of leverage. Making enemies of Bessent, Rubio, and Duffy was a strategic error. Even less powerful enemies can lead to political problems, which is whyMusk doesn’t get his pet boy in NASA now. Jared Isaacman was due to receive his final confirmation vote in the Senate when Trump abruptly withdrew his nomination for head of the aerospace agency. That was reportedly because Musk had beef with Sergio Gor, the head of the White House Presidential Personnel Office — basically the lead recruiter for government jobs. The moment Musk was no longer in the actual White House, Gor dropped the blade. Still, Trump isn’t publicly chastising Musk Silicon Valley is still entwined with the government — Musk’s cronies, including theguy who calls himself Big Balls, now have permanent jobs. Associates of Peter Thiel, Palmer Luckey, and David Sacksall have jobs in the administration; the vice president owes his entire political career to his sugar daddy Thiel. But whenDavid Sacks gets on X to argue with Marjorie Taylor Greeneabout the AI provision in the budget bill, that suggests a shocking lack of leverage. Sacks was a major Republican fundraiser and is a literal advisor to the president; shouldn’t he be able to pick up a phone and get what he wants? Instead, his podcastAll-Inis gettingthe exclusive bitch session from Isaacman, the NASA administrator who wasn’t. Great for content, I guess, but not real power. I’m a little surprised Musk isn’t threatening to primary people over the bill. Maybe that’s happening in private, I don’t know. But it could also reflect that Musk’s money is, at times, a political liability. When Musk dropped $20 million on his preferred Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate,that candidate got blown out of the water. Musk’s increasingly toxic reputation may make his money less welcome. Still, Trump isn’t publicly chastising Musk, which is unusual. Maybe that’s because he’s waiting on a$100 million check to his political action committee, perThe Wall Street Journal.Or maybe it’s because Musk is particularly close to Katie and Stephen Miller, two major Trump administration power players. The basic truth of Donald Trump’s entire career,starting in real estate, is that he willfuck over anyone who does a deal with himas soon as it benefits him to do so. (Justask Michael Cohen!) You can buy him, but he won’t stay bought. You have to keep an eye on him, keep managing him, as Stephen Miller knows well. Musk left the White House to tend to his own reputation, leaving his enemies behind to whisper in the president’s ear. Sure, he’s still got people in the administration, but it’s hard to effectively rule from the shadows when you’ve created a shocking amount of tension with the actual presidential staff. Musk set his own companies on fire, and this is what he’s gotten in return. What did you get for your money, honey? How do you get your kicks?

    "article_text": "An appeals court rejected Apple’s request to block an order enabling external links. An appeals court rejected Apple’s request to block an order enabling external links. byJacob Kastrenakes Apple will have to continue allowing web links and external payment options in the App Store after its request to halt a judge’s order was rejected today by a higher court. In April, a federal judgedemanded that Applebegin allowing web links, cease restricting how links are formatted, and enable developers to offer external payment options without giving the company a cut of their revenue. Applepromptly appealedand requested that the order be put on hold until the legal proceedings were finished. But an appeals court has now denied Apple’s emergency request to block the order. The court said it was “not persuaded” that blocking the order was appropriate after weighing Apple’s chances to succeed on appeal, whether Apple would be irreparably harmed, whether other parties would be hurt if the order is halted, and what supports the public interest. Spotify, Kindle, and other big apps have quickly added options for web purchases The rejection bodes poorly for Apple’s chance of overturning the order, which stems from a lawsuit by Epic Games. Epic sued Apple over its App Store restrictions back in 2020. Epic notched only a narrow win in the case, with the court ordering Apple to allow developers to communicate with their users about better pricing. Then, in April, ina scathing ruling, the court said that Apple had repeatedly failed to comply. The judge then gave Apple a more explicit order about how the App Store must be opened up. In the weeks since, major apps likeSpotifyandKindlehave taken advantage of the ruling by adding links in their apps to make purchases on the web.Fortnitehas returned, too, offering an option between Apple’s in-app payment system and Epic’s own payment and rewards program. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney toldThe Vergethis week thatthere’s currently a 60-40 splitin usage between the two systems, with Apple’s still winning out. “We are disappointed with the decision not to stay the district court’s order, and we’ll continue to argue our case during the appeals process,” says Apple spokesperson Olivia Dalton. “As we’ve said before, we strongly disagree with the district court’s opinion. Our goal is to ensure the App Store remains an incredible opportunity for developers and a safe and trusted experience for our users.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

Sony says PlayStation Link offers “ultra-low latency” connectivity, allowing for precise responses to button inputs and stick movement. There’s also an option to plug the controller into your device with a USB-C cable. The controller comes with a digital stick that’s custom-designed by Sony Interactive Entertainment, along with buttons that have mechanical switches, a touchpad similar to the one on a DualSense wireless controller, and interchangeable restrictor gates (square, circle, and octagon) for the stick.

Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicleswill take players back to a time whenFinal Fantasywasn’t an action RPG or even a turn-based RPG but an isometric strategy game.

The originalFinal Fantasy Tacticswas released in the US in 1998 and is considered by some to be the best game in theFinal Fantasyoeuvre. I myself have never played the game, though have heard tales of its legendary storyline and utterly busted job classes, like the Arithmatician (seriously).

The feature will reportedly allow you to snap a picture by tapping the stem of your AirPods. As noted by9to5Mac, Apple is also planning a new feature that detects when you fall asleep while wearing your AirPods and automatically pauses whatever you’re listening to. It’s still unclear whether this would require an Apple Watch to work, since the watch can already track your sleep,9to5Macreports. Apple may roll out a new head gesture, too, that would extend the volume adjustment madewith Conversation Awareness, an AirPods feature that lowers your audio while you’re talking. There may also be a new “studio quality” mic mode for AirPods, which could be similar to theiPhone 16’s audio mixfeature that removes background noise from videos.

    "article_text": "The latest iPad Mini and iPad Pro are getting cheaper by the day, but the basic models offer the best value. The latest iPad Mini and iPad Pro are getting cheaper by the day, but the basic models offer the best value. byBrandon WidderandQuentyn Kennemer If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and Prime Day, many great iPad deals are attainable outside of those times. The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often some amount to be saved, particularly on Apple’s more affordable iPads. The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Mini are also regularly discounted, as is the latest iPad Air. It’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters atThe Vergeare doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is available, from the 10th-gen iPad of 2022 to the more powerful iPad models with M3 and M4 chips. Apple’s10th-gen iPadcame out in late 2022. It’s still a great tablet overall; however, it has recently been supplanted byApple’s latest entry-level model, which features an upgraded A16 chip and twice as much base storage. That said, the last-gen iPad still benefits from a modern design and Apple’s long-in-the-making switch to USB-C. The 10.9-inch tablet is also outfitted with a side power button with a fingerprint sensor and uniform bezels, though, unlike its predecessor, it lacks a home button and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Right now, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale atWalmartstarting at $299 ($50 off), which is $40 more than its best price to date.AmazonandWalmartare also selling the upgraded 256GB model with Wi-Fi in select colors for $349.99 ($150 off), which is a better deal when you consider you can currently grab an 11th-gen iPad with an expanded 128GB of storage at Amazonstarting at $299($100 off). As noted above,Apple’s 11th-gen iPadonly just recently landed on the scene. Thenew base-model tabletis a fairly iterative update of the prior model with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip found in the 10th-gen iPad. That being said, the newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model. Pricing-wise, the new iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We haven’t seen significant price drops yet, although the entry-level model is currently on sale atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buystarting at $299 ($50 off). Alternatively, you can grab the 256GB model atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $399 (about $50 off), or the 512GB variant atAmazonandWalmartfor $594.95 ($54 off). The newseventh-gen iPad Miniis similar tothe outgoing modelbut comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades. The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is. Right now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is only on sale atAmazonandB&H Photofor $489, a mere $10 discount. You can also pick up the 256GB variant atAmazonandB&H Photofor $529 ($70 off), or the 512GB model atAmazonfor $749 ($50 off), the latter of which is the second-best price we’ve seen on the largest storage configuration. The2025 iPad Airis little more than a spec bump over theprevious model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer than both the entry-level iPad and the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence and compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard, which has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys that make the Air a more credible laptop replacement. The 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as prior models — but we’re already starting to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale atAmazon,Best Buy, andTargetin its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $499 ($100 off).

    "title": "Fungus in \"agroterrorism\" arrest already widely prevalent in U.S., researcher says",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 4, 2025 / 6:28 PM EDT/ CBS News The fungus labeled a \"potential agroterrorism weapon\" in arecent arresttouted by the Trump administration likely originated in North America and is already widely prevalent around the country, a researcher who studied the fungus for the federal government says. University of Michigan researcher Yunqing Jian and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, werecharged withtrying to smuggle strains of a fungus called Fusarium graminearum into the United States. Jian worked at the University of Michigan, according to officials, and Liu works at a Chinese university. The two haveco-authored researchinto the fungus. \"I can confirm that the FBI arrested a Chinese national within the United States who allegedly smuggled a dangerous biological pathogen into the country,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said Tuesday in a poston X. According tocharging documentsin the case, Liu told customs officers he was trying to continue his research with the strains at the University of Michigan lab that Jian worked in, skirting the rules that require paperwork and safeguards to safely import fungi for studies. F. graminearum is already widely prevalent across the U.S. innative grassesaround the country as well as crops, scientists say. It spreads and thrives usuallyduring wet weather, causing a common crop disease calledFusarium head blightor head scab, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service. \"It's extremely prevalent in North America. It likely arose in North America, so it's not like a foreign agent coming in. And it's already causing a lot of problems in U.S. agriculture,\" Harold Kistler, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, told CBS News. Kistler said scientists believe F. graminearum likely originated in North America, because all of its closest relatives have been found on the continent. \"Graminearum itself is distributed worldwide, and likely because of the distribution of grain from North America worldwide,\" he said. Kistlerpreviously workedas a researcher for the USDA's Agricultural Research Service, studying fungi like F. graminearum and the crop disease it causes. While at the agency, heco-authored researchwith Liu and Jian uncovering new molecular clues to how the disease might be mitigated. \"It's a real problem. The problem is because there's no naturally occurring resistance to the disease. And people have been trying for decades to find resistance. It's just a tough nut to crack,\" Kistler said of the head blight caused by F. graminearum. Farmers in the U.S. rely on anumber of methodsto mitigate the risk of F. graminearum, including the use offungicides, though scientists have worried about the possibility of mutations that could make the fungicides less effective. \"The fungicides are not cheap. So it's extra cost to farmers. But it's worth it because, without it, their crops could be completely lost. Not only due to yield reduction, but because what grain they may have would be contaminated with these toxins,\" Kistler said. Billions of dollars were lost to epidemics causedby the fungusin the 1990s, researchers and agriculture officialsestimate. The Food and Drug Administrationmonitorsfor the toxins that are produced by fungi like F. graminearum, including deoxynivalenol, also called vomitoxin or DON, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea in humans who ingest too much of it. \"It is not possible to completely avoid the presence of DON in wheat. DON is sometimes found in wheat grown under normal weather conditions, however, the fungus thrives in cool, wet conditions,\" the FDA said in a2010 advisoryto states and grain groups. Kistler said U.S. distributors also test grain for the presence of the toxins to prevent there being too much of it in the food supply. \"If it's too high, they will reject it. They won't buy it. Or they will reduce the amount that they'll pay for it. If it's just marginal, they can blend it with grain that doesn't have the toxin to get below the limit of what's considered safe,\" he said.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 4, 2025 / 4:51 PM EDT/ CBS News Jessie J was diagnosed with \"early breast cancer,\" the U.K. pop singer said on social media on Wednesday. The 37-year-old artist, whose real name is Jessica Ellen Cornish, said she was diagnosed with breast cancer before her latest single \"No Secrets\" was released in April. She said she will undergo surgery following her performance at Summertime Ball on June 15, an annual music festival in London. \"Cancer sucks in any form, but I'm holding onto the word 'early,'\" she told her nearly 14 million followers on Instagram in a video. A post shared by Jessie J (@jessiej) Jessie J said she's sharing her diagnosis partly because she's \"not processing it,\" since she has been consumed with work. \"Sharing in the past has helped me with other people giving me their love and support and also their own stories,\" the singer said. The video was met with a flurry of supportive comments, including from fellow British pop stars Rita Ora and Leigh-Anne Pinnock. \"Your literally my favourite person and I'm praying for you you've got this. my mother had it and I know the surgery and any treatment on this matter is mentally tough so I'm here for you. X,\" Ora wrote. The Grammy-nominated signer is known for her powerful and unique vocal. Her greatest hits include \"Price Tag,\" \"Masterpiece,\" \"Do It Like a Dude,\" \"Domino\" and \"Bang Bang,\" the 2014 collaboration with Ariana Grande andNicki Minaj. Prior to \"No Secrets,\" she had not released any new music since 2018. Breast cancer is characterized by five major stages, from Stage 0 to Stage 4. While the singer didn't disclose further details about her diagnosis, an early stage of breast cancer is \"highly treatable and survivable,\" according to theNational Breast Cancer Foundation.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 4, 2025 / 4:37 PM EDT/ CBS News Satellite images of Russian air bases released Wednesday appear to show the aftermath of what Ukraine called\"Operation Spider's Web\"— a long-planned drone attack deep inside Russian territory, which Ukrainian security officials claim destroyed 41 military bombers. Debris and what appear to be burn scars, along with some intact aircraft, can be seen in photos of Belaya and Oleya air bases, which were provided by Maxar Technologies, an American space technology company. Some of the aircraft were untouched and seemed to have unusual items placed on top of them, close-ups of the images show. SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk said in a statement that Ukraine hit aircraft at four Russian bases, inflicting more than $7 billion worth of damage onRussia's bomber fleetover the weekend. CBS News has not been able to confirm the full extent of the damage. Russia has claimed Ukraine's estimates are exaggerated. The Russian Defense Ministry said several warplanes at air bases in the Irkutsk and Murmansk regions were set on fire during the attack, but the fires were extinguished, according to The Associated Press. It also said Ukraine unsuccessfully tried to hit two air bases in western Russia and another in the Amur region, in Russia's Far East, AP reported. The attacks come as delegates from the two countries meet in Istanbul for thesecond round of negotiationsin a bid for peace. Russian President Vladimir Putin hadno public responseto the attack before Wednesday, when hespoke to President Trumpby phone for over an hour. \"We discussed the attack on Russia's docked airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media. \"It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.\" A Kremlin spokesperson said Tuesday that Putin was updated in real time about the attack, but is waiting for the results of an investigation into the assault.

    "title": "More Americans turning to \"buy now, pay later\" loans to purchase groceries",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 4, 2025 / 4:23 PM EDT/ CBS News A growing number of consumers are taking out \"buy now, pay later,\" or BNPL, loans to cover everyday living expenses, data shows, a sign of the precarious financial state facing many U.S. households. A quarter of Americans now use BNPL loans to pay for groceries, up 14% from last year, according to a recentsurveyfrom LendingTree. The personal finance firm also found that more people are using such financing to pay for clothing, technology and housewares. BNPL loans — which are readily available from financial technology companies such as Affirm, Klarna and PayPal, as well as from household names like Apple — let shoppers make interest-free purchases while spreading payments over several installments. The mostcommon BNPL loansare \"pay in four\" products, which divide the total cost of a purchase, usually ranging from $50 to $1,000, into four equal payments. Consumers pay the first 25% at the point of sale and the remaining three installments over the next six weeks. Although such credit arrangements can help consumers afford an item in the short term, some BNPL loans can carry interest changes and fees, potentially leading consumers to rack up debt. According to LendingTree, 41% of customers who have used a BNPL loan say they have made a late payment in the past year, up from 34% the year prior. And while most lenders don't charge interest, they do charge late fees for missed payments, which can add up over time. Despite such risks, BNPL loans have exploded in popularity, including for modest transactions. For example, Klarna in March partnered withfood delivery service DoorDashto offer a BNPL plan that consumers can use to pay for meal and grocery deliveries. DoorDash said it was launching the service to let customers postpone payment to \"a more convenient time, such as a date that aligns with their paycheck.\" LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz said BNPL loan providers make it easy for customers to use them for a wide range of purchases. \"They give people more options, which can be good if it's managed well,\" he told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady. At the same time, the growing number of Americans using the loans to buy food \"clearly shows that there are a lot of people who are struggling with high costs at the grocery store and elsewhere, and who are looking for whatever ways they can find to help them make ends meet a little easier,\" Schulz said. \"If you make a bunch of purchases with a credit card, you're just making one payment at the end of the month,\" he added. \"But if you get a bunch of different BNPL loans, it can be a challenge to manage them. That's especially true if you're on a tight budget without a lot of wiggle room, and you're inexperienced with managing payments.\" LendingTree survey data shows that about one in four BNPL users say they've had at least three active BNPL loans at one time. \"That speaks to how easy these are to get and how easy it is to overspend on them,\" Schulz said.

    "title": "Judge orders Trump administration to provide due process to some migrants deported to El Salvador",
    "article_text": "A federal judge ordered the Trump administration Wednesday to provide hundreds of migrants sent to CECOT, a maximum-security terrorism confinement center in El Salvador, with habeas relief, ordering the government to give them opportunities to challenge their detentions and removals under President Donald Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. The order applies to all noncitizens removed from U.S. custody and transferred to CECOT \"on March 15 and 16, 2025, pursuant solely to the Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua.'\" It will not apply to migrants such asKilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man removed from the country around the same time, but for reasons other than Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. “Defendants plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States — a right that need not itself be vindicated through a habeas petition,” U.S. District Judge James Boasberg of Washington, D.C., wrote in the order. “Perhaps the President lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act. Perhaps, moreover, Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs are gang members. But — and this is the critical point — there is simply no way to know for sure, as the CECOT Plaintiffs never had any opportunity to challenge the Government’s say-so.” Trumpinvoked the Alien Enemies Actin March to target members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang the administration deems a foreign terrorist organization and accuses of engaging in \"mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens.\" By invoking the wartime law, Trump was able to swiftly detain and remove immigrants he claimed were members of the gang. One day after he invoked the Act, the Trump administration announced it had deported hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members on at least two planes to El Salvador,even as Boasberg in a ruling at the timeblocked the deportations and ordered any flights carrying migrants subject to the presidential proclamation to return to the United States. The Trump administration challenged the block on its Alien Enemies Act deportations, but the ruling was upheld by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for Washington, D.C. TheU.S. Supreme Courtlater faulted the administration for giving the Venezuelan detainees only 24 hours to challenge their deportations before it returned the case to an appeals court for further proceedings. Boasberg noted in his ruling that the Supreme Court unanimously agreed \"that those subject to removal under the Act must be allowed to challenge their removability in federal court before being deported.\" \"Defendants instead spirited away planeloads of people before any such challenge could be made. And now, significant evidence has come to light indicating that many of those currently entombed in CECOT have no connection to the gang and thus languish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations,\" he wrote. Boasberg has given the government a week to propose a plan about \"how they intend to facilitate the ability of the CECOT class to seek habeas relief,\" making it clear that the Venezuelan migrants must be granted the opportunity to contest their removals under the Alien Enemies Act but conceding that \"such a remedy may implicate sensitive diplomatic or national-security concerns.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for the nonprofit groups representing the migrants praised the ruling as affirming that the right to due process extends to people who are in the country illegally. “The court properly recognized that the government cannot send people to a notorious foreign gulag without due process and then wash its hands of the situation,” said American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt, the lead counsel in the case.",

    "title": "Puerto Rican coquí frogs are loud. Islanders want to keep it that way.",
    "article_text": "For many Puerto Ricans, the nightly chirping of “coh-KEE” — the sound of a tiny frog known as the coquí — is like a national lullaby. But for one purported tourist, the noise felt more like a nightmare, according to a now-deleted Reddit post from May on the Puerto Rico Travel thread. The post, titled “Spray to keep the noisy frogs quiet?” alarmed residents and lovers of the amphibian. In thelast month,dozens have voiced their concerns across social media about their fears that visitors to the island appear to want to silence the creature. On TikTok, videos pleading to leave the coquís alone have millions of views.Some usershave urged people not to come to Puerto Rico if they don’t like the sound of the coquÍs. Others have joined in the chorus of voices calling on people to protect coquís from possible harm. Alejandro Ríos-Franceschi, an associate professor of ecology, biodiversity and evolution at the University of Puerto Rico, Ponce Campus, said that before the social media post, he had never heard of people in Puerto Rico attempting to kill coquís. Puerto Rican environmental officials have not weighed in on the online uproar. However, Ríos-Franceschi isn’t surprised by the fears expressed by many locals and environmental enthusiasts online, given how beloved the frog is. On the island, many Puerto Ricans are taught from a young age to care for and appreciate them. “The coquÍ is not noise — it’s a living soundtrack of the Puerto Rican identity,” Ríos-Franceschi said. There are 17 species of coquís, most of which are endemic to Puerto Rico, according to Ríos-Franceschi. The creatures are tiny, muddy and brown. Males are known for making “co” sounds to dissuade other males, while the “qui” sound is meant to attract females. As a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico is subject to the rules and laws of theU.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, which means anyone who harms a coquÍ could face serious legal trouble. As of 2017, some coquÍs were listed as endangered. But the common coquÍ, which makes the iconic sound, are not endangered. The frog is also an invasive species in Hawaii, Ríos-Franceschi said. In 2003,The Associated Press reportedthat state and federal officials were trying to eradicate the Oahu coquÍ frog population, citing the need to control them. The superstar rapper and singer Bad Bunny, who is from Puerto Rico, has even posted about the creature. Last week, he appeared to allude to the ongoing discussion about them by sharing an Instagram story featuring their croaking in the background of a clipped version of his song “Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii,” which translates to “What Happened to Hawaii.” Ríos-Franceschi, who is also a research director for the nonprofit conservation group Proyecto Coqui, said if tourists are actually coming to Puerto Rico and trying to spray the coquí with chemicals, it could enter the groundwater and spread to other creatures, possibly disrupting the entire ecosystem of the island. To Puerto Ricans, the sound of the frogs, Ríos-Franceschi said, is \"melody for our ears, but I can understand that for tourists that are not used to it, it can be bothering.” “But that doesn’t mean that when tourists come here, they have the right to kill them just because they’re annoying.”",

    "article_text": "A Guatemalan man who was deported by the Trump administration and thenwas ordered to be returnedby a judge because of due process concerns is back in the United States, his attorney said Wednesday. The man, identified in court documents only as O.C.G., landed in the U.S. “a few hours ago” and contacted his legal team upon arrival, Trina Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, said Wednesday evening. O.C.G. was expected to be taken into federal custody, Realmuto said. The Trump administration deported O.C.G. to Mexico, where he had previously been held for ransom and raped as he traveled north to the U.S., in February, according to court documents. O.C.G. was put on a bus and sent to Mexico despite a federal judge granting O.C.G. a withholding of removal just two days earlier, court documents show. A withholding of removal is an order that prevents the United States from deporting someone to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened, based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group “The Court has already found it likely that O.C.G.’s removal lacked due process,” U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy wrote in May, when he ordered the Trump administration to return him. Murphy, a judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, also wrote in that order that the government didn’t put forth any evidence that due process was followed. “The likelihood that O.C.G. is correct in asserting that his due-process rights were violated, in this Court’s view, has long hovered near certainty,” Murphy wrote. O.C.G. is not the only person who has been deported from the United States only to have federal judges then order that the Trump administration return them. Kilmar Abrego Garciawas deported in March to anotorious prisonin El Salvador, and the Trump administration has not yet facilitated his return to the U.S. as ordered by a federal judge.Politico reported in May that another man, Venezuelan national  Daniel Lozano-Camargo, was deported to the same prison, and a judge has ordered the U.S. to return him as well. O.C.G. fled Guatemala, where he said he endured persecution and torture, and came to the U.S. to claim asylum in March 2024, but was denied and deported, according to court records. He then tried again and, while in Mexico traveling north to the U.S., he was held for ransom, raped and targeted for being gay, he said in a court declaration. In May 2024, a U.S. asylum officer determined O.C.G. “had a reasonable fear” to return to Guatemala and was taken into immigration custody to see his case through. In February, an immigration judge determined that O.C.G. would most likely be persecuted if deported to his native Guatemala, and granted him a withholding of removal, court records show. Instead, he was placed on a bus to Mexico a few days later, without notice. Mexico then sent him to Guatemala, where he went into hiding, according to court records, before he was returned to the U.S. on Wednesday.",

    "article_text": "Concern that some Topo Chico bottles may contain more than just minerals has prompted Coca-Cola to issue a recall following the discovery of bacteria that could pose health risks to individuals with weakened immune systems. Coca-Cola issued an initial recall announcement to Costco members on Monday, warning that select packs of Topo Chico Mineral Water could be contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In its letter, it said the cases were sold at Louisiana and Texas-based warehouses. The letter issued to Costco members who purchased the product states that the bacteria poses a “very low” health risk to the general public. However, those with compromised immune systems who consume affected products could be subject to potential minor health consequences. A Coca-Cola spokesperson told TODAY.com in an emailed statement that the affected Topo Chico bottles are no longer available for sale and have been removed from store shelves. The statement, however, did say retail locations across five total states were impacted. “The quality and safety of our products is our top priority,” the statement reads. “Due to a potential contamination of pseudomonas we have voluntarily recalled a limited quantity of Topo Chico Mineral Water 16.9oz glass bottle products. All impacted product has been removed from store shelves at the approximate 40 retail locations across Arizona, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas, and no illnesses have been reported.” Read on for more of what we know. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the bacteria identified by Coca-Cola in its letter to consumers. According to the company’s notice, Pseudomonas can be found naturally in water sources such as mineral water. TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)notes that the bacteria most often occur in health care settings. The agency also notes that the bacteria can lead to infections that can affect the blood, lungs, urinary tract and other parts of the body following a surgical procedure. Individuals who are most at risk are patients in health care settings, including those who are: The recall applies to Topo Chico Mineral Water with the following indicators: Item:Topo Chico Mineral Water 16.9 oz (500mL) Sold in:18-packs Lot code:#13A2541 Date of purchase:May 20 and May 29, 2025 To confirm:Customers can locate the lot code on both sides of each case, as well as on the necks of the bottles.

    "title": "Nintendo Switch 2 draws long lines and excited gamers",
    "article_text": "For the crowds outside Nintendo’s store in New York’s Rockefeller Center on Wednesday, a long wait was well worth getting their hands on the new Switch 2 console. Some camped out for hours, bringing their own makeshift waterproof tents and lawn chairs. Others stood in the line, which stretched several city blocks. A handful even dressed up as iconic Nintendo characters, including Luigi, the beloved brother and sidekick in the video game “Super Mario.” “Really, it’s just all about the community and sort of sharing that love of Nintendo with each other,” said Lauren Hyde, who has been in line since she traveled from Maryland on Monday. The Japanese gaming giant is releasing the coveted console Thursday, eight years after the original version hit shelves. The first iteration of the Switch was a major hit for Nintendo, selling roughly 150 million units,according to the company, making it the third-best-selling console of all time, behind the PS2 and the Nintendo DS. The hype for the Switch 2 has been building for months, with Nintendoteasing a brief first look at it in January. With a bigger screen, better graphics and larger controls, the next iteration of the console has drummed up enough enthusiasm among gamers that many showed up early at stores like Best Buy and GameStop to pick up their units at midnight. “We have a lot of wonderful products that create buzz,” said Jason Bonfig, Best Buy’s senior executive vice president in charge of customer offerings and fulfillment. “Switch is very, very special. They’re a passionate community.” Bonfig estimated that 70% of Best Buy’s customers indicated they wanted to pick up their Switch 2s in-store, “and the vast majority of those customers will be there at midnight to do so.” “Something about consumer electronics in general with that instant gratification is really important,” he added. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Store is selling units at midnight only to those who secured reservations on its website, meaning many lining up outside its New York City location were doing so mostly for fun. Nintendo even warned in a message on its website that “delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed” for customers who had not already secured pre-order invitations. Though consumers have been fatigued by high prices amid the ongoing global trade war,Nintendo said in Aprilthat it would not hike the price of the $449.99 device at launch. There is also hope among some in the gaming world that the Switch 2 could spur the creation of new games and therefore new jobs. Theindustry has taken a hit in recent yearsafter widespread layoffs affected many studios, and a performers strike has continued into 2025. While some companies release consoles to reviewers early, Nintendo has remained quiet about many of the details of the Switch 2, holding off on review copies forgaming news sites like IGN. Nintendo has not commented on how many customers have pre-ordered the Switch 2.",

    "title": "Reddit sues AI startup Anthropic for breach of contract, 'unfair competition'",
    "article_text": "Redditis suingartificial intelligencestartupAnthropicfor what it’s calling a breach of contract and for engaging in “unlawful and unfair business acts” by using the social media company’s platform and data without authority. The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco on Wednesday, claims that Anthropic has been training its models on the personal data of Reddit users without obtaining their consent. Reddit alleges that it has been harmed by the unauthorized commercial use of its content. Reddit shares closed up more than 6% on Wednesday. The company opened the complaint by calling Anthropic a “late-blooming” AI company that “bills itself as the white knight of the AI industry.” Reddit follows by saying, “It is anything but.” “For its part, despite what its marketing material says, Anthropic does not care about Reddit’s rules or users: it believes it is entitled to take whatever content it wants and use that content however it desires, with impunity,” the filing said. In an emailed statement, an Anthropic spokesperson said, “We disagree with Reddit’s claims and will defend ourselves vigorously.” Since the generative AI boom began with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022, Reddit has been at the forefront of the conversation. Its 20-year-old site is filled with user-generated information about hundreds of thousands of topics and has been a main source of training for large AI models, including Anthropic’s Claude. Reddit announceda partnershipwith OpenAI in May that will allow the company to train its AI models on Reddit content. The company has a similar agreement withGoogle. In the lawsuit, Reddit said that “other giants in the AI space understand and respect Reddit’s rules.” It named OpenAI and Google as companies that “are permitted to use public Reddit content but only after agreeing to Reddit’s licensing terms” protecting user privacy. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is a former board member and major shareholder in Reddit, with a stake now worth well over $1 billion. In March, Anthropic was valued at$61.5 billionin a funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and including participation from Salesforce Ventures and Cisco Investments. The company, founded in 2021 by ex-OpenAI executives, has been backed heavily byAmazon. Reddit held its IPO in 2024 and now has a market cap of about $22 billion. Reddit says it has established rules dictating how its data can be used, which the company says in the filing “are clearly memorialized” in the Reddit’s user agreement. “While Reddit has always been of the mind that the community should be open to all humans looking for connection and community, it has never allowed its platform and the countless communities who find a home on it to be appropriated by commercial actors seeking to create billion-dollar enterprises and offering nothing in return to Reddit and its users,” the complaint says. Reddit said the aim of the lawsuit is to seek damages and compel Anthropic to abide by its contractual and legal obligations. It’s asking for a jury trial.",

    "title": "ICE arrests record number in single day, including hundreds at scheduled appointments",
    "article_text": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement made the most immigrant arrests in a single day in its history Tuesday, detaining more than 2,200 people, according to a source familiar with the arrests and an ICE spokesperson who confirmed the numbers, as the agency responds to pressure from the White House to rapidly and dramatically increase arrests. Hundreds of the people who were arrested had been enrolled in ICE’s Alternative to Detention (ATD) program, three sources familiar with the arrests said. Under the program, ICE releases undocumented immigrants who are deemed not to be threats to public safety and then keeps track of them through ankle monitors, smartphone apps or other geolocating programs, along with periodic check-ins at ICE facilities. At least some of the arrests appear to be the result of a new ICE tactic: Immigration attorneys across the country told NBC News that some of their clients on ATD were asked in a mass text message ICE sent out to show up ahead of schedule for check-ins at ICE offices, only to be arrested when they arrived. An NBC News reporter saw seven people who had come for check-ins at a New York City ICE office Wednesday being led out in cuffs and put into unmarked cars. One, a 30-year-old Colombian man, was followed close behind by his wife, who was sobbing loudly, and his daughter, who tried to chase after him as law enforcement agents in masks led him and two other men in handcuffs into waiting vehicles. Margaret Cargioli, the directing attorney at the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, who represents the family, told reporters afterward that the man had gone “to every single [ICE] appointment. He was, you know, very cooperative with all of the requirements that were made of him.” Veronica Navarrete was waiting outside the immigration office for a friend, an asylum-seeker from Ecuador, who had been told to report to the office Wednesday. She told NBC News she had seen immigrants pacing outside the building all day, some of them seeming to her to be contemplating whether to show up for their appointments at all. “If you enter, there’s a possibility that they’ll take you into custody,” she said. “And if you don’t enter, you’ve missed your appointment, and that’s automatic deportation. We have no way out.” About the arrests of immigrants with ankle monitors who were reporting for appointments, the ICE spokesperson said, “Those arrested had executable final orders of removal by an immigration judge and had not complied with that order.” Asked for clarification, as multiple lawyers who have spoken with NBC News said their clients did not have final orders of removal, the spokesperson did not immediately respond. The White House deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, threatened in a meeting with ICE leadership last month tofire senior officialsif the agency does not start making 3,000 arrests per day, according to two sources who spoke to attendees. President Donald Trump has promised to deport “millions,” while his border “czar,” Tom Homan, has said the administration will focus on deporting the “worst of the worst.” But former ICE officials say it will not be possible for ICE to hit the numbers Trump that has talked about and that it is under increasing demands to reach quickly while it focuses only on people with criminal histories. As of late last month, more than 20,000 ankle monitors were in use by ICE, according to ICE data. According to the same data, 98.5% of people on ATD appear for their check-ins, making them easy targets as ICE moves to increase its arrest numbers. “[With] mass arresting of people on Alternatives to Detention or at their ICE check ins or at immigration court hearings, the dragnet is so wide that there’s no possible valid argument that could be made that these individuals are all dangerous,” said Atenas Burrola Estrada, an attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights. Greg Chen, the senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said he is hearing that more immigrant clients are afraid to show up in court or at check-ins out of fear they will be arrested. “People are now increasingly afraid and intimidated because of the way that ICE is executing these kinds of enforcement priorities on such a widespread, indiscriminate and mass scale.” Chen said. NBC News has reportedthat ICE has boosted its manpower by drawing on over 5,000 employees from other federal law enforcement agencies to increase arrests as part of a new nationwide crackdown. But not every arrest leads to a deportation. Particularly when immigrants have pending asylum claims or appeals, they may not be able to be deported until their cases are heard by immigration judges. “ICE arresting people already on Alternatives to Detention is bureaucratic theater,” said Jason Houser, who was chief of staff at ICE during the Biden administration. “These individuals are vetted, complying and are in custody supervision and often have legal status.”",

    "title": "In hearings, McMahon faces questions about the shrinking federal role in schools and colleges",
    "article_text": "By Cory Turner , Sequoia Carrillo Linda McMahon, U.S. Secretary of Education, during a Senate appropriations subcommittee hearing in Washington.Eric Lee/Bloomberg/Getty Imageshide caption U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon had a complicated job this week: To explain to lawmakers the Trump administration's new fiscal year 2026 budget proposal for a department McMahon and President Trump have both committed to close. According toa new budget summary, the administration wants to cut the Education Department's funding by 15%, while largely preserving the two most important federal funding streams to K-12 schools: Title I, for schools in low-income neighborhoods, and IDEA grants to states, which help support students with disabilities. It is proposing cuts to other programs instead, includingTRIO, which help low-income and first-generation college students. On Wednesday, McMahon testified before the House education committee and, on Tuesday, before a Senate appropriations subcommittee. Here are several moments that stood out: In Tuesday's Senate hearing, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, asked McMahon, \"What's the definition of insanity?\" \"Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome,\" McMahon answered. Mullin's point, based on declining test scores: Whatever the U.S. Department of Education has been doing over the years, \"It's not working. What we're doing is not working.\" The notion that U.S. students have been failing academically and that the Education Department is to blame has been Republicans' leading argument in support of gutting the department, and it came up time and time again in this week's hearings with McMahon. Critics of that argument have noted that the department does not run the nation's schools.It can't tell districts or stateswhat to teach or how to teach it. In fact, in Tuesday's hearing, Sen. Katie Britt, Republican of Alabama, rightfully highlighted her state's exceptional academic progress in recent years,something NPR has documented. Another state, Louisiana,has also improved remarkably. When it comes to student loans, McMahon said colleges need to get \"a little skin in the game.\" She suggested that the federal government should not be responsible for all loans that go unpaid by students. \"Loans are not forgiven or just go away, they're just shouldered by others,\" she said. A plan to force collegesand universities to repay a portion of the loans their students do not has been included in House Republicans' big reconciliation bill. Republicans also want to make it clear when a given college program isn't giving students a good return on their investment. \"If you want to get a student loan … you've got to go get a degree in something where actually you might be able to do something useful when you're done with it,\" said Rep. Randy Fine, a Florida Republican. Such a shift would require significant changes to the student loan system and federal oversight of colleges. In Tuesday's Senate hearing, Democrats' toughest questions for McMahon were about thedepartment's decision to stop payingout $1 billion in grants to school districts to hiremental health professionals, including counselors and social workers. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, told McMahon: \"It's a really cruel thing to do to those kids. Did you think about the impact?\" McMahon doubled-down on the department's explanation of the funding freeze, that some of these programs were tainted by what the administration considers toxic DEI ideology. She also said that \"the states and the local areas, I think, are the best place where we need to concentrate for these particular programs.\" The administration uses this trust-the-states approach throughout its budget: For the programs it does not want to cancel outright, the budget calls for stripping away regulations and sending the money to states in chunks, via block grants, that can be spent at the discretion of state leaders. For example,the budget would foldfederal funding for rural schools, students experiencing homelessness, literacy instruction and a host of other unrelated programs into one, generic bundle of money that would go to states. The department's fiscal year 2026 budget would end a cluster of federal programs knowncollectively as TRIO, meant to help low-income and first-generation students access and succeed in college. And McMahon heard bipartisan support for TRIO and pleas to save the programs. At one point during Tuesday's hearing, Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins pointed out that she was wearing a Maine TRIO pin on her lapel and that three of her staff members had gone through TRIO. Collins said she had seen first-hand how the programs had changed the lives of many vulnerable Americans for whom college might have otherwise been out of reach. When asked by Collins why the administration thinks TRIO isn't worth the investment, McMahon answered that the department of education lacks the ability to audit TRIO, to make sure the federal funding is being used appropriately. Multiple senators voiced support for TRIO during the hearing and, at one point, New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen told McMahon, \"if there is a problem with accountability, let's address that … but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.\" The administration's proposed consolidation of workforce-development programs was met with a range of responses, from slight apprehension to open hostility, from lawmakers from both parties. Rep. Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat, pressed the Secretary to put a number on the cuts across the budget: \"When the dust settles do we understand that there will be about a 33% cut across workforce development?\" McMahon did not answer the question with a yes or no, but continued to highlight the need for workforce development without the federal government shouldering the cost. Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan, also a Democrat, made a plea for her home state: \"We are competing on a world stage,\" she said of Michigan's manufacturing apparatus. \"We need these engineering jobs, we need these apprenticeship programs.\" In a later exchange with a Republican representative, Mark Messmer of Indiana, Secretary McMahon said the administration was looking into expanding public-private partnerships for career and technical education. She cited a program in West Virginia that is a partnership between community colleges and the car manufacturer Toyota. Students there train in the auto plant and take classes at the college to develop a built-in workforce funded by the employer, she said. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Judge blocks deportation of Boulder attacker's family",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press A visitor offers a tribute after leaving a bouquet of flowers at a makeshift memorial for victims of an attack outside of the Boulder County, Colo., courthouse as a light rain falls Tuesday, June 3, 2025, in Boulder, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)David Zalubowski/APhide caption BOULDER, Colo. — A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the government to immediately halt deportation proceedings against the wife and five children of a man charged inthe firebombing attack in Boulder, Colorado, responding to what the judge called an urgent situation to ensure the protection of the family's constitutional rights. U.S. District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher granted a request from the family of Mohamed Sabry Soliman to block their deportation, after U.S. immigration officials took them into federal custody Tuesday. \"The court finds that deportation without process could work irreparable harm and an order must issue without notice due to the urgency this situation presents,\" Gallagher wrote in the order. The family members have not been charged in the attack on a group demonstrating for therelease of Israeli hostagesin Gaza. Soliman, 45, has been charged with a federal hate crime and state counts of attempted murder in the Sunday attack in downtown Boulder. U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Wednesday that the family were being processed for removal proceedings. It's rare that family members of a person accused of a crime are detained and threatened with deportation. \"It is patently unlawful to punish individuals for the crimes of their relatives,\" attorneys for the family wrote in the lawsuit. \"Such methods of collective or family punishment violates the very foundations of a democratic justice system.\" Soliman's wife, 18-year-old daughter, two minor sons and two minor daughters all are Egyptian citizens, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. \"We are investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack, if they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it,\" Noem said in a statement. Noem also said federal authorities would immediately crack down on people who overstay their visas, in response to the Boulder attack. Soliman told authorities that no one, including his family, knew about his planned attack, according to court documents that, at times, spelled his name as \"Mohammed.\" Soliman's wife said she was \"shocked\" to learn her husband had been arrested in the attack, according to the lawsuit. Victims increased to 15 people and a dog. Earlier Wednesday, authorities raised the number of people injured in the attack from 12 to 15, plus a dog. Boulder County officials said in a news release that the victims include eight women and seven men ranging in age from 25 to 88. The Associated Press on Wednesday sent an email to prosecutors seeking more details on the newly identified victims. Soliman had planned to kill all of the roughly 20 participants in Sunday's demonstration at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, but he threw just two of his 18 Molotov cocktails while yelling \"Free Palestine,\" police said. Soliman, an Egyptian man who federal authorities say has beenliving in the U.S. illegally, didn't carry out his full plan \"because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,\" police wrote in an affidavit. According to an FBI affidavit, Soliman told police he was driven by a desire \"to kill all Zionist people\" — a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel. Authorities said he expressed no remorse about the attack. A vigil is scheduled for Wednesday evening at the local Jewish community center. Defendant's immigration statusSoliman was born in el-Motamedia, an Egyptian farming village in the Nile Delta province of Gharbia, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of Cairo, according to an Egyptian security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to the media. Before moving to Colorado Springs three years ago, Soliman spent 17 years in Kuwait, according to court documents. Soliman arrived in the U.S. in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. She said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023, but that has also expired. Hundreds of thousands of people overstay their visas each year in the United States, according to Department of Homeland Security reports. The case against SolimanSoliman told authorities that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting for his daughter to graduate before carrying it out, the affidavit said. A newspaper in Colorado Springs that profiled one of Soliman's children in April noted the family's journey from Egypt to Kuwait and then to the U.S. It said after initially struggling in school, his daughter landed academic honors and volunteered at a local hospital. Soliman has been charged with a federal hate crime as well as attempted murder counts at the state level, but authorities say additional charges could come. He's being held in a county jail on a $10 million cash bond and is scheduled to make an appearance in state court on Thursday. His attorney, Kathryn Herold, declined to comment after a state court hearing Monday. Public defenders' policy prohibits speaking to the media. Witnesses and police have said Soliman set himself on fire as he hurled the second incendiary device. Authorities said they believe Soliman acted alone. Although they did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear. The attack unfolded against the backdrop of theIsrael-Hamas war, which has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. It happened at the beginning of theJewish holiday of Shavuotand barely a week after a man who also yelled \"Free Palestine\" was charged withfatally shooting two Israeli Embassy staffersoutside a Jewish museum in Washington. Six victims hospitalizedThe victims ranged in age from 25 to 88, and were members of the volunteer group called Run For Their Lives who were holding theirweekly demonstration. No new details were released Wednesday about three victims who were sent to the UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital on the CU Anschutz Medical Campus. \"They have requested privacy to heal,\" spokesperson Kelli Christensen said in an email. One of the victims was a child when her family fled the Nazis during the Holocaust, said Ginger Delgado of the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office. Delgado is acting as a spokesperson for the family of the woman, who doesn't want her name used. ___ Associated Press reporters Eric Tucker in Washington, Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Missouri, Samy Magdy in Cairo, Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City and Hallie Golden in Seattle contributed to this report.

    "title": "The Trump administration is working on a plan for time limits on rental aid",
    "article_text": "Jennifer Ludden Some nine million people in the U.S. get federal housing assistance. Most are elderly or disabled, and would be exempt from a proposed rule regarding time limits or work requirements, according to a HUD employee familiar with the plan. But millions of others could still face harsh consequences.Mario Tama/Getty Imageshide caption The Department of Housing and Urban Development wants to limit the amount of time people can get federal rental subsidies and add work requirements as a condition of funding, according to an internal document seen by NPR. Only a few local housing authorities currently have the authority granted by Congress to impose such restrictions if they choose. The agency is writing a rule that would vastly expand that number — bypassing Congress in the process. A HUD spokesperson offered no confirmation or details on the proposal, but pointed to the two-year time limit in President Trump's recent budget proposal, \"which will be immensely helpful to empower families and individuals to achieve self-sufficiency and economic independence.\" Any rule would be subject to a public comment period before being finalized, and could potentially face a legal challenge over the lack of congressional approval. Some nine million people in the U.S. get federal housing assistance. Most are elderly or disabled, and would be exempt from the new policies,according to a HUD employee familiar with the plans for a time limit rule, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media. But that still leaves millions who could face harsh consequences, especially at a time when the cost of rent is increasingly unaffordable for large numbers of Americans. \"It would have a devastating impact on families,\" said Deborah Thrope, deputy director at the National Housing Law Project. She and other housing policy experts say there'slittle evidencethat either time limits orwork requirementsincrease employment or help people move off subsidies. The policies, Thrope said, \"don't make housing more affordable. … They're not increasing the wages for those families.\" Several housing experts said a time limit alone could be considered an implied work requirement. But last month, Housing Secretary Scott Turner and three other Cabinet members wrote aNew York Times opinion piececalling on Congress to expand work requirements across safety net programs. They said an increasing share of public benefits are not going to the \"truly needy,\" but to able-bodied adults who don't work. The HUD rule would be a different way to push more people to work morehours, instead of going through Congress. Advocates say most who receive federal rental assistance and can work already do, and those who don't may be caring for family members with a health problem, or have small children and are unable to afford daycare. Supporters say time limits couldspread limited rental aidamong more people. Rental assistance is not an entitlement, and demand far outstrips the funds available. For the lucky minority who do get a housing voucher or a spot in public housing, often after waiting for years, they can keep it as long as needed. \"There's a whole lot of people who qualify for this kind of aid who don't receive it. So there's an inefficient use of our housing, because people can stay so long,\" said Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. He said time limits could also encourageupward mobility,but should not be imposed \"in a vacuum.\" To be effective, Husock said, a time limit should include a fixed rent and automatic savings accounts, so people can get ahead as their income rises. It's not clear that HUD's rule would include such things. Trump's ownbudget proposalcalled for gutting aself-sufficiencyprogram that promotes savings accounts, and for slashing HUD's rental assistance by 43%. There are about 3,300 local housing authorities nationwide, but fewer than 140 have the flexibility to try out different things like time limits and work requirements. Even among those few, the policies are not popular. \"I just don't necessarily think that a hard term limit has generated the sort of outcomes that people are looking for,\" said Joshua Meehan, president of the Moving to Work Collaborative, which advocates for this smaller group of housing authorities. Since Moving to Work was created in the mid-1990s, the collaborative said only 40 housing authorities have tried time limits or work requirements at some point, and 20 currently have one or both. Meehan also leads the Keene Housing authority in New Hampshire, which used to have a five-year time limit. But when the deadline to drop people's assistance approached, it was clear their incomes hadn't increased by much. \"I think it's fair to assume they would have wound up back on our waiting lists,\" he said. Keene Housing is among those that have chosen to drop their time limits. Given that track record, it's not clear whether a significant number of housing authorities would choose to adopt time limits. But if they did, forcing millions of people to give up their subsidy every few years could rattle the landlords who lease to those with a housing voucher. Many have left the program as the housing market has grown intensely competitive in recent years, andtime limits could push out more, according to the HUD employee who requested anonymity. This person also worried the ripple effect of cutoff dates could make the severe lack of affordable housing even worse. \"Private investors and lenders would not invest in much needed affordable housing development due to the high turnover and vacancies that would come from a two-year term limit,\" the employee said. \"Ultimately, this proposal would result in increases in street homelessness in communities across the country.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Eleanor Beardsley Yulia Navalnaya, widow of Russian opposition leader and activist Alexei Navalny, presents her television project at the Reporters Without Borders headquarters on Tuesday in Paris.Thomas Padilla/APhide caption PARIS — Starting Wednesday, Russians will be able to watch a new TV channel featuring political content that was previously banned from Russian airwaves. The channel, called Russia's Future, is a joint venture between the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation and Reporters Without Borders. The channel is beamed out across Europe, the Middle East and Africa via the Hotbird satellite operated by the French company Eutelsat, and is part of a 13-channel bouquet calledSvoboda Satellite. Jim Phillipoff, the Svoboda Satellite project director, says 45% of Russians get their news from satellite television. \"For more than 20 years, the Russian public has been bombarded with anti-Western, anti-Ukrainian, anti-democratic, pro-authoritarian propaganda,\" he says. \"So this project, we think, is a very important step because it brings the Navalny group's great content — which is incredibly popular — to the Russian-speaking broadcast audience.\" Before his death in February 2024 in a Russian gulag, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny mobilized many and angered the Kremlin through his YouTubechanneland its meticulous exposés of corruption, garnering tens of millions of views. He and his associates and their work had been banned from traditional TV in Russia. Now, thanks in part to the efforts of his widow Yulia Navalnaya, who heads the ACF, Russians will for the first time be able to watch ACF reports and interviews on TV. At a press conference in Paris on Tuesday, along with representatives of Reporters Without Borders, Navalnaya said with the war in Ukraine came the shuttering of independent media and draconian censorship, which made it difficult for ACF to carry out and broadcast their corruption investigations. \"We are trying to do our best working with YouTube,\" she said. \"There are a lot of problems and it could be blocked every morning.\" Phillipoff said satellites can't be shut down or jammed. \"It's not so simple to block satellites in general, and ours in particular,\" he said. \"I can't go into details. Let's just say it hasn't been done yet.\" Ruslan Shaveddinov, the ACF editor in chief, said the Russia's Future channel could make a difference. \"Our new TV channel is extremely important in getting Russians true facts and reliable information,\" he said. \"This has been especially urgent since the war in Ukraine. Truthful information can only be obtained from independent sources, from independent media. We are so misinformed. But through this venture, people may be able to be aware of all the crimes that are being committed and what is really going on.\" Thibaut Bruttin, the director general of Reporters without Borders, said his outfit ranks Russia 171st out of 180 countries in terms of press freedom. \"What we're trying to do is to favor, little by little, this idea that the truth matters, that facts matter,\" he said. \"I think the war that's raging in Ukraine is something that's showing the limits of Russian propaganda.\" Navalnaya said her late husband would have relished the channel launch coming on June 4, his birthday. He would have been 49. \"He was a great man and this will help keep his legacy alive,\" said Navalnaya. \"I know he would be very happy about reaching new people with information about the Kremlin, corruption and the war. About everything going on now in Russia.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Darfur: bearing the brunt of over two years of civil war in Sudan",
    "article_text": "By Kate Bartlett People who fled violence in Darfur walk through a makeshift encampment in the western Darfur region on April 13, 2025.AFP/Getty Imageshide caption JOHANNESBURG — The food that a United Nations convoy was taking to the besieged Sudanese city of El Fasher would have been the first humanitarian aid desperate families there had received in over a year. But they never got it. The 15-truck convoy was on its way to the city in the Darfur region on Monday when it came under attack. Five UN staff were killed, several others injured, and the supplies damaged. The UN condemned\"in the strongest possible terms this horrendous act of violence against humanitarian personnel who literally put their lives at risk in an attempt to reach vulnerable children and families in the famine-impacted areas of Sudan.\" \"It is devastating that the supplies have not reached the civilians in need,\" it said in a statement. It's the latest blow for civilians inDarfur,who are currently bearing the brunt of the brutal two-year civil war between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). El Fasher, the capital city of North Darfur, is one of the last areas controlled by the Sudanese army in the remote western region of Sudan, and has been under attack by the RSF since last year. The UN didn't say who was responsible for the attack on the aid convoy, but both warring factionsaccused the other of using dronesin the ambush. The Sudan conflict has killed tens of thousands,displaced nearly 13 millionand created what the UN has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with the World Food Program saying almost 25 million people face\"acute hunger.\" The U.S., UN experts, and the Sudanese army all argue the RSF and allied ethnic-Arab militias have been committing a genocide against Black African ethnic groups in Darfur. While rights groups have accused both sides of war crimes, including extrajudicial killings and the blocking of humanitarian aid, they have blamed the vast majority ofatrocitieson the RSF. In April the RSF attacked the massiveZamZam displacement campin North Darfur, which was home to about half a million people, killing hundreds. On Wednesday, Doctors Without Borders,released a new reportfocused on South Darfur, where it said \"pervasive violence, a healthcare system in ruins and an inadequate international response have all combined to push people's coping strategies to their limits.\" \"People are subject to appalling violence on roads and farmland, and in markets and their own homes,\" the medical charity said. \"Air strikes and drone strikes continue to hit South Darfur and other parts of the country.\" This weekHuman Rights Watchaccused the Sudanese armed forces of airstrikes \"indiscriminately\" bombing civilian populations in South Darfur. Doctors Without Borders also sayssexual violenceis widespread in South Darfur, with the organization providing care to 659 women and girls between January 2024 to March 2025. Of those 7 percent were younger than 10 years old, with some as young as five. Many women and girls are gang-raped. One man in West Darfur told the NGO: \"Three months ago there was a little girl of 13 years old who was raped by three men…They caught her and raped her, then they abandoned her in the valley.\" Another 17-year-old girl, accounted her own rape to the charity. \"They beat us, and they raped us right there on the road, in public. There were nine RSF men. Seven of them raped me.\" the teen said. \"I wanted to lose my memory after that.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Trump's tariffs could cut deficit by $2.8 trillion over next decade -- with caveats",
    "article_text": "Scott Horsley Revenue raised by President Trump's tariffs could reduce federal deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade, according to a new forecast from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.Roberto Schmidt/AFPhide caption Congressional forecasters say President Trump's tariffs could raise trillions of dollars over the next decade — if they remain in place —  more than offsetting the additional red ink that's projected to flow from a sweeping budget bill passed by the House last month. Since taking office in January, Trump has imposed taxes of 10 to 50% on nearly everything the U.S. imports. Those taxes have already raised tens of billions of dollars in revenue. If the tariffs become permanent, they're expected to reduce the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion by 2035, according toa letter released Wednesdayby the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. A separate CBO forecast out earlier in the day shows the combination of tax cuts and spending cuts in the House-passed budget bill wouldincrease the deficit by $2.4 trillionover the same period. The tariff forecast includes a number of caveats. \"Because the United States has implemented no increases in tariffs of this size in many decades, there is little relevant empirical evidence on their effects,\" writes CBO director Phillip Swagel.  The high taxes might discourage imports more than expected, which would result in lower revenues. On the other hand, if imports drop less than expected due to tariffs, the government could end up raising more money. The forecast assumes that most of the tariffs in place in mid-May are made permanent. It does not include the doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that took effect Wednesday, or the prospect that higher tariffs, which have been temporarily suspended, might return. Many of the tariffs were imposed under a novel reading of a 1977 law, and they arebeing challenged in court, though they remain in effect for now. In addition to cutting deficits, forecasters project the tariffs will result in higher inflation this year and next and slower economic growth. Forecasters say tariffs will likely raise prices for both rich families and poor families, although the CBO is still sorting out which end of the income ladder would be hit hardest.

    "title": "Partisan battle lines form over Trump's plan to defund NPR & PBS",
    "article_text": "By Deirdre Walsh , David Folkenflik People participate in a rally to call on Congress to protect funding for US public broadcasters, Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR), outside the NPR headquarters in Washington, DC, on March 26, 2025.SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images/AFPhide caption As GOP congressional leaders are vowing to move full steam ahead to approve President Trump's request to eliminate all federal funding for public media for the next two years, a group of 29 Senate Democrats are warning the broadcast outlets should be \"protected, not decimated.\" In aletter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, these senators argue the proposed clawback of money for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) \"would have detrimental effects on local stations, which rely on this funding to provide critical services to millions of Americans across the country.\" The effort comes a day after the Trump administrationformally requestedCongress approve a $9.4 billion rescissions bill. The proposal includes $8.3 billion in cuts to foreign aid and $1.1 billion in cuts to public broadcasting. CPB distributes that funding to NPR and PBS and their member stations across the country. Congress approved the funding for the next two years for the public-private entity as part of the government funding bill Trump signed in March. Most Capitol Hill Republicans express support for the package, but a few have raised concerns about some of the cuts to State Department programs. Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters she could not back the proposed cuts to PEPFAR, a public health program created by President George W. Bush to address HIV/AIDS. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the chamber would act on the package soon. Under the rescissions rules, Congress has 45 days to act. The House is scheduled to vote first next week. The Senate can then approve the package with a simple majority. With the GOP holding a 53-seat majority in the upper chamber, it's unclear if there are four Republican votes to block the package. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters on Wednesday \"these are common sense cuts.\" He criticized news coverage by both NPR and PBS as ideologically biased, asserting, \"There is no reason for any media organization to be singled out to receive federal funds. We're in a different era now.\" GOP leaders say the House will vote on the package next week. Senior Republicans told NPR they believed the bill would pass. The Democratic senators' letter notes the \"vast majority\" of CPB money is allocated to local public radio and television stations. They say the cuts \"will have an immediate and significant impact for stations in rural communities that heavily rely on CPB funding to provide critical services and could likely result in the elimination of programming or outright closure of stations in areas already faced with limited connectivity.\" They urge Thune to maintain \"full funding\" for CPB. Trump has called NPR and PBS \"THE RADICAL LEFT 'MONSTERS'\" and denounced their news coverage and cultural programming. NPR's chief executive, Katherine Maher, hinted on Tuesday that the network might consider filing suit if Congress passes the rescissions package. NPR would not address what its legal strategy would be if that happens. \"The proposal, which is explicitly viewpoint-based and aimed at controlling and punishing content, violates the Public Broadcasting Act, the First Amendment, and the Due Process Clause,\" Maher said in a statement. No Senate Republican signed the letter, led by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Ed Markey, D-Mass., but Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski voiced support for public media in an editorial in theFairbanks Daily News Minerearlier this month. She said the loss of funding for local stations in her home state would be \"devastating.\" \"Not only would a large portion of Alaska communities lose their local programming, but warning systems for natural disasters, power outages, boil water advisories, and other alerts would be severely hampered. What may seem like a frivolous expense to some has proven to be an invaluable resource that saves lives in Alaska,\" Murkowski wrote. A group of 104 House Democrats led by New York Rep. Dan Goldman, sent aletteron Tuesday to the top Republican and Democrat on the House spending panel that oversees CPB. \"Without federal support for public broadcasting, many localities would struggle to receive timely, reliable local news and educational content, especially remote and rural communities that commercial newsrooms are increasingly less likely to invest in,\" the lawmakers wrote. Trump separately moved to defund public broadcasting outlets byissuing an executive orderlast month instructing CPB to stop releasing money to NPR and PBS. NPR and a group of local stations sued the administration, arguing the order was unconstitutional. Separately PBS and one of its member stations in Minnesota also filed suit to block the order. Heads of both NPR and PBStestifiedbefore a House oversight panel and maintained that cutting funding for CPB would especially hit rural stations the most - where communities don't have other private media outlets to report on national news, but also on important local stories like natural disasters. After the rescissions package was delivered to Capitol Hill on Tuesday the leaders pushed back against the funding clawback effort.

    "title": "Endangered classic Mac plastic color returns as 3D-printer filament",
    "article_text": "Mac fan paid $900 to color-match iconic Apple beige-gray \"Platinum\" plastic for everyone. On Tuesday, classic computer collector Joe Strosniderannouncedthe availability of a new 3D-printer filament that replicates the iconic \"Platinum\" color scheme used in classic Macintosh computers from the late 1980s through the 1990s. The PLA filament (PLA is short for polylactic acid) allows hobbyists to 3D-print nostalgic novelties, replacement parts, and accessories that match the original color of vintage Apple computers. Hobbyists commonly feed this type of filament intocommercial desktop 3D printers, which heat the plastic and extrude it in a computer-controlled way to fabricate new plastic parts. The Platinum color, which Apple used in its desktop and portable computer lines starting with theApple IIgsin 1986, has become synonymous with a distinctive era of classic Macintosh aesthetic. Over time, original Macintosh plastics have becomebrittle and discoloredwith age, so matching the \"original\" color can be a somewhat challenging and subjective experience. Strosnider, whoruns a websiteabout his extensive vintage computer collection in Ohio, worked for years to color-match the distinctive beige-gray hue of the Macintosh Platinum scheme, resulting in a spool of hobby-ready plastic by Polar Filament and priced at$21.99 per kilogram. According to a forum post, Strosnider paid approximately $900 to develop the color and purchase an initial 25-kilogram supply of the filament. Rather than keeping the formulation proprietary, he arranged for Polar Filament to make the color publicly available. \"I paid them a fee to color match the speaker box from inside my Mac Color Classic,\" Strosniderwrotein a Tinkerdifferent forum post on Tuesday. \"In exchange, I asked them to release the color to the public so anyone can use it.\" The development addresses a gap in thevintage computingcommunity, where enthusiasts sometimes struggle to find appropriately colored materials for restoration projects and new accessories. The new filament is an attempt to replace previous options that were either expensive, required international shipping, or had consistency issues that Strosnider described as \"chalky.\" The 1.75 mm filament works with standard 3D printers and is compatible with automated material systems used in some newer printer models. On Bluesky, Strosnider encouraged buyers to \"order plenty, and let them know you want them to print it forever\" to ensure continued production of the specialty color. The timing of the filament's release coincides with growing interest in 3D-printed cases and accessories for vintage computer hardware. One example is theSE Mini desktop case, a project by \"GutBomb\" that transformsMacintosh SEandSE/30logic boards into compact desktop computers that can connect to modern displays. The case, designed to be 3D-printed in multiple pieces and assembled, represents the type of project that benefits from color-accurate filament. The SE Mini case requires approximately half a spool of filament and takes a couple of days to print on consumer 3D printers. Users can outfit the case with modern components, such asPico PSUsandBlueSCSIstorage devices, while maintaining the classic Macintosh appearance. Why create new \"retro\" devices? Because it's fun, and it's a great way to merge technology's past with the benefits of recent tech developments. Projects like the Platinum PLA filament, the SE Mini case, and the dedication of hobbyists like Strosnider ensure that appreciation for Apple's computers of yore will continue for decades.

    "title": "US science is being wrecked, and its leadership is fighting the last war",
    "article_text": "Facing an extreme budget, the National Academies hosted an event that ignored it. WASHINGTON, DC—The general outline of the Trump administration's proposed 2026 budget was released a few weeks back, and it included massive cuts for most agencies, includingevery one that funds scientific research. Late last week, those agencies began releasing details of what the cuts would mean for the actual projects and people they support. And the results are as bad as the initial budget had suggested: one-of-a-kind scientific experiment facilities and hardware retired, massive cuts in supported scientists, and entire areas of research halted. And this comes in an environment where previously funded grants are being terminated, funding is being held up for ideological screening, and universities have been subject to arbitrary funding freezes. Collectively, things are heading for damage to US science that will take decades to recover from. It's a radical break from the trajectory science had been on. That's the environment that the US's National Academies of Science found itself in yesterday while hosting theState of the Scienceevent in Washington, DC. It was an obvious opportunity for the nation's leading scientific organization to warn the nation of the consequences of the path that the current administration has been traveling. Instead, the event largely ignored the present to worry about a future that may never exist. Thetop-line budget numbersproposed earlier indicated things would be bad: nearly 40 percent taken off the National Institutes of Health's budget, the National Science Foundation down by over half. But now, many of the details of what those cuts mean are becoming apparent. NASA's budgetincludes sharp cuts for planetary science, which would be cut in half and then stay flat for the rest of the decade, with theMars Sample Return missioncanceled. All other science budgets, including Earth Science and Astrophysics, take similar hits; one astronomer posted a graphic showing how many present and future missions that would mean. Active missions that have returned unprecedented data, likeJunoandNew Horizons, would go, as would two Mars orbiters. Asdescribed by Science magazine's news team, \"The plans would also kill off nearly every major science mission the agency has not yet begun to build.\" The National Science Foundation, which funds much of the US's fundamental research, is alsoset for brutal cuts. Biology, engineering, and education will all be slashed by over 70 percent; computer science, math and physical science, and social and behavioral science will all see cuts of over 60 percent. International programs will take an 80 percent cut. The funding rate of grant proposals is expected to drop from 26 percent to just 7 percent, meaning the vast majority of grants submitted to the NSF will be a waste of time. The number of people involved in NSF-funded activities will drop from over 300,000 to just 90,000. Almost every program to broaden participation in science will be eliminated. As for specifics, they're equally grim. The fleet of research ships will essentially become someone else's problem: \"The FY 2026 Budget Request will enable partial support of some ships.\" We've been able to better pin down the nature and location of gravitational wave events as detectors in Japan and Italy joined the original two LIGO detectors; the NSF will reverse that progress by shutting one of the LIGOs. The NSF's contributions to detectors at the Large Hadron Collider will be cut by over half, and one of the two very large telescopes it was helping fund will be cancelled (say goodbye to the Thirty Meter Telescope). \"Access to the telescopes at Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo will be phased out,\" and the NSF will transfer the facilities to other organizations. The Department of Health and Human Services has beenless detailedabout the specific cuts its divisions will see, largely focusing on the overall numbers, which are down considerably. The NIH, which is facing a cut of over 40 percent, will be reorganized, with its 19 institutes pared down to just eight. This will result in some odd pairings, such as the dental and eye institutes ending up in the same place; genomics and biomedical imaging will likewise end up under the same roof. Other groups like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration will also face major cuts. Issues go well beyond the core science agencies, as well. In theDepartment of Energy, funding for wind, solar, and renewable grid integration has been zeroed out, essentially ending all programs in this area. Hydrogen and fuel cells face a similar fate. Collectively, these had gotten over $600 billion dollars in 2024's budget. Other areas of science at the DOE, such as high-energy physics, fusion, and biology, receive relatively minor cuts that are largely in line with the ones faced by administration priorities like fossil and nuclear energy. It goes without saying that this would amount to an abandonment of US scientific leadership at a time when most estimates of China's research spending show it approaching US-like levels of support. Not only would it eliminate many key facilities, instruments, and institutions that have helped make the US a scientific powerhouse, but it would also block the development of newer and additional ones. The harms are so widespread that even topics that the administration claims are priorities would see severe cuts. And the damage is likely to last for generations, as support is cut at every stage of the educational pipeline that prepares people for STEM careers. This includes careers in high-tech industries, which may require relocation overseas due to a combination of staffing concerns and heightened immigration controls. That said, we'vebeen here beforein the first Trump administration, when budgets were proposed with potentially catastrophic implications for US science. ButCongress limited the damageand maintained reasonably consistent budgets for most agencies. Can we expect that to happen again? So far, the signs are not especially promising. The House has largely adopted the Trump administration's budget priorities, despite the fact that the budget they pass turns its back on decades of supposed concerns about deficit spending. While the Senate has yet to take up the budget, it has also been very pliant during the second Trump administration, approving grossly unqualified cabinet picks such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. All of which would seem to call for the leadership of US science organizations to press the case for the importance of science funding to the US, and highlight the damage that these cuts would cause. But, if yesterday's National Academies event is anything to judge by, the leadership is not especially interested. As the nation's premier science organization, and one that performs lots of analyses for the government, the National Academies would seem to be in a position to have its concerns taken seriously by members of Congress. And, given that the present and future of science in the US is being set by policy choices, a meeting entitled the State of the Science would seem like the obvious place to address those concerns. If so, it was not obvious to Marcia McNutt, the president of the NAS, who gave the presentation. She made some oblique references to current problems, saying, that “We are embarking on a radical new experiment in what conditions promote science leadership, with the US being the treatment group, and China as the control,\" and acknowledged that \"uncertainties over the science budgets for next year, coupled with cancellations of billions of dollars of already hard-won research grants, is causing an exodus of researchers.\" But her primary focus was on the trends that have been operative in science funding and policy leading up tobut excludingthe second Trump administration. McNutt suggested this was needed to look beyond the next four years. However, that ignores the obvious fact that US science will be fundamentally different if the Trump administration can follow through on its plans and policies; the trends that have been present for the last two decades will be irrelevant. She was also remarkably selective about her avoidance of discussing Trump administration priorities. After noting that faculty surveys have suggested they spend roughly 40 percent of their time handling regulatory requirements, she twice mentioned that the administration's anti-regulatory stance could be a net positive here (once calling it \"an opportunity to help\"). Yet she neglected to note that many of the abandoned regulations represent a retreat from science-driven policy. McNutt also acknowledged the problem of science losing the bipartisan support it has enjoyed, as trust in scientists among US conservatives has been on a downward trend. But she suggested it was scientists' responsibility to fix the problem, even though it's largely the product of one party deciding it can gain partisan advantage by raising doubts about scientific findings in fields like climate change and vaccine safety. The panel discussion that came after largely followed McNutt's lead in avoiding any mention of the current threats to science. The lone exception was Heather Wilson, president of the University of Texas at El Paso and a former Republican member of the House of Representatives and Secretary of the Air Force during the first Trump administration. Wilson took direct aim at Trump's cuts to funding for underrepresented groups, arguing, \"Talent is evenly distributed, but opportunity is not.\" After arguing that \"the moral authority of science depends on the pursuit of truth,\" she highlighted the cancellation of grants that had been used to study diseases that are more prevalent in some ethnic groups, saying \"that's not woke science—that's genetics.\" Wilson was clearly the exception, however, as the rest of the panel largely avoided direct mention of either the damage already done to US science funding or the impending catastrophe on the horizon. We've asked the National Academies' leadership a number of questions about how it perceives its role at a time when US science is clearly under threat. As of this article's publication, however, we have not received a response. At yesterday's event, however, only one person showed a clear sense of what they thought that role should be—Wilson again, whose strongest words were directed at the National Academies themselves, which she said should \"do what you've done since Lincoln was president,\" and stand up for the truth.

    "title": "Jared Isaacman speaks out, and it’s clear that NASA lost a visionary leader",
    "article_text": "\"We went from the atomic bomb in 1945 to laying the keel on theNautilusin 1951.\" In a revealing interview published bytheAll-In Podcaston Wednesday, the private astronaut nominated to lead NASA, Jared Isaacman, spoke at length on what he thought about the nomination process, how he would have led NASA, and the factors that led to the abrupt rescission of his nomination by President Trump. \"I got a call Friday, of last week, that the president has decided to go in a different direction,\" Isaacman said. \"It was a real bummer.\" It was a real bummer for most of the space community, myself included. To be clear, I am biased. I have gotten to know Isaacman over the last five years rather well, talking with him about his passion for spaceflight, what is working, and what is not. What I have discovered in Isaacman is a person who cares deeply about the future of US spaceflight and wants to make a meaningful contribution to its advancement. To see him done wrong like this, well, it's a very sordid affair. A lot of Isaacman's intellect and thought on these issues was evident in the podcast. Here's a look at some of the things that we heard for the first time, publicly, from Isaacman on Wednesday. \"The agency is doing a lot of littles, a lot of things that other agencies, departments, companies are capable of doing,\" Isaacman said. \"That's not why the taxpayers fund NASA. NASA's funded to do the near impossible that no one else can do.\" So, what are the needle-moving projects that NASA should be focused on? \"That's leading in the high ground of space,\" he said of his priorities. \"Let's complete our lunar obligations, because that's a whole other story with China. At the same time, in parallel, develop the capabilities to get to Mars. Help the commercial industry develop the rapid, reusable, heavy-lift capability that allows us to go anywhere. Pivot from competing with industry to doing what no company would ever do, which is build nuclear spaceships.\" Isaacman referencedthe recent cancellationof the DRACO project, which aimed to develop a nuclear thermal propulsion engine. He supports this, saying NASA should fund a much larger project that is applicable in the real world and focus on nuclear electric propulsion. \"It's subscale,\" Isaacman said of the DRACO program. \"It's a program that sits in a lab forever. Like what you need in nuclear electric—I'm passionate on the subject. You need us to get back to the good old days. We went from the atomic bomb in 1945 to laying the keel on theNautilus[the world's first nuclear submarine] in 1951. Five, six years. We didn't keep it in the lab forever. We said, you know what? We're going to do big, bold things. And that's what we need to be doing in space when it comes to nuclear.\" It's clear that Isaacman was not overly enamored with the Artemis Program to land humans on the Moon, viewing it as a program built around using the large, expendable Space Launch System rocket. \"It's a giant disposable rocket program that repurposes shuttle hardware,\" he said. \"It's incredibly expensive. We signed up a lot of international partners to support it because we like collecting flags, and it doesn't necessarily always mean that what they're contributing to is in the best interests of the program, case in point, you know, Gateway, man. This is going down a rabbit hole of a lot of things because of the shortcomings of the vehicle. But it's expensive; it's disposable. It is not the way to do affordable, repeatable, efficient exploration, whether it's to Moon, Mars, or anywhere else.\" Isaacman said NASA should fly Artemis II and Artemis III using this SLS rocket, and then proceed toward deep space programs focused on reusable hardware. Later in the interview, he continued to assail the expensive, expendable hardware NASA has been developing for two decades. \"There's enough hardware now to fly a couple of missions, and make sure you beat China back to the Moon,\" he said. \"But you can't be stuck on this forever. This is literally the equivalency, by the way, of taking P-51 Mustangs [a fighter aircraft] from World War II and using them in Desert Storm, because we got to keep the plants open.  And that obviously makes no logical sense whatsoever.\" Isaacman said he is, politically, a moderate, although he leans right. He supports Trump's desire to cut alleged waste and fraud from the US government, and that is what he intended to do at NASA. He also did not blame Trump for his departure, saying that a president makes a thousand decisions a day, often with a few seconds of information. He also said he enjoyed the Senate confirmation process, which allowed him to candidly discuss his positions on NASA with individual US senators. As for why he was removed, Isaacman said the following: \"I had a pretty good idea, I don’t think the timing was much of a coincidence,\" he said. \"Obviously, there was more than one departure that was covered on that day.\" The phone call to Isaacman saying his nomination was being pulled came the same day that SpaceX founder Elon Musk left his position as a special advisor to the president. Musk had been supportive of Isaacman's nomination. However, in his time running the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk had made enemies within the US government. \"There were some people who had some axes to grind, and I was a good, visible target,\" Isaacman said. \"I want to be overwhelmingly clear: I don’t fault the president.\" Although Isaacman did not name anyone, multiple sources have told Ars that it was Sergio Gor, an official in the White House Presidential Personnel Office, who moved against Isaacman after Musk left the White House. Gor was irked by Musk's failure to consult him and other personnel officials on some decisions. As a result of what appears to be political pettiness, NASA lost a visionary leader who had the potential to lead the space agency into the middle of the 21st century at a time when an aging agency needs to modernize. If you listen to him, losing that potential in such a way is downright painful. It's a damn shame. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "FCC Republican Nathan Simington resigns along with Democrat Geoffrey Starks. Two commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission are resigning at the end of this week. For at least a little while, the FCC will have just two members: Chairman Brendan Carr, a Republican chosen by Trump to lead the agency, and Anna Gomez, a Democratic commissioner. Democrat Geoffrey Starksannounced in Marchthat he would leave in the near future, andtodayhe said that Friday will be his final day. Starks' departure could have given Carr a 2-1 Republican majority, but it turns out Republican Commissioner Nathan Simington will leave at the same time as Starks. \"I will be concluding my tenure at the Federal Communications Commission at the end of this week,\" Simingtonannouncedtoday. \"It has been the greatest honor of my professional life to serve the American people as a Commissioner. I am deeply honored to have been entrusted with this responsibility by President Donald J. Trump during his first term.\" Bloombergreportedin March that Simington \"has also wanted to depart to take on different work,\" but he didn't announce his resignation until today. While the Carr FCC is going from a 2-2 partisan split to a 1-1 split, Carr isn't likely to have to wait as long for a majority as his predecessor did. Biden-era Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel had towait over two yearsfor a Democratic majority. Carr would get a 2-1 Republican majority oncenominee Olivia Trustyis confirmed by the Senate. The FCC has five commissioners when it's at full strength. FCC chairs wield significant power even without a majority. Carr has dramatically changed the FCC's approach to regulating news media, taking ahard stance against broadcast networksaccused of bias against President Trump. The Carr FCC also pressured Verizon and T-Mobile into dropping DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) policiesin exchange for merger approvals. Carr, a longtime proponent of telecom deregulation, has alsobegunrelaxing rules that apply to phone and broadband network operators. But he'll need a Republican majority for more expansive rule-cutting as part of his \"Delete, Delete, Delete\" initiative. In ablog post today, Carr thanked Starks and Simington for their service and said he plans to continue eliminating various rules that apply to cable TV, Internet, and phone providers.

    "title": "OpenAI slams court order to save all ChatGPT logs, including deleted chats",
    "article_text": "OpenAI defends privacy of hundreds of millions of ChatGPT users. OpenAI is now fighting a courtorderto preserve all ChatGPT user logs—including deleted chats and sensitive chats logged through its API business offering—after news organizations suing over copyright claims accused the AI company of destroying evidence. \"Before OpenAI had an opportunity to respond to those unfounded accusations, the court ordered OpenAI to 'preserve and segregate all output log data that would otherwise be deleted on a going forward basis until further order of the Court (in essence, the output log data that OpenAI has been destroying),\" OpenAI explained in acourt filingdemanding oral arguments in a bid to block the controversial order. In the filing, OpenAI alleged that the court rushed the order based only on a hunch raised by The New York Times and other news plaintiffs. And now, without \"any just cause,\" OpenAI argued, the order \"continues to prevent OpenAI from respecting its users’ privacy decisions.\" That risk extended to users of ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro, as well as users of OpenAI’s application programming interface (API), OpenAI said. The court order came after news organizations expressed concern that people using ChatGPT to skirt paywalls \"might be more likely to 'delete all [their] searches' to cover their tracks,\" OpenAI explained. Evidence to support that claim, news plaintiffs argued, was missing from the record because so far, OpenAI had only shared samples of chat logs that users had agreed that the company could retain. Sharing the news plaintiffs' concerns, the judge, Ona Wang, ultimately agreed that OpenAI likely would never stop deleting that alleged evidence absent a court order, granting news plaintiffs' request to preserve all chats. OpenAI argued the May 13 order was premature and should be vacated, until, \"at a minimum,\" news organizations can establish a substantial need for OpenAI to preserve all chat logs. They warned that the privacy of hundreds of millions of ChatGPT users globally is at risk every day that the \"sweeping, unprecedented\" order continues to be enforced. \"As a result, OpenAI is forced to jettison its commitment to allow users to control when and how their ChatGPT conversation data is used, and whether it is retained,\" OpenAI argued. Meanwhile, there is no evidence beyond speculation yet supporting claims that \"OpenAI had intentionally deleted data,\" OpenAI alleged. And supposedly there is not \"a single piece of evidence supporting\" claims that copyright-infringing ChatGPT users are more likely to delete their chats. \"OpenAI did not 'destroy' any data, and certainly did not delete any data in response to litigation events,\" OpenAI argued. \"The Order appears to have incorrectly assumed the contrary.\" At a conference in January, Wang raised a hypothetical in line with her thinking on the subsequent order. She asked OpenAI's legal team to consider a ChatGPT user who \"found some way to get around the pay wall\" and \"was getting The New York Times content somehow as the output.\" If that user \"then hears about this case and says, 'Oh, whoa, you know I’m going to ask them to delete all of my searches and not retain any of my searches going forward,'\" the judge asked, wouldn't that be \"directly the problem\" that the order would address? OpenAI does not plan to give up this fight, alleging that news plaintiffs have \"fallen silent\" on claims of intentional evidence destruction, and the order should be deemed unlawful. For OpenAI, risks of breaching its own privacy agreements could not only \"damage\" relationships with users but could also risk putting the company in breach of contracts and global privacy regulations. Further, the order imposes \"significant\" burdens on OpenAI, supposedly forcing the ChatGPT maker to dedicate months of engineering hours at substantial costs to comply, OpenAI claimed. It follows then that OpenAI's potential for harm \"far outweighs News Plaintiffs’ speculative need for such data,\" OpenAI argued. \"While OpenAI appreciates the court’s efforts to manage discovery in this complex set of cases, it has no choice but to protect the interests of its users by objecting to the Preservation Order and requesting its immediate vacatur,\" OpenAI said. Millions of people use ChatGPT daily for a range of purposes, OpenAI noted, \"ranging from the mundane to profoundly personal.\" People may choose to delete chat logs that contain their private thoughts, OpenAI said, as well as sensitive information, like financial data from balancing the house budget or intimate details from workshopping wedding vows. And for business users connecting to OpenAI's API, the stakes may be even higher, as their logs may contain their companies' most confidential data, including trade secrets and privileged business information. \"Given that array of highly confidential and personal use cases, OpenAI goes to great lengths to protect its users’ data and privacy,\" OpenAI argued. It does this partly by \"honoring its privacy policies and contractual commitments to users\"—which the preservation order allegedly \"jettisoned\" in \"one fell swoop.\" Before the order was in place mid-May, OpenAI only retained \"chat history\" for users of ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro who did not opt out of data retention. But now, OpenAI has been forced to preserve chat history even when users \"elect to not retain particular conversations by manually deleting specific conversations or by starting a 'Temporary Chat,' which disappears once closed,\" OpenAI said. Previously, users could also request to \"delete their OpenAI accounts entirely, including all prior conversation history,\" which was then purged within 30 days. While OpenAI rejects claims that ordinary users use ChatGPT to access news articles, the company noted that including OpenAI's business customers in the order made \"even less sense,\" since API conversation data \"is subject to standard retention policies.\" That means API customers couldn’t delete all their searches based on their customers' activity, which is the supposed basis for requiring OpenAI to retain sensitive data. \"The court nevertheless required OpenAI to continue preserving API Conversation Data as well,\" OpenAI argued, in support of lifting the order on the API chat logs. Users who found out about the preservation order panicked, OpenAI noted. In court filings, they cited social media posts sounding alarms on LinkedIn and X (formerly Twitter). They further argued that the court should have weighed those user concerns before issuing a preservation order, but \"that did not happen here.\" One tech worker on LinkedIn suggested the order created \"a serious breach of contract for every company that uses OpenAI,\" while privacy advocates on X warned, \"every single AI service 'powered by' OpenAI should be concerned.\" Also on LinkedIn, a consultant rushed to warn clients to be \"extra careful\" sharing sensitive data \"with ChatGPT or through OpenAI’s API for now,\" warning, \"your outputs could eventually be read by others, even if you opted out of training data sharing or used 'temporary chat'!\" People on both platforms recommended using alternative tools to avoid privacy concerns, like Mistral AI or Google Gemini, with one cybersecurity professional on LinkedIn describing the ordered chat log retention as \"an unacceptable security risk.\" On X, an account with tens of thousands of followers summed up the controversy by suggesting that \"Wang apparently thinks the NY Times' boomer copyright concerns trump the privacy of EVERY @OpenAI USER—insane!!!\" The reason for the alarm is \"simple,\" OpenAI said. \"Users feel more free to use ChatGPT when they know that they are in control of their personal information, including which conversations are retained and which are not.\" It's unclear if OpenAI will be able to get the judge to waver if oral arguments are scheduled. Wang previously justified the broad order partly due to the news organizations' claim that \"the volume of deleted conversations is significant.\" She suggested that OpenAI could have taken steps to anonymize the chat logs but chose not to, only making an argument for why it \"would not\" be able to segregate data, rather than explaining why it \"can’t.\" Spokespersons for OpenAI and The New York Times' legal team declined Ars' request to comment on the ongoing multi-district litigation.

    "title": "American Science & Surplus is fighting for its life. Here’s why you should care.",
    "article_text": "Part science outlet, part Radio Shack, part curio cabinet—American Science & Surplus is unique. It was shortly after moving into Chicago's Jefferson Park neighborhood that I saw the sign for the first time: American Science & Surplus. My curiosity piqued, I pulled into the strip mall and walked into a store filled with an unimaginable variety of lab equipment, military surplus, tools, electronics, toys, and so much more. Now, nearly 90 years after its launch selling \"reject lenses\" as American Lens & Photo,American Science & Surplusis facing an existential threat. The COVID-19 pandemic and increased costs hit the business hard, so the store has launched aGoFundMe campaign looking to raise $200,000from customers and fans alike. What's happening in suburban Chicago is a microcosm of the challenges facing local retail, with big-box retailers and online behemoths overwhelming beloved local institutions. It's a story that has played out countless times in the last two-plus decades, and owner Pat Meyer is hoping this tale has a different ending. Launching a fundraiser was a tough choice for Meyer. \"I don't like asking people for money,\" he said. With his voice catching, he continued: \"It's hard for me to talk about sometimes, because the more I'm in the store, the more I see how much people care about it and don't want it to go away.\" And the current environment is tough for small business owners. \"Banks… are real hesitant [about lending] money,\" Meyer told Ars. \"Interest rates are high, too. So we decided that we were going to try and reach out to the community that we built over the last 88 years.\" Walk into any of the three American Science & Surplus' stores in the Illinois-Wisconsin area—two in Illinois, Park Ridge and Geneva, and one in Milwaukee—and it's easy to see why it has such a devoted following. Each aisle could be a store of its own. One has stationery and office supplies. Another has military surplus. The next one over has tools. I head over there regularly just to wander the aisles and see what's in stock. Other times I go looking for a particular oddball item—and I usually find it there. American Science & Surplus got its start in 1937 and has expanded its inventory and reach ever since. And Meyer has been a part of the story for the last four decades. \"I've done everything in the company that there is to do,\" he said. \"I started off literally scraping floors and Windexing, driven our trucks. I've done warehouse sales, I've done tent sales. I've been store manager, assistant manager, I've done—there isn't anything in this company that I haven't—and it's been my life for 41 years.\" Over time, the store has moved far beyond lenses and lab equipment. There's a science toy section and an aisle devoted to Etsy-style craft supplies. But other, once-thriving areas of the business have suffered. When I first discovered American Science & Surplus in the early 2000s, I would always linger at the massive telescope section. The store staff was always more than happy to answer my questions and explain the differences between the scopes. Now, telescopes are just a small corner of the store, and sales are infrequent. \"People come in to ask questions and then buy the telescopes online,\" Meyer explained. In many ways, American Science & Surplus is a physical manifestation of the maker ethos. There is an endless array of motors, switches, cables, tools, and connectors. \"Sometimes our customers will send us photos of their creations,\" said Meyer. \"It's always cool to see how people are inspired by shopping here.\" The store should feel familiar to those who were alive in the peak days of Radio Shack. In fact, there used to be a Radio Shack in the same strip mall as American Science & Surplus' old store in the Jefferson Park neighborhood on Chicago's northwest side. Meyer said that Radio Shack would frequently send customers a few doors down to his store to find things Radio Shack didn't stock. And one time, the surplus store sent a customer back. \"Radio Shack sent one guy over to us after telling him they didn't have the item in stock,\" Meyer said. \"We didn't have it, but one of our associates knew Radio Shack did, so he walked the customer back, pulled the part out of the bin, and handed it to him.\" That customer service ethos is one of the reasons the company has lasted as long as it has. Another is the offbeat, quirky nature of the store. It's not just the inventory—even the product descriptions are offbeat. A sign for a $19.50 \"Deluxe Walking Cane\" warns customers that it's \"not the edible kind of cane.\" And if you're looking for, say, a Romanian army gas mask, a tactical spork, or a set of tuning forks, there aren't a lot of other options. Meyer said that only a handful of similar surplus stores are left in the US, down from hundreds a few decades ago. American Science & Surplus has adapted over the years. There's now a well-stocked section of science toys. And Meyer has started hosting science nights. The next one,slated for June 7 at the Park Ridge store, will double as a fundraiser—in addition to the usual science experiments and demonstrations, there will be a silent auction and live music. What will Meyer do with the money if the fundraising goal is reached? \"We have to move our warehouse,\" he said. \"It's too expensive, it's too big.\" Other plans include updating its operating software and updating the website. A quick look at theAbout Us pageof the current site shows the need for an update. It contains a warning that the \"heavy use of tables\" may not be supported in all browsers—paired with a suggestion to download Netscape Navigator. As of this writing, the GoFundMe campaign has raised $136,903. Meyer says contributing isn't just about supporting American Science & Surplus; it's about supporting local retail during a very challenging time. \"Who wants to buy everything at Amazon, Walmart, Temu, and Target?\" he asked.

    "title": "It’s here: Unboxing and setting up our Switch 2 review unit",
    "article_text": "Our Switch got here 14 hours early—here's what early adopters will see. As we'vementioned previously, Nintendo did not see fit to provide press with early review hardware for the Switch 2. Today, though, with the June 5 launch of the Switch 2 having already arrived in regions like Japan and Australia, the ever-efficient UPS driver delivered final retail hardware straight from Nintendo of America to the Ars Orbiting HQ. The 14-hour lead time between our receipt of the hardware and the midnight launch of the Switch 2 on the US East Coast isn't close to enough time to put together a comprehensive review. For now, though, we thought we'd take you through a pictorial journey of our unboxing and initial setup process, ahead of much more coverage to come. And while you peruse the images, we recommend listening to the absolute bop that is the Switch 2 setup music, which we've embedded below: The first thing we saw when powering on the Switch 2, after a Nintendo logo, was a short animation showing us how to attach the new snap-on Joy-Cons (which are packaged separately in the box). After that, the system confirmed our language, region, and time zone before asking to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi to download an update. We didn't see any option to skip this download, making it unclear what, if anything, you can do with a brand-new Switch 2 that doesn't have access to an Internet connection. After that quick update, the console explained a bit more about how to connect and remove the Joy-Cons from the Switch 2 tablet and from the color-coordinated holsters that come with the system. Then it was time to log in to my Nintendo account to enable a data transfer from the original Switch to its inevitable successor. This process only copies account information and save data to the new system; non-physical games themselves are downloaded separately after the transfer is complete (and can be managed between two consoles withthe new Virtual Game Card system). Once I brought the original Switch close by to start the transfer process, I was warned that save files for games includingAnimal Crossing: New HorizonsandPokémon: Let's Go Pikachuwould be removed from the original system during transfer, presumably as an anti-cheating measure. This made the whole process a bit nerve-wracking, though in the end my save files made it through with flying colors. Surprisingly, the wireless system transfer process also wouldn't move screenshots and gameplay videos stored on the original Switch. To move those over, I had to remove the physical microSD card from the Switch and temporarily insert it into the Switch 2. This was particularly perplexing since the Switch 2 seems toonly officially support MicroSD Express cardsfor everything but this one setup feature. We'vetalked beforeaboutthe relative size of the Switch 2compared to other portable game consoles like the original Switch and the Steam Deck. Still, there's something about seeing the hardware next to an original Game Boy or even a PlayStation Portable that really highlights how far handheld gaming hardware design has come in the last few decades. Holding a retail Switch 2 unit in our hands also reconfirmswhat we said during our April preview of the hardware; namely, the unit feels a bit more substantial in the hand than the original Switch, but still a good deal less bulky than portable PCs like the Steam Deck, both in terms of weight and overall thickness. While it's still early, we'd expect long-term portable play to be plenty comfortable here. On the control side, while the buttons and sticks on the Switch 2 are a little better suited to adult hands than those on the original Switch, they still feel a little on the small side when held right next to standard console controllers from Sony and Microsoft. That's not true of the Pro Controller 2, though, which will feel immediately familiar in size and shape to anyone who's played on a PlayStation or Xbox console in recent years. We'll have much more to say about our experience with the Switch 2 in the coming days and weeks. For now, leave us a comment if you have any specific questions that we might be able to answer as we put the console through its paces.

    "title": "Lawsuit: DOGE, HHS used “hopelessly error-ridden” data to fire 10,000 workers",
    "article_text": "Firing spree allegedly based on incorrect employee scores and other basic errors. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) teamed up with DOGE to fire 10,000 employees while relying on \"hopelessly error-ridden\" personnel records, aclass-action complaintfiled yesterday alleged. The lawsuit said the HHS terminated thousands of workers on April 1, shortly after sharing the flawed personnel records with the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and Office of Management and Budget (OMB). \"These agencies knew that the records were hopelessly error-ridden, and that the records should have been used, if at all, with great caution,\" said the lawsuit filed in US District Court for the District of Columbia. \"Instead of taking steps to verify the contents of the records and correct the systemic inaccuracies, the agencies promptly used them to fire 10,000 employees.\" The case was filed by a law firm founded by former Justice Department attorneys on behalf of seven named plaintiffs and all others who were laid off as part of the April 1 Reduction in Force (RIF). It alleges that the government violated the Privacy Act, whichrequiresagencies to verify the accuracy of information used as the basis for adverse actions against employees. \"Because the decision-makers at these agencies were working with such flawed data, they barely knew who they were cutting,\" lawyer Clayton Bailey said in apress release. Lawyer Jessica Merry Samuels said, \"politics aside, this is no way to treat civil servants who have dedicated their careers to public health and safety.\" Bailey and Samuels launched their firm, the Civil Service Law Center, to represent fired federal workers in lawsuits against the Trump administration. The lawsuit said the plaintiffs come from \"a range of offices and positions at HHS, from the Chief Information Officer of FDA, to an engineer working on mining safety at NIOSH [National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health], to an IT specialist with 34 years of experience at CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. They all suffered the same experience: losing their jobs as a result of flawed personnel records.\" The lawsuit points to public statements from HHS to support its contention that leaders knew the firings were based on false data. \"Almost immediately after the April 1 cuts, a spokesperson for HHS reported to multiple media outlets that 'to the extent there are errors, it is because the data collected by HHS's multiple, siloed HR divisions is inaccurate,'\" the lawsuit said. The lawsuit quotes Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as saying, \"Personnel that should not have been cut, were cut. We're reinstating them. And that was always the plan. Part of the—at DOGE, we talked about this from the beginning, is we're going to do 80 percent cuts, but 20 percent of those are going to have to be reinstated, because we'll make mistakes.\" With this remark to reporters, Kennedy \"acknowledged that the Department knew they were making mistakes in carrying out the RIF,\" the lawsuit said. But not all incorrectly fired employees were reinstated, according to the complaint. The defendants include HHS, Kennedy Jr., DOGE, Elon Musk, OMB, OMB Director Russell Vought, OPM, the FDA, and the CDC. The lawsuit said Musk was \"deeply involved in deciding where HHS would cut,\" and that \"the animus of [defendants] towards federal workers led them to ignore the many obvious red flags about the accuracy of the personnel data they were relying on, in order to terminate more people more quickly.\" The \"unreliable records hopelessly marred the image of various HHS offices and subcomponents that were being considered by Defendants for significant cuts, making entire offices more likely to be targeted by DOGE and others for elimination,\" the lawsuit said. The inaccurate data in many cases \"prevented Defendants from understanding even the basic composition of HHS offices.\" Additionally, \"these inaccurate and incomplete records fed directly into agency retention registers—the formal standings that rank employees against each other—making it less likely that Plaintiffs caught up in the RIF would be retained or offered favorable reassignment,\" the suit alleged. When plaintiff Catherine Jackson received her termination notice, she \"was surprised to see recent performance ratings that were flatly incorrect,\" the lawsuit said. Jackson worked in the Office of Child Care \"supporting the state of Alaska and American Indian tribes in their implementation of programs that help low-income families afford childcare.\" Jackson's notice \"reflected a recent performance rating of 3, but she had never received a score lower than 4. Defendants had clearly used an inaccurate personnel record in determining to include her in the RIF. She has not received an offer of reinstatement or reassignment. Ms. Jackson is 68 and struggling to find a new career to support her through to retirement; her retirement annuity would have vested in a few months.\" Plaintiff Carrie Greene's termination notice said she had received a 3 in a recent performance evaluation, even though \"she had never received a score lower than 5\" and in fact \"had received incentive awards based on her outstanding performance every year,\" the lawsuit said. Greene, who worked in the Administration for Children and Families, seemed to be \"included in the RIF because her personnel records incorrectly listed her duty station as the San Francisco, CA regional office, which was closed as part of the April 1 cuts,\" the lawsuit said. But her team was based in Washington, DC. Melissa Adams, a former Office of Grants Management employee, received a termination notice containing incorrect performance ratings along with \"an even more fundamental issue: Defendants did not seem to know where she worked,\" the lawsuit said. The defendants seemed to think that Adams was part of a Boston regional office, but she actually worked for a DC-based office and \"worked remotely in Massachusetts pursuant to a longstanding reasonable accommodation,\" the lawsuit said. \"Ms. Adams is a single mother searching for a new job to support her and her family,\" the lawsuit said. Plaintiff Vid Desai, former CIO of the FDA, received a termination notice that said \"he had received a 3 in each of his most recent performance evaluations,\" the lawsuit said. \"But this was inaccurate: his previous three performance reviews should all have rounded up to 5. As a direct result, he lost eight years of retention credit, which should have been used to determine whether he would be retained, terminated, or offered alternative assignments.\" Because of the mistakes, decision-makers apparently saw \"an office led by an under-performing executive when that was not accurate,\" the lawsuit said. \"As a result, on information and belief, Defendants chose to cut Mr. Desai and much of his team while keeping other IT functions.\" Desai's notice also allegedly contained other inaccurate and incomplete data. \"Mr. Desai's reputation as a high-level IT professional has been especially damaged by Defendants' actions,\" the lawsuit said. \"Defendants' disparaging comments about IT modernization and efficiency, combined with Mr. Desai's inclusion in the RIF, give the impression that he was responsible for those problems, despite his and his team's efforts over years to improve the IT environment.\" The Civil Service Law Center isinvitingother fired employees to join the lawsuit. \"Although the exact number and identity of class members is unknown to the Plaintiffs at this time and can only be ascertained through appropriate discovery, public reporting and interviews with potential class members suggest that many—and possibly most—of the RIF notices issued by the agency contained personnel-related errors,\" the lawsuit said. Other named plaintiffs include Shawn Chenault, a former product manager and marketing specialist in the FDA's Office of Digital Transformation; Brendan Demich, a former engineer in the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division of NIOSH; and Fonda Kornegay, a former IT systems analyst in the CDC. All three allegedly received termination notices containing inaccurate performance scores. \"The Pittsburgh Mining Research Division also appeared to decision-makers to have lower-performing employees than was accurate. After collecting and reviewing this erroneous data, Defendants chose to cut the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division while ultimately keeping some other portions of NIOSH open,\" the lawsuit said. The CDC's Office of Informatics, Governance, and Assurance, where Kornegay worked, \"also appeared to decision-makers to have lower-performing employees than was accurate\" and was eliminated, the lawsuit said. The FDA's Office of Digital Transformation wasn't eliminated entirely, but much of the office was cut based on similarly false records, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit asks for financial damages and a judgment \"that Defendants' use of inaccurate and incomplete data in connection with the April 1 RIF was unlawful.\" We contacted HHS about the lawsuit today and will update this article if we get a response.

    "title": "Are Dead Sea Scrolls older than we thought?",
    "article_text": "Combining radiocarbon dating and a new AI program called Enoch yields surprising results. Over the years, scholars of the Dead Sea Scrolls have analyzed the ancient parchments with various methods: for example, X-rays, multispectral imaging, \"virtual unfolding,\" andpaleography, i.e., studying elements in their writing styles. The scrolls are believed to date back to between the third century BCE and the first century CE, but those dates rely largely on paleography, since only a handful of the scrolls have calendar dates written on them. However, the traditional paleographic method is inherently subjective and based on a given scholar's experience. A team of scientists has combined radiocarbon dating from 24 scroll samples and machine-learning-based handwriting analysis to create their own AI program—dubbed Enoch. The objective was to achieve more accurate date estimates, according to anew paperpublished in the journal PLoS ONE. Among the findings: Many of the scrolls are older than previously thought. Asreported earlier, these ancient Hebrew texts—roughly900 full and partial scrollsin all, stored in clay jars—were first discovered scattered in various caves near what was once the settlement ofQumran, just north of the Dead Sea, by Bedouin shepherds in 1946–1947. (Apparently, a shepherd threw a rock while searching for a lost member of his flock and accidentally shattered one of the clay jars, leading to the discovery.) Qumran wasdestroyed by the Romans, circa 73 CE, and historians believe the scrolls were hidden in the caves by a sect called the Essenes to protect them from being destroyed. The natural limestone and conditions within the caves helped preserve the scrolls for millennia. This isn't the first time that AI tools have been applied to analyzing the handwriting on the Dead Sea Scrolls. Back in 2020,we reportedon an AI-aided handwriting analysis of theGreat Isaiah Scroll. Most scholars believed that the Isaiah Scroll was copied by a single scribe due to the seemingly uniform handwriting style. But others have suggested that it may be the work of two scribes writing in a similar style, each copying one of the scroll's two distinct halves. The2020 analysis revealedthat the text was indeed likely written by two scribes. It also showed that the second scribe's handwriting was more variable than the first's, although the two styles were quite similar, indicating a possible common training. The authors of this latest paper wanted to find a better means than paleography alone for determining the chronology of the scrolls, with an eye toward reconstructing the evolution of ideas. They thought that given the small data set in the case of the scrolls, it was wisest not to rely on a pre-trained model and instead \"let the available data speak.\" The development of Enoch grew out of the team's earlier deep neural network for ferreting out handwritten ink-trace patterns in digitized manuscripts, involving micro-level geometric shape analysis. \"Enoch emphasizes shared characteristics and similarity matching between trained and test manuscripts, where traditional paleography focuses on subtle differences that are assumed to be indicative for style development,\" the authors wrote. \"Combining dissimilarity matching and adaptive reinforcement learning can uncover hidden patterns.\" They tested Enoch by having paleographic experts evaluate the AI program's age estimate for several scrolls. The results: About 79 percent of Enoch's estimates were deemed \"realistic,\" while its age estimates for the remaining 21 percent were either too young, too old, or just indecisive. This new model revealed that many of the Dead Sea Scrolls are older than previous estimates based solely on paleography. That should be relevant for the question of when two ancient Jewish script styles—\"Hasmonean\" and \"Herodian\"—developed, for example. The former script was thought to have emerged between 150–50 BCE, but the authors believe Hasmonean could have emerged much earlier; ditto for the Herodian script. So both scripts may have coexisted since the late second century, challenging the prevailing view that they preexisted by the mid-first century BCE. Enoch may even be able to shed light on biblical authorship. For instance, the authors concluded that two of the scrolls are the first known fragments of the Book of Daniel, believed to have been finished by an anonymous author around 160 BCE. And Ecclesiastes was likely completed by an anonymous author in the third century BCE, rather than by King Solomon in the 10th century BCE. “With the Enoch tool we have opened a new door into the ancient world, like a time machine, that allows us to study the hands that wrote the Bible, especially now that we have established, for the first time, that two biblical scroll fragments come from the time of their presumed authors,” the authors wrote. “It is very exciting to set a significant step into solving the dating problem of the Dead Sea Scrolls and also creating a new tool that could be used to study other partially dated manuscript collections from history.\" PLoS ONE, 2025.

    "title": "Review: At $349, AMD’s 16GB Radeon RX 9060 XT is the new midrange GPU to beat",
    "article_text": "If that $349 price is real then it's a great deal; if it's not real, it depends. Now that most of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards have been released, it's clear that they give AMD and Intel their best opportunity this decade to claw back some market share and make the dedicated graphics card business a little less lopsided. It's not that the 50-series GPUs have beenbadcards, but a focus on sometimes-useful, sometimes-not AI-generated frames and a lack of major manufacturing advancements relative to the 40-series have eroded Nvidia's usual lead in performance and power efficiency. That's the advantage AMD is trying to press withthe new Radeon RX 9060 XT graphics cards, which at $299 and $349 for 8GB and 16GB are both priced and configured to comprehensively undercut Nvidia's RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti. As with theRX 9070 seriesearlier this year, the RDNA 4 architecture goes a long way toward addressing the RX 6000 and RX 7000-series' lackluster ray-tracing performance and mediocre power efficiency, and a relatively affordable 16GB version will help insulate buyers from the RAM limitations that are slowly but surely becoming more of a problem for 8GB cards. With the usual 2025 GPU caveat—the difference between a \"good\" GPU and a \"bad\" one is whether you can actually find one and buy it for anything close to the list price—let's dive into one of the few genuinely exciting midrange GPUs we've gotten in a while. On paper, the 9060 XT series looks a lot like last generation's RX 7600 and RX 7600 XT. All of those GPUs have 32 of AMD's compute units, and all are connected to either 8GB or 16GB of GDDR6 via a 128-bit memory interface. But AMD says that each RDNA4 CU is much more capable than in previous architectures—when the 9070 series was introduced, AMD said that an RDNA4 CU could render roughly twice as fast as an RDNA2 CU or 2.5 times faster for ray-tracing workloads. The RX 7600 and 7600 XT only improved over the RX 6650 XT by a few percentage points, but the 9060 XT should be a bigger upgrade. The 9060 XT's Navi 44 silicon is also manufactured using a 4 nm TSMC process rather than the 6 nm process used for the 7600 series. You can already see that in the lower total board power (TBP) figures for both cards: The 16GB 9060 XT starts 30 W lower than the RX 7600 XT, and the 8GB 9060 XT starts 15 W lower than the vanilla RX 7600. The cards' power consumption will vary slightly based on the settings your GPU's manufacturer uses and what settings you select in the Tuning section of the Adrenalin software. Officially, AMD publishes a range of TBP figures for the 9060 series rather than a single default number. For the 8GB card, that range runs from 150 W to 182 W; for the 16GB card, it ranges from 160 W to 182 W. AMD says the 150 and 160 W baselines should represent the ideal spot on the efficiency curve, where performance-per-watt is greatest. But OEMs can choose a higher default to try to squeeze out a bit more performance, and users will generally be able to set their own GPUs to operate at the bottom or top of that TBP range using \"favor efficiency\" or \"favor performance\" buttons in the Adrenalin app. As long as your card is being adequately cooled, a card with a higher TBP should be able to maintain higher clock speeds for a bit longer, boosting performance. Presumably, using a higher TBP setting will also improve the cards' overclocking headroom somewhat, but you'll also be at the mercy of the silicon lottery. Our ASRock review unit shipped with a default TBP of 170 W, and all of our testing reflects that slightly higher-than-baseline TBP. It only has a single 8-pin power connector, and we'd bet that most GPUs from most of AMD's partners ship the same way. One nice thing for users of slightly older systems is that the 9060 XT uses a full 16-lane PCI Express 5.0 interface. The GPU does notneed16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 bandwidth, but older PCs that only support PCIe 4.0 or even 3.0 should still have sufficient bandwidth for it, something that has occasionally been an issue for midrange cards that have shifted to eight-lane PCIe interfaces. Our gaming testbed uses the same configuration we've been using sincethe RTX 5090 reviewearlier this year. It's powered by an eight-core Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, which is way, way more CPU than you need for any of these midrange GPUs. They will generally perform just as well with any relatively recent Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 processor. But it ensures that the CPU is never limiting the GPU, eliminating one important variable when we see slow or otherwise weird results in our benchmarks. We tested the 9060 XT mostly at 1080p and 1440p resolutions and compared it primarily to the last-generation Radeon RX 7600, 7600 XT, 7700 XT, and 9070; Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060, 5060, and 5060 Ti; and Intel's Arc B580. Where available, we've also included some results for older cards—the GeForce RTX 3060 and 3070 and the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT—to give people a sense of what they can expect if they haven't upgraded their GPU in a few years. The 8GB and 16GB versions of the 9060 XT are basically drop-in replacements for last generation's RX 7600 and RX 7600 XT, which, despite the \"XT\" in the name, were mostly the same GPU with 16GB of RAM instead of 8GB. We only had the 16GB version of the card available to test, but we can make some broad assumptions by comparing the 8GB and 16GB versions of the 7600 and seeing which games seem to struggle disproportionately with less RAM. At 1440p, the 9060 XT usually runs between 22 and 62 percent faster than the RX 7600 XT in games without ray-tracing effects enabled. That's a solid generational jump that makes a strong case for the 9060 XT as an entry-level 1440p GPU. These $300–$400 GPUs have been marketed primarily as 1080p cards for a long time, and the 9060 XT will also pair well with a high-refresh-rate 1080p monitor, but people looking to play games at 1440p for less than $400 have a good option here if they can find this card at or near its list price. The 9060 XT isn't quite as fast as a last-generation RX 7700 XT (originally $449) or RX 6800 (originally $580, in 2020 dollars), but it comes pretty close. In games with ray-tracing effects enabled, the 9060 XT soundly beats the 7700 XT and 6800 and runs some games likeCyberpunk 2077around twice as fast as the old 7600 XT. Nvidia still has a small edge here—the 9060 XT is slightly faster than the RTX 5060 but slower than the 5060 Ti. But AMD has narrowed the gap quite a bit, to the extent that ray tracing isn't nearly the liability for AMD that it once was. You may or may not care about these fancy lighting effects, but some games are already beginning to require ray-tracing support, and it's likely to become more common over the next few years. Compared to Nvidia's offerings, the 9060 XT sits between the $299 8GB RTX 5060 and the supposed-to-be-$429 16GB 5060 Ti. It generally outperforms the 5060 by a small but consistent margin across the board (the one exception being inBlack Myth Wukong, where Nvidia cards still generally do better than AMD's), and it generally loses to the 5060 Ti by 10 or 15 percent. Given that 16GB 5060 Ti cards are actually going for closer to $500 right now, the 9060 XT at $349 is still a more economical choice if you can find one. One important win for AMD here: The 16GB 9060 XT is usually 40 to 60 percent faster than 2021's RTX 3060. If you have one of those cards, you're probably still getting decent performance out of it. But AMD is offering  a relatively affordable upgrade path that bumps you up from 12GB of RAM to 16GB rather than making you step down to 8GB, as both the RTX 4060 and 5060 do. If you have a 3060 and you're looking for a relatively affordable way to play more games at 1440p or at higher settings, AMD's new card might get you there. As for power efficiency, the 9060 XT is a huge improvement, consuming roughly the same amount of power as the 8GB RX 7600 or Nvidia's RTX 3060 but performing considerably faster than either. The 5060 Ti still has a tiny edge here—power consumption is similar, and performance is a tiny bit better—but as with ray-tracing performance, the gap has closed enough that it's no longer a strong selling point in favor of Nvidia. If you frequent any of the tech YouTube channels that traffic in GPU reviews, you'd think that 8GB cards are pointless trash, junk you'd throw in a hole before you'd sully your gaming PC with it. A lot of that complaining—not all, but a lot of it—involves turning a game's resolution up to 4K and all the textures up to Ultra and then pointing out that things don't run, which is a bit like buying a Zippo lighter and complaining that it isn't a flamethrower. Sure, 8GB of RAM is insufficient in these scenarios, but you're also talking about settings and resolutions that the GPUs would struggle with, even with unlimited video RAM. With all of that said, we are noticing a handful of cases where Ultra settings at 1440p or even 1080p were occasionally challenging for our 8GB cards. Sometimes these issues were on-and-off; cards like the 8GB RTX 4060 would perform fine in a test likeBlack Myth Wukongon some runs but abruptly turn into a flipbook on other runs. The 8GB version of the 7060 wouldn't run theBlack Myth Wukongbenchmark at high settings in 1440p at all, and running it at 1080p eventually resulted in either slowdown or crashing midway through.Cyberpunkand even the somewhat less-demandingReturnalstruggle more on the 8GB RX 7600 than they do on the 16GB RX 7600 XT. These are edge cases in individual games, and lowering resolutions or settings resolves the issues. But if you're spending $350 to $400 or more on a GPU in 2025, you should try to avoid 8GB cards if you can. It used to be the case that these low-end-to-midrange GPUs weren't good for much above 1080p anyway, but the 5060 Ti and 9060 XT are both fast enough to be decent 1440p graphics cards when they're equipped with the right amount of RAM. Are the 8GB versions totally pointless? No. But they do leave performance on the table, and the problem will get worse over time. At this point in 2025's graphics card market, the issue isn't so much that mainstream cards like the 5060, 5070, or 9070 aren't available but that they are rarely available for their stated retail price. This has always been an issue with AMD, Nvidia, and Intel's board partners, who try to add things like fancy cooling, lighting, or marginal overclocks to justify raising the price. But MSRP cards are currently vanishingly rare, and it's hard to know where the 9060 XT's price willactuallyfall. Using Newegg listings for cards that are in stock, Intel's \"$249\" Arc B580 is available for $299 at best. Thereisone $299 RTX 5060 from Gigabyte available, but the rest of them cost at least $320. The $349 8GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti actually starts at $390, and the $429 version starts closer to $490 new. The $549 RTX 5070 is more like $600 or $610. The $549 RX 9070 starts at $650 instead, and the $599 RX 9070 XT at $720 or more. You get the picture—you can buy a lot of graphics cards, but the actual prices are somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 to $100 more than they ought to be. If you're in the market for a GPU and you can actually get the 16GB version of the RX 9060 XT at $349, you should do it because it's clearly better and more future-proof than anything else available at that price, and the 5060 Ti's advantages are totally moot when it costs almost $150 more. But be aware of your other options and their actual costs if you can't find anything at the advertised list price. Imagine a better world with me: Companies that design and manufacture graphics cards announce new products and reveal pricing for those products, and then it's possible to go into a brick-and-mortar or online store and buy those products for the price that was originally announced. Wouldn't that be nice? But that's not the world we live in, due to many factors: thedeath of Moore's Law, inflation, tariffs and general economic uncertainty, and the fact that companies can make much more money selling GPUs as AI accelerators than they can selling similar silicon to people who play video games. I feel like a broken record because I've had to devote some portion ofeveryGPU review I've done in the last six months to the Pricing and Availability Situation, but it's just unavoidable at this point. I can review this GPU and its probably-pretend retail price against a bunch of other GPUs and their pretend retail prices, but the actual pricing and availability are a mystery to me. Take this for whatever it's worth: If all current-generation graphics cards were available at their advertised MSRPs, I'd say the 16GB version of the RX 9060 XT is the midrange graphics card to beat right now, a card that most people should buy instead of an RTX 5060 or RTX 5060 Ti. The $299 version with 8GB of memory is also probably fine, but it's worth the extra money to future-proof it—leave the 8GB cards to the pre-built PCs at this point. What will the RX 9060 XT actually cost when the dust settles? Who knows. But at a baseline, the RTX 50-series is underwhelming, and the RX 90-series is more attractive than AMD's last couple of GPU generations have been. You're no longer accepting a big dip in power efficiency or ray-tracing performance just because you're picking an AMD card. Nvidia can still count benefits like DLSS upscaling and frame generation as advantages, but they're notsoinvaluable compared to the modern FSR equivalents that they're worth paying a ton of money for. For the first time in years, AMD feels like it has a midrange GPU offering that I could recommend without caveats—with the caveat that it actually needs to be available at the price AMD is advertising.

    "article_text": "Sales are booming in Norway. Everywhere else, less so. Tesla CEO Elon Musk's big government adventure appears to be at an end.As promised in April, Musk has returned his attention to his car company, which is facing serious headwinds. In the first quarter of the year, Tesla sold tens of thousands fewer electric vehicles than it did the year before, despite a rise in worldwide EV sales. Data from April looked even worse, withsubstantial sales declines in Europeand China. May's numbers don't look much better. Although Tesla only publishes its global production and sales numbers—and only at the end of each quarter—some countries provide monthly new car registration information, making it possible to track sales on a national level. And according to Germany's KBA, in May, Tesla sales fell by just over 36 percent year over year, even as overall EV registrations increased by 45 percent. At least that's a few hundred more cars than it managed in April. Similar trendswere seen in the UK and Italy. In the UK, Tesla sales decreased by 45 percent, even as overall EV sales increased by 28 percent. In Italy, EV sales increased by almost 41 percent, but Tesla's deliveries dropped by 20 percent. The slide isn't quite as bad in China, where Tesla faces stiff competition from local brands that undercut it with low prices while providing a wealth of features that are either unavailable in Teslas or cost extra.According to Reuters, Tesla's Shanghai factory delivered 15 percent fewer vehicles in May than it did last year, a number that includes both exports to Europe and local sales. A rare spot of good news is that Norway—which has one of the highest adoption rates of EVs in the world—has seen a huge 213 percent increase year over year. Turning around shrinking sales is just one of Musk's challenges at Tesla. Even though much of the company's production is vertically integrated, its US factories arestill exposed to increased costs due to the Trump tariffson imported auto parts, which make up about 20 percent of a Tesla's content. Allegedly, Musk was unaware of this impacton a recent visit to Tesla HQ. The industry-wide shift from CCS1 to Tesla-style NACS charging plugs isprogressing so slowly that the New Jersey Turnpike isreplacing Superchargerswith machines that can service both types. Will others follow suit? Now that we're into June, the clock is ticking on the rollout of Tesla's autonomous taxi service in Austin, Texas, which suffered a branding setback when the companywas denied a trademarkon the word \"robotaxi.\" And finally, the CEO appears to be at odds with his political allies, taking to social media to express his hostility toward the proposed Republican budget and promising to \"fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Samsung teams up with Glance to use your face in AI-generated lock screen ads",
    "article_text": "Glance AI is coming to numerous Samsung phones as an opt-in experience this month. On an average day, you might unlock or look at your phone dozens of times, which makes the lock screen a hot property for advertising. Ad tech company Glance has been taking advantage of that for years with itsad-laden lock screen experiences, but it's going further in the age of AI. Samsung and Glance have teamed up to deliver a new \"AI shopping\" experience that uses a selfie to create custom fashion ads. This feature is rolling out to numerous Samsung phones in the next month. Glance has been around for a while—its non-AI lock screen experience has been bundled on various phones from Samsung, Motorola, and others. Before the AI era, Glance lured people in with promises of pretty pictures and news alerts, which came with a side of ads and tracking. The new Glance AI feature has all that, but it adds an unsettling face-stealing layer to the experience. The AI-infused Glance will arrive on Samsung phones as both a standalone app and a fully integrated lock screen. Thankfully, this is a fully opt-in experience. If you never open or set up Glance, you can keep using the normal lock screen on your phone. Credit:\n\n          \n          Glance Should you choose to wade into the murky waters of AI shopping, Glance will have you take a selfie and provide some basic body type details. From there, it uses Google Gemini and Imagen to create fashion ads tailored to you—because theyareyou. Your lock screen will be populated with images of you \"in outfits and destinations [you] would never imagine.\" Naturally, you will be able to buy the looks chosen for you with a tap, which fills Glance's coffers. We've looked overGlance's AI privacy policy, and nothing stands out as unusual for the tech industry (which still isn't good). By using the service, you agree to some tracking, including your general location, and some of that data will be shared with partners. However, this all feels a bit more creepy when a service is churning out AI images of you. Glance says it will retain the biometric data used to create your digital avatar for 12 months from your last interaction with the service or until you manually delete your account. The company claims that your images won't be used for any other purpose or shared with third parties without your consent. Glance is not the only company hoping to motivate buyers with custom AI images. At Google I/O last month, the company unveiled shopping in its AI Mode search product.Virtual try-onallows you to generate AI images of yourself on demand to see how you look in items that appear in the shopping results. The Glance AI experience is somewhat more alarming because it's constantly generating new images of you wearing clothing, which may be based on \"trending content, local events, and social media moments.\" If you are totally on board with this kind of shopping experience or are just morbidly curious, you can test the service in the standaloneGlance AI appin the Play Store. On Samsung phones, the app and lock screen will roll out via the company's Galaxy Store. That process begins today on all phones from the Galaxy S22, S23, S24, and S25 lineups.Glance saysit hopes to have its AI shopping fully deployed on an even wider range of Samsung phones within 30 days.

    "title": "Top CDC COVID vaccine expert resigns after RFK Jr. unilaterally restricts access",
    "article_text": "The expert said she could no longer help vulnerable people in her CDC role. A top expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was overseeing the process to update COVID-19 vaccine recommendations resigned on Tuesday. The resignation, first reported byThe Associated Pressand confirmed byCBS News, comes just a week after health secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unilaterallyrevoked and altered some of the CDC's recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines, restricting access to children and pregnant people. The resignation also comes three weeks before CDC's experts and advisors are scheduled to meet to publicly evaluate data and discuss the recommendations for this season—a long-established process that was disrupted by Kennedy's announcement. The departing CDC official, Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, a pediatric infectious disease expert, was a co-leader of a working group on COVID-19 vaccines who advised experts on the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). She informed her ACIP colleagues of her resignation in an email on Tuesday. \"My career in public health and vaccinology started with a deep-seated desire to help the most vulnerable members of our population, and that is not something I am able to continue doing in this role,\" Panagiotakopoulos wrote. Previously, the CDC and ACIP recommended COVID-19 vaccines for everyone ages 6 months and up. Experts have emphasized that pregnant people in particular should get vaccinated, as pregnancy suppresses the immune system and puts pregnant people at high risk of severe COVID-19 and death. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that \"COVID-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic.\" Further,dozens of studies have foundthat the vaccines are safe and effective at protecting the pregnant person, the pregnancy, and newborns. But in the announcement last week, Kennedy celebrated revoking the recommendation. TheCDC's immunization schedulefor adults was subsequently edited to say that pregnant people should \"delay vaccination until after pregnancy if vaccine is indicated.\" Kennedy also gleefully said he was revoking recommendations for vaccinating healthy children. But the CDC'sedited immunization scheduledid not remove the recommendation outright; rather, it simply added a stipulation that a child's doctor and parents agree on the vaccination, described as \"shared clinical decision-making.\" It's unclear what both changes will mean in practice for children and pregnant people who want to get vaccinated, including whether vaccines will continue to be covered by health insurance. Regardless, the confusion and unorthodox changes are expected to further deter vaccination. \"More of us should be resigning in protest,\" one federal health official told CBS News in response to Panagiotakopoulos' resignation. ACIP is scheduled to meet June 25–27 to publicly discuss COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Science PhDs face a challenging and uncertain future",
    "article_text": "Smaller post-grad classes are likely due to research budget cuts. Since the National Science Foundation first started collecting postgraduation data nearly 70 years ago, the number of PhDs awarded in the United States has consistently risen. Last year, more than 45,000 studentsearneddoctorates in science and engineering, about an eight-fold increase compared to 1958. But this level of production of science and engineering PhD students is now in question. Facing significant cuts to federal science funding, some universities havereduced or pausedtheir PhD admissions for the upcoming academic year. In response, experts are beginning to wonder about the short and long-term effects those shifts will have on the number of doctorates awarded and the consequentimpact on scienceif PhD production does drop. Such questions touch on longstanding debates about academic labor. PhD training is a crucial part of nurturing scientific expertise. At the same time, some analysts have worried about anoversupply of PhDsin some fields, while students havesuggestedthat universities are exploiting them aslow-cost labor. Many budding scientists go into graduate school with the goal of staying in academia and ultimately establishing their own labs. For at least 30 years, there has beentalkof a mismatch between the number of doctorates and the limited academic job openings. According toan analysis conducted in 2013, only 3,000 faculty positions in science and engineering are added each year—even though more than 35,000 PhDs are produced in these fields annually. Decades of this asymmetrical dynamic has created a hypercompetitive and high-pressure environment in the academic world, said Siddhartha Roy, an environmental engineer at Rutgers University who co-authored arecent studyon tenure-track positions in engineering. “If we look strictly at academic positions, we have a huge oversupply, and it's not sustainable,” he said. But while the academic job market remains challenging, experts point out that PhD training also prepares individuals for career paths in industry, government, and other science and technology fields. If fewer doctorates are awarded and funding continues to be cut, some argue, American science will weaken. “The immediate impact is there's going to be less science,” said Donna Ginther, a social researcher who studies scientific labor markets at the University of Kansas. In the long run, that could mean scientific innovations, such as new drugs or technological advances, will stall, she said: “We're leaving that scientific discovery on the table.” Historically, one of the main goals of training PhD students has been to retain those scientists as future researchers in their respective fields. “Academia has a tendency to want to produce itself, reproduce itself,” said Ginther. “Our training is geared towards creating lots of mini-mes.” But it is no secret in the academic world that tenure-track faculty positions are scarce, andthe road to obtaining tenure is difficult. Although it varies across different STEM fields, the number of doctorates granted each year consistently surpass the number of tenure-track positions available. Asurveygathering data from the 2022-2023 academic year, conducted by the Computing Research Association, found that around 11 percent of PhD graduates in computational science (for which employment data was reported) moved on to tenure-track faculty positions. Roy found a similar figure for engineering: Around one out of every eight individuals who obtain their doctorate—12.5 percent—will eventually land a tenure-track faculty position, a trend that remained stable between 2014 and 2021, the last year for which his team analyzed data. The bottleneck in faculty positions, according to one recentstudy, leads about 40 percent of postdoctoral researchers to leave academia. However, in recent years, researchers who advise graduate students have begun to acknowledge careers beyond academia, including positions in industry, nonprofits, government, consulting, science communication, and policy. “We need, as academics, need to take a broader perspective on what and how we prepare our students,” said Ginther. As opposed to faculty positions, some of these labor markets can be more robust and provide plenty of opportunities for those with a doctorate, said Daniel Larremore, a computer scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder who studies academic labor markets, among other topics. Whether there is a mismatch between the number of PhDs and employment opportunities will depend on the subject of study and which fields are growing or shrinking, he added. For example, he pointed out that there is currently a boom in machine learning and artificial intelligence, so there is a lot of demand from industry for computer science graduates. In fact, commitments to industry jobs after graduation seem to be at a30-year high. But not all newly minted PhDs immediately find work. According to the latestNSF data, students in biological and biomedical sciences experienced a decline in job offers in the past 20 years, with 68 percent having definite commitments after graduating in 2023, compared to 72 percent in 2003. “The dynamics in the labor market for PhDs depends very much on what subject the PhD is in,” said Larremore. Still, employment rates reflect that postgraduates benefit from greater opportunities compared to the general population. In 2024, the unemployment rate for college graduates with a doctoral degree in the US was 1.2 percent, less than half the national average at the time, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In NSF’s recent survey, 74 percent of science and engineering graduating doctorates had definite commitments for employment or postdoctoral study or training positions, three points higher than it was in 2003. “Overproducing for the number of academic jobs available? Absolutely,” said Larremore. “But overproducing for the economy in general? I don't think so.” The experts who spoke with Undark described science PhDs as a benefit for society: Ultimately, scientists with PhDs contribute to the economy of a nation, be it through academia or alternative careers. Many are now concerned about the impact that cuts to scientific research may have on that contribution. Already, there are reports of universitiesscaling backgraduate student admissions in light of funding uncertainties, worried that they might not be able to cover students’ education and training costs. Those changes could result in smaller graduating classes in future years. Smaller classes of PhD students might not be a bad thing for academia, given the limited faculty positions, said Roy. And for most non-academic jobs, Roy said, a master's degree is more than sufficient. However, people with doctorates do contribute to other sectors like industry, government labs, and entrepreneurship, he added. In Ginther’s view, fewer scientists with doctoral training could deal a devastating blow for the broader scientific enterprise. “Science is a long game, and the discoveries now take a decade or two to really hit the market, so it's going to impinge on future economic growth.” These long-term impacts of reductions in funding might be hard to reverse and could lead to the withering of the scientific endeavor in the United States, Larremore said: “If you have a thriving ecosystem and you suddenly halve the sunlight coming into it, it simply cannot thrive in the way that it was.” This article was originally published onUndark.

    "title": "An in-space propulsion company just raised a staggering amount of money",
    "article_text": "\"The Space Force said, 'Hey, we know what that thing's for.'\" This week an in-space propulsion company, Impulse Space, announced that it had raised a significant amount of money, $300 million. This follows a fundraising round just last year in which the Southern California-based company raised $150 million. This is one of the largest capital raises in space in a while, especially for a non-launch company. To understand why Impulse was able to raise so much additional money so quickly, Ars caught up with founder Tom Mueller and the company's chief executive, Eric Romo. They explained that demand for Impulse's efficient in-space vehicles is high, and since early missions have worked well, the company wants to seize the moment to scale up its operations. \"We had been operating relatively conservatively, in how many people we were allowing ourselves to hire and capital expenditures,\" Romo said. \"This will allow us to release a little bit of that conservatism and lean into some stuff like electric propulsion and potentially other vehicles that are going to allow us to grow long-term.\" The company presently has about 250 employees, and they are crammed into the company's 60,000-square-foot facility in Redondo Beach. Impulse would like to reach 300 employees by the end of the year and find a larger headquarters for its expanding vision. Although Impulse Space is only about 4 years old, it has already had some sparkling successes and is nearing completion of a new vehicle called Helios that could meaningfully improve the ability of SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy to ship large payloads to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the Solar System. The company's initial product was the Mira spacecraft, powered by nitrous oxide and ethane thrusters. It can move payloads up to 300 kg around in space, and for a 100 kg payload, it offers 900 m/s of Delta-V. With Mira, Impulse sought to tackle the problem of mobility once a spacecraft reached orbit. Mira proved a success almost immediately, with the first vehicle launching in 2023 and operating for a year in space, demonstrating ample mobility before finally depleting its propellant tanks. A second mission, LEO Express-2, launched in January with several hosted payloads and, so far, has met all of its objectives. The mission remainsongoing. Initially, it was believed that this vehicle would be useful for providing \"last mile\" services for spacecraft launched as a part of rideshare missions. \"The reality is the market for that is not very good,\" Romo said. \"If you're gonna size that market, it's basically the market Rocket Lab serves today, which is 25 to 30 flights a year, which is fine. You can do that, but not economically very well. Your gross margins won't be good. Your working capital kind of sucks. So that's not at all the market that we're after with Mira.\" Since Mira has had ample success during its first two flights, other customers have taken notice. \"It's a high-thrust, high-maneuverability spacecraft that can operate anywhere up to GEO,\" Romo said. \"And so when you're thinking about space defense and space control, they need rapid response. So we'll move from one part of GEO to another very rapidly. And we can host payloads, like what Anduril makes, such as electronic warfare payloads, and then potentially doing proximity ops missions. So Mira wasn't necessarily designed out of the gate for that, but what we found out after we flew it successfully was, the Space Force said, 'Hey, we know what that thing's for.'\" After Mira, Impulse Space has been working on the largerHelios vehicle, which is designed to ride as a kick-stage on various large rockets. Helios packs a real punch, with an engine capable of producing 15,000 pounds of thrust and the ability to move a multi-ton payload from low-Earth orbit to geostationary space in less than a day. Mueller also said he believes that Helios has significant implications for interplanetary science missions. \"It just really increases your payload capacity,\" he said. \"We looked at a case where a rocket can throw less than 2 tons to Mars. But with Helios, it was like 11 tons. So it's just a huge advantage.\" The company is currently targeting a launch of Helios in the third quarter of next year andrecently securedthree Falcon 9 launches to launch its first three Helios spacecraft. It is natural for Mueller to work with SpaceX, of course. He was a founding employee and led the company's propulsion department for more than a decade. Once he saw that launch was becoming a solved problem, Mueller moved on to what he saw as the next frontier, taking advantage of that launch capacity and improving the ability of spacecraft to move around in low-Earth orbit and beyond. \"We want to open up the capabilities of LEO and above and greatly reduce the cost of getting anywhere else past LEO,\" he said. \"There are lots of things that we've dreamt about for decades, like a base on the Moon or mining asteroids or putting humans on Mars. We want to see lots of things happen, and hopefully we can reduce the cost and help make it happen.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "Chunghwa Telecom and Netlock customers must look elsewhere for new certificates. Google says its Chrome browser will stop trusting certificates from two certificate authorities after “patterns of concerning behavior observed over the past year” diminished trust in their reliability. The two organizations, Taiwan-based Chunghwa Telecom and Budapest-based Netlock, are among the dozens of certificate authorities trusted by Chrome and most other browsers to provide digital certificates that encrypt traffic and certify the authenticity of sites. With the ability to mint cryptographic credentials that cause address bars to display a padlock, assuring the trustworthiness of a site, these certificate authorities wield significant control over the security of the web. “Over the past several months and years, we have observed a pattern of compliance failures, unmet improvement commitments, and the absence of tangible, measurable progress in response to publicly disclosed incident reports,” members of the Chrome security teamwrote Tuesday. “When these factors are considered in aggregate and considered against the inherent risk each publicly-trusted CA poses to the internet, continued public trust is no longer justified.” According to Ryan Hurst, a researcher with over two decades of experience working with certificate authorities, such certificate distrust events occur aboutonce every 15 months. The reasons for the revocations vary widely. Hurst provided the following graph tracking the frequency of reasons for past events: Google cited no specific incidents. Hurst, however, said past offenses included: Chrome will stop trusting all certificates issued by Chunghwa Telecom and Netlock after July 31. Certificates issued after that date will, by default, display anerror pageon Chrome. The delay is designed to give those organizations' customers time to find new certificate authorities.

    "title": "The Incredible Action in ‘Ballerina’ Masks How Dumb the Rest of It Is",
    "article_text": "At a certain point while watchingBallerina, the latest film intheJohn WickUniverse, I did something I rarely do while watching a movie. Something I’ve vehemently fought against in the past. And yet in this case, it felt wholly necessary becausethe film posed a dichotomythe likes of which I haven’t seen in a long, long time. That’s how it happened that, while watchingBallerina, I did the unthinkable. I stopped watching with a critical eye, and I’m very glad I did. I fully admit this is not an ideal situation, and normally I’d be very against this. On many occasions, after giving a negative review to something, someone will say to me, “Oh, just turn your brain off and enjoy it.” To that, my response is always, “Well, if it was actually good, I shouldn’t have to.”Ballerina, however, is somehow both not good and also incredibly good at the same time. It’s a mostly brainless, cold, cookie-cutter revenge movie that has so much unfathomable yet enjoyable action in it that the two are completely at odds. How can a movie this lame have such entertaining action? Why is such care being paid to these action sequences when the story and emotion are so surface? It’s very odd, a little confusing, and why, without even knowing it happened, I did what I always say you shouldn’t do. I shut my brain off. As a professional critic, that’s not the easiest thing to do. Out of habit, you watch almost everything with that eye. What’s good about it? What’s bad about it? What’s working? What’s not? Why do I like this? Why do I not? ButBallerinafeels as if it was constructed from two completely different points of view. On one hand, it’s rather clear that, despite some effort early on, the film is not particularly concerned with being narratively rewarding or complex. However, it is very interested in showcasing action and stunts unlike anything you’ve ever seen before, and in that aim, it is wildly successful. Set mostly between the events of the second and thirdJohn Wickmovies,Ballerinastars Ana de Armas as Eve. Eve is an orphan who finds herself training in the way of the Ruska Roma, just like everyone’s favorite dog-loving assassin, John Wick. The film does an admirable job of explaining how Eve found herself in this situation, complete with an origin story and more, but eventually that all takes a back seat. Eve wants to kill the people who killed her father. Even the fact she trained as a ballerina, the literal title of the movie, never really comes back. This is about revenge, plain and simple. And so Eve goes from place to place looking for information that will lead her to a mysterious organization that killed her father. All of which is not in the slightest bit interesting. From the first second of the film, we can guess almost precisely what’s going to happen at each stage because we’ve seen it a million times before. However, each of these places does allow director Len Wiseman and his team to showcase different environments, styles, and weapons that can be breathtaking. There’s a scene with a car in an alley that’ll drop your jaw. An underground battle with grenades that’s completely unbelievable but also hilariously awesome. And then there’s the flamethrower fight that is so beyond excellent, you can’t help but enjoy it simply because you are in awe of what you are watching. Those scenes are all done so well that, for a few minutes, you forget you don’t care about anything else happening. You just want more of this dynamic, innovative action. Plus, de Armas is just a star. She’s hugely charismatic and believable as this character who we hope we’ll get to see more of. Along the way, Eve runs into characters new and old in theWickfranchise, played by the likes of Anjelica Huston, Lance Reddick, Ian McShane, Gabriel Byrne, and Norman Reedus, to name a few. It’s an impressive cast. Then, eventually, there’s Wick himself, reprised by Keanu Reeves. It’s great to see him again but his inclusion actually works against the rest of the film. Having such a strong force introduced into the film somehow makes both Wick and Eve feel less capable than everything else we’ve seen. We understand the impetus to put him in, even just for marketing, but the movie would’ve been better without him. The movie would’ve been better with a lot of things, though. A more interesting story, better characters, deeper emotions, but that’s notBallerina.Ballerinais a brainless slog filled with action-packed wonder that’s sure to wow audiences who go in looking for that and only that. Just know if you go in looking for anything else, there’s not much there. By the end ofBallerina, things had long gone past any chance of being particularly interesting or emotional. I knew I wasn’t going to get that innovative, emotionally charged, deep lore or narrative some of the previousWickfilms provided. And so, instead of getting angry at it, I switched gears and in this very rare, very specific case, it was the right call. Because while what I was watching was very forgettable in a traditional narrative sense, it’s decidedly unforgettable in terms of pure, unfiltered action and entertainment.Ballerinais a pick-your-poison situation.

    "title": "Watch Live as Japanese Startup Attempts Moon Landing After Failed First Mission",
    "article_text": "The Resilience lander has spent the past six months traveling to the Moon, with plans to touch down in its far northern region. Japanese company ispace is aiming for a Thursday landingâits second attempt to reach the lunar surface. Resilience is set tolandon June 5 at 3:24 p.m. ET, aiming for a smooth touchdown near the center of the Mare Frigoris region (which roughly translates to the sea of cold). The landing attempt will be streamed live on ispace’sYouTube channel, beginning around one hour before the scheduled touchdown. You can also tune in through the feed below. Tokyo-based ispace launched its second mission to the Moon on January 15. Resiliencehitched a ride along with another landerheaded to the Moon. Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost landed on the Moon on March 2, while Resilience took a much longer route. Resilience first operated in an elliptical transfer orbit before using a lunar flyby to move into a low-energy transfer trajectory that will then enable it to attempt a soft landing. The lander has successfully checked off all of its orbital maneuvers and will remain in a low lunar orbit until the big day, according toispace. For its landing attempt, Resilience will automatically fire its main propulsion system to gradually decelerate and adjust its altitude to begin descent from its current orbit toward the lunar surface. The Resilience lander is carrying a small rover, named Tenacious, to Mare Frigoris, located in the Moonâs far northern regions. Itâs also packed with science instruments, mainly from commercial space ventures in Japan, designed to explore the lunar surface. This is ispace’s second attempt to land on the Moon, although the first was unsuccessful. In April 2023, the Hakuto-R Mission 1 (M1) Lunar Landerplummeted towards the Moon and crashed on its surface. The company later revealed that, during the landerâs descent toward the lunar surface, Hakuto-R estimated that it was very close to zero altitude when it was roughly 3 miles (5 kilometers) above the surface. As a result, the lander slowed itself down during its descent, eventuallyrunning out of fuel and free-falling onto the Moon. Hakuto-R M1 was carrying both commercial and government-owned payloads, including a tiny, two-wheeled transformable robot from the Japanese space agency. Members of the Japanese startup are optimistic about their second go at a Moon landing. “We have leveraged the operational experience gained in Mission 1 and during this current voyage to the Moon, and we are confident in our preparations for success of the lunar landing,” Takeshi Hakamada, founder and CEO of ispace, said in astatement. The Moon has claimed a number of landers in the past few years as more commercial companies attempt to touch down on its rough surface. Texas-based startup Intuitive Machinescrashed not one, but two landers,with both Nova-C and Athena ending up lying on their sides.

    "title": "Democrats Commission $20 Million Study to Figure Out How to Communicate with Bros on YouTube",
    "article_text": "During the 2020 presidential race, the Bernie Sanders campaign decided to tout an endorsement from Joe Rogan. Thebacklash was swift: Democratic Party insiders and party-aligned activists demanded that Sanders apologize and rescind his support for the endorsement. The general consensus seemed to be that, as an avatar of “regressive” masculinity, Rogan could not be tolerated inside the blue tent. Last month, in a sign of just how much the political calculus has changed since then, the Democratic Party announced that it waswilling to spenda small fortune to “find” its own “Joe Rogan.” By now, the Democratic Party’s “masculinity problem” is a well-known phenomenon. Men are increasingly getting red-pilled and leaving the party that once consistently swept national elections with votes from blue-collar and white-collar men alike. Last month, the Democratic Partyannounced its intentionto spend ghastly amounts of money to better understand the minds of men and thus develop a strategy about how best to draw them back into the party fold. Politico nowprovides more contextabout the Speaking with American Men (or SAM) project, which says it is willing to spend $20 million to understand the modern man and how best to appeal to him. SAM has already completed an initial round of research on its exotic subject, which it has shared exclusively with Politico. The outlet notes that this first foray into Dude Studies included 30 focus groups and a national media consumption survey. The results of those surveys are fairly straightforward: they have found that many young men “believe that ‘neither party has our back,’ as one Black man from Georgia said in a focus group.” Participants also described Democrats as “overly-scripted and cautious, while Republicans are seen as confident and unafraid to offend.” âDemocrats are seen as weak, whereas Republicans are seen as strong,â Ilyse Hogue, a co-founder of SAM, told Politico. âYoung men also spoke of being invisible to the Democratic coalition, and so youâve got this weak problem and then youâve got this, âI donât think they care about meâ problem, and I think the combination is kind of a killer.â Hogue further noted that SAM has a plan to reach its lost demographic by expanding its presence into the online platforms where men typically congregate: Hogue said part of SAMâs mission âsuper charg[ing] social listeningâ and progressive influencers on Discord, Twitch and other platforms in their fundraising proposal. Theyâre urging Democratic candidates to use non-traditional digital advertising, especially on YouTube, in-game digital ads and sports and gaming podcasts. Yet whether Hogue has adeptly identified the problem or not, his effort seems doomed to failure. Indeed, the effort, itself, is the problem. By studying men as if they were an alien life force instead of 50 percent of the population, the Democrats have already proven themselves to be completely and utterly lame and, appropriately, unmanly. Do real men waste large sums of money learning how to talk to other men? I never recall seeing John Wayne do that. It took the Democratic Party roughly a decade to dig itself into this hole, and it will likely take another decade for them to crawl out. Indeed, since 2016, the party has largely swung left on social issuesâa process that has meant distancing itself from “traditional” men and catering to the interests of women and minorities. During roughly the same period, a reactionary feminist politicsâspurred partially by Trump himselfâcame to power that openly sought to demonize men. This politics accused American males of a variety of social ills, from manspreading to mansplaining to “patriarchy,”“rape culture,”“toxic masculinity,” “fragility,” inceldom, and a host of other issues. The Democrats, which have traditionally been attached at the hip to the women’s movement, were dragged into this morass by association. The results have been predictable. Polls have consistently shown a gendered political divide, with young womentrending increasingly left, while young men have drifted rightward. AnNBC pollearlier this year showed a “staggering” gap between Gen-Z men and women, with the alignments stratified along party lines. Democratic strategists have focused on the tech platforms they can use to reach young men. This is an important part of the puzzle but ultimately not the most important one. The technology is not nearly as important as what Democrats say once they get on those platforms. Gavin Newsom recently launched his own podcast, a bold move that hasn’t really paid off because his messaging has been all over the place. Other Democratic figures, including Bernie Sanders (and, interestingly enough, thedisgraced Anthony Weiner) have sought to insert themselves into the long-form podcast circuit where young men digitally live. Conservatives, meanwhile, have proven themselves incredibly adept at weaponizing media to their advantage. Trump was able to capitalize on young men’s disaffection with the Democrats during the 2024 election cycle by tapping into the media ecosystem where those voters lived: the so-called âmanosphereâ circuit of male-oriented podcasts like Joe Rogan, Theo Von, and Flagrant. But again, the medium is less important than the message. Trump’s oratory style is cartoonishly masculineâsorta like a mix between Huey Long and Tony Montana. For many men, however, it works. There’s a reason thatScarfaceis a classic “guy” movie: its protagonist is just one big runaway libido, all “balls”âa man who does what he wants, when he wants, all consequences be damned. Similarly, Trump’s political style is arguably all balls and no brain. He seems to speak and act from his gut in a way that feels unvarnished and assertive, even if the content of what he says and does is often idiotic and mayhem-inducing. I guess what I’m trying to say is that Democrats could save themselves $20 million by just spending a weekend watching action movies from the 1980s. In fact,Die Hardis guaranteed to teach the average bespectacled Democratic pollster more about average male psychology than a dozen “focus groups.” Why? Because it came about during a time when red-blooded American masculinity was still a dominant part of the culture. John McClane is a cowboy in a wild west of concrete and steel. He curses, he smokes, and he wastes his enemies with a submachine and a smirk. I’m not suggesting that Tim Waltz should dispatch his enemies with a Beretta, merely pointing out that if he talked about doing it (like Trump did) it might not be the worst thing in the world.

    "title": "Everything We Expect Apple to Announce at WWDC25 on June 9",
    "article_text": "Apple is planning to completely rejigger the software on all its biggest products, from the iPhone and Mac all the way down to theVision Pro. To promote this rapid maturation across the Apple ecosystem, every OS will reportedly experience a growth spurt andjump from whatever number it’s on to â26,â according to Bloomberg. Appleâs first major overhaul of all its software offerings in years may be more subtle than you might expect when they debut next week atWWDC25Â on June 9 at10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET. Thereâs a whole host of visual changes coming to the alleged iOS 26, macOS 26 (reportedly dubbed “Tahoe” in honor of the famed freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains), iPadOS 26, and all the rest. The most immediate differences are said to be purely visual. Bloombergâs Mark Gurman has suggested in multiple reports that iOS and the family of Appleâs products will sport new bubbles inspired by the glassy, transparent windowsfound in the Vision Pro’s visionOS. According to reports, this new look will be the new unifying theme for all of Appleâs ecosystem. Several sources have referred to this design as âSolarium,â effectively a sunroom that allows light to pass through at multiple angles. Imagine all your app icons with transparent or translucent, glass-like textures, and you probably wonât be far from the mark next week. Despite the big talk, we donât expect it to be so outside the norm ofwhat we had with iOS 18. The last big OS update included customizable app icons and widgets, and we expect those to remain if Apple takes the âbubbleâ route with its new UX. Knowing Appleâs normal slow pace of OS software updates, iOS 26 will likely be far less zany thanAndroid 16âs recent Material 3 Expressive redesign. Appleâs smaller product portfolio, includingCarPlayand tvOS, could bear many of these design elements. The Apple Watch interfacemay look differentin the coming months with this upcoming software revamp. Apple may add more health and fitness features to its smartwatches, though the rumored âAI Doctor,” which would offer insights based on the data your watch collects from you, may not receive its license to practice in time for WWDC25. More of Gurmanâs recent deluge of leaks suggested Apple may finally add more Mac features to iPadOS to make it far better at multitasking, beyond its current Stage Manager mode. Current reports from usually accurate sources donât exactly have us pounding at the gates of Apple Park to see whatâs in store.9to5Macreported this week the Messages app may finally be able to access an automated text translation similar to whatâs been around onSamsung Galaxy phonesfor the last two years. The Apple Music app may showcase the album art on your phoneâs lock screen while playing tunes. Not too long ago, just a single trip around the sun, Apple promised it would launch its big AI overhaul on iPhone, Mac, and practically every other device. Apple Intelligence was supposed to transform Siri from a know-nothing bonehead into a sophisticated chatbot capable of doing more than merely setting timers and alarms. After a year of badâthough often hilariousâAI summaries andlimited use cases, numerous reportsbased on leaks from inside Applesuggest the companytook a big step backfrom its AI ambitions. Gurman has suggested Apple may entice more outside AI companies beyond OpenAI, like Anthropicâthe makers of Claudeâto promote their models on Appleâs software ecosystem. Apple may also offer its foundation models to third-party developers to let app makers design their own text summary machines. GurmansuggestedApple will stay mum about its AI snafu at WWDC25. The company had previously hinted we would have seen the AI-enhanced Siri before this summer, but now thereâs no sign it will arrive in 2025. Bloomberg said some people inside Apple hope to make up for lost time in 2026. By then, maybe weâll have AI features that move beyond the hype bubble and offer something truly useful. Weâre expecting Apple to reveal a few unexpected surprises come June 9. Thereâs a chance Apple could make another big push into gaming with adedicated video game appon its devices.Reportssuggest this app could incorporate Apple Arcade and the select few games that have been ported to Appleâs ecosystem in recent years. It also could include achievement-like emblems for completing in-game tasks and leaderboards. Appleâs visionOS 26 may also increase its gaming capabilities, perhaps withthird-party controller connectivity. As much as we may want it, Apple probably wonât offer its own first-party controllers or share details of any new hardware at all. Apple doesn’t typically announce new hardware at WWDC25 and there’s no indication that it will do so this year. If you want to see thatrumored iPhone 17 Airor the rest of the iPhone 17 family, new Apple Watch, and AirPods, youâll have to sit on your hands until September, just like always.

    "title": "‘Doctor Who’ Utterly Wasted Belinda Chandra",
    "article_text": "When the latest season ofÂDoctor Whokicked off, themost exciting thingÂ about it wasn’t even its premiere story, or what was being set up to lead towards the season’s grand finale: it was the arrival ofVarada Sethu as Belinda Chandra, promising to shake up the Doctor/companion dynamic in a way ithadn’t been in years. But now that the season is over, andÂDoctor Wholies amid a litany of narrative and production messes lurching towards an uncertain future, one of its biggest of all is just how it completely and utterly wasted Belinda’s character. A young nurse balancing the rigorous demands of her career with the sudden tumult of being thrust into a suitably ludicrousÂDoctor Whonarrativeâabducted by giant robots and whisked off into space to become a planetary ruler and forcibly thrust into a horrific arranged marriageâBelinda’s arrival in “The Robot Revolution” immediately bucked the trends of mostDoctor Whocompanion debuts, especially in the modern era. After initial moments of fear and hesitation, life in the Doctor’s orbit is, more often than not, too mesmerizing to resist: 45 minutes to an hour later everyone from Rose Tyler to Ruby Sunday is ready to step inside the TARDIS, remark on its interior’s size, and run straight forward into adventures in time and space. And yet, while Belinda ends up in the blue box just like the rest of them, she challenges the Doctor, both from his own perspective and that of the audience, every step of the way. The Belinda of “The Robot Revolution” isn’t obstinate for the sake of it or anything, but she rightfully pushes the Doctor’s assumption that his way, his default of being the person that everyone in the room should listen to unquestionably, isn’t the only way. It made for a remarkable chemistry between the Doctor and Belinda, and not just for Ncuti Gatwa and Varada Sethu’s own sparkling charisma (the latter certainly cannot be blamed for the narrative choices the show makes with her character), but because you really see them feel out each other over the course of the episode, figuring out where lines are drawn between themâand it’sBelinda drawing the lines. The Doctor’s charm offensive, which has by and large driven so many of those initial sparks in the companion/Doctor relationship, simply does not work on Belinda. It all culminates in a brilliant final moment in that debut episode to set the tone going forward: calling him out for invading her privacy, for not thinking to ask people consent, for brazenly trying to dazzle her in the same way he’d clearly dazzled many people before her. There is clearly some part of Belinda that likes the Doctor; she’s not actively horrified or disdainful of him, but she makes it clear he crosses lines, and the world he operates in (or rather worlds) are dangerous. She wants home, and the only thing that stops that is the fact that they can’t get thereâthe adventures along the way aren’t her signing up for this dazzling new life, but a necessity to get what she wants. It’s a shame then, that this version of Belinda by and large stops existing halfway through her season ofDoctor Who. Of course, she was always going to soften in her appraisal of the Doctor the longer she spent with him, but the show plays an awkward balancing act where both Belinda moves on from this challenging almost inorganicallyâarguably she is totally fine with traveling with the Doctor by the end of thesecond episode, “Lux,” but even after the darkness of“The Well”an episode later she is truly into the default companion modeâand because the season then also starts suddenly having to balance in dedicating its limited runtime to episodes about Ruby like“Lucky Day,”Â or“The Story and the Engine,”Â where Belinda is barely part of the narrative. For many of theother thorny narrative issuesit has, by the time the season is heading into its endgame in “The Interstellar Song Contest,” the version of Belinda we get there, where her reaction to the Doctor crossing a distinct moral line in aggressively torturing his “foe” in Kid, is far from the woman who called him out for scanning her without asking her in “The Robot Revolution,” willing to effectively rubber-stamp the Doctor’s actions as a moment of duress. Which would be disappointing, but fine ifDoctor Whoreplaced that initial skeptical archetype with anything, but instead Belinda is pushed into a void, a generic “companion.” We don’t learn anything about her, really, other than the fact that she wants to get home. But all that is before the real injustice comes in the two-part season finale. Inits first part, “Wish World”, Belinda is transformed by the reality imposed by Conradâthe asshole villain weirdo who stalked Ruby in “Lucky Day”âonto the earth into the Doctor’s matronly wife. The reality is presented by the text as aberrant and dystopian, a world where every woman exists to be a good daughter, a good wife to her husband, and then a willing mother dutifully raising the next generation of daughters to follow in that exact same mold. In “Wish World,” Belinda’s one-note definition as mother to her and the Doctor’s child, Poppy, is reflective of Conrad’s retrograde views about women, filing them down into a single trait that is subservient to a traditionalist, conservative patriarchal power balance. The fact that Belinda, Poppy’s mom, is not Belinda, the Doctor’s companion that we’ve followed over the course of this season, ismeantto be disturbing, to be something we want her to break free of and recognise the trap she, the Doctor, and the rest of the world in. “The Reality War”instead decides that reducing Belinda to this singular traitâaltered reality or otherwiseâis Good, Actually. The second Belinda is freed from Conrad’s world, her sole dramatic trait is reminding us that she is Poppy’s mother and that that is all that she cares about, regardless of the chaos beginning to unfold around her on the Doctor, to the point that she literally tells him that she can’t help him in his fight against the Rani. The episode metaphorically and literally shoves her in a box so Ruby can take on the primary companion role, safeguarding her and Poppy from any reversions to the original reality that might render the latter erased as quickly as she was wished into being. She’s only allowed out the box when the day is saved, and again, she reverts to this matriarchal character, both when it initially seems like she, the Doctor, and Poppy might travel together, and then when Poppy vanishes from reality and the Doctor choses to sacrifice his life to bring her back. There is a lot of “Reality War” that isan absolute mess, but little of it feels quite as insulting as what it does to Belinda’s character. Having a character for whom motherhood is important is not the issue here; there is plenty that could’ve been done with a companion that’s a mother (we certainly got a particularly involved version of that with Amy’s arc in the Steven Moffat era!). It’s thatDoctor Whoessentially took the Belinda it hadâwho, by episode count and other narrative decisions, had already been losing her sense of an arcâwiped her clean, and then metaphorically stamped “mom” on her forehead, and left her like that for the episode’s final act. An act that is now our farewell to the character, one that even attempts to retroactively “reveal” that Belinda’s arc was always about returning home to Poppy via a series of flashbacks to prior scenes from the season altered to now have Belinda add “for Poppy” to the end of every mention of her desire to get back to Earth. That’s not an actual character arc, or even an interesting recontextualization that reframes what the audience had already seen in new light. It’s a literal re-write of what the audience already saw! After telling us the week prior that it was wrong for Conrad to impose, without consent, a patriarchal gender role on Belinda,ÂDoctor Whoitself has the Doctor do exactly that to Belinda, re-write all of reality to make her into a single mom. The Belinda Chandra we met in “The Robot Revolution” doesn’t exist any more, not just because the show whittled down her character into nothingness, but because the show concludes her arc by rewriting her existence so that that Belinda never existed in the first place. There’s even a dark mirror in the final moments of that arc, when the Doctor does exactly to Poppy what he did to Belinda in the climax of “The Robot Revolution”: medically scan her with his alien technology without a single thought to ask if he was allowed to first. It’s just that this time not only does Belinda not challenge him, she doesn’t reactat all. She is “just” Poppy’s mother now, with no thought or feeling given to her beyond that description. Again, a having a female character to whom being a parent is important is not the issue with whatDoctor Whodid with Belinda. There were so many ways the series could’ve given this ending to her storyline and actually organically laid out a path to it across the season. Perhaps have her slowly realize over time that something, someone is missing from her memories of her life on Earth, to struggle with the feeling that she has to get back to Earth as soon as possible while not fully grasping why, to eventually play with the reality manipulation that the finale hangs its dramatic stakes on. Instead, the show started with a completely different idea and dynamic for herâone brimming with potential it almost immediately decided not to capitalize onâbefore slowly but surely pushing her further and further to the fringes of its priorities over the course of the season.

    "title": "Wyze Says ‘Screw It’ and Shoves a Camera Into Its Latest Smart Bulb",
    "article_text": "A famous meme once asked, “Why don’t we have both?” Clearly Wyze agrees. Its latestsmart home gadgetis theWyze Bulb Cam,which is exactly what the name impliesâa smart bulb that’s also a camera or a camera that’s also a smart bulb, whichever makes your brain happier. The first thing I noticed is that the price on this bad boy is rightâit’s just $50, which is a pretty decent deal if you compare the cost of buying a smart camera and a smart bulb separately. On the camera front, the Wyze Bulb Cam records 2K video with a 160-degree field of view and can also record in both regular color in the daylight and night vision when nightfall hits. As a nice bonus, it also records incolor night vision,which is great if you’re trying to identify what kind of cat got into your garbage last night. (My bet is an orange boy; sorry, not sorry.) If you want to, everything can be recorded locally in this cam, which can be equipped with up to a 256GB microSD card. Alternatively, you can pay $3 per month for recording via the cloud, which also grants you some object recognition. As a light bulb, the Wyze Bulb Cam puts out 800 lumens and can be adjusted via the Wyze app if you need it brighter or dimmer. I, for the record, own a few Wyze bulbs myself, which I have installed in various lamps inside my apartment. I bought them because the price was right, and while I don’t love Wyze’s app, which can sometimes be glitchy, they’ve worked mostly fine over the past few years. If you’re wondering, will this thing fit my light fixture? You’ll be happy to know that the Wyze Bulb Cam is adjustable, which increases the likelihood it’ll mesh. It will also ensure that you have a good angle for the camera element so you can get a perfect look at that porch pirate who stole your last Amazon package. You can also purchase an Accessory Bulb for $17 if you want to expand your Wyze light/camera system. Together, the two can make a motion-activated lighting system that couples well with the two-way audio feature that allows you to speak and also listen through the bulb’s microphone. (Sorry, orange cat, you’re cookedâprepare to be remotely scolded for tearing up the brand-new flower box!) Both products are available via Wyze’s site right now, so if a camera/bulb is high on your list of priorities, go ahead and pull the trigger.

    "title": "‘Sinners 2’ Wasn’t on Ryan Coogler’s Mind, but Maybe That Has Changed",
    "article_text": "BeforeRyan Coogler’sSinnerswasreleased into the world, he was not thinking of it as the start of a franchise. In an interview published three days prior to the film’s release,the writer and directormade that abundantly clear. âI never think about [sequels],â Coogler said toEbony Magazine. “Iâve been in a space ofmaking franchise films for a bit, so I wanted to get away from that. I was looking forward to working on a film that felt original and personal to me and had an appetite for delivering something to audiences that was original and unique. I wanted the movie to feel like a full meal: your appetizers, starters, entrees and desserts, I wanted all of it there. I wanted it to be a holistic and finished thing. That was how I was asked all about it. That was always my intention.â Those quotes have been making the rounds in recent days and rightfully so. Since that article was published,Sinnerswent on to become a certified, and maybe even surprising, smash hit.It has grossed over $265 milliondomestically and another $80 million plus internationally. That, coming on a budget that was reportedly less than $100 million, is proof that audiences love this movie and could want more. It’s something that wasn’t for certain before release, so any direct quotes from Coogler himself about sequels would certainly be of interest. Coogler himself clearly knew that might be the case too. Ina widely publicized dealhe made forSinners, the filmmaker gets the full rights to the film back to himself 25 years after release. Usually, studios keep those rights, but Coogler gets his back. Would he have made that a point of contention if he didn’t thinkSinnershad a life beyond just this one film? Hypothetically, sure, because movies can make money forever, but there was certainly an impetus to own and control his own creation in some way as well. It’s a confident move. Plus, don’t forget, Coogler also added a mid-credits scene in his film that showed two of his main characters, immortal vampires played by Michael B. Jordan and Hailee Steinfeld, decades after the events in the movie. On the one hand, it works as an acknowledgement that these characters will forever be out there. On the other hand, it also could be a tease of future stories to come. So, yes. Before the release ofSinners, Ryan Coogler certainly said that he wasn’t thinking about making a sequel. But that was before the film was a huge success. Maybe that thinking has changed a bit. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "New Russian Satellite Appears to Be Stalking U.S. Satellite in Orbit",
    "article_text": "A recently launched Russian satellite is getting uncomfortably cozy with a U.S. reconnaissance satellite, leading Space Command to worry that it’s part of an anti-satellite weapon being deployed to orbit. Cosmos 2588launchedon May 23 to a near-circular orbit, placing it eerily close to a U.S. reconnaissance satellite, USA 338. The move prompted suspicion that it’s an attempt by Russia to deliberately stalk the U.S. government satellite. This isn’t the first time Russia has deployed a sneaky satellite to trail behind and allegedly observe another satellite in orbit, but this time it may be connected to Russia’s controversial anti-satellite program. “U.S. Space Command can confirm Russiaâs recent launch put a Russian satellite into an orbit near a U.S. government satellite,” a Space Command spokesperson is quoted as saying toBreaking Defense. “Russia continues to research, develop, test, and deploy a suite of counter space systems that threaten the safety and the stability of the domain, so consistent with all on-orbit objects, USSPACECOM will continue to monitor for concerning behavior or activity related to this launch.” Slingshot Aerospacereports that the alleged spy satellite, Cosmos 2588, is a NIVELIR military inspection satellite likely carrying a kinetic weapon onboard.Â Its alignment with USA 338 “strongly suggests COSMOS 2588 may be actively monitoring or ‘chasing’ it,” the satellite tracking company wrote in a statement. Slingshot Aerospace has been tracking the two satellites, revealing that Cosmos 2588 is orbiting at a slightly higher altitude and that the two objects will have a close flyby of one another roughly every four days. The two satellites come as close as 62 miles (100 kilometers) from one another, Marco Langbroek, an astronomer and expert on space situational awareness at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands,wroteon X. Not much else is known about USA 338 as it doesn’t have publicly available orbital data, but it is believed to be a part of the National Reconnaissance Officeâs KH-series electro-optical surveillance network, known as the Crystal constellation, according toInteresting Engineering. This isn’t the first time Russia has allegedly deployed a satellite for such a purpose. In April 2023, a Russian satelliteappearedto be closely trailing a classified U.S. military satellite, and Russia’s Kosmos 2558, launched in August 2022, wasdeployed into the same orbital planeas a U.S. military satellite, dubbed USA 326. In 2020, another Russian satellite, Kosmos 2542,stalkedÂ USA 245, an electro-optical spy satellite in low Earth orbit. The U.S. isn’t completely innocent either. In June 2017, classified U.S. military satellite USA 276 snuck up on the International Space Station at a close distance of about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers). Earlier in 1998, hobbyistsdiscoveredÂ a U.S. satellite that was believed to have been used for space spying purposes as well. Russia’s satellites, however, are believed to be part of the country’s efforts to develop an anti-satellite weapon designed to destroy other objects in space. In November 2021, Russia destroyed a defunct Soviet-era satellite in low Earth orbit, producing thousands of pieces of orbital debris. The test prompted the United Nations to draft a resolution against tests of anti-satellite (ASAT) missile systems, which was led by the Biden administration after the U.S. adopted a self-imposed ban on ASAT tests. A total of 155 countries voted in favor of the resolution, while nine voted against it, including Russia, China, Cuba, Syria, and Iran. “This is the fourth time in five years that they launch a satellite into a coplanar orbit with a US optical reconnaissance satellite,” Langbroek wrote on X.Â “So no, not mere coincidence but deliberate.” Russiasatellitesspy satellites Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "The Voices Behind ‘Dan Da Dan’ Look Back on the Anime of 2024, and Ahead to What’s Next",
    "article_text": "Dan Da DanÂ is set to make a highly anticipated return to streaming platforms. Ahead of the newÂ season, Science Saru and GKids are collaborating again to releaseDan Da Dan: Evil Eye, a theatrical cut featuring the first three episodes of the second season. This release will also include a special behind-the-scenes interview with co-directorsFuga YamashiroÂ andÂAbel Gongora. After a special Los Angeles screening ofDan Da Dan: Evil Eye, io9 held a virtual interview with the English voice cast: Abby Trott (who voices Momo Ayase), A.J. Beckles (Okarun), and Aleks Le (Jiji Enjoji). During our conversation, the three cast members reflected on their favorite moments from the previous season and shared their excitement about the scenes they are eager for fans to experience in the upcoming compilation preview film, which will be released June 6, as well as the anime’s new season premiering in July. This interview has been edited for brevity.Â Isaiah Colbert, io9: Youâve voiced plenty of standout characters in anime, butDan Da Danâs Momo Ayase is one of my personal favorites. With her being a co-lead in a shonen seriesâa genre that traditionally puts male protagonists in the spotlightâwhat about Momo makes her special to you,Â  and how do you think she stands out even more in the shonen landscape this season? Abby Trott:I love voicing Momo. I’ve been having so much fun with her. And it’s interesting that this anime, although maybe if you had to put a label on it, a shonen has a lot of elements from different genres incorporated into it. And I think that helps Momo stand out. We do see a romance element, whereas in a lot of typical shonen, the protagonist will typically not be aware of romantic advances or intentions from a female protagonist. But in this, very early on, there’s a relationship there. We can only look forward to seeing how that is going to grow and develop over the course of however many seasons the show goes on. For forever. I think she’s very confident, and she cares fiercely about her loved ones; she’s willing to do anything to protect them. Those are things about Momo that I love. I think that I read an interview with the mangaka, where he said thatMomo is his favorite character, and that he compared her to Superman. She makes everyone else around her want to step up to the plate and do their best, too. And that’s one element that I really like about her. She makes everyone want to do their best. io9: Inyour last interview with io9, you mentioned being a fan of theDan Da Danmanga and having read it before auditioning. Were there any specific scenes from the manga that you were particularly excited to bring to life in season two ? A.J. Beckles:The whole first interaction with Evil Eye is so cool in the manga. Science Saru, like always, took it and made it so much better; they added so much more content. I went back and read it recently, just to make sure that I was prepared for a recording, and I was like, “Oh, wow!” when I went in. They added a lot, and they did a great job. I think those interactions are what I most looked forward to. Acro Silky was definitely a cool fight, but it wasn’t like a traditional hand-to-hand combat situation that this was with Evil Eye and Okarun. So I was really excited to see what that would look like, and they knocked it out of the parkâEvil Eye’s ball thing that he uses is really cool. Aleks Le:It’s kind of Okarun’s first fight fight. He’s not just launching himself. Beckles:He has to dodge and punch, or whatever else, which he doesn’t really know how to do. You get to see that bit of awkwardness, too, that he clearly doesn’t know what he’s doing versus Evil Eye, who seems so experienced in comparison. It’s interesting, and they did a great job of showing that. io9: First off, congrats on your anime voice acting award forSoloLeveling, Aleks.Â Youâve really kept your finger on the pulse of fan engagementânot just by pushing your vocal limits as Sung Jinwoo but also by embracing the memes and sharing behind-the-scenes moments on TikTok. InDan Da Danseason one, you threw âDeez Nutsâ into the mix, making it an unexpectedly perfect fit for the seriesâ chaotic energy. Can you walk me through how that creative choice came about with the team at Bang Zoom? And are there any other localization line reads youâre especially excited to bring to life in season two? Aleks Le:First of all, thank you so much for the congratulations. I appreciate it. And as for that particular line, Imade a video about thatÂ where I said that the line was actually adapted by our English dub director,Alex Von David, who is wonderfully talented. He put so many funny things into the dub like the usage of the word “bitch” by almost everybody. Those were always really fun. HeÂ had pitched the idea of for this joke. He was like, “Maybe we should put deez nuts in there.” We were discussing it back and forth because it was just two words, but there was so much history behind the meme itself that we wanted to get it just right for the show. I feel like the meaning and the definition of deez nuts have been watered down over the years, and we really needed to hone in on it. What ended up happening was that we performed it once initially, and Alex was like, “That’s good. I think we should put the emphasis on deez, likedeeznuts.” And I was like, “But I want to do it like the original.” So he was like, “Oh, the original, deez nuts?” and I’m like, “You’ve seen the video?” And he’s like, “I’ve heard it thrown around, but I don’t remember the video.” So I was like, “Okay,” [so] I pulled up the video, and our poor engineer had to just sit there as I showed him the deez nuts and then we were going back and forth on it. He was very insistent on one way and I was like, “I want to do it exactly like the video.” We did it so many times, and then we finally found one that we were both really happy with. So that was how deez nuts ended up in the show. Alex is a driving force of this adaptation. In terms of improv, it’s always the most unnoticeable, subtle moments of comedy, I feel, are where my strong suits come in. There’s a lot of Jiji reads where I really want to make it sound as noncommittal as possible, as in it doesn’t sound like somebody who’s doing a performance. It sounds like you walked by a group of teenagers, and you had your microphone up to them, and you heard what they’re saying. “Oh, my God, blah blah blah blah.” They shout basically drivel. That’s my favorite part of the improv that we get to do. We do have a lot of limitations on what we can and can’t do. One of my favorite improvs that didn’t make it was in episode 11 when Jiji first introduces himself. We had him singing theDan Da Dantheme song, and it was really really good. But then we looked back on it, and we were just like “It’s too meta. It wouldn’t really make sense for the moment.” In the future, though, I hope we can throw it back in there somewhere. io9: Alongside their seiyuus, youâve all brought Okarun, Momo, and Jiji to life beautifully, capturing the essence of the anime’s low-taper fade occult nerd, outspoken gyaru, and resident himbo. As season two approaches, what aspects of their dynamics are you most excited to explore, and how has your approach to voicing them evolved, especially while recording separately, and the energy each of you is bringing into the booth? Trott:For Momo, this season kicks off with a lot of action. The first three episodes (that hopefully you’ll go see in theaters, everyone) is a lot of yelling and a lot of [being] in the action. I’m looking forward to getting back to the elements, such as the relationships between the other characters Momo’s relationship with Okarun. I love how Momo has this kind of cute way of speaking to him at times, which is her way of flirting. Just those little moments, I’m looking forward to the development of relationships. Beckles: I’m looking forward to seeing how Okarun reacts to Jiji. Okarun is so polite, and he’s very cognizant of thinking about what he says before he says it. He’s very mature for his age in terms of how he views relationships and communication and Jiji throws all that out of the window. I’m interested to see how he handles it. It’ll be fun to play like him handling those moments where he’s trying to be a certain way, trying to be like kosher, and Jiji doesn’t care. And how he’s gonna handle coming out of his shell more. I think Jiji is gonna bring some of that out of Okarun. But in the meantime, I think where we’re at, it’s very much Okarun knowing who Jiji is, but they haven’t spent a lot of time together. Only just now, at the end of the last season, he’s on the train, and they’re talking about the magazine Okarun is sharing and Jiji is genuinely interested. Okarun’s never had that beforeâa friend who’s not picking on himâand I think that’ll be really cool to see Okarun embrace and learn not to see Jiji as a threat to his new feelings he has towards Momo.Â Or maybe he still will. It’ll be cool to see that unfold and watch all those different personalities interactâMomo instigating moments and trying to get them to be friendsâand it’ll be cool. Le:I think we all know each other pretty well, and our performance styles. We are aware of how each of us would act. We have a good image in our heads of how one person would do a specific read or [how] one person would interpret the scene this way and, ultimately, the nuances of those performances in the final surprise us. But, for the most part, we have a really good idea of what the other person’s gonna do. I feel that closeness and understanding has given us the ability to performing these scenes basically in the dark, yet still having them mesh really well with each other. I feel like we all understand each other’s sense of humor or acting choices pretty well, for the most part.

    "title": "IRS Makes Direct File Software Open Source After Trump Tried to Kill It",
    "article_text": "Direct File, the Internal Revenue Service’s long-promised free tax filing software, might be at risk of being killed off by the Trump administration, but the code that made the service possible will live on even if the program itself doesn’t.According to 404 Media, the IRS published most of the code for its Direct File on GitHub, making it open source and available for others to use, much to the chagrin of tax lobbyists everywhere. Before you mistake the move as an act of resistance by those within the agency who are trying to keep the project alive, Direct File getting open-sourced was always part of the plan. The code was published in compliance with theSHARE IT Act, which requires agencies to share custom source code (though, of course, the Trump administration is not always motivated by following the law, so this wasn’t a given). In areport published last year, the IRS explained its reasoning for making the code available publicly: âFirst, it would enable public scrutiny of that code and invite independent groups to assess its accuracy and report potential issues. Second, other tax administrators, both in states and internationally, could build upon and contribute to the IRSâs work, improving the robustness of the software over time and providing additional public value.â Now that the code is available, it should help others develop functioning (and hopefully free) tax-filing tools. According to 404 Media, the code can’t run independently because it still relies on internal IRS systems; however, it does provide a strong baseline for a platform that is essentially guaranteed to be in compliance with the federal government, as it was built by the government itself. On a related note, 404 Media pointed out that several of the people who were heavily involved in building Direct File for the IRS have since left the government entirely and joined the Economic Security Projectâs Future of Tax Filing Fellowship, where they work on projects designed to make filing taxes simpler and more accessible. It seems like just the type of people who might want to build something based on that open-source codebase. Direct File getting open-sourced comes at a time when there is a target on the program’s back. The Trump administration, Elon Musk, and tax lobbyists have set out to kill Direct File in one way or another. Musk’s DOGEblew up 18F, the government agency that was key to building Direct File, and set out to explicitlyshut down the Direct File tooldespite it being wildly popular among taxpayers. Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill would alsocut the budget entirely for Direct File, leaving it dead in the water, which would surely thrill Intuit, the company behind TurboTax, thatspent millions of dollars lobbying to killa government-provided free tax filing option.

    "title": "Smoking Weed and Eating Edibles Share This Surprising Health Risk",
    "article_text": "A new study has found a startling link between chronic cannabis use and increased risk of cardiovascular diseaseâregardless of whether you smoke it or consume edibles. The finding challenges commonly held beliefs about the health impacts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which many see as a relatively harmless drugâespecially when ingested. The study, published Wednesday, May 28 in the journalJAMA Cardiology, found that THC smokers suffer from significantly worse artery function than non-users. They observed the same effect in edible consumers, though their arteries were not as severely affected. In either case, vascular function was reduced by roughly half compared to those who do not use cannabis, according to astatementfrom the University of California, San Francisco. âScientifically, this THC result is really interesting but boy does it screw up the public health messaging,ââ co-author Matt Springer, a cardiovascular researcher at UCSF,reportedly said tolead author and UCSF physician-scientist Leila Mohammadi when he saw the data.Â These results add to agrowing body of evidencethat suggests long-term weed use can lead to cardiovascular damage and life-threatening events such asheart attacksand strokes, though experts still lack consensus on its precise impacts. A 2024 study published in theJournal of the American Heart Associationfound that people who consume cannabis daily had a 25% increased risk of heart attack and a 42% increased risk of stroke compared to non-users. For this new study, researchers investigated how cannabis impacts vascular function. To isolate the effects of chronic cannabis use, they recruited 55 otherwise healthy adults aged 18 to 50 who did not use any form of nicotine and were not frequently exposed to secondhand smoke.Â These participants were sorted into three groups: marijuana smokers, edible users, and non-users. Those in the two cannabis user groups reported taking the drug at least three times per week, either exclusively through smoking or edibles.Â Â To assess the participantsâ vascular function, the researchers measured dilation of the brachial arteryâlocated in the upper armâto determine whether it could properly expand in response to increased blood flow. To that end, they used an inflatable forearm cuff to briefly block blood flow to the artery, then used ultrasound to measure its diameter before and after inflating the cuff.Â Matt Springer, a cardiovascular researcher at UCSF whose lab led the study,toldLive Science that his test offers a âwindow into the future.â When blood vessels cannot fully dilate, he said, the risk of heart attack and other poor cardiovascular outcomes increases. Participants who did not consume cannabis showed an average vessel dilationârepresented as the percent change from the baseline measurement of artery diameterâof 10.4%. This value was significantly reduced among weed smokers and edible users, who showed an average vessel dilation of 6.0% and 4.6%, respectively. For reference, average values for brachial artery dilation in healthy individuals typicallyrangefrom 8.0% to 15%. In a previous study, Springerâs labfoundsimilarly reduced levels of vessel dilation among e-cigarette and cigarette smokers.Â To better understand how THC causes this change, the researchers ran lab tests to determine how endothelial cellsâwhichformthe linings of blood vessels and release nitric oxide to trigger dilationâresponded to the participantsâ blood samples. These tests revealed that the blood of chronic cannabis smokers inhibited nitric oxide production in the cells, which may explain why these participants showed reduced vessel dilation.Â This effect was not observed in edible consumers, however, suggesting that ingestible THC may impact arterial function via an entirely separate mechanism. Figuring out what that mechanism may be will require further research. Whatâs more, subsequent studies will need to reproduce these findings in a larger population to validate the results.Â Within the last several years, cannabis use among U.S. adults has reached new heights, according to the NIHâsNational Institute on Drug Abuse. As such, investigating the health effects of THC is more important than ever beforeâespecially as mounting evidence challenges perceptions of weed as a harmless high.Â cannabiscardiovascular diseasemarijuana Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "Obviously, Dorothy has to enter theWickedstory eventuallyâthe movies are based on the Broadway musical, which is based on the book, which riffs offThe Wizard of Ozand its own source-material books. And everyone knowsThe Wizard of Ozfollows Dorothy’s journey over the rainbow, where she meets and defeats the green-skinned Wicked Witch of the West. Wickedmay show Elphaba’s side of the story with a sympathetic eye, but we all know she’s on a collision course with a certain bucket of water. Now,Wickeddirector Jon M. Chuis teasing how that pesky tornado traveler from Kansas will find her way into upcoming sequelWicked: For Good. Speaking toVanity Fairin a “first-look” article timed toWicked: For Good‘s trailer (arriving later today), Chu explained how his film will expand Dorothy’s role. In the stage musical, she’s an implied presence, but she remains hidden behind a scrim. The magazine got an early look at the trailer, however, and reveals that we’ll see Dorothy and her famous pals (the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion; presumably Toto’s there, too) strolling down the yellow brick road to Oz. “That intersection is the place that we were first introduced into Oz,” Chu explained of Dorothy’s role inFor Good. “We tread lightly, but try to make more sense of how it impacts our girls and our characters than maybe the show does.â However, don’t expectWicked: For Goodto be the Dorothy show. âWeâre delicate. Weâre delicate. Weâre delicate,” Chu emphasized, anticipating that fans of the musical might shudder at the thought of too many changes. Speaking of changes, the profile also gives a few details about the two new songs that will appear inFor Good; one for Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba, and one for Ariana Grande’s Glinda. And though the firstWickedcontained the musical’s most famous tunes (including the show-stopping “Defying Gravity,” which came at the end of the film), Chu insists “there are some bangers” to come in the sequel.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. \"We should make Road 96 but with boats! Boat 96!\" joked the developers at Digixart when planning their follow up to their excellentprocedural road trip, Road 96. And their next game does indeed have a lot of boats—but it's also a pretty big departure from their previous game. Instead of NPCs changing your adventure, this time other players will: in Tides of Tomorrow, you enter an asynchronous multiplayer world where the actions of another player can have an impact on your own story, and your actions may affect them, too. In the post-apocalyptic waterworld of Tides of Tomorrow, you travel from island to island in the wake of other players. If a character you meet treats you with hostility, it might be because the last player they met did something awful to them, like steal something or shove them into the water. As a result, they won't be too happy to see you. As you can see in the trailer above, revealed at Sony's State of Play today, other players can also help you out: in one scene, an earlier player thoughtfully left a knife for you in a room where you may wind up fighting for your life. Thanks, stranger! In thePlayStation Blog, Adrien Poncet explains a bit more about how it works. \"When starting a game of Tides of Tomorrow, you must select a player to 'follow'. This player has played the game before you and can be a total stranger, someone from your friend list, or even a famous streamer,\" they say. \"Thanks to our 'asynchronous vision' system, you’ll see echoes of this player’s choices and actions, in the form of 'ghosts'.

Maybe you like their playstyle, want to discover their choices, or to benefit from the resources they left behind,\" Poncet says. And don't forget, as you follow someone through the world, someone else is following you. So be nice. Or, don't! It's your choice. Tides of Tomorrow (Steam) launches in February 24, 2026.

    "title": "An all-new Thief game was announced during State of Play, but it's a VR game so who cares",
    "article_text": "More than 10 years has passed since the botched Thief reboot and this is what we get. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've been waiting more than 10 years since thebotched Thief rebootfor a new game in the series, and now that it's happening all I can think about is the old\"careful what you wish for\"adage. Because coming later in 2025 is Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow. Thief VR is a \"reimagined\" take on the once-great stealth series, taking players back to the City, \"a place of shadows, ruled by the tyrant Lord Ulysses Northcrest.\" \"You are Magpie, a cunning thief orphaned by Northcrest’s brutality and shaped by the streets, who steals as the only means to survive,\" the YouTube listing states. \"That is until you uncover something greater: a legendary artifact holding a legacy from the past.\" For those not familiar with the series, that artifact—assuming the trailer isn't a big ol' misdirect, and spoilers ahead for a 27-year-old videogame, by the way—is the artificial eye constructed by the Hammerites for Garrett, the hero of the first three Thief games. And Garrett himself seems to somehow be contained within, although that voice at the very end—\"I thought I was dead\"—doesn't sound exactly like him. More like a pretty good imitation. In any event, here's what's on the table: All of that does sound like a Thief game, and it has the right look, if you count Deadly Shadows among them, which I sometimes do and sometimes do not depending on my mood. There's a decent chance that it could turn out to be a very solid VR experience. And as devoted as I am to Stephen Russell, if the Thief series is going to carry on, it probably is time for a new lead—or at least to start making moves in that direction. None of which un-sours my mood. Superficial Thief trappings aside, the fact that this is trapped behind VR makes it essentially a non-entity. Which I don't mean as a slight toVR fans, but simply a reflection of the fact that VR exclusivity limits the potential market size to the point where it's almost irrelevant. It is, quite frankly, a space for spinoffs and throwaways, and maybe I'm being stubborn or cranky (or both, I am old, after all) but it genuinely rubs me the wrong way to see Thief, after such a long absence, end up in that pile.

While today's reveal is mostly cutscenes, with just a few quick snippets of shooting and melee combat, I'm pretty sure that means we're going to be killing a whole lotta dudes. Based on a line in the trailer, it sounds like the villain of 007 First Light will be a rogue agent, 009, \"a master manipulator.\" IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak said that \"you'll experience James Bond as a young air crewman in the royal navy, before the tuxedos and the martinis, as he first steps into the world of espionage striving to earn his 00 status.\" Apparently this version of Bond is 26 years old, and I have to say he's got an unfortunate case ofiPhone facegoing on. 007 First Light isn't a period piece—it very much seems set in the modern day—but after decades of watching Bond films, I'm not sure I'm ready to be confronted with one who looks like he vapes or has opinions about Ethereum. With a 2026 release date and a contemporary setting, we're extrapolating that Bond was born in the year 2000, which makes my bones feel very brittle indeed.

The urban environments also give off a ton of Dead Rising vibes. Romeo is a Dead Man also seems to be mixing in some anime and 16-bit videogame references, too—if it wasn't clear enough it's a Grasshopper game. There's no sense of what's actually going on in the story other than the fact that Romeo is a cop who is turned into a killing machine and seems to be trying to save the world one explosive headshot at a time. The trailer was shown at Sony's State of Play so there's no PC confirmation yet. Grasshopper games tend to launch on everything, though, so I doubt we'll be left out when it drops sometime in 2026.

    "title": "Oh hell yeah, that Final Fantasy Tactics remaster is real, and it's out later this year",
    "article_text": "The Ivalice Chronicles includes two versions, I'm sure we'll all be normal about which to play first. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've lost track of how many times a Final Fantasy Tactics rumor sent me down a desperate rabbit hole, but those days are no more. During today's PlayStation event, Square Enix revealed Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles, a remaster of the classic RPG that includes two distinct versions. In a post on thePlayStation Blog, Square Enix detailed the classic and enhanced versions of Final Fantasy Tactics arriving in The Ivalice Chronicles. Classic isn't a straight port of any older versions, but \"stays true to the original in almost every aspect.\" It both looks and plays like the 1997 RPG, but instead uses the War of the Lions translation from its updated PSP era. Enhanced adds an updated UI, fully voiced dialogue, graphical improvements, and \"a number of other quality of life features.\" I'm eager to see what those mystery tweaks include, and the added Squire difficulty aimed at new players has me hopeful it'll deliver a version of Tactics that doesn't seem so impenetrable. Final Fantasy Tactics made its Western debut in 1998, and is responsible for a whole generation of grid-obsessed RPG players still yapping about Yasumi Matsuno's passionate war drama and the world of Ivalice—myself included. We've seen rumor after rumor spin up over the years, though more recent teases from folks likeFinal Fantasy 14's Naoki Yoshidaand aretweet from Matsunopointed all signs toyes, it's for real this time. The new take on Final Fantasy Tactics will release September 30 on Steam. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "I'm not an expert, but I think the glowing guardian spirits are a product of creative license. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Update:Added info on PC release, which is coming \"early 2026\" alongside the PS5 version. At Sony's State of Play showcase today, Koei Tecmo announced Nioh 3, its third Soulslike set in a feudal Japan suffering from as many hostile spirits as it is competing warlords. And in Nioh 3, we'll be playing as one of the biggest possible figures from the Warring States period: Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate that reigned in Japan for more than two centuries. If you're only familiar with FromSoft soulslike fare, Nioh adds a fair amount of complexity through weapon stances, randomized Diablo-esque loot, and specialization skill trees. In Nioh 3, there'll be yet another layer in the mix, as Tokugawa will be able to shift between samurai and ninja combat styles. As the figure who closed Japan's Warring States period by consolidating power under his declared shogunate, Tokugawa—declaring himself with his original given name, Takechiyo, at the end of the trailer—is an interesting protagonist choice for the Nioh threequel. If you saw his fictionalized analogue, Toranaga, in FX's Shogun, you'll know that Tokugawa is often portrayed as a ruthless strategist, whose schemes often skew underhanded, if not outright treacherous. By offering a ninja combat style, which unsurprisingly seems to focus more on sneaking and assassination-style strikes than toe-to-toe combat, Nioh 3 seems like it's acknowledging that Tokugawa's ascension as shogun wasn't exactly above board. You know how it is with conquering warlords. Nioh's been pretty willing to do some creative storytelling with Japanese history in the past—splitting another Japanese unifier, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, into a pair of dual protagonists, for example—so I'm interested to see how Nioh 3 will extend Tokugawa's characterization beyond game mechanics. Hopefully they won't make me wait until the end of the game to see his tanuki guardian spirit again, though.Little guy's adorable. Nioh 3 will also be the first game in the series to get a PC release on day one, alongside the PS5 version. The release date is slated for \"early 2026\".

    "article_text": "That's my favorite kind of sensory wonderland! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At today's State of Play showcase, Sony started the show with what I immediately described as \"a Tetris Effect-ass trailer\" as a silhouette of a man walked through a shifting, abstract dimension of EDM beats and lyrics about interconnectedness. Well, I was close: courtesy of Tetris Effect creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi, we're getting a new Lumines. If you've played Tetris Effect but haven't experienced a Lumines, you've already had a strong primer for Lumines Arise. Expect falling blocks, surreal stage visuals, and an aetherial, accelerating, electronic soundtrack that'll sink you into a hypnotic mind-state where there's only you, blocks, and a ton of particle effects. As theSteam pagedescribes it, Lumines Arise will feature \"over 30 stages of synesthetic sensory wonderlands, everything from lush jungles to buzzing Tokyo streets to more surreal experiences,\" including \"the endless expanse of outer space.\" There's also a new \"Burst\" mechanic, which appears to function a lot like Tetris Effect's \"Zone\" state. While clearing blocks, you'll build up a meter that you can spend to temporarily prevent a square from clearing, letting you build it as large as possible before the timer ends. You can also make a customizable Lumines avatar from a variety of unlockable head shapes. I'm fond of the \"egg floating in smiling square\" option, myself. Lumines Arise launches some time in 2025.

    "article_text": "But it's still a wait: Pragmata's due in 2026. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Five years ago, Capcom showed off what was at the time one of the very first \"next-gen\" games for the PlayStation 5: Pragmata, an action game seemingly starring an astronaut and a little girl. Three years ago, it not only wasn't out yet, but was apparently so far from complete that Capcom felt compelled to release another trailer to indicateit'd been delayed indefinitely. Well, props to Capcom for sticking with it. Whatever went off track with Pragmata's development, it seems like it may now be sorted out. A trailer at today's State of Play declared Pragmata will be out in 2026 with a note at the end: \"It's real xD.\" Though the new trailer debuted during a PlayStation event, as expected from Capcom it's also confirmed for Steam. The developer calls it a \"science fiction action adventure with its own unique hacking twist,\" which we see a bit of in the trailer. The little girl Diana, who's an android, rides on astronaut Hugh's shoulder and can hack robots in combat. We still don't know much about Pragmata considering how long it's been in development, but presumably that'll change now that it has a firm(?) release date.

    "article_text": "The show's partners include brand new developers with unannounced games, as well as many of gaming's biggest publishers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. E3 has been deceased long enough that we don't even refer to June's flurry of videogame announcements as \"the event formerly known as E3\" anymore. Thanks to the march of time and the brand-building acumen of Geoff Keighley, it's just Summer Game Fest now, referring simultaneously to a live showcase, an in-person event for media referred to as \"Play Days\", and all of the many otherJune gaming showcases. In this article, I'm mostly talking about what we expect to see at the Summer Game Fest livestream, which airsFriday, June 6 at 2 pm Pacific onYouTube, but we'll of course be covering all of the weekend's showcases, which includes our ownPC Gaming Show on Sunday. We'll also be on the ground in LA for Play Days, where we'll be previewing just-announced games, talking to developers, and producing videos in partnership with HP Omen, thanks to whom we've been able to bring along an ice cream truck—both to evoke the Omen Max 16's cooling capabilities and because ice cream is delicious. All of our SGF coverage will be collected under theSummer Game Fest 2025 tag, and you can find all of our video coverage onTikTok,Instagram, andYouTube. Back to the topic at hand: The Summer Game Fest main event, which will be streamed live from LA's YouTube Theater on Friday. Not all of the trailers and announcements in the show will come from companies that paid to be in it, and some SGF partners may have trailers in adjacent streams rather than Keighley's, but the list of partnered companies is still the best way to guess at what we'll see. So, without further ado... SGF has a lot of partners this year, but I'll start with just two, which stand out to me as unknown quantities: new developers whose games we haven't seen yet. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The following Summer Game Fest partners are notable to me either because we can easily guess what big game they're showing, or because there are so many things they could show that we might get a surprise from them. And finally, here are the rest of this year's Summer Game Fest partners and what they're known for or are likely to show up with. It's a long list: That's a hell of a lot of potential announcements and trailers, and doesn't include however many developers will be showing their games at SGF without sponsoring the event. For instance, we know to expect an \"intense body horror\" game called ILL (seea clip here). We also know that beta access toSoulframe, the new game from the Warframe developer, will begiven out via Twitch dropsduring the stream, so expect to hear about that. (Fun fact: It's not called Soulframe in China because there'sa game developer who goes by the name Soulframealready.) And finally, it wouldn't be a Summer Game Fest without Hideo Kojima. He'll be at the show, if there were any doubt. There's also aseparate Death Stranding 2 streamon Sunday, which is hosted by Keighley. The bond grows even stronger.

    "title": "A 'vast medieval sandbox' with a former Cyberpunk 2077 designer working on it may be revealed at Summer Game Fest, but there's a twist: the studio is really into generative AI",
    "article_text": "The first RPG from Raw Power Games has piqued my interest, but the Midjourney concept art might not go over well. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While scanning the list of this year's Summer Game Fest partners, I noticed an unfamiliar logo—an 'R' with a lightning bolt—and traced it to a Danish studio I'd never heard of:Raw Power Games, which says it's making a \"vast medieval sandbox.\" We love a medieval sandbox at PC Gamer: Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 recently took homea 90% in our review, and we've been fans of the Mount & Blade games for ages. So, guessing that this unnamed game could be revealed during the Summer Game Fest livestream this Friday, I started looking into the company. There's good news and bad news, depending on your feelings about generative AI. With a bit of LinkedIn digging, I discovered some notable designers attached to this medieval RPG, including Andrzej Zawadzki, a lead designer on Cyberpunk 2077, Daniel Janitzek, senior combat designer for Lords of the Fallen 2, and Kristian Jespersen, who worked on the Hitman series at IO Interactive. The company's statement that it is \"fully committed to delivering top-tier mod support\" is promising, too. My armchair investigation changed course when I noticed that one of Raw Power's founders is Rune Christensen, who co-founded crypto outfitMakerDAOand describes himself as \"working in blockchain, AI and gaming.\" I don't see any evidence that Raw Power's medieval RPG is a blockchain endeavor, but the studio is definitely a fan of that other controversial tech trend, generative AI. Ina 2022 profile of the studio, Raw Power CTO Caspar Strandbygaard told Danish paper Ingeniøren that the company was just \"testing the waters\" of AI-driven game development with its first game (the medieval sandbox RPG I expect to be announced at Summer Game Fest), but that it has much bigger plans for the technology. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. At the time, Raw Power was using Midjourney AI to produce muddled concept images, but Strandbygaard predicted that within 10 years the studio's task would be \"almost to make tools that will generate the game\" rather than making the game itself. \"The gaming industry should be cutting-edge and a front-runner in [AI], but we haven't seen that in very many games,\" said Raw Power COO Jakob Rasmussen in the same 2022 profile. \"We are not saying that we will necessarily use AI at the core of how we develop, but it is at the core of our vision. When the technology is ready—and perhaps a little sooner—we'll be willing to stick our necks out and put it into our game.\" Today, the Raw Power website mentions AI in connection with Raw Power Tools, a \"sister company\" working to \"bring the power of AI into the hands of game creators.\" The studio also said in that 2022 interview that it planned to release its first game, which it described then as a singleplayer and multiplayer medieval RPG, in three years—which would be this year. Things may have changed, and I've asked the company if its comments back then reflect its current plans and focus and will update this article if I hear back. Since the studio is a Summer Game Fest sponsor, it's pretty safe to assume we'll learn more this week. In aFacebook post in January, Raw Power said, \"2025 is our year. We're building something big.\" Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs.

Yet there are none: No MTX, no season passes, no nothing really, except theFriends of Jimbo \"collaboration packs,\"and they're free. Why not? \"The honest reason I don't have microtransactions/season pass/ads/100 DLCs/etc in Balatro isn't just about the ethics of those practices but because when I play other games that have those things it makes me want to put my computer in the dishwasher and set it to pots and pans,\" Balatro creator LocalThunk explained very vividly onBluesky(viaGamesRadar). \"Like I get why people add those things but you're shooting your UX in the foot if players are having their first impression and also being bombarded with a bunch of nonsense that isn't actually the game.\" He's not wrong, and while you could argue that selling five million copies in a year makes it a little easier to reach the moral high ground, the fact is that Balatro was built this way from the start: You pay your dime, you get your game. It's certainly possible to incorporate MTX into games without overwhelming the UI or otherwise diminishing the experience, but the drive to monetize is so relentless that it rarely works out that way. \"There's like a 95% chance that if the game is FTP then the main menu UI is more complicated than the actual game UI,\" LocalThunk added in areply post. Separate from all this, LocalThunk also shared a bit of \"pointless Balatro lore\": A bus stop sign outside his apartment in his hometown of Regina, Saskatchewan, where he was living when he began work on Balatro, inspired the art for the \"Ride the Bus\" joker. \"Every time I see that joker it reminds me of my old apartment,\" LocalThunkwrote.

And yes, the Steam charts: Deltarune currently holds three spots inSteam's top-ten best-selling list, an impressive accomplishment by any measure. Well, it's been a long time coming. The first chapter of Deltarune debuted in 2018, and the second in 2021, and both were free. Creator Toby Fox said the subsequent chapters 3, 4, and 5 would not be free, however, but apparently Fox was in no great hurry to take anyone's money because they then proceeded to horse around for four years, occasionally reassuring the world at large thatprogress was being madebut never actually delivering on that progress—until now.

So, in short, it's a horror choose-your-own-adventure experience. One that has been brewing for a long time, although slowed by writer's block, according to aBluesky post from last year. There's no firm release date yet for Welcome To The Dark Place, beyond the loose 'October' listed on the game's store page. Most likely, expect it sometime around Halloween, although given how long in development and already-delayed this game has been, that could easily slip further. Welcome To The Dark Place might be the Lethal Company developer's longest project. There's someearly alpha gameplay footagelurking around in the dark corners of the developer's YouTube channel from way back in 2019, giving us a glimpse at an early, entirely text-based version of the game. Judging by the gameplay footage (including theolder 2019 alpha clips), Welcome To The Dark Place is a purely single-player experience. A stark choose-your-own-adventure style game of multiple dialogue choices in white against a stark black background, accompanied by unsettling music, sound effects and possibly the occasional low-fi cutscene. As for its setting, it seems to be a contemporary, if twisted Earth, but with strange technology. The early gameplay clips show the player experimenting with a strange flying mechanical dragon, and mention of a potentially threatening phenomenon known only as The Cloud. Sounds like there's plenty of mysteries to be unraveled here. There's nothing to suggest this will be tied into the world of Lethal Company or any of his older games, although the worlds he tends to create are fragmented and nebulous enough to be a bit frayed at the edges, operating mostly on dream (or nightmare) logic. This also probably means it won't be shying away from intense situations, as the content description features mention of suicide, self-harm, deaths and 'grotesque situations'. It should also be noted that Lethal Company didn't come out of nowhere. Zeekerss has been making games (and primarily horror ones at that) since he wasnine years old. Starting out with making SCP-inspired adventures for Roblox, before graduating to native PC releases as a teenager. Before Lethal Company, he released three games, all of which are genuinely worth checking out. Each feels like part of the puzzle that is Lethal Company, and might provide some clue as to how Welcome To The Dark Place will feel, look and sound: It Steals(2020) is a tense, panicky maze horror game where each stage is patrolled by a different monster. Simple conceptually, but each enemy has enough quirks to its behavior (echoing the later Lethal Company) to make each segment a really distinct challenge.Dead Seater(2021) is a free, more traditional survival horror adventure, minus the opportunity to fight back. Once a monster becomes aware of your presence in this warren of claustrophobic corridors (made all the more suffocating with fixed camera angles), running is all you can do. But before Lethal Company, there wasThe Upturned(2023), a great little horror-comedy adventure about a lost soul trying to find their hotel room in the afterlife through a series of sometimes scary (and frequently slapstick) misadventures via a malfunctioning elevator into the beyond. While this is a solely single-player experience, Lethal Company's slapstick roots clearly originate here. So what does this all tell us? Well, Zeekerss is a one-man horror band with a penchant for situations that start out quiet, slowly build up tension and then release everything in a truly frenzied burst of energy. Whether we'll see that echoed in the game's prose and decisions is yet to be seen, although I'm expecting some strange vibes, given that the author himself feels likethe game's ambient soundscapes hit the same notes as Sufjan Stevens' famously dour album Carrie And Lowell. Lastly, on a personal note, I'm happy to see a small developer hit it big, only to act like it's no big deal and continue treating the medium as a personal creative outlet. While I'd love to have seen what a professional team under his leadership could do, I've got huge respect for this move, and can't wait to see what the Dark Place holds for us in Skeleton Appreciation Month.

    "title": "Bungie makes the (correct) decision to roll back Destiny 2's most severe Edge of Fate nerfs before they've even happened",
    "article_text": "And yes, I am going to take partial credit When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's always a privilege speaking to the creative minds behind a game you've spent thousands of hours playing, in no small part because you get the chance to ask them questions about changes you think the community will be concerned about. That was the case a couple of weeks ago when, after playing a preview build of The Edge of Fate expansion, I sat down to talk to game director Tyson Green. One of the hot topics we hit were the nerfs incoming to multiple Prismatic subclasses in the version of the game I played. Specifically: Consecration, Stylish Executioner, Knockout and Feed the Void had all dropped to one Fragment slot, having previously had two or three. The result being that their buildcraft flexibility and base power would be brought down, with the argument being that those Aspects are so strong as to almost be auto-includes. Suffice to say that when myinterviewmade it to Reddit yesterday, despite Tyson's thoughtful answers about needing to avoid players feeling trapped into picking particular options, the community was, putting it politely,concerned. However, in one of the fastest turnarounds from outrage to official response, the Destiny 2 Team account took tor/DestinyTheGametoday to announce that those nerfs would now either no longer be happening or have been watered down: \"This tuning pass reduced the number of Fragments that could be placed on various Aspects, as we've found the Prismatic subclasses have been a bit hot since release,\" the spokesperson wrote, understating the power of Prismatic admirably. \"Certain Prismatic builds have increased damage output and survivability to a point where some challenges can feel trivial, and bringing everything else up to Prismatic's level wouldn't help to solve this issue in a healthy manner.\" \"While we're still planning an overall tuning pass for Prismatic for a future date, featuring buffs alongside other changes, we'll be changing our approach for The Edge of Fate a bit in response to your feedback. Aspects that were originally planned to be reduced to 1 fragment slot will remain at 2. We feel this is a good middle ground where some of the more potent Aspects are being tuned down, but not too much.\" I really do think that's the right decision. Consecration and Feed the Void are so good that I don't think dropping them to one Fragment would have had the desired effect anyway, but—as I said in the interview—it would make those builds feel anemic in terms of player creatvity. So, panic over? Not quite. While the nerfs to the four aspects I listed have been watered down, Bungie's post also included some other Aspects which are being brought down in the balance pass. Here's the complete list (which is still subject to change based on playtesting): Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. To the surprise of absolutely nobody, people are still grumbling about why Bungie can't just buff all the lesser-used subclass Aspects, completely ignoring the concept of power creep, and the fact that the entire Prismatic class has been absolutely white hot in terms of power since it launched as one of the main selling points of last year's The Final Shape expansion. That problem is not going to go away without a substantial subclass rework, but I stand by the idea that simply shaving off multiple Fragments from the most used Aspects was way too blunt of a solution.

    "title": "CDPR says the Kingdom Come style of systems-heavy RPG is 'super great' and, when it comes to The Witcher 4's direction of travel, 'these are our next steps for sure'",
    "article_text": "\"I love Kingdom Come because of the realism and the feeling, the sense of humor.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Yesterday brought our first proper look at The Witcher 4, thanks to a highly impressive tech demo, and the Ciri-led sequel is now CDPR's next big thing. PCG's Josh Wolens recently sat down with several of the studio's core figures to discuss the series' past and future and, with this happening around The Witcher 3's tenth anniversary, one prominent topic was how the gaming landscape has changed over that time. The Witcher 4 will release in a very different world from The Witcher 3, and there are several high-profile examples of studios that don't seem to have kept pace with the times. Bioware's Dragon Age: Veilguard, for example, was a perfectly decent RPG, but the visuals aside it was almost like a game you could've been playing in 2015. But then there are those games that do feel like they're pushing the RPG forward, like Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and perhaps most prominently Baldur's Gate 3. So where is CDPR and The Witcher 4 going to find itself? \"Bioware has changed for sure, but the industry has changed too,\" says CDPR co-CEO Adam Badowski. \"We have a different strategy for our company. We definitely would like to continue keeping and truly understanding our core rules, how we develop our games, and of course, on top of that, we need to find new things, especially in gameplay, because there's not such a great progress when it comes to good stories. \"So here we feel very strongly at the same time, so many great things happened in gameplay [since The Witcher 3]. What are players' expectations here? And there are great games, great mechanics and plus UI [improvements]. So this is the idea for our development, and we are focusing on that, but at the same time we strongly believe in the core of what we are doing here.\" Badowski goes on to say that he thinks one of CDPR's strengths is that, while The Witcher and Cyberpunk are very different worlds, at their heart are some pretty similar goals. \"So even if we have multiple games, it doesn't mean that we are focusing on one big thing, because our games are similar when it comes to the core aspects,\" says Badowski. \"Of course, Cyberpunk is different from the Witcher, but different enough to feel that it's something maybe more for me, less for you. But I think the core, the pillars, how we make games stay the same and we continue. Maybe that's the difference, the difference between our strategy and Bioware's strategy these days.\" To get down to brass tacks, then, what does CDPR see when it's looking at the likes of KCD2 and BG3? Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"I love Kingdom Come because of the realism and the feeling, the sense of humor,\" says Badowski. Would he even say it's a little Witcher-y? \"Thank you,\" laughs Badowski, before going on to explain how some of the more simulation-y and systems-heavy aspects of KCD2 are the things CDPR watches with interest, because this is partly The Witcher 4's direction of travel. \"The Kingdom Come kind of simulation, it's great,\" says Badowski. \"There's so many options, you can change the world, it's super great. And we would like to keep that, we'd like to follow this trend as well. So these are our next steps for sure, and it's kind of a similar challenge to what we have in The Witcher 3 because of the open world and storytelling here, freedom of choices. But at the same time, we would like to build very fleshy, very well-motivated characters. So it's kind of in contradiction from time-to-time. That's a great design challenge.\" With Larian the influence is less direct. \"In Larian's case it's turn-based so it's a different kind of game, and the way you interact with characters is totally different,\" says Bakowski. \"We like to fully build the characters, understand the past and the future of the character motivation. That's why it takes so much time. [In BG3] there are great characters as well but sometimes your choices, because there's freedom of choices in Larian's work, it pushes you to use different tricks than ours. But I think we observe each other, and there are not that many games like that, so that's natural, yeah, and we see how players react, how fans react to those tactics.\" It's a theme that joint CEO Michał Nowakowski echoes: Baldur's Gate 3 has clearly impressed an awful lot of people at CDPR, even if they're conscious that The Witcher is always going to be a different type of RPG. \"I think we're still more in the, you know, we're a big open world,\" says Nowakowski. \"But a lot of what Baldur's Gate 3 showed was an inspiration, and to be honest there's no shame in that. I think everybody who launches games nowadays is looking back on what was done before, and is looking at what worked and what was great and how and if they can fit it into whatever they are doing. \"So for sure there was a lot of inspiration and what BG3 did, but I think we're still more sticking to what was The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk, even if we don't want to just make another game like that, just with better graphics. We do want to innovate in terms of what's available in terms of gameplay and so on. I hope when the time comes, that's going to become clear for the fans as well.\" If that's all sounding a little fuzzy, Nowakowski circles back to make it clear what CDPR is not doing: \"It's a bit of an unclear answer, but to make it more clear, we definitely are not going to make a game like Larian did,\" says Nowakowski. \"That's the kind of game they can make. But a lot of stuff with how the characters can interact with the world and what it does was for sure some inspiration to us.\" Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "article_text": "You're mayor now. No, you can't refuse. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. For as long as mankind has gazed up at the stars, it has been seized by a dream: to journey out there, into the void, to stand eye-to-eye with God, to slip the surly bonds of Earth, venture into space, and establish responsible local government. No Man's Sky's latest in a frankly unbelievable line of updates is calledBeacon, and it promises to let you become Overseer—or space mayor—of \"up to four settlements, managing townships on the frontier of multiple worlds—each with their own set of citizens and challenges.\" Your stellar towns are yours to muck with. You can construct and upgrade buildings, resolve disputes between citizens, hold festivals, and generally do what I've decided to call 'mayor stuff'. I've gotta be honest, I think Hello Games might have turned NMS into some kind of citybuilder/management game when we had our backs turned. At some point those guys are going to turn this game into a JRPG and then where will we be? It's not all about your new mayordom, though. It's just mostly about that. On top of your new roles and responsibilities as planetary potentate, Beacon also marks the introduction of \"robotic Autophage settlements.\" These towns have their own thing going on: a rough, robotic style that you can make your own if you take an Autophage town into your remit. The good news is, your toil as mayor can pay off in the form of resources. Put those ungrateful citizens to work in the mines and reap the rewards, I say. The downside, though, is that they're all weak and feeble, and you'll need to defend them against incursions by miscreants. To do that, you can \"hire a squadron of wingmen, who will now defend towns when they come under attack from roving pirates.\" It all sounds pretty involved—the kind of thing most studios would put out as costly DLC rather than a free update—and I won't pretend I'm not tempted to leap back into No Man's Sky.

    "title": "CD Projekt Red and Epic claim Witcher 4 development 'ramped up dramatically' Unreal Engine's open world game capabilities",
    "article_text": "It's going to be a long wait until 2027... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We recently sat down with bothCD ProjektRed and Epic to find out a little bit more about that, well,epic Witcher 4 tech demoand what the new Unreal Engine 5.6 brings to game development. The main takeaway is that their collaboration won't just makeWitcher 4an incredible open-world experience. It looks like it will help other developers literally up their game when it comes to open-world titles. \"This is exactly what we wanted to do in Unreal and have been talking about since the middle of Unreal Engine 4. Improving open-world development in Unreal is a very long conversation and you can go back to each and every release and see something in it that is guiding us towards even more excellence in open world development,\" says Wyeth Johnson, Epic's senior director of product strategy. He then motions upwards vigorously to illustrate how much better the latest Unreal 5.6 engine is for open world game development. \"We ramped up dramatically for this release and I think it shows,\" Johnson says, referring to the Witcher 4 demo that's been blowing everyone's mind, particularly because it's running on mere Sony PS5 hardware, not even the PS5 Pro. Johnson also re-emphasized just how important performance is for Unreal Engine 5.6. \"Our focus for 5.6 is almost exclusively performance,\" he says. \"Developers should be able to achieve incredible quality, and they get to define what that quality is, maybe it's the perfect pixel, or maybe it's incredible scale, or animation features or AI, or whatever the case may be,\" he says. \"Performance is not just what a player interacts with, it's also what a developer interacts with. And when the water level goes up and the time to achieve quality goes down, then you can be more expressive, you can be more playful, you can try to dream a little bit more than just worrying about all these systems holding you back. I would expect every developer who is trying to do something really original and creative in the Triple-A space, they're all going to be excited about this release, \" Johnson says. In other words, Unreal 5.6's performance optimizations should mean much higher quality visuals and gameplay on existing hardware. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Unreal 5.6 is also about making things easier for developers in the first place. \"We need to bring the overall level of the engine down and keep the overhead as low as possible so that developers themselves can implement interesting behaviours and they can trust that those behaviours can go right in and players can experience them. Every developer who uses Unreal will benefit from what we showed today. That's the most fundamental take away,\" Johnson says. As for CD Projekt Red, it seems like the transition from their own Red Engine to Unreal has been an unambiguous success. \"We had a blast with Unreal,\" says Witcher 4 senior technical animator Julius Girbig. \"It's not like we lost things because of the transition. We're bringing our experience that we already have from Red Engine, all the Triple-A, open world with streaming, all that experience we're now bringing over to experts who have been building engines for years,\" he says of the collaboration with Epic. \"I'm a pretty surface-level animation artist, so I'm not actually digging into code that much,\" Girbig goes on to explain, \"but I'm still able to run these hundreds of characters, create behaviours for them within the editor with this supportive UI, it just unlocks me as an artist. \"Now with this engine it suddenly unlocks me to create much bigger things and to think bigger. It's really awesome to be able to use things like the Nanite foliage to create these vast forests and whatever comes to your mind.\" The end result is certainly impressive. Indeed, it's almost hard to believe that it's running on the Sony PS5, it looks that good. But Johnson confirms that it's all running on completely standard PS5 hardware. \"There are intrinsic things that the Playstation is amazing at, and we kind of show every single one of them in that technical demo,\" he says. Given the most spec of the PS5 compared to the latest PC hardware, that bodes well. Even AMD's new entry-level RDNA 4 GPU, theRadeon RX 9060 XT, blows the PS5 away for raw specs and especially ray tracing performance. Speaking of which, Johnson confirms that the demo was indeed using Unreal's Lumen ray tracing engine in hardware mode. If it runs well on the PS5, it should fly on any relatively recent PC graphics card. Overall, the upside of CD Projekt Red and Epic working together is that both sides of the collab' benefit, and that means better games for all of us to play. \"There's no possible way that we could push in every direction to the apex level that developers like CD Projekt Red are capable of pushing,\" Johnson says. \"We don't have any heartburn if somebody wants to make a modification to Unreal for their specific use and in fact that's a wonderful success for us, because it means we gave them a nice place to plug in the thing that they needed that we didn't provide.\" The only frustration in all this is that Witcher 4 only started development late last year and isn't due out for a few more years at the very earliest, and likewise other games that benefit from all of CD Projekt Red and Epic's latest learnings aren't exactly around the corner.

It also clocked in at over 300,000 concurrent players on its first day, according toSteamDB, and since then it's sat between 100,000 to 300,000 players consistently. Out of Nightreign's 3.5 million players, just 7.5% of players have managed to defeat all of the Nightlords. You might think that percentage would be higher, given the sheer number of people playing the game, but this is a FromSoft game and defeating all eight bosses is no easy task—some of the big bosses are relatively easy to overcome, like Maris, Fathom of Night, but most of the Nightlords are excruciatingly difficult. Out of Nightreign's 3.5 million players, just 7.5% have managed to defeat all of theNightlords. Now this is no easy task—some of the big bosses are relatively easy to overcome, likeMaris, Fathom of Night, but most of the Nightlords are excruciatingly difficult. Only 70% of players have bested the first boss,Gladius, Beast of Night, which is an expedition that you need to complete in order to unlock all the other Nightlords that Nightreign has to offer. So as always, it's important not to underestimate just how difficult beating FromSoft bosses can be for us mere mortals. Not everyone can be likeNightreign's game director who managed to solo all the Nightlordswithout the use of relics. But I'm sure that as time goes on and more players arrive, and as existing players get their heads around all the final bosses, the success rate will slowly tick up. Either that or FromSoft will release an update which nerfs all the Nightlords making the whole ordeal slightly easier.

    "article_text": "As a FF14 and WoW player both, I don't think this is gonna go as well as they think it will. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Blizzard is planning on shaking things up—alright, 'shaking things up' might be an understatement. For twenty-odd years now, World of Warcraft has existed with an ecosystem of UI addons that facilitate a bunch of stuff: Profiles for roleplayers, accessibility features for disabled gamers and, obviously, combat addons. It's the very latter that Blizzard is taking aim at, and while PCG contributor Heather Newmaninterviewed game director Ion Hazzikostasabout the changes, it seems the studio's encountered enough resistance to extend an olive branch to the addon community directly. As spotted byWoWHead, World of Warcraft developers spoke with the WoWUIDev Discord about their intentions for reductions to the utility of the game's API when it comes to combat—in simpler terms, what the game tells you upfront and in real-time. \"Reading through your feedback so far it is clear that there's a lot of confusion about the timing, goals and nature of these changes,\" the statement begins, before reassuring players Blizzard'll be \"giving many months of advance notice before we flip the switch. \"We want to allow addon devs as much time as possible to test the changes, report issues and provide feedback. We will be announcing the landing place for these changes well ahead of time and taking steps to maximize the amount of hands-on feedback from addon developers before the changes go live.\" What follows are a lot of similar promises we've heard before—that Blizzard's aiming for the \"least amount of collateral damage possible\", and that it'll be aiming \"to minimize the impact on accessibility addons … Functionality in this space which is no longer possible after these changes are things we will aim to incorporate into our base game.\" I don't envy Blizzard's 20-year arms race with addon creators, but I'll repeat what I said back in May—the best way to stop modders is tolet your alternatives win out. WoW's historically lagged far behind in the UI department. Heck, it wasn't even until Dragonflight that the default WoW UI was customisablewithout addons. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Even then, Blizzard is keen to insist that they aren't just doing it for the sweatiest of sweats: \"While it is true that Mythic raiding has become increasingly reliant on addons, that is not the primary goal of this project. We are embarking on this project with the aim of leveling the playing field and making the game more approachable for all players. \"Currently, addons are able to analyze and 'solve' combat and coordination mechanics perfectly, and faster than would be possible for an unassisted human player. While many players will naturally seek out any advantage, this also means that players who don't use these addons are at a huge disadvantage.\" This isn't an unreasonable assessment of the situation—but Blizzard has made targetedchanges to the API before via \"private auras\", which help obfuscate the most encounter-simplifying info for players. I feel like Blizzard's committing to a much higher degree of shutdown than it strictly needs to. I'm not particularly taken by the argument Blizzard makes here that \"Many players end up feeling excluded from competitive content unless they install, set up, and maintain a number of addons. This is a significant barrier to entry, and we have heard growing feedback over the years from players who resent feeling like they need addons to play the game properly.\" As a long-time MMO player, I do find it a little annoying to have to download a bunch of addons—but that's because I'm not that interested in competitive content. I broadly agree with the statement that needingaddons to play a game properly isn't healthy, but I'll say it again: Simply offer better homegrown options, and you solve that issue. \"This project is about doing everything we can to shrink that gap, by building up the baseline functionality of the default UI, while also reining in the 'optimal problem-solving' capabilities of the addon API. We will also be making substantial changes to how we design our combat and encounters to accompany these addon changes. Removing the ability for addons to 'solve' most encounter mechanics means that we can also take a different approach to the design of our encounters going forward. The same goes for certain class mechanics. \"If everything goes to plan, WoW will remain challenging, but the nature of that challenge will be less about managing subtleties of class mechanics and more about collaborating with allies and interacting with encounters.\" Maybe this is just perspective—perspective, I might say, obtained under the yoke of a developer team thathasn't shown a shining understandingof how its illicit mods actually work—but in FF14, forbidden UI mods haven't stopped people using them anyway. In fact, World First raids have been scuffed by cheatersthree times in a row. You can practically set your watch to the time between a world first accolade and one of its team members being busted. I dunno, man. Maybe Blizzard is simply going to be more competent about it, but I have this eerie sense it's putting a ton on its plate without thinking the consequences through. Here's hoping I'm wrong—or that a middle ground is reached between scorched earth and new boundaries.

    "title": "Skyrim's version of Radiant AI was developed from a drawing Todd Howard made on a napkin",
    "article_text": "\"It's actually a napkin story. You don't hear many in real life, but this is a real one.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. With Oblivion Remastered sucking up everyone's time, there's a whole new generation of people getting to enjoy Cyrodiil's weird NPCs—and for us Oblivion vets, it's a chance to reconnect with some old pals. There was so much to love about Bethesda's gargantuan RPG back in 2006, but the vast array of eccentric characters wandering around the world, doing their own thing, really set it apart from the previous Elder Scrolls. This was down to Radiant AI, which Bethesda has continued to use in all of its RPGs since. And when it came to figuring out how to evolve the system for Skyrim, it all started with a sketch on a napkin. \"The Radiant AI system was developed from a napkin drawing that Todd [Howard] gave us,\" says Bruce Nesmith, Skyrim's lead designer. Bethesda understandably doesn't want to give away too much about its secret sauce, but Howard and Bethesda have given Nesmith, who left the company in 2021, approval to talk about Radiant AI and its development. \"So it's actually a napkin story. You don't hear many of those in real life, but this is a real one.\" Howard started by drawing a hero in the centre of the napkin, \"and then he drew various little icons to represent things like houses and monsters and whatnot around it and drew a line to them. And he said, 'The player interacts with these things, but they don't interact back with them. That was Morrowind. For Oblivion, we started having them interact with each other a little bit. But now for Skyrim, we want the world to point back to the player as well as interact with itself. So how can you do that?'\" Nesmith sat down with senior designer Kurt Kuhlmann and tried to figure out how to make this work. It was \"very freeing\", Nesmith recalls. \"We went off on our own, and we came back with proposals. Probably some of the most creative moments I've had in the videogame industry, to be honest. And the idea was to be able to have events and objects in the world that the player interacts with and that the code is watching.\" One of the early examples they showed Howard connected NPCs, quests and players together. \"So you kill a person, and the game knows that NPC has relationships to other NPCs. That's data that we attach to the player. And this is all in the editor. You can see it all. And so it spins up a quest that picks one of the relatives who comes back and tries to kill you. So it created a quest to do that. And Todd really liked that idea.\" But Howard wanted to see how this could be employed in a scenario that didn't involve killing. \"It's at the heart of all these games,\" says Nesmith. \"They were developed largely by men for the first 30 years. And our more violent tendencies come out in that.\" It was time for a change. So he went back and came up with a list of around 30 different actions that the programming could potentially monitor. \"Things like, you pick up an item, you steal an item, you change a location, all these other actions that could be taken. We said, 'OK, here's our list.' And Todd said, 'Now that I like, there's all kinds of good stuff in there'.\" This led to \"large amounts of data\" being attached to objects, which was new for Bethesda. \"An NPC actor would know the location it belonged to; the location would know the actors that belonged to it. It would know the objects. And we had an event system where, when something happens, it goes through a list of potential quests that could get spun up, that all have conditions on them. If the conditions are met, a quest is spun up. If no conditions are met, no quest is spun up.\" It could create interesting conflicts, as different NPCs each had a reason to try to get their hands on a specific object, and the system would draw the closest NPCs to the object, who the player could then encounter, beginning a quest. This \"felt very unique to us\", says Nesmith. \"The world sees the player. Think of how many games you play where the world doesn't see the player. You kill that monster over there, and the rest of the world doesn't know. You solve this person's problem over here, and the rest of the world is not paying attention.\" Nesmith is talking about more meaningful reactions, not simply someone reacting to you killing a dragon by saying, \"Oh, I heard you killed the dragon,\" though Skyrim does have that, too. Rather, his vision for the system was one that could conjure new quests out of your interactions with the world. \"You feel like you're actually part of something that's living and breathing, and like what you do makes a difference. The world sees you. And I'm not going to sit here and say that Bethesda was the first game company to do that, because I don't know that for a fact, but we were one of the early ones. And we were definitely one of the biggest, that got the most notoriety and attention for it.\" Of the list of 30 possible actions that the programming could monitor, \"virtually all of them\" made it into Skyrim. \"Most of them made it in, and we didn't actually add very many [afterwards] either, because Kurt and I both have programming backgrounds, so we had a pretty good sense for what would be good and what would not be good for the programming side of it.\" The wackiest version of Radiant AI, the version that's present in Oblivion, is the one that's always going to stick with me the most—it was weird and janky and hit me at a formative time. But that doesn't make Skyrim's version any less impressive. Even now, well over a decade later, it's striking how it manages to craft a seemingly infinite number of bespoke quests and adventures every time you cluelessly wander into a dank cave or saunter through a new village.

    "title": "I wasn't expecting a FromSoftware game, of all things, to be so gut-bustingly funny—but just like Helldivers 2, Elden Ring Nightreign turns death into a punchline",
    "article_text": "Whomped in the Lands Between. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's down to the wire inElden Ring Nightreign. After a carefully-paced, downright strategic brawl featuring myself, and two of PC Gamer's finest Nightfarers, we've got theEquilibrious Beaston the ropes. Two measly percent stand between us and victory. Our Duchess goes down. Me and my raider-in-arms exchange a look: It's all or nothing. Time slows to a crawl and crystalises, as adrenaline and cortisol scream through my system. I make the choice then and there: Killing the boss is more important than reviving our Duchess. I push past her, Executor's Blade in hand. And then— Another unfortunate evening approaches. Me and a friend push our luck killing a boss as the storm closes in. We have flasks, we'll be fine. Like children giddily fleeing the scene of a cookie jar, I watch as my health ticks down. My friend asks me if I have any flasks left. I say yes. I wait for the last second, only to remember that there's a goddamn animation when you drink. I keel over mid-sip. Elsewhere in the neverending night: The run isn't going well, but it's still salvageable. We're rushing for a church to upgrade our flasks. I scrabble to scale up a cliff. Down below, a rock-flinging gravity miner decides my time has come. I make it halfway up the crag before I'm sniped out of goddamn nowhere and I plummet to the worms below. I lie in the muck below, deadly rain searing through the plates of my armour, snickering under my helmet as blood fills my mouth. In what universe would I have predicted that anElden Ringspinoff, of all games, would be so gut-bustingly funny—and so often, too? Fellow writer Ted Litchfieldcoined a term last weekthat I can't get out of my head: \"You got Nightreigned\". It's used to describe the capricious and merciless way in which Elden Ring will flatten you into paste. It's also a sitcom catchphrase, it's a punchline. It's a perfect encapsulation of the Nightreign experience, and yet it could also be accompanied by a laugh-track and a slide whistle. That's because Nightreign shares a huge amount of DNA with another game I've burst into fits of childish giggles at—Helldivers 2. A game that, by the admission of its devs, has a slapstick bent inspired heavily by theabsolute shenanigans of a good D&D table. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Nightreign and Helldivers 2 are two extremely different comedy routines with the same final joke: At any point, at any time, a procedural set of circumstances can align to completely whomp you off the face of the earth with such immediate cruelty that the only thing you can do is laugh. I'm fighting for Super Earth, and I try to dive away from an oncoming tank only to bonk my head and get shredded under its treads. I'm fighting for the Roundtable Hold, and I get poisoned three times trying to stumble around the same ruins. It's the same play being held in different theatres. I'mfrustratedmore often at Nightreign, mind, for some of the obvious reasons. The soldiers of Super Earth are immediately replaceable, and it's not long before you get back in the action. Meanwhile, each venture in Nightreign is a half-hour investment—abject failure may be hilarious, but it stings. Doom in Nightreign is also slower. In Helldivers 2, you can simply allow the reinforcement budget to run down if you aren't having fun—a bad start in Nightreign, however, can obliterate the rest of your run, forcing you to amble along to the Night 1 or 2 bosses and wait for your scheduled execution. Despite this, I'm convinced there's a similar mirth to be found somewhere. Nightreign absolutely requires a deeper zen than its cousin—but while a souls game that's consistentlyfunnyis a novelty, one that asks you to change your mindset or die mad isn't new at all. Every souls game I've ever played has demanded I shift my neurons around a bit. The OG Dark Souls taught me not to be afraid of a challenge. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice taught me that no problem was insurmountable as long as I stayed calm and remained analytic, the eye of the storm. The thing Nightreign is working on right now is my patience for misfortune and, moreover, setbacks. I get flustered and frustrated at boss runbacks, but that's what Nightreign is—a repeated 30-minute boss runback on loop. Each Nightlord is going to take a few earnest tries to even start understanding. You're gonna get whacked horribly, terribly, unfairly, at random, because your teammate didn't stick around, because you tried to solo a boss, because your build sucks, because your parry timing was off—and every time that happens to you, you're gonna have to spend 10-30 minutes getting back to that point again. But that element of slapstick—uncompromising, unexpected, and random misfortune—is also what takes the edge off. The solution to looking into the abyss, says Nightreign, is to point and laugh.

    "article_text": "I don't know whether I'd recommend doing this on an RTX 5090, though. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you've ever looked at that old graphics card sitting at the back of the shelf and thought, man, I wish that thing took up four PCIe slots and could dress up as a CPU, the good news is all you need is a 3D printer and a screwdriver. AsYouTuber TrashBench shows us(via anow-removed Reddit post), with just such tools, you can put a CPU cooler on a GPU instead of its normal cooling setup and actually improve your thermals. TrashBench unscrews the shroud and cooler and first attempts to affix the Cooler Master heatsink and fan to the GPU with zip ties, but this \"looked dumb, ran hot, and nearly rattled itself apart.\" The graphics card in question was a GTX 960 (what a card!), and in3DMark Fire Strikeit reached 40 °C with the default cooler and shroud. After being stripped of this default setup and zip tie jerry-rigged with a CPU cooler, it hit 50 °C, so not a great result. So, the tech YouTuber used a 3D printer to make a \"proper bracket\", ie, one that fits the screw holes already there in the PCB, and used it to screw in and mount the CPU cooler on top, with thermal paste betwixt the two, of course. The result was 28 °C, a resounding success. This solution isn't very practical, of course, if you have, well, just about anything below the GPU. The cooler shoots down to the bottom of the motherboard. I suppose it might fit in a case, but good luck working with anything on the motherboard below the graphics card. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Still, it's a little surprising how simple it is to pull off something like this these days—3D printers really have done the DIY world a service. And if you don't have one of those but do happen to have some zip ties (and if you don't mindworsethermal performance), you can always try that method. The zip tie cooler idea is new to me, but my colleague Andy said he and his step-brother used to do the very same thing with graphics cards of times of yore. Why not? It half makes me tempted to dig the ol' GTX 1070 out of the cupboard.

    "title": "I built a real SteamOS Steam Machine out of the guts of an old laptop so Gabe doesn't have to go through that whole sad dance again",
    "article_text": "I get why you might not want to go back, but I just made myself a Steam Machine from office bits and it was (eventually) pretty damned easy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm reminded of the time I met Gabe Newell in Las Vegas. Now, if I never type another word the story would seem far cooler than it is. Sadly it was just another CES trip, way back in the January of 2014; a simpler time where people thought the futuremightbe a positive place. Ah, how naïve we once were. I'd been invited to a relatively small suite at the top of the Palms hotel and casino, just off the Strip, where Valve and its partners were demonstrating Steam Machines for the first time. Remember those little PCs—determinedly not Windows-based—promising to deliver the living room console experience for PC gamers? Gabe delivered the presentation from a few feet in front of me, spoke enthusiastically about the future of Linux-powered game boxes, and then let us gathered journos loose to prod a selection of different Steam Machines and play with some prototype Steam Controllers within SteamOS. And maybe a handful of words passed between Gabe and I during the event. Probably something like \"I hope the quality of these prototype controllers carry on to the final units\" or \"you better hurry up and get SteamOS finished or elseAlienwareis going to do something crazy like launch its Steam Machine with Windows.\" Or maybe it was a somewhat less erudite: \"Hello Mr. Newell. Um, I like your games.\" It was a long time ago, and the memory… ah, she is a fallible mistress. But what I do remember is the utter failure of the whole endeavour as SteamOS itself faltered before it got out the gate and the Steam Machines themselves just became wee Windows boxes, before disappearing altogether. It was all rather sad, after an unveiling that promised an OS which\"combines the rock-solid architecture of Linux with a gaming experience built for the big screen\"we ended up with delay upon delay and what was an exciting moment for gamers and developers ended up with some very late launches and some unhappy partners with Steam Machine chassis they couldn't shift. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Sure, the controller itself got out there, but subjectively speaking, it sucked. You could say, however, that Gabe was playing the long game. Every detail of the unfortunate Steam Machine debacle led into theSteam Deck; arguably the true embodiment of what Valve was originally going for and surely the most successful piece of hardware the company has ever produced. At its heart is a fully realised third-generation version of SteamOS, a distribution built on top of Arch Linux, and such a hit it has been that since the Deck released back in 2022 people have been desperate to get the operating system installed onto their other PCs. Despite promises that getting a standalone version out there has been\"very high on our list\"we're only just starting to see a sort of version you can sort of jam onto your other devices. In fairness, you've been able to try that out for a while, grabbing the recovery install and see if your other hardware will take, but it's only now, 12 years after the first promise of SteamOS was made, there is actual baked-in support for other devices in the most recent 3.7 versions. Jacob has stuck it on his Legion Go Sand, of course I've made a Steam Machine with genuine SteamOS. No Bazzite-ing here. This one's for you, Gabe. As Valve has stated in the past, SteamOS is still only really here for other handheld devices, specifically supporting theLegion Go SandROG Ally, and I've honestly had pretty limited success getting the operating system working with any other handheld in my care. I was hoping the Strix Point-basedOneXFly F1 Prowould hook it, but the installation procedure falls over before it even really begins. And I didn't get much further with theOneXPlayer X1tablet, either. It's worked out better on theAyaneo Kun, where I've actually got a mostly functional setup that lets me play games with almost the same level of control over the system that the AyaSpace app affords in Windows. Sadly, the speakers don't work—and no amount of command line playtime has changed that—but, worse, the sleep function is entirely non-existent. Basically making it pretty useless as a gaming handheld. This is a perennial issue of mine with Linux. I recently stuck PopOS on a Blade 15 laptop for giggles and rapidly stopped laughing when I realised the machine would resolutely never sleep. There's alwayssomethingwith Linux and the myriad configs of PC hardware to fix, which is why tinkerers love it, why it's taking so long for Valve to get a standalone version of SteamOS out there, and why it may still not be the perfect pick for regular PC gamers wanting to jam something other than Windows onto their systems. At least not yet. But the hardware in the Ayaneo handheld is essentially the same as myFramework 13laptop with theRyzen7840U mainboard inside it, so I figured it ought to at least work as badly. Yet it works a treat. Once I'd unzipped the downloaded recovery file from SteambeforeI loaded it onto a USB stick via Rufus then I was installing SteamOS onto my laptop in no time. Andeverythingworks. SteamOS is finally delivering on its 'screw Microsoft' promise. The sound bursts from the speakers the moment it boots in and the sleep function is working exactly how it does on the Steam Deck, and with Decky Loader and SimpleDeckyTDP I can control the power of the thing. And that's exactly what I want. It makes for a very effective light-gaming laptop, with a Linux desktop there for any proper notebook work at the flip of a system setting. But the joy of the Framework setup is that you can whip out the mainboard and just use it in Standalone mode to create your own mini PC. So long as you remember to put it in that mode via the BIOSbeforeyou rip it out of the laptop frame, that is. Yeah, I had a few stutters on the way to Steam Machine nirvana. And so, with the assistance of the Cooler Master-made Framework case I now have a delightful mini PC that can plumb into a big screen living room TV and boot instantly into a gaming OS easily controllable via a joypad. We've finally gotGeForce Now natively on SteamOS, too, so I've been playing Indiana Jones at 4K Ultra settings via this little Steam Machine, kicking back in my chair. Like it or not, Windows has never made for a good experience in the living room, but SteamOS is finally delivering on its 'screw Microsoft' promise. The best thing is that it's been surprisingly easy to get things working. Okay, it's third time lucky in terms of the products that I've tried to install SteamOS on, but it's been a no-fuss experience for the most part getting it running on the Framework mainboard. The installation went smoothly, it discovered all the necessary drivers, and Decky Loader and the TDP control are but a download and a command line away respectively. I've been a little resistant to all the recent clamour of SteamOS now being available for everything—it most certainly is not—but if you can find a device that it does work on, it works brilliantly. Certainly the Radeon 780M iGPU inside my wee slab of a PC isn't going to set any speed records natively, but it's more than capable of delivering good 1080p gaming performance, and when you're running permanently cabled into the mains there's no excuse not to run it at its 40 W maximum. In all, my new Steam Machine is responsive, accessible, and surprisingly stable for a beta OS. Oh yeah, I'm running the latest beta version of the operating system, partly because I'm a glutton for punishment, but also because it now brings in keyboard shortcuts for the two SteamIOS side menus. That's certainly useful in both laptop and desktop modes, and 12 years later I'm on the way to becoming more of a convert to Gabe's thinking. As long as everything with the final standalone release is so easy… and why wouldn't it be? The process I've gone through to get my li'l Steam Machine up and running is really straightforward, and also something you could easily replicate yourself. It wouldn't necessarily have to be with a Framework board and case, either, as there's a good chance a lot of AMD-based mini PCs will take the install, too. The first step is to download theSteam Deck recovery file, this is the data that is used to reset the Steam Deck, but this page is also where Valve details the methods used to get SteamOS onto other devices. Though obviously washes its hands over responsibility for smooth operation on anything other than the Deck, Legion Go S, and ROG Ally. The next thing you'll need to do is unzip the file you just downloaded. Youcanmount it on a boot drive as is, but I've had better success from unpacking it first. Now, get yourself a USB drive you don't mind wiping—preferrably 8 GB+ as there's a lot of SteamOS—and then format it as FAT32. And to mount the OS on there, you'll needRufus. Download the program and boot it up, and then you can point it at your USB drive and the SteamOS repair file. Click Start to get the ball rolling and a handful of minutes later Rufus will have created you a bootable SteamOS installation drive. You will need to disable Secure Boot in the BIOS, too. This is a vital step. Now, you will need to prep whatever device you're hoping to install to. The first thing I would suggest is that you find the most recent BIOS you can and make sure it's installed on your target device. For some handheld devices that might be the difference between functional sleep modes or not, because Modern Standby or the lack thereof is what's holding back my Ayaneo device right now, and that's only enabled via a firmware update. You will also need to disable Secure Boot in the BIOS, too. This is a vital step in ensuring your device even gets close to installing the Valve OS. And for me, I needed to enable Standalone mode in the Framework BIOS. There is a chassis intrusion sensor that we need to tell the mainboard to ignore if it's getting stuck inside anything else—like a wee case,or a power deskfor example—and you can't access it once the board is outside of the Framework 13 laptop chassis. For this project I actually ran the installation while the Framework board was still configured inside a laptop—I wasn't 100% confident the setup would be fine, and figured it would be a quicker operation with a pre-attached screen, keyboard, and touchpad. But the process is essentially the same for any other device: stick the USB drive in a spare port on your machine, boot into the BIOS, and select your USB stick (partition 1) as the boot drive. From there on you'll hopefully get a screed of text cascading down the screen before you boot into a live OS to create your install. This is essentially the desktop SteamOS environment and there will be a selection of shortcuts at the top of the screen and you want to double-click the one marked Wipe Device and Install SteamOS. Obviously. You'll need to confirm that you want to raze everything on your machine to the ground, and click Proceed. Then it will go through the process of installing the operating system for you and then it will reboot. If you are lucky, and your system is content with the current state of SteamOS, then you will find yourself booting into a fresh new operating system. The first thing to do here is to make sure you are running the latest version of the OS. Nip into the Settings menu, select System and check for software updates. Personally, at this point, I would look at the System Update Channel section and select Beta rather than Stable. Chances are you'll benefit more from quicker updates. From here, the one thing I would make sure of is to have Decky Loader and SimpleDeckyTDP installed so you can control the power draw of your system. This is especially important if you're running something off a battery, but it also helps you control noise to a certain extent. You'll need to jump into the desktop mode of SteamOS to do this, though. So bring up the Settings menu again, go into Power and Switch to Desktop. It will then boot into a relatively familiar Windows-style desktop environment. You may need to install FireFox so you have a functioning browser, but that will be accessible from the Applications button on the taskbar. Then navigate to theDecky Loader main pageand hit download. Then bring up the file manager to access your downloads and double-click the file and select Execute to run it. Getting the power control feature installed is a bit more Linux-y in that you'll need to hit the Konsole. But first you'll likely need a password so you can get things done in there. Hit the System Settings button, scroll down to Users and hit the Change Password button. You won't have one already, so just put in one now, and select not to change the password for other areas. Now, navigate to theSimpleDeckyTDP github pageand go to the install section. From here, boot the Konsole app and copy the install commands from the browser into the command line in Konsole. Hit enter, and it will start installing. Once that's complete, reboot your machine into Game mode and you'll find Decky Loader and SimpleDeckyTDP at the foot of the secondary control menu. That's either Shift+CTRL+Tab on a keyboard or Xbox button+A on a controller. From there, you're weapons-free to install and play games at will on your new machine. Have at it. For me, well once that was done I had to get the mainboard out of the laptop and installed into the little Cooler Master chassis. Thankfully Framework makes that super easy, and there's a full guide on how to do it on its site. It was essentially just a question of installing the Wi-Fi cable routing, dropping in the PCB and hooking that and the 3.5 mm audio jack up to the board. It's finally worth noting for anyone doing this that the HDMI display output needed to be on one of the top two I/O modules for it to output to our 4K Alienware OLED properly, and the same is true of the USB Type-C module, too.

    "title": "Elden Ring Nightreign Sentient Pest boss guide: How to beat Gnoster",
    "article_text": "Somehow this bug-based expedition is also one of the most beautiful. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ever wondered what a mech would look like if it were made of bugs? No? Well, it would be theSentient Pest, a big scorpion with a moth on top that drives it around like a magic tank. Considering it's two bosses combined into the ultimate fighting bug, working outhow to beat Gnosteris quite a challenge inElden Ring Nightreign. Gnoster is one of the sixNightreign bossesyou unlock after beating Gladius for the first time. Then, you need to defeat three more Nightlords to unlockNight Aspect, the true final boss. Although Sentient Pest can be tough, at least it's not theDarkdrift Knight, so I recommend prioritising learning how to kill it to tick off another Nightlord. It's also worth noting that the Sentient Pest can invade expeditions against other Nightlords, where they'll appear as anenemy stealing your runesvia a plague of locusts. Dealing with this invasion is completely different from their dedicated boss, so I won't go over that here. To beat the bug duo, you need the right equipment. Of course, this includes taking thebest rune farming routeand keeping an eye out forlegendary weaponsthat suit your build, but there are a few specifics to understand too: Gnoster is weak to fire damage, which is no doubt music to your ears as it's generally the easiest affinity to come across. Use the map overlay to search locations marked with the fire symbol during a run, or simply use the Night of the Beast relic you got from defeating Gladius to get guaranteed fire on your starting weapon and upgrade it usingsmithing stones(and possibly theShifting Earth: Craterevent if it's active). You can also get a specific buff on relics unique to Wylder that give his abilities fire damage, making him one of the stronger melee picks for this boss. Gnoster deals two different damage types beyond pure physical: the scorpion and moth both spread poison clouds, but the moth also fires magic projectiles. Talismans, relics, and passive upgrades can give you poison resistance and magic damage negation, but don't overlook neutralising boluses. These cure poison, but also sneakily heal you and improve your resistances. While Gnoster isn't the hardest boss, I recommend reaching level 12 before battling the bugs, simply because it can be quite a drawn-out fight and splitting up from your allies is a key strategy. Taking relics with increased rune acquisition will help with this, as will grabbing the buff from small trees surrounded by a golden glow. You should also max out your flask charges by visiting churches, so you've got as much healing as you can. The Sentient Pest is perhaps the most unique boss in Nightreign, and it requires an equally unique approach to take it down. While most of the characters at the top of ourNightreign tier listwill do good, I recommend the following for a goodteam composition: You'll generally want to have two ranged characters and one melee fighter (or hybrids like Duchess), and split your team in two. The ranged players take on the moth while the fighter keeps the scorpion busy until the bugs combine. Since Gnoster is technically two bosses in one, there's quite a bit to keep track of depending on which one you're fighting. Once the shared health bar reaches around 60%, the bugs will combine into one and share some abilities: Attack Explanation Counter Magic missile (moth) The moth's basic attack is a quick barrage of magic bolts that track towards you. Dodge towards them or run in any other direction to cause the bolts to hit the ground next to you instead. Magic rain (moth) When the moth flies even higher into the sky (and the scorpion hardens), it will unleash a barrage of magic that rains down on the ground and spreads out further as the attack goes on. To avoid this move, dodge towards the wave of rain so that any remaining bolts hit the ground behind you. If you try to dodge or run away, you'll only be keeping yourself in the danger zone. Poison mist (moth) When the moth flies down to the ground, it can breathe poisonous mist that hangs around before it dissipates. You'll want to get out of this mist by dodging and running backwards as quickly as you can to avoid being poisoned. Grab (moth) If the moth quickly flies towards you, it's going in for a grab attack. This deals damage and can poison you. You can avoid being grabbed by dodging or running to the side. It's tricky to time it right, so it might take a few attempts. Burrow (scorpion) The scorpion will occasionally burrow underground and begin to charge at you, where it will then erupt from the ground. Keep an eye out for the dust trail as the scorpion burrows, so you know who it's targeting and where it'll emerge. Spread out if multiple people are fighting the scorpion. Dodge and run away when you notice it stops, just before it emerges. Slam (scorpion) When the scorpion stands up on its hind legs, it's preparing to smash on the ground ahead of it, dealing damage on impact and creating a small wave of damage. This attack impacts a small radius directly ahead of the scorpion, so you can roll forwards to get under and around the sides to avoid being caught in the shockwave. Stomp (scorpion) Using its many legs, the scorpion can quickly stomp to its side. This attack can follow the slam, so be careful if they come in quick succession. This attack is easy enough to avoid by dodging to the side of the stomping leg. Orbital laser (combined) A small patch of light appears on the ground before a laser beam begins firing. When you see the beam of light appear on the ground, run away quickly to avoid the subsequent laser. These only have a small radius and short duration, so they're easy enough to avoid. However, be careful as multiple lasers can be activated at once. Charge (combined) One of its most deadly attacks, the scorpion stands up and roars before they both charge at you several times. The scorpion stomps while the moth fires a barrage of magic. There is a second variation of this attack where the moth fires a barrage of projectiles, followed up by the scorpion jumping at you immediately after. As soon as you see the scorpion roar, stop attacking and be prepared to move. Repeatedly dodge sideways to avoid being hit by the charge and the magic bolts. Facing one boss is often hard enough, so don't even attempt to fight both the scorpion and the moth during phase one. One or two people should fight the moth, who takes the most damage, while another player should duke it out with the scorpion elsewhere in the arena. By keeping the bugs separate, you're keeping your allies safe from their attacks. Don't drop your guard, though, sometimes they'll change their target and randomly lash out, so always keep an eye on the boss you're not actively fighting. Don't repeat what happened on my first attempt, where I had a team full of melee characters swinging at the clouds. It's incredibly hard to beat Gnoster without at least one ranged damage dealer, in fact, the easiest way is to bring multiple. Sure, you could technically ignore the moth entirely during phase one and only damage the tanky scorpion, but this means you'll have to deal with both bosses attacking you. This inevitably leads to pure chaos and taking way more damage than you have to, plus it takes even longer because the scorpion is more resistant to damage. With the moth flying about and teleporting, and the scorpion burrowing or hardening its carapace, it's not always easy to land an ultimate ability, or follow up on any potential stagger. You're best off saving high HP and stagger damage ultimates like Wylder's Onslaught Stake or Ironeye's Single Shot until the bugs combine, where it's much easier to land both and capitalise on these key attacks.

    "article_text": "I hated Phys Ed as a kid—but I'm sure I would have changed my tune if the curriculum included server tossing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When you can't sell or even give away your well-worn hardware, it's not unheard of for folks to get a little creative with how they get rid of their e-waste. There are a number of ways to dispose of old tech—though I would strongly recommend against shooting your old phone with an archery arrow, and I would also ask you not to ask me how I came into possession of this knowledge. Thankfully, I've just learnt about a hardware harming pastime I can happily shout about. CloudFestis a cloud infrastructure conference that saw folks from all over the globe descend on Europa-Park in Rust, Germany earlier this year, and once again brought a little known underground sport to a wider audience: Server tossing. Conference attendees of all ability levels and genders were welcome to apply to toss servers—the only necessary qualification requested was the \"desire to throw a server really %&#*ing far.\" TheWorld Server Throwing Championshiphas been enjoyed by a spectating crowd at CloudFest for a couple of years now—and applications are already open for theUS-based server tossing event coming up in November. The sport itself has a long andlargely made-up history, but its most likely origin story can be traced back more than a decade to some disgruntled sys admins in Holland. The first edition of the tournament as we know it today took place in 2011, giving rise to a compound word that makes me wish I spoke a little more Dutch: 'Serverwerpen'. Archival footage of that2011 competitionlooks almost quaint now, but compared to thesizzle reel for 2025's championship, there is one thing that stands out to me: namely, how close the crowd is on all sides in the footage from the more recent events. I'm sure spinning, shotput-style windups are disallowed to minimise the risk of a server toss that goes offpiste, but the lack of eye protection gear does still make me wince at every throw. Thankfully, it appears most competitors and attendees come out of the event in far better shape than any of the servers. Competitors have two attempts to lob a server as far as they can, with the qualifying throws from 2025's event not just seeing some impressive air but record-breaking distances too. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. According to thisrecap of the 2025 event, Linda Splitt placed first in the women's division by hurling a server a distance of 11.10 metres—an honour she also lists on her LinkedIn profile. In the men's division however, there was a major upset as Thom van Hal placed first with a throw of 13.18 metres, wrestling the previous record from Bartosz “The Beast” Wojciak who won last year. Now I don't know about you, but I'm definitely not an IT professional immersed in the world of cloud infrastructure—nor am I especially gifted in the strength department. All the same, I'm still adding 'lob a server' to my career bucket list. Best gaming PC: The top pre-built machines.Best gaming laptop: Great devices for mobile gaming.

    "article_text": "The beautiful irony of idiotic AI. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Among the countless examples of the ever-burgeoning ens***ification of the internet, Google's AI-powered search overviews rank pretty highly. Verily, I pine for the days of reliable, organic search results devoid of AI slop. But don't despair. Well, not entirely. For the editor-in-chief of our sister website, Tom's Hardware, has come up with abrowser extension that gets rid of AI overviews from Google search results. Give it up for Avram Piltch and hisBye Bye, Google AIextension. To quote the man himself, Avram says Google, \"decided to push AI overviews and AI mode onto search users, regardless of the damage it causes to the user experience or the harm it may inflict on publishers and the entire open web.\" He also points out that Google is rolling out AI Overviews to ever more territories and countries and fears that Google may eventually want to replace all organic search results with AI Overviews . His solution is the aforementioned Bye, Bye Google AI, which works in Chrome or Edge or any desktop browser that supports Chrome extensions. He's currently working on Firefox and Safari versions. \"The extension allows you to hide the AI Overview section from all of your queries and goes a step further, allowing you to hide other areas of the Google SERP that you may not want, such as the videos section, text ads, or 'People Also Ask,'\" Avram says. The latest 1.5 version now supports 19 languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, Mandarin (Trad + Simplified), Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, Hindi, Thai, Greek, Italian, Polish, Russian, Dutch, Danish and Portuguese. You can also now hide the AI Mode tab, not just AI Overviews. Avram also explains the other ways to kill the AI Overview, such as adding \"-noai\" to your search string. But if you want to permanently kill AI Overviews—or at least for as long as this extension works and Google is serving up any organic results at all—thenBye, Bye Google AIfeels like a no brainer of an extension. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Of course, you could just use another search engine, like DuckDuckGo. Moreover, the seemingly falling quality of Google's organic results isn't fixed by this extension.

    "title": "'The problem isn't necessarily the yellow paint', says the Witcher 4 design lead, but its overuse: 'People see through the smoke and mirrors'",
    "article_text": "You're always being guided, you're just annoyed when you realise it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. One of the more surface-level discourses in videogames in recent memory has been the hullabaloo over yellow paint—gamers the world over decrying games with obvious sunshine climbables as being patronising slop for little babies (I'm exaggerating, a little). But Miles Tost, the level design lead for The Witcher 4, tells PCG's Joshua Wolens that it's a little more complicated than yellow paint good or yellow paint bad. All videogames use the environment to guide players through them—though, Tost admits, it wasn't always that way. In fact, CDPR simply stumbled into a lot of solid industry practices when making The Witcher 3. \"Level design may not have been as sophisticated as it is now. And I think the same is true for most disciplines in the industry,\" Tost explains. \"In The Witcher 3, we didn't do too much of that, actually. The level design team was still being built, [it] was really fresh, and in some ways it took us the entirety of production to get to a point where we would do (what I would nowadays consider) more traditional level design. \"As such, we didn't emphasise guidance as strongly—we did at some point add these white decals for 'hey, climb here', but I think when it comes to overall guidance in the world, it was a relatively small element, right?\" Instead, Tost says that the design teams simply followed their noses and wound up on a lot of decisions that would later become industry practice. \"We did a lot of things—and maybe it's luck—butintuitivelycorrect … Nowadays, we're much more sophisticated with that, I think.\" A good example of CDPR finally nailing down the specifics, Tost argues, is Phantom Liberty: \"I think there we have all the bells and whistles of what level designers here do. We use compositional line work in our levels, to make things look particularly impressive, but also to guide the eye to certain elements … In the Witcher 3, we would use a lot of composition, but it was mostly to get the most impressive image, without the real purpose [behind it].\" When it comes to something as straightforwardly obvious as yellow paint, though, Tost says that \" We've always thought about our games as being still quite accessible to a wider audience, so we're not afraid of adding elements that'll also guide players more directly, whether it's NPCs shouting out and saying 'look at this thing', or the Witcher sense in the Witcher 3.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. However, \"In the best of cases, [the player] doesn't understand or feel like they're being guided in any way.\" When it comes to what Tost jokes as \"being in a 'yellow room',\" he reckons they're \"one of the many tools that developers can use. But they'reone ofthe tools they can use, right? \"I believe that if you properly weaponise the entire arsenal of your toolkit of guidance as a level designer, then you can subdue each individual element and make it more subtle. And in that case, you get closer to the situation of the player not noticing the guidance. The strings carefully pulling them along. That is, for me, the sweet spot. \"I think the problem is not necessarily with the yellow paint, but it's so known and used right now that people see through the smoke and mirrors there. That 'oh, I am being guided'. But there's more subtle ways of doing it.\" It's a little funny to hear an argument that basically boils down to 'you need to trick your kids into eating their veggies', but it is right.Assassin's Creed Shadows, which has plenty of colour-coded climables, tried to go without. But becauseUbisofthad to put in all the foliage and pretty bells and whistles that players expected, they simply kept running into walls or missing climbable routes entirely. So, a little direction is vital. Tost still thinks it ought to be subtle. Or at least diegetic—I'm not sure I'd consider The Witcher 3's Arkham-style detective vision to not have any sort of influence on the artstyle. A great example, Tost mentions, is Uncharted and its occasional uses of flags waving in the wind: \"It fits gently into the environment, as opposed to, I dunno—someone went into this specific spot and painted a yellow line, because at that point it's not necessarily believable.\" The Witcher 4: What we know about Ciri's storyWitcher 3 mods: Good huntingThe Witcher books: Where to startWitcher 3 console commands: Cheat deathThe Witcher season 4: Hemsworth's debut Harvey's history with games started when he first begged his parents for a World of Warcraft subscription aged 12, though he's since been cursed with Final Fantasy 14-brain and a huge crush on G'raha Tia.

    "title": "I've been gaming with Razer's new wireless charging mouse pad and I'm glad there's finally serious competition for Logitech",
    "article_text": "About that price, though… When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Mouse pads that charge your gaming mouse never quite took off in the way I expected them to. They made a grand entrance, then they lingered for a little while, and then seemed to fade away. Now, hot on the heels of Logitech's recent Mk.2 release, Razer has just launched its newHyperFlux V2 Wireless Charging System. The charging pad, Razer explains, delivers \"continuous wireless charging directly through the mouse mat, eliminating the need for charging cables or docks entirely.\" This, of course, means you won't have to do anything to charge your mouse at all, provided you keep it on the HyperFlux pad. Not just any mouse, though—it has to be one that can fit Razer's charging puck into the bottom. It's the same charging puck slot that some Razer mice can use with theDock Pro, so you get the same mouse compatibility as with that dock: Basilisk V3 Pro 35K,Basilisk V3 Pro,Cobra Pro, and Naga V2 Pro. I've been using the HyperFlux V2 with a Basilisk V3 Pro 35K for the past few days and have been really enjoying my time with it. I've got the hard pad version (there's a cloth one, too), and the first thing that jumps out to me is actually nothing to do with the wireless charging. It's just how much I've missed using a hard pad because boy is this thingsmooth. I sent a quick video to my colleagues of me gently nudging my mouse across it and the general consensus was that it's a little like a puck on an air hockey table. If that slipperiness isn't your jam, of course you can go for the cloth version. I also spent a lot of time with the newLogitech G PowerPlay 2 charging mouse padand scored that one a low 40% primarily because it's expensive, has just a flimsy cloth pad on top of the charging station, and most importantly doesn't include a wireless receiver (you have to plug in a separate dongle to connect your mouse to your PC). I'm happy to say that the Razer HyperFlux V2 does have a wireless receiver built-in, so you won't need to plug in the mouse padandthe mouse, just the pad which the mouse connects to. Razer claims \"seamless auto-pairing\" for the HyperFlux V2, and this seemed to bear out. I just slotted the puck into the mouse and slapped it on top of the pad and it connected and worked. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This Razer pad also looks and feels premium in a way the new Logitech one doesn't. It's solid, has a nice bezel to the edges, is practically immovable when placed, and its receiver station zone at the top (whatever you want to call it) is in that iPhone camera island cut-out kind of style which looks rather nice, as does its LED which hints towards low/medium/high battery life. Just like the PowerPlay 2, though, it might not be big enough for low sensitivity players. And unlike the PowerPlay 2, the mouse pad is attached, which presumably means no replacements. Although I don't see anywhere to actually get a replacement PowerPlay 2 cloth pad, either. I'm excited that we have some actual competition in this charging mouse pad space. What doesn't make me quite so excited is the price tag. We're looking at $120 for this thing, which is more than the PowerPlay 2. One of my main criticisms of the PowerPlay V2 was its price, and although that was in part in comparison to its predecessor, the fact is that even in a vacuum $120 is still a lot for a mouse pad, charging or no charging. Best gaming mouse: the top rodents for gamingBest gaming keyboard: your PC's best friend...Best gaming headset: don't ignore in-game audio I've yet to figure out exactly what I think of that irksome price tag, but I'll be mulling things over as I formulate my full review of the HyperFlux V2. Razer has done a charging mouse pad before, but that was in the form of a Mamba HyperFlux combo, with both mouse and mouse pad. That tended to go for about $200-$250, and given the Mamba mouse alone went for close to $100, the price for this charging station doesn't seem to have shifted much. Still, as I said, you are getting a very premium mouse pad here in terms of both looks and feel. And you're getting a built-in wireless receiver so you only have to plug in the mouse pad and not a dongle for the mouse, too. From a subjective perspective, I know that I get excited each morning when I remember I'll soon be using this Razer HyperFlux, and I didn't feel anything like that towards the PowerPlay 2. For that experience, though, you're spending $20 on top of what you'd spend on the PowerPlay 2 that I reckon costs too much. And you're limited to just a few Razer mice, and not its best ones, at that. It's certainly new competition, but not the ideal competition I'd hoped for. Mixed feelings, here.

    "title": "Epic cops to the Epic Games Store sucking for the 2nd time in a month as it proudly announces its money-hose has spaffed over $2 billion",
    "article_text": "Which has been pretty good for devs, at least. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm beginning to think poor Epic is developing some sort of complex. Nary a month after CEO Tim Sweeney took to the airwaves to admit that, yeah, theEpic Games Store sure is clunky, the store's general manager Steve Allison has taken to the stage (viaGamesRadar) at yesterday's Unreal Fest to admit that \"even after years of building the store on PC, we know there's still a ton of work to be done to deliver a world-class experience.\" Of course, he's not wrong. Allison said that as a lead-in to talk about all the features that were due to trickle into the Epic Games Store in the near future: stuff like preloading, gifting, and game-independent voice and text chat. You know, stuff that Steam has had for years. Oh, and as for clunkiness: \"We're also putting great focus on ongoing launcher improvements that will make the store feel great to use.\" These are all good and correct things to be implementing and working on, of course, but the EGS is seven years old at this point, and it's still scrambling to achieve basic parity with Steam. If the grand visions Allison announced on stage at Unreal Fest come to pass, the EGS won't be more attractive than Steam, it just won't be quite as unattractive, relatively. It doesn't sound like a proposition that will win many people over. Still, Epic's forays into digital distribution are working out for some people: game studios. Epic says it's paid out over $2 billion to devs and publishers, all while giving the likes of you and me a bajillion free games I will probably never remember to actually play. Still, it's good to know they're there. Hey, good for Epic. As much as I don't use the Epic launcher, I do think the company—whatever its reason—does a lot of things on its business-side I wish Steam would adopt. EGS' 12% cut on revenue from its store is a lot less galling than the meaty 30% Valve takes at base, and its various schemes to tempt devs and publishers—like its recently announced 0% fee for all games until they make $1 million in revenue—would be great to see on PC gaming's most popular storefront. But none of these things are going to tempt players, I think, and nor will just bringing the EGS up to parity with Steam. I have to admit, Epic's biggest hurdle to getting me using its store has little to do with functionality or player-treat schemes. It's the simple fact that I have 1,400 games on Steam and little desire to suddenly start up a whole new, separate shelf. I don't know how Epic can ever overcome that, but it's probably not with preloading. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Inevitably creating the potential for bots emailing other bots and absolutely nothing else to worry about. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. My Gmail inbox currently has 84,685 unread emails. Were there an AI tool that could clear my backlog automatically, let's just say you could sign me up and take my money. It's the only way I'm going to achieve inbox hygiene (there's always the trashcan button - Ed.). Rejoice, then, because the head of Google DeepMind says they're working on a next-gen Gmail that can answer emails for you. Yep, Demis Hassabis has been speaking at the SXSW London festival (via the Guardian) about all things AI. And apart from predicting the arrival of AGI or artificial general intelligence within five to 10 years, Hassabis revealed Google's plans for clearing the world's email backlog. \"I would love to get rid of my email. I would pay thousands of dollars per month to get rid of that,\" Hassabis said. More specifically, he said Google was planning, \"something that would just understand what are the bread-and-butter emails, and answer in your style—and maybe make some of the easier decisions.\" Such a technology raises all kinds of immediate questions. Such as, why not pay a human thousands of dollars per month to manage that for you. Like an executive assistant maybe? And exactly what kind of email will it answer? Will it actually save you much time if in practice you need to know it's answered for you and what exactly it said? I mean, if your Gmail bot replies, \"sure, I'm on it\" or \"thanks, understood,\" well, you'd need to be actually on it or have understood it, right? Likewise, do you trust any AI with your personal communications? Slightly more dystopianly (if that's a word, and it ought to be, I sense we're going to need it, though it might need another 'n' or perhaps an extra 'l'), it also raises the prospect of bots spiralling off into endless back-and-forth comms. After all, if you are a Gmail user who emails another Gmail user, you'd presumably have situations where you fire off an email, their Gmail bot replies, following which your Gmail bot decides to weigh in and they're off to the races, chatting away. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Somewhat ironically, Hassabis also said AI could be used to protect you from attention-grabbing AI algorithms. The idea is that an AI assistant might give you, \"more time and maybe protect your attention from other algorithms trying to gain your attention. I think we can actually use AI in service of the individual.\" So, that's Google's bots protecting you from the attention-grabbing efforts of other companies' bots. What a time to be alive that will be. Of course, we could just cut out the toxic attention grabbing nonsense in the first place. Sorry, silly idea. Without the toxic algorithms, Google couldn't sell you a bot to protect you from its competitors, while those competitors presumably sell you another bot to protect you from Google's algorithms.

    "title": "Elden Ring Nightreign Darkdrift Knight boss guide: How to beat Fulghor",
    "article_text": "Screw the Night Aspect, Fulghor is the real final boss. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Although theDarkdrift Knightexpedition is just one of the standard Nightlords on the way to the secret final boss, Fulghor may as well be the top dog inElden Ring Nightreign. He's incredibly tough to slay, so much so that I'd beaten every other Nightlord (yes, including Night Aspect) before returning to him—and I doubt I'm alone in this. Working outhow to beat Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow, is potentially the toughest hurdle to overcome. If you're trying to complete all theElden Ring Nightreign Remembrancesfor each character, then I'm sorry to say that you'll be required to beat Fulghor on at least one occasion. Ironeye, the best character in ourNightreign tier list, demands you kill Fulghor in Chapter 6, and right after youunlock Revenant, you'll be sent to kill Fulghor or Gladius again, the first of theNightreign bosses. It shouldn't be a surprise when I recommend you kill Gladius again over challenging the Champion of Nightglow. As one of the hardest bosses, Fulghor demands that you start gearing up correctly immediately to have the best chance of beating him. Of course, this includes taking thebest rune farming routeand keeping an eye out forlegendary weaponsthat suit your build, but there are a few specifics to understand too: Though the symbol looks annoyingly similar to holy damage, Fulghor is weak to lightning. Dealing enough lightning damage can stagger him and even interrupt when he's casting holy spells, so it's a game-changer in beating him. When you enter a run, use the map overlay to search locations marked with the lightning symbol, or use relics that give your starting weapon lightning damage and upgrade it usingsmithing stones(and theShifting Earth: Craterevent if it's active). You can also use relics that boost lightning damage to make your attacks even more effective. When luck really isn't on your side, remember that you can also use lightning grease to temporarily coat your weapon. If you're taking this approach, bring two stacks of lightning grease to be safe. My biggest pet peeve with any boss fight is when they move around so much that you can't even attack them back, and that couldn't be more applicable to Fulghor, but there is a remedy. To avoid this fight taking acentaur-y, you can use damage-over-time ailments, scarlet rot or poison, to damage Fulghor when he's running around out of reach. Poison is easy enough to find, but scarlet rot is typically rarer, so I recommend completing the Shifting Earth: Rotted Woods event if it's active in your run. Most of Fulghor's attacks, at least the most painful ones, deal holy damage. You probably already learned the hard way, but he hits like a truck, so anything you can do to take the edge off is worth getting. I recommend using relics with holy damage negation if you have them (check the Small Jar Bazaar in the Roundtable Hold if you don't) and keep your eyes peeled for the Haligdrake talisman during your expedition. Get both a suitable relic and the talisman, and you'll have around 25% holy damage negation. I recommend getting as close to level 15 as you can before facing Fulghor, as each level gives you more health, stamina, and overall damage. Taking relics with increased rune acquisition will help with this, as will grabbing the buff from small trees surrounded by a golden glow. You should also max out your flask charges by visiting churches. Even if you interrupt key attacks, Fulghor rarely stops moving, making it hard to get into melee range. Characters with a range advantage or high mobility generally come out on top in this fight, though it's not a bad idea to bring a tank along too for a balancedteam composition: Whatever you do, I'd generally advise against Revenant for Fulghor. His sweeping attacks wipe out her summons quickly, and most have a hard time keeping up with him anyhow. Plus, if you're building Revenant as a ranged spellcaster, you might as well play Recluse. Nevertheless, it's time to put the Darkdrift Knight in the dirt, so here's how to beat Fulghor: Fulghor has a handful of deadly attacks that either need to be dodged or interrupted to avoid an untimely death: Attack Explanation Counter Swipes Fulghor's basic attack is a three-hit combo with his spear, which also creates shockwaves for added range. There's quite a delay between the attacks, so don't let it throw you off. He can also mix up this combo with stomps and by dragging his spear on the ground. Since he lunges a lot during this combo, with strong AoE damage to boot, it's best to just wait it out, especially if you're his target. If you're a ranged character, then keep chipping away at him, and dodge backwards when you need to. Jump slam Occasionally, Fulghor launches into the air and slams down. When you see him rear and raise his weapon, he's usually about to dive on you. Fulghor can easily change targets with this attack, so you should always be prepared to dodge, even if you weren't his target beforehand. Holy spear slam One of Fulghor's most powerful attacks is a spear slam that creates holy spears underneath you. You'll see him stand still and raise his spear as he charges the attack before jabbing the ground. You can interrupt this attack entirely by dealing enough lightning damage to Fulghor as he's charging the attack, or by using high-stagger ultimates like Wylder's Onslaught Stake or Ironeye's Single Shot. You can also dodge immediately as he slams the ground to avoid the holy spear. You'll briefly be slowed if you hit him during this attack, so if you can't do enough lightning or stagger, just don't attack him for a bit. That said, you can still dodge the attack while slowed, though it's a little trickier. Breaking him out of this attack is the perfect opportunity to deal some damage. Holy damage negation also comes into play here. Holy charge Fulghor's most troublesome attack is a dash that leaves holy fissures behind him. He'll typically run towards a player and briefly stop before charging again. These fissures explode shortly after. When Fulghor starts this attack, focus fully on avoiding his charge by running or dodging, and then sprint out of the fissure's range before it follows up. Wait until he's stopped using this attack before going back on the offensive. If you do get hit, any holy damage negation will mitigate how much it hurts. Claw arm combo During his second phase, Fulghor grows a massive arm that he uses for even wider-ranging sweep attack combos. In his second phase, you need to be even more precise with your dodges (and generally dodge towards him), as his sweep combos have large AoEs. Only attack once Fulghor has finished the combo, as he'll take a second to recover, giving you a brief opening. Since these attacks are forward-moving sweeps, I suggest getting behind him by dodging through the attacks when there's an opening. Claw arm slam Fulghor will also use this arm to slam the ground, creating a massive shockwave. When you see Fulghor leap into the air and spin, he's about to dive on a player. Whether you're the target or not, you're likely still in the range of the AoE damage. To avoid it, dodge roll or jump just before his arm reaches the ground to avoid taking damage from either the slam or the shockwave. Again, you need to be very precise. What makes Darkdrift Knight arguably more difficult than Night Aspect is the incredible precision you need to avoid his attacks. More so than most, you really need to wait for the right moment to strike, so don't expect to pull off more than a few hits before you need to return your focus to dodging. It's worth reiterating that Fulghor is weak to lightning. Not only will you deal bonus damage, but you can also stagger and interrupt him during key attacks, like the holy spear slam. If everyone on your team has lightning damage, whether it's from your weapon, a spell, grease, or even a bomb, it makes the fight much more manageable. He's also far easier to stun with lightning melee weapons than, say, a bow, if you can get close enough to hit him. Unless you've completely mastered his attacks, you'll inevitably get hit and eventually die. Due to Fulghor's oppressive moveset, you generally won't have time to hit an ally to revive them if they've died more than once already. Wending Grace to self-revive, or saving ultimates to revive (like Guardian, Revenant, or even Ironeye), goes a long way to keeping your team in the fight.

    "title": "AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT 16 GB review (XFX Swift)",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When it comes to the entry-level GPU market, pricing is everything. And while the RX 9060 XT isn't quite capable of outright beating Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti, it often comes within touching distance of it—all for an $80 lower MSRP. That makes it the budget card to beat right now, if you ask me. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. The AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT is, I think it's fair to say, one of the most anticipated graphics cards of this generation. Gamers on a tight budget have had a tough time of it in recent years, and AMD's new entry-level card feels aggressively designed (and priced, no less) to hit Nvidia where it hurts. At $299 for the 8 GB version and $349 for the 16 GB variant, the latter I have in front of me here, the little AMD card is not just looking to knock the $299 RTX 5060 off its precarious perch, but even aims to take a swing at the $429 RTX 5060 Ti. Everyone loves an underdog story, but in a GPU market plagued by inflated prices and less-than-impressive generational performance gains, the RX 9060 XT has its work cut out from the start. So, what you're likely wondering is, does it give Nvidia's budget offerings a comprehensive floor-wiping? Not quite. But what AMD has come up with here is a cool, calm, and collected 1080p and 1440p performer for a very reasonable sum, and right now that feels like a cool breeze on a hot summer's day. ✅ You want bang for your buck:The RX 9060 XT might not be the fastest card on the market, but nothing touches it for its MSRP. Assuming that price translates to reality, of course, so cross your fingers.✅ You want a budget upgrade for modern 1080p or 1440p gaming:Smooth 4K gaming is beyond even the fastest budget cards, but at lower resolutions the RX 9060 XT delivers great performance for the cash, particularly compared to previous generations. ❌ Money isn't much of an issue:Should you be feeling flush and don't mind spending a fair bit more, the RTX 5060 Ti will deliver faster performance overall—and much more overclocking potential.❌ You want productivity performance:This is a gaming card, through and through, so if you're looking for productivity chops then Nvidia is the way to go. I've had the XFX Swift version of the AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT sitting in one of our benchmarking rigs for the past week, and it's rather impressive. While it's not quite been able to beat out our RTX 5060 Ti sample overall (AMD's claims that it's 6% faster than the RTX 5060 Ti at 1440p haven't proved out in my testing), it often comes perilously close at both 1080p and 1440p resolutions for a full $80 less—and that's just the sort of thing that might cause Nvidia to drop the Ti's price down in response. Competition is a good thing, y'see, and the RX 9060 XT provides just that. And as for the $299 RTX 5060? Fuggedaboutit. While the Nvidia card is $50 less, the extra performance you receive from the 16 GB RX 9060 XT is more than worth the money, in my opinion. The RX 9060 XT might not quite have the goods to outright beat the RTX 5060 Ti in many of our benchmarks, but it's so close to it it makes the non-Ti card look poorly-equipped by comparison. Not to mention, the 8 GB RX 9060 XT is the same cash as the RTX 5060 at MSRP. That being said, I'll be very interested to see if the RX 9060 XT's MSRP proves out in practice. This generation of GPUs has been marred by low availability, ludicrous retailer mark ups, and a host of factors that have made it hard to recommend any card—given what it'll likely end up costing you when you plug your details in at the checkout. Ultimately, though, I have to review the GPU in front of me, and I can say that it's a good 'un. It's also been remarkably stable, only finally sullying its 100% reliability record once I pushed those GDDR6 memory chips past their stated speeds. My particular XFX sample isn't much of an overclocker compared to the Palit RTX 5060 Ti, for sure, but I'd wager that even in 2025, most people are more concerned with the apples to apples performance you get from either card fresh from the box. And in the RX 9060 XT's case? I'd say it's got enough grunt to make the RTX 5060 Ti worry. Time will tell if that pricing holds out, but should you be able to find one for MSRP, it's the new budget GPU I'd plump for if I was looking to save a penny or two. Money makes all the difference at this end of the market, and an $80 saving goes a long way towards some shiny new games, a slightly better CPU, or even just a good night out. Great entry-level GPUs have been far too expensive for far too long, if you ask me. The RX 9060 XT, though? It might just be the turning of the tide. Fingers crossed, ey? When it comes to the specs, the little RX 9060 XT looks a lot like an RX 9070 XT, only halved. It's a Navi 44 variant built on TSMC's N4P process with 32 RDNA 4 Compute Units, 32 Ray Tracing Accelerators and 64 AI Accelerators, all of which matches with that basic equation—although with a stated 3.1 GHz boost frequency as standard, it certainly comes with a hefty dose of clock speed straight out of the box. Those improved RDNA 4 CUs are key to AMD's recent catch up to Nvidia-like performance, in tandem with third generation RT Accelerators that mean the red team is no longer on the back foot when it comes to the increasingly-important ray tracing performance figures. We're starting to see games likeDoom: The Dark Agesrequire ray tracing capable (and ideally, performant) graphics hardware these days, and it looks like a trend that's likely to accelerate in years to come.

That's around 28% less memory bandwidth than you'll get from the RTX 5060 Ti with its speedy GDDR7 chips on board, albeit with the same bus size. For the 16 GB cards that's probably going to be just about fine, but it might spell trouble for the 8 GB variant of the RX 9060 XT. The Nvidia GPUs with a paucity of VRAM may have a little more to give than the competing 8 GB AMD chip, but as we've yet to manage to get hold of the lower spec version that's all speculation for now. Mention should also be made of those second generation AI accelerators, which allow the RX 9060 XT to take advantage of the latest, machine learning-enhanced iteration of AMD's upscaling tech, FSR 4. DLSS has long ranged ahead of FSR for sheer image quality thanks to its reliance on local, AI-capable hardware, and the RX 9000-series now has an equivalent of its own. Multi Frame Generation has oft been touted as a reason to pick up an Nvidia card over the competition, but we've found it doesn't scale so well further down the stack due to increased latency. You can artificially boost the frame rate to gain some impressive figures, but the lower-end RTX 50-series cards show the limits of the tech when it comes to real world gaming experience. AMD doesn't yet have an exact MFG equivalent, instead primarily relying on 2x Frame Gen as part of FSR 4—although major AI enhancements are said to be coming to AMD's tech in theRedstone updatelater this year. Regardless, at least when it comes to the bottom end of both company's current lineups, the AI frame rate-enhancing doohickeys look fairly evenly matched on paper. All that being said, comparing AMD's efforts to Nvidia's with a specs sheet showdown doesn't reveal the performance differences between the two, nor what it's like to use one for real world gaming. The architectures are distinctly different, so it's in the benchmarks where we'll find whether the budget AMD card has the potential to give the significantly more expensive RTX 5060 Ti some serious trouble. For now, we've only received a 16 GB sample for review, so I can't tell you how the 8 GB variant performs. I have, however, primarily pitted the XFX card against thePalit RTX 5060 Ti Infinity 3 16 GB, with ourMSI RTX 50608 GB sample thrown in for reference, alongside theRX 7700 XTfrom the previous generation. I've also dropped in the numbers from theXFX Swift Radeon RX 9070 OC, to give you an idea of what $200 extra (technically) gets you in the world of AMD GPUs right now. To war, then.AMD's chief architect of gaming solutions, Frank Azor, has been keen to point out that the \"majority of gamers are still playing at 1080p\", and the RX 9060 XT is aiming for great 1080p and good 1440p performance. And, while the 16 GB variant I have on hand here seems designed to allay concerns of a lack of VRAM, it would be unrealistic to expect smooth 4K frame rates from such a budget offering, and that is certainly reflected in the benchmarks here. At 1080p, however, the little XFX card puts on an impressive turn of speed. A mere two frames difference between the RX 9060 XT and the RTX 5060 Ti in both the Black Myth Wukong and Cyberpunk 2077 average results is pleasing to see, especially when you factor in the price difference between the two, and the proclivity for ray tracing in CDPR's game. In F1 24 the AMD card pulls five frames ahead on average, although the 1% minimum is a full 10 frames behind. Total War: Warhammer 3 delivers the best overall result for the XT when taking into account both the average and minimum frames, which is something of a surprise given it's traditionally a more CPU-focussed benchmark, especially at 1080p. I had a play around outside of the benchmarking tool to see what it was like in actual gameplay, and the little AMD provided a reliably high minimum result when paired with the mightyRyzen 7 9800X3D. ...the budget RX 9060 XT delivers figures that would have been decidedly mid-range for the previous generation Overall, though, the AMD card is slightly behind on average. Claims that the RX 9060 XT is6% faster than the RTX 5060 Tihaven't quite proven out in my particular testing, but it's close enough across most benchmarks to show the performance is very much comparable. 1440p is a similar story: Close, but not quite the full cigar when it comes to beating the RTX 5060 Ti overall. Still, F1 24 seems to be the AMD card's jam, as it once again ranges ahead of the Nvidia GPU by a reasonable margin. And then there's 4K where… yep, you guessed it, the AMD card is ever so slightly behind on average once more. Not that smooth 4K performance was ever on the table for either GPU—but should you be a fan of crunchy gaming, the RTX 5060 Ti delivers slightly more frames. A close run thing, though, no doubt. It's the real world performance chart where the value of the AMD card becomes apparent, though. With upscaling enabled at 1440p (and frame gen, where applicable) the budget RX 9060 XT delivers figures that would have been decidedly mid-range for the previous generation. Take note of the Cyberpunk 2077 result, for example. Six frames ahead of the significantly-more-expensive RTX 5060 Ti is nothing to be sniffed at, and is comparable to the figures I recorded with theRX 7800 XTwhen I played through the game last year with similar settings, minus some of the ray tracing goodies. That particular card is still what I'd consider a great 1440p GPU in 2025, so the fact that the new budget AMD offering can match it is mighty impressive. And as for the ray tracing performance? It's much better than its older, bigger brother. As gen-on-gen comparisons go, that's the sort of major improvement I can get behind. And so, up and down we go. The RX 9060 XT is eight frames slower than the RTX 5060 Ti in Black Myth, a full 20 fps quicker in The Talos Principle 2, and eight frames slower on average in Homeworld 3. Pretty much the definition of trading blows, this particular chart, but still a good result for the AMD card when price is taken into consideration. The real kicker, however, comes when you compare the $349 RX 9060 XT 16 GB to the $299 RTX 5060 8 GB. The AMD tiddler is roughly 14% faster on average at both 1080p and 1440p Native, and a whopping 23% faster in the real world upscaling and frame generation benchmarks. I'll admit, that last percentage is significantly skewed by a staggering 190 fps 1440p result for the RX 9060 XT in F1 24 with the upscaling and frame generating goodies turned on. We saw similarly astonishing numbers in that particular game in our testing of the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. Whatever FSR is providing, this particular F1 racing game seems to love it. DRS, perhaps? Anyway, while it might seem unfair to pit the 8 GB RTX 5060 against a $50 more expensive 16 GB competitor (although that VRAM difference is likely to only come into play for 4K gaming, which neither card is particularly good at), it's still pretty impressive what you get in terms of extra performance for the cash. Where the RX 9060 XT truly lags behind, however, is in productivity performance. Not that I think that particularly matters in a budget gaming GPU, but should AI image generation be your thing, you'd be far better off with the Nvidia card. The Blender result is also fairly disappointing, although it's far from the first AMD card we've seen drop significantly behind the competition in this particular benchmark. Rendering games? Great. Rendering for work? You'll be wanting something else. While Nvidia's RTX 50-series GPUs are reliable overclockers, I'll admit to clenching my teeth when I push the AMD card above its usual speeds. With a 3.13 GHz boost clock speed as standard, it doesn't feel like there's a whole lot of headroom to play with—and the card as a whole feels like it's pushed fairly close to its limits straight out of the box. However, I was able to achieve a 300 MHz overclock on both the chip and the memory with little effort using AMD Adrenaline's built-in tuning software, which works fairly well. Going much past this, however, results in some jarring hard locks, particularly when trying to eek a little more speed out of the memory. What's also held me back from pushing the AMD card into the stratosphere is the coil whine. The XFX card runs virtually silently at stock speeds, but boost the frequencies and it gets very chatty, very quickly. Call me a nervous nellie if you must, but when an overclocked component starts squealing under serious duress, I find it difficult to ignore. This is most evident in The Talos Principle 2, where the RX 9060 XT makes its displeasure audibly known at every opportunity when pushed beyond its specs sheet. Still, that could be a PSU-dependent thing, and is more of an observation of this particular setup than an outright critique. My testing shows a decent two to three fps improvement from this relatively mild OC in most of our games, with the odd outlier result. That's enough for me to say that if that slight fps discrepancy between the stock RX 9060 XT and the RTX 5070 Ti really does bug you, a little light overclocking can help to close the gap. However, I would point out that the overclocked Nvidia GPU is capable of going a fair bit further—although your mileage will likely vary from card to card as to what stable clocks and performance you can eventually achieve. Our Dave found that the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT both benefit from a spot of undervolting, but it's no bueno on this particular card. Even the mildest -60 Mv undervolt causes insta-crashes in most tests, even with a 10% tickle of extra wattage to play with. I'm no expert overclocker, but I'd say the RX 9060 XT has had most of the juice tweaked out of it by AMD to begin with. Which makes sense. This card is a little late to the party, and I would wager that's because AMD was keen to see what the RTX 5060 Ti was capable of before it committed to final tuning. It feels like a card that's been gussied up to near its maximum in order to give Nvidia a headache right out of the box, so those looking for an overclocking wonder would be better off elsewhere.

After all, the RX 9070 XT manages to give the RTX 5070 Ti a proper run for its money, and many have been hoping that the RX 9060 XT would do the same for the RTX 5060 Ti, too. And although the AMD card is slightly behind on average in many of our gaming benchmarks compared to the Ti, I still think it achieves its goals—excellent 1080p performance, good 1440p figures, low power draw and cool temperatures, all for a significantly cheaper MSRP than its direct competition. What's absolutely key here is pricing and availability, and that's a hard thing to judge at this point Which brings me back to money once more. What's absolutely key here is pricing and availability, and that's a hard thing to judge at this point. While I want to believe that, as AMD claims, the RX 9060 XT will be widely available for its stated price come launch day, we've all been disappointed before. That being said, a look at ourbest graphics card dealspage reveals multiple 8 GB RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti cards at MSRP or less, and a (relatively) small mark up on the 16 GB Ti variant. The 16 GB RX 9060 XT makes a whole lot of sense if it can maintain its $80 cheaper MSRP than the 16 GB Ti in particular, but should it prove popular (and I'm willing to bet it will) and retailers start to even out the price difference between the two, you're looking at a whole different recommendation. I've been told by an AMD representative that the XFX Swift 16 GB model I've reviewed here has a recommended price of £315 in the UK. That's an encouraging thought, but again, what it ends up listing for on retailer websites remains up for debate at the time of writing. As things stand, though, the AMD card seems destined to become the new budget darling of this generation. As someone who regularly recommends PC builds for this very website, I know how tough it can be to spec out a budget gaming rig in 2025, and how every penny counts when it comes to maximising the bang for your respective buck. And while I wouldn't call the RX 9060 XT an exciting card, what it is is something more tangible. It's a workhorse, a reliable, cheap, chuck-in GPU willing to do some serious work in the graphics mines for much less than its main competition. In short, it'sexactlywhat we've been waiting for at the lower end of the market, and for that, it's deserving of some serious praise. It might not be the quickest card in its segment, but it gets darn close for significantly less. When it comes to the entry-level GPU market, pricing is everything. And while the RX 9060 XT isn't quite capable of outright beating Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti, it often comes within touching distance of it—all for an $80 lower MSRP. That makes it the budget card to beat right now, if you ask me.

    "article_text": "It seems clean build designs are the name of the game in 2025. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. One of my favourite trends in gaming hardware of late is new ways of tucking away all those cables for a sleeker build. Now it looks like Gigabyte's joining the party with its own method for maintaining a minimalist look, as its latest graphics card has a hidden power connector. TheGigabyte Aorus RTX 5090 Stealth Iceis a graphics card with a standard power connector—none of this back-connect motherboard malarkey—but said connector is hidden around the back of the card. The 12V-2x6 connector plugs into the PCB right behind the heat fins, as you can see from a cut-out on the backplate. This would presumably be more cumbersome (if not impossible) if it were using a smattering of standard 8-pin connectors. This graphics card is part of the company'sProject Stealth, which is primarily a back connector project that moves headers/connectors around to the rear of the motherboard just likeMSI's back-connect design. UnlikeAsus's BTF design(the graphics cards for which are nowstarting to become compatible with non-BTF motherboards too), Gigabyte's Stealth motherboards don't deliver GPU power through the motherboard. This new Stealth GPU should therefore make for a good pairing with its Stealth lineup, because in lieu of this it sneaks the power cable towards pass-throughs to keep it hidden. One benefit of this is that it won't require the purchase of an entirely new motherboard to keep those cables hidden. It's a great option for those who are looking to upgrade their GPU but already have a standard motherboard or a back-connect one that doesn't do motherboard GPU power delivery. Gigabyte explains: \"This new graphics card inherits the minimalist philosophy of Project Stealth by adopting a hidden power connector design, allowing seamless cable routing and a cleaner build layout. Tailored for enthusiasts who prioritize aesthetic refinement and efficient assembly, the card offers both cutting-edge performance and a streamlined look that elevates any gaming setup.\" Apart from this stealthy addition, the graphics card design looks similar to the standardGigabyte RTX 5090 Aorus Ice, which is a blocky all-white affair.

    "title": "'Why are they so greedy': Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 players are in disbelief to find bundle ads but Activision claims it's simply a 'UI feature test' that was published 'in error'",
    "article_text": "\"This feature has now been removed from the live game.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Over the weekend aCall of Duty: Black Ops 6player noticed something different about the weapon select menu: for some reason there were bundle ads embedded into it. This feature has since been taken down byActivision, which claims it was just a mistake, but even just a glimpse of these ads was enough to infuriate players. \"Did they seriously add bundle ads to the weapon select menu,\"JustTh4tOneGuy saysin a Reddit post (viaIGN). \"It's bad enough that this game already raised Blackcell's cost and hasn't fixed any bugs at all that actually affect the majority of players. This clearly was the implementation that mattered.\" Other players pointed out that the ads wouldn't even be that bad if they were in a free-to-play game like Warzone, but Black Ops 6 is a premium title which still goes for $40. \"It really feels like one of those free cell phone games from a tiny studio begging you for money at every turn,\" oneplayer says. \"Pathetic for a full-price, standalone game from a huge developer.\" The ads have since been taken down. \"A UI feature test that surfaced select store content in the Loadout menus was published in the Season 04 update in error,\" Activision says in asocial media post. \"This feature has now been removed from the live game.\" While Activision claims that this was just a test that wasn't meant to see the light of day, I'm sure the uproar from fans sped up its removal. Even if this was an honest mistake, the fact that Activision was running a test like this clearly means that ads are a feature that it feels is worth trying out and that it's at least being talked about. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together But this is far from the first time Call of Duty has fallen into a monetisation controversy.

    "title": "This incredible truly wireless desktop PC build even keeps your coffee hot forever",
    "article_text": "Is 3D wireless power the future? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you thought wireless power delivery was handy for charging phones but not terribly practical for much else, prepare to have your mind blown. One of our favourite YouTube channels, DIY Perks, has just dropped anew video showcasing a new fully 3D wireless power delivery technologythat looks, well, revolutionary. Imagine a desktop that can power just about anything wirelessly. There's no need to align anything carefully with a charging pad. You don't even need to be resting on the surface, the power can be transmitted to devices positioned a foot or more above the desk surface. That's exactly what DIY Perk's truly wireless power desk is capable of. The basic principles here are similar to existing wireless charging pads as typically used with smartphones. Those use a coil to generate a magnetic field that flips in polarity thousands of times a second. If you place another coil nearby, an electric current is induced. The problem is that the secondary coil has to be positioned very close and be quite precisely aligned. But this new 3D wireless power system can cover a very large area defined by the perimeter of a single length of wire. The 3D wireless power hardware in the video is provided by Etherdyne Technologies and a full evaluation kit as used by DIY Perks isavailable through their website, though the cost isn't clear. The kit is claimed to be both FCC and CE certified and can deliver up to 100 W of power. The evaluation unit is composed of a control box, power supply, plus the field-generating wire and has been designed to be embedded within a desktop measuring around two feet by four feet. The wire generates a magnetic field in the same way as a charging pad but flips polarity much more rapidly, millions of times per second. The technology also relies on being precisely tuned to resonate at this frequency. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The result is a \"dome\" of 3D wireless power above the desk surface. Exactly how far above the desk the power can be transmitted isn't stated, but going by the DIY Perks video, the power dome extends well over a foot above the desk surface, at minimum. For this demo, DIY Perks built a PC based on asuper-slimFrameworks laptop mainboardinto the underneath of desk surface. Up top, there's everything from a keyboard and mouse, Bluetooth speakers, a microphone and even a monitor, all powered wirelessly. The monitor also runs via a wireless HDMI video interface, enabling a truly wireless solution with a totally cable-free screen that can be slid around the surface. DIY Perks' final flourish is a wirelessly heated coffee mug that keeps fluids at a constant 70 degrees C. Nice. At this point you may be wondering why you haven't heard of all this before and what the catch must be. Well, the first downside is power efficiency. DIY Perks doesn't go into great detail on this subject, but points out that the system isn't 100% efficient and consumes 10 W at idle. Our understanding is that overall efficiency is probably in the 70 to 80% region at best. Then again, if you're powering it all with renewables like solar, some losses arguably aren't the end of the world. Overall power delivery is another obvious limitation. That 100 W figure, we believe, is a total for all devices being powered. For sure, the largest power receiver coil in the kit delivers just 7 W. For a desktop solution like this, the main power draw is the PC itself which can run on wired power. DIY Perks says it has used a pair of receivers, so presumably that's two times 7 W. For sure, it's not a large display and probably isn't very bright. A typical PC monitor probably isn't compatible with the evaluation kit as currently specced—and you can forget about a power-hungryOLED panel. But then this is early days for 3D wireless power and more, well, powerful solutions may be possible. As for other concerns around safety, interference with other devices, health implications and so on, well, that's outside our expertise. But as a tech demo this is all very impressive. Heck, just having what you might call a perpetual wireless keyboard and mouse would be nice, let alone a truly wireless monitor and a cup of coffee that never, ever gets cold.

The first relic grants a character skill cooldown reduction +2, with follow-up attacks possible when using a character skill (a greatsword passive). The second relic fills Wylder's art gauge when an ability is activated, and grants a further skill cooldown reduction +2, while the final relic gives Wylder one additional character skill use and, you guessed it, another character skill cooldown reduction +2. That's a lot of grappling hooks. \"I can use my skill every four seconds, and thanks to the +1 character skill it can stack up even easier,\"OFurthestBenO adds. \"It truly feels like I never run out of skill usage.\" Wylder's grappling hook is one of the more useful character skills, granting him both mobility and a way to get close and far away from enemies at a moment's notice, while also dealing a good chunk of damage. This is most useful for taking on bosses, especially when fightingall of Nightreigns' Nightlords,all of which can scamper around their massive arena way too quickly.

Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Then I have the Grand Burning Scene, which can damage boost my summons and allies when ulting, as well as having the Polished Tranquil Scene which grants ultimate art gauge +2 to turn my ultimate into a team rez/damage boost skill. Finally, this last relic also gives me max FP when the Sorcerer's Rise mechanism is released, meaning I can use my Finger Seal to heal myself even more. It's not New York's iconic webhead, but it gets the job done. Sadly there's no way to control what kind of relics you get after an expedition, they're random. It's because of this that I didn't start getting relics that suited my chosen Nightfarer until recently, but sometimes you just have to make do with what you have. And while Wylder might be called the 'vanilla' choice forElden Ring Nightreign, this build just looks too good to pass up.

    "article_text": "Hey, at least that's fewer folks on Windows 10. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's that time again where we look to Steam's monthly survey and all feel slightly better about our own rigs. Just for starters, I may not be able to afford the latest Nvidia card, but I can still feel a wee bit smug that neither you nor I fall into the 37% of Steam users still rocking Windows 10, right? …Right? Operating systems that are about to becomean unsupported vintageaside, the real story from theMay edition of Steam's hardware and software surveyis that there's been a slight uptick in folks moving to Linux—by about 0.42%. Okay, so it's hardly like there's been a massive exodus from Windows as theend of 10approaches, but the fact that 2.69% of Steam users are running a Linux OS is worth drilling down into. For one thing,SteamOSitself is Linux-based. For another, SteamOS is gradually rolling out compatibility for handhelds beyond theSteam Deck, such as theLenovo Go S and other AMD devices, potentially explaining some of this increase. Steam has even addeda compatibility rating for third-party devicesto its store pages, at least suggesting a long-term commitment to bringing SteamOS to a wide selection of devices. On the hardware team, our Jacob recently gotSteamOS running on his Legion Go Sand hasn't looked back. However, as he notes in his feature, we've enjoyed less success getting SteamOS to run on other devices with similar internals, like theFramework 13 Strix Point laptop. While stilldoable, it hasn't been all that functional in Dave's recent experience. Dave has, however, managed to get a SteamOS laptop up and running using the Framework's older 7840U mainboard. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Though 2.69% is a bit of a high as far as OS share goes, I'm not going to pretend this is Linux's tipping point. Besides the fact that Windows still enjoys a whopping 95.45% total share of the OS pie in Steam's May survey, Valve's ultimate ambitions for SteamOSaren't really about replacing Windows. Still, if you've got a third-party handheld gaming PC, you can try your own hand at installing SteamOS usingSteam's own handy guide. Alternatively, you could attempt toinstall Windows on your Steam Deck, thoughour Dave would likely judge youfor it. It's worth noting that the Steam survey is a little, let's just say, all over the place. It's a good tool for a general idea of trends, but view the results with a pinch of salt. For example, I doubt there's been a sudden wave of new, dual-core CPUs coming online in the past month, but lo and behold, Steam registers a 0.12% uptick. Linux usage around the 2% mark does at least appear to be a fairly reliable stat month-to-month: Linux usage was at 2.27% in April, slightly down on the 2.33% noted in March, but broadly above the 1.55% of users registered in February.

    "article_text": "I dunno if \"confidence\" is the word I'd use to describe how I feel. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Elden Ring Nightreignis a hard game—no, not just hard, sometimes downright unfair. It's in a way that's incredibly charming, mind, but as our ownTed Litchfield wrote last week, it's \"player hostile\" or, in other words, occasionally \"such bullshit\". I had my own taste of this recently as, while playing with a couple of other PCG folks, we got a boss down to around 2% HP, decided to try and finish it off, and got insta-gibbed by a muddily-telegraphed AoE.Nightreign'd. However, combat director Junya Ishizaki wants you to believe in yourself, especially in the face of a capricious game that mostly hates and wants to murder you. That's per aninterview with CNET, wherein Ishizaki says: \"I can hopefully give you reassurance to know that I have beaten all of the game's bosses. I've seen everything it has to offer, both in multiplayer and as a solo player. So I want you and players to know that this is very possible, and I want you to have the confidence to give it a try yourself.\" Phew, alright. Well, you'd hope that the combat director of Nightreign is good at the combat, given he's directing it and all. Even thoughsolo is a momentous challenge, it tracks he'd be able to pull off some lone ranger runs. At the very least, he's making use of the game'srelicsystems to do so, right? \"Yes. And without relics.\" Aw, man. Bless Ishizaki—he's trying to be motivational here—but I've never heard a more polite, perspective-shifting clarion call to git gud since Bandai Namco tweeted out\"this is a suggestion to level up your Scadutree Blessing\"in the early days ofElden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. It's certainly possible if you're absolutely cracked at soulslikes, mind. It's not exactly sans-relics, but someone's already beaten the game solowithout levelling up once—and every single time I've thought aFromSoftwaregame was a bit spicy, some kung-fu master's rocked up to Twitch armed with only a controller and a level of patience and focus forged in the mountains of some far-flung monastery and done ano-hit runbefore I can blink. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Mark my words, Ishizaki won't be the first person to depress you with his accomplishments. Here's my prediction: Not only is Ishizaki right, we're about two months maximum from someone doing a full Nightreign solo level one run, blindfolded, armed with only adance padand a saxophone, no-hit, while underwater with their hands tied.

    "title": "TSMC boss claims the chipmaker doesn't need to pick winners to work with, just wait patiently 'because they will all come to us in the end'",
    "article_text": "If you build it, they will come. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Yesterday, TSMC held a shareholder meeting, and in an interview following this the company showed every sign of confidence in its future, regardless of the ebbing and flowing of different AI companies that are some of its biggest customers. The world's biggest semiconductor company even went as far as to say about AI companies: \"We don't need to judge who will win, because they will all come to us in the end.\" That eerily ominous machine translated quote, brought to you byTaiwan Economic Daily(viaWccftech), comes from Wei Zhejia (C. C. Wei), CEO and chairman of TSMC. It comes off the back of of Wei pointing out that both GPUs and ASICs are made at TSMC, implying that whatever kind of AI data centre compute you need, TSMC has you covered. And it's true, TSMC does produce most of the compute for AI data centres, with Nvidia's various Hopper andBlackwellchips being the most obvious ones and the ones that AI companies seem to be lining up for. Yesterday we covered howTSMC said at this TSMC shareholder meetingthat \"AI demand has always been very strong and it's consistently outpacing supply\" despite US tariffs. The company did say that tariffs have an impact, though. With a new$100 billion planned investment in the USand an Arizona fab capacity that's already apparentlysold out through 2027, it doesn't look like TSMC has much to worry about on the international trade war front, either. I suppose that with production based both in Taiwan and in the US, it's not too ridiculous to assume that \"they will all come to us in the end.\" Wei reportedly admits that the company did face overcapacity in the recent past, but \"this time we are more careful and thorough than before.\" This seems to be in part because TSMC is getting forecasts and info from chip-scale packaging manufacturers (CSPs) as \"they are also worried that we are not prepared enough.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It must be difficult to predict demand in such a new and booming market as AI, but if any company can be sure to do well—other than Nvidia, of course—it does seem to be TSMC. Let's just hope we see some of that sweet chip revenue trickle down into the laps of we humble gamers in the form of some derivative gaming chips and GPUs.

    "title": "The UK House of Lords denies the government's AI bill for 'state sanctioned theft' of copyrighted data for the fourth time",
    "article_text": "The UK and US governments seem aligned on letting AI do whatever it wants. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AI doesn't care about copyright. It can't, obviously, because it's AI, and not a human being with thoughts and feelings. But it particularly doesn't care about copyright, partly because the US and UK governments are both pushing to let AI companies scrape data for use in generated text and imagery without a care thrown to the digital wind. The House of Lords has just denied the UK government's fourth attempt to pass a bill to let it scrape whatever data it likes, and the counter to that is merely a push for transparency over which data is scraped. The point of this counter from the House of Lords is to allow copyright holders the means to license or protect their information from what effectively amounts to stealing. Those invested in the growth of AI are, predictably, not a fan of paying artists for their work. Sir Nick Clegg, the former president of global affairs at Meta, and previous deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom, said the House of Lords' wish would \"Kill the AI industry in this country\", according to theBBC. The Data (Use and Access) Bill, as suggested by the UK government, argues that AI developers should have access to all the content they like without any consideration towards those who create the data, unless those creators specifically opt out of data collection. Baroness Beeban Kidron, a member of the House of Lords, has argued that the \"state sanctioned theft\" of data would be \"throwing UK designers, artists, authors, musicians, media and nascent AI companies under the bus\". The most recentamendment to the AI billargues, \"The regulations must require specified business data to be published by the trader or the data holder so as to provide copyright owners with information regarding the text and data used in the pre-training, training, fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation in the AI model, or any other data input to the AI model.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. According to the BBC, the standstill between the House of Lords and the British government is \"uncharted territory\" with neither budging on their stance on AI and the arts. Personally, I find the push for AI companies to scrape data unless specifically told otherwise rather telling. Many artists will not be aware of their rights around AI and will not opt out purely because they haven't been adequately informed. Artists being asked to opt in feels more equitable, but from my conversation with artists, I have a feeling very few would choose to do so. The British government is likely looking to get as much as data as possible to these AI companies, artists be damned. Similarly, it has been suggested many times that untraining data from AI models is impossible, which means that once the data is scraped, there's no going back anyways. The change for better transparency won through a vote of 242 to 116. The bill has now been pushed back to the House of Commons, where it could be further discussed this week. This means a fifth push for the bill is likely on the cards. The argument used by the UK government is similar to that recently used by OpenAI, the owner of ChatGPT. In March,OpenAI appealed to the US government, stating that if it doesn't let OpenAI scrap copyrighted content, America would lose to China. What is artificial general intelligence?:We dive into the lingo of AI and what the terms actually mean. Just months before that,OpenAI complainedthat DeepSeek, a Chinese AI model, stole data from it, which was data OpenAI scraped from others in the first place. Recently, President Donald Trump introduced the One Big Beautiful Bill act (or OBBB), which attempts to mandate that states could not regulate AI for a decade, among other things, like increased tax cuts and further support for Border Patrol and ICE. The AI section of this bill has seencriticism from even large Trump supporters, like Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, for how wide-reaching it is.

It was not until 2019, after just finishing a degree in law and media, that they decided to throw out the last few years of education, build their PC, and start writing about gaming instead.

    "title": "Remedy announces very friendly minimum specs for its co-op Control spinoff, FBC: Firebreak. You only need a GTX 1070 for 1080 60 fps play",
    "article_text": "The hardware you need to not set your PC on fire. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've been hanging out for Remedy's next game after falling head over heels in love with the developer's last big hit, Control. So whenFBC: Firebreak was announcedby the brand last year, I was delighted to see the team is bringing acooperative shooter into this twisted world. Control resonated with me so intensely that it's in my top ten games of all time. This is in no small part thanks to how deeply weird the game can be, and FBC: Firebreak is looking to ramp this right up for some silly fire-zombie shenanigans. With any new game release, there's always the question of hardware. And given how much of a ray tracing demon Control was for its time, I was a little worried about how demanding FBC might end up. There's not much reason to get excited for a game that my machine can't even run. Well, thankfully, Remedy recently announced the required specs over onBlueSky, and this is looking like a game that will still run, even on a fairly dated rig. So not only is FBC: Firebreak lookingto respect my time, it might respect my wallet as well. To run at 1080p 60 with quality upscaling, you only need a Nvidia GTX 1070, or an AMD RX 5600 XT. This needs to be paired with at least an Intel i5-700k or anAMD Ryzen5 1600X, as well as 16GB of RAM. You'll also need 30 GB of SSD storage to store and run the game from. Really, that's some super minimal stuff. While it'll only run the game on low settings, I'm impressed it would do it at all, so props to Remedy for giving some of us still rocking the older hardware a chance. Naturally, the recommended specs are a fair bit more demanding than the minimum. These will let you run the game on medium settings at 1440p 60 FPS with quality-based upscaling. For this, you'll be needing a much more recent GPU, with at least an Nvidia RTX 3060 or an AMD RX 6600 XT, giving you at least an extra 2 VRAM over those minimum specs. It's recommended to pair these with at least an Intel i5-8500 or AMD's Ryzen 5 2600 CPU and still have at least 16 GB of RAM. To step that upscaling up to 4k performance levels, Remedy recommends upgrading that GPU. AnRTX 3070orRX 6800 XTcan level this gaming experience up to High presets. If nothing else, this tier demonstrates just how far a GPU upgrade can really go to helping you enjoythis game built for chaotic joy. If you want the high-definition Ray Tracing experience of your lives, then Remedy's High Ray Tracing tier is probably what you're after. These settings deliver a 4k 60 FPS experience with performance upscaling like before, as well as High ray tracing enabled. Hold your breath, mind, as Remedy recommends you're packing anRTX 4080orRX 9070 XTbefore attempting these settings. Your CPU also needs an upgrade, with ani7-8700kor5 3600specified. The good news is that your 16 GB of RAM should still be enough, so you can save some cash there at least. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And look, I'm not going to lie. Control looks amazing on rigs that can do it justice, and I'm betting FBC: Firebreak will too. All those fire infected hiss-like creatures will no doubt look incredible reflecting off the shiny walls of the oldest house offices, but they don't have to. I'm excited to be able to play this game with more friends than I initially expected, even if theirweird pink blobs of goodon't look as good as mine. Best CPU for gaming: Top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game first.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It’s been a long road to the Switch 2 launch day – that's tomorrow, June 5 – and the console hasn’t been without its leaks or controversies. From retailers canceling pre-orders to price increases for games and accessories, there’s no shortage of Switch 2 news that’s left a sour taste. On the flipside, there is plenty to be excited about withNintendo Switch 2.MarioKart Worldis arriving on launch day, third-party support appears to be a major step-up, new features like GameChat could vastly improve the online play experience, and updates to some existingNintendo Switch 2 gameswill make them look and run better than ever. Like a kid on Christmas Eve, this final day before the Nintendo Switch 2 launch may feel as long as the time between now and its official announcement way back in January. But that’s why we’re here. At TechRadar Gaming, we’ve been covering huge console and game launches for years - everything from reviews of Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox systems to key live events like Nintendo Direct and Summer Game Fest presentations. On that note, we’re confident we’ll be able to provide an interesting and informative live run-up to the Switch 2’s launch. Furthermore, we'll also be keeping an eye on launch day stock to help you secure a console if you haven't managed to pre-order one. Be sure to follow ourNintendo Switch 2 launch day stock hubfor up-to-date information on that front. We’ll also be keeping things running on launch day and beyond with our first impressions on the console, its games, accessories, and features. But for now, our early impressions as they happen will hopefully help to inform your own opinions on the console if you’ve held off from purchasing - or to simply give you something fun and informative to read while you wait for your unit to be delivered. Before we dive into the live coverage proper, here's a quick glance at all the Nintendo Switch 2 launch games you can expect to purchase and play on June 5. In addition to the above, a number of existing Switch titles will be receiving Nintendo Switch 2 Edition versions on launch day. These are paid upgrades that either add significant content to the base game or otherwise improve its performance up to4K60fps, or 1080p 120fps with enhanced image quality. Finally, a dozen Nintendo Switch games are set to receive free updates on June 5. These are set to provide upgrades to resolution, frame rates, and image quality, or otherwise provide enhanced features like GameChat andHDRsupport. They are as follows: As someone who's covered gaming hardware and software for almost five years, and an avid Nintendo gamer from an early age, I'm primed to provide you with informed Nintendo Switch 2 live coverage across launch day and beyond. At TechRadar Gaming, I've regularly written reviews, features and news about Nintendo products and events like Nintendo Direct. That means you can expect information and hands-on Switch 2 opinions from a place of passion and experience. There's now only 30 minutes to go! We're getting close to the midnight hour – well, about two hours out – and that means the Switch 2 launch is nearly here in the United States. However, countries around the world are already celebrating the launch of the console. Now, if you're keen to potentially score one on launch day, you can check outour live blog covering all things availability for the console itself, games, and accessories here. My colleagues in the UK – where it is already Switch 2 launch day – will pick this back up in just a few hours. But until then, I'll leave you with some videos of folks celebrating the launch and even picking up consoles. Game Stop has been along for the Nintendo Switch 2 journey since the console was first announced, and now at least one store in NYC is getting ready. In a short timelapse shared on GameStop's X (formerly Twitter) account, we see a store being decked out withMario Kart World-themed wallpaper – presumably representing the sponsors of the race – and colored tiles covering lights to create a party atmosphere. Lap one starts at midnight. pic.twitter.com/EPSOc02st9June 4, 2025 Lance also took the time to go inside, and while there are cases ready to showcase and display the Nintendo Switch 2 and its various accessories like the Switch 2 Camera, they're all still empty. That should all change, though, when the clock strikes midnight and it officially becomes June 5, 2025 – the launch day of the Nintendo Switch 2. It's safe to say we're not the only ones excited for the Nintendo Switch 2! TechRadar's Editor At Large, Lance Ulanoff, visited the NYC Nintendo Store to check out the space ahead of the console's launch in a few hours. While the Switch 2 consoles themselves are hidden, there are plenty of folks lined up waiting to play some of the most anticipated titles, includingMario Kart World. Folks are playing on custom red stands with Nintendo Switch 2 branding and a TV, as well as what appears to be a Switch 2 Pro Controller. Lance estimates there are over 100 people at the NYC store for the festivities, and the setup to play titles is out in the plaza. And maybe best of all, you can meet Princess Peach and Yoshi. While the Nintendo Switch 2 does have backwards compatibility for some Nintendo Switch games, the team at Game Informer has tested what happens if you put a Switch 2 game cartridge into the original console. The results aren't super surprising, but it's good to know nonetheless. Here's what happens when you try to put a Nintendo Switch 2 game cartridge into a Switch 1 console.Spoiler alert: the results are underwhelming. pic.twitter.com/w07CszHSz7June 4, 2025 If you're curious about what the day-one update entails and brings to the Nintendo Switch 2, we have good news. Courtesy of Nintendo's Australia website, we have the release notes for the update, titled \"20.1.1.\" It looks to be a substantial update as it adds a long list of features, including GameChat, GameShare, system transfer capabilities, and support for Nintendo Switch Online, among many others. Nintendo also notes that you'll be prompted to install the 20.1.1. Update as soon as you power on your Switch 2. You can see therelease notes here. Hello there from NYC as TechRadar continues our road to Switch 2 launch day coverage. We're nearly there, and according to some social media posts, it seems that some pre-orders are starting to move – always a good sign. I wasn't able to secure a preorder in advance, but I'm keeping an eye out and crossing my fingers for ample launch-day availability. However, I'm not expecting a ton on the latter. Coming from a Switch OLED myself, I'm curious to see how the difference in displays will make a difference, especially alongside the other upgrades that come with the Switch 2 itself. That's tools down for me today, but our launch day build-up coverage isn't going anywhere. I'll now hand you over to Jacob on our US team, who's looking forward to Switch 2 launch day as much as I am. I'll be back tomorrow for even more launch day coverage, and I'll (hopefully) have my own Switch 2 unit by then as well! It's fair to sayNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tourhasn't had, well, the bestwelcometo the general Nintendo fan base. It was announced at the initial Nintendo Switch 2 Direct and certainly looked interesting, filled with minigames and technical tidbits about the system itself. However, when it was revealed to not be included with the Switch 2 console - instead costing $9.99 / £7.99 - fans weren't exactly happy. While it's not the priciest point of entry, it certainly would've sat better as a freebie in the same vein asWii Sports. I'm remaining cautiously optimistic for this bite-sized experience, though, especially as someone who covers gaming hardware for a living. Mainly because I'm wondering ifNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tourwill reveal anything about the system - be that quality-of-life features or nifty secret settings - that we don't already know. Naturally, you can also expect aNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tourreview from the TechRadar Gaming team in the near future, so be sure to keep an eye out for that as we'll judge whether it's worth your time or not. While there's plenty to dive into on launch day, Nintendo still has plenty of first and third-party titles scheduled to launch on Switch 2 throughout the rest of the year. And that's before we've had any more Nintendo Direct presentations outside of the one that happened on April 2. Here's a quick rundown of the games you should be keeping your eye on this year. Sure, it may seem obvious to those of us who like to keep our new consoles in tip top condition, but the Nintendo Switch 2’s safety manual is adamant that you leave the handheld screen’s protective film layer firmly stuck to the display. “The screen is covered with a film layer designed to prevent fragments scattering in the event of damage. Do not peel it off,” the safety manual reads. Now, it isn’t a traditional screen protector (those can be bought separately). Rather, it’s to make sure any unpredictable bits of wear and tear - such as rogue debris or pet scratches - don’t damage the screen directly. I wish I knew! Truthfully, we’re as much in the dark as you are on the eventual release ofHollow Knight: Silksong.Though in case you’ve forgotten, there was a bit of aSilksongjumpscare at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct presentation, where the game appeared for all of five seconds, with a vague ‘2025’ release date attached. So what’s my best guess? Well, given it’s Summer Game Fest week, with the gaming event as well as PlayStation and Xbox hosting their own showcases, there is once again a chance that aSilksongtrailer sheds more light on the hotly anticipated upcoming title. I won’t hold my breath of course, but is there a better time all year than now? Probably not. I still have to wait a day for my own, of course, but a Nintendo Switch 2 unit as well as several Switch 2 accessories have just landed over at TechRadar Gaming HQ! We'll be thoroughly testing and reviewing the console and accessories including the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, Switch 2 Camera, microSD Express cards, plenty of Switch 2 games and more throughout this month and beyond. So be sure to stay tuned! We all had a good chuckle about theNintendo Today appwhen it was revealed at the last Nintendo Direct presentation. But it turns out to have been a pretty valuable resource when it comes to Switch 2 news, as well as catching glimpses of upcoming releases that may not get posted to Nintendo’s official social channels. The Nintendo Today app has already given us sneak peeks atMario Kart World, Metroid Prime 4: Beyondand plenty of other upcomingNintendo Switch 2 games. We’ve also seen further looks at systems like GameShare and GameChat. It’s a great way to tide you over a little until tomorrow’s big launch day, so be sure to check it out! You can download the app for free for iOS and Android devices. Simply plug in your Nintendo account details once the app is downloaded and you’re good to go. How does backwards compatibility work on Nintendo Switch 2? It’s actually really quite simple, especially as the vast majority of original Nintendo Switch cartridges (and digital downloads) are immediately compatible with Nintendo Switch 2. That said, there may be some caveats here or there. Nintendo has published aSwitch 2 game compatibility guideon its website. The breakdown shows that over 100 titles are expected to have “start up issues” on Switch 2, but in most cases, fixes are being applied for on or around the launch window. Lastly, there is just one game that Nintendo states outright won’t work on Switch 2, and that’sNintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit.That’s owing to the fact that the game requires a very distinct peripheral in order to play, which seemingly isn’t compatible with the new console. The weekend really can’t come soon enough, as I’m planning to really get stuck in withMario Kart Worldwith a few friends. And while I’m very excited about the kart racer (and had glowing impressions of it during myMario Kart Worldhands-on preview session), there is one game that I simply cannot wait to get my hands on. That would beMetroid Prime 4: Beyond,which will be getting a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition capable of running at 4K 60fps, or 1080p up to 120fps. I’ve been a hugeMetroidfan for most of my life, and I consider thePrimeseries, especially, to be among my all-time favorite games. Prime 4will be the first new entry in the subseries in well over a decade, the last one being the rather underwhelmingMetroid Prime Federation Forcefor Nintendo 3DS. This latest game will also tie back to the excellent DS titleMetroid Prime Hunters,as one of the antagonists from that game, Sylux, will be a major focus in this Switch 2 release. With Retro Studios back at the helm ofMetroid Prime 4: Beyond,I’m expecting a highly polished game that will hopefully live up to the standards set by the originalPrimetrilogy as well as 2021’s superbMetroid Dread. Our managing editor Rob Dwiar is now live with TechRadar Gaming’s Nintendo Switch 2 launch day stock live hub. Throughout today and the actual launch period itself, Rob (alongside some of our brilliant TechRadar colleagues) will be keeping an eye on stock drops in the US and the UK. If you wanted to secure a Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order, but weren’t able to do so, our stock hub could be the thing you need to help locate launch day stock at your preferred retailer - whether that be online or in-store. So, for expert tips on how to bag yourself a Nintendo Switch 2 on or around launch day, be sure to pay Rob a visit! Rob's been covering console launch events for years, so I'm confident in his ability to point you in the right direction here. Hello Games founder Sean Murray has just announced thatNo Man’s Skyis coming to Nintendo Switch 2. This will be a free update for those who already own the game on Nintendo Switch. Announcing NMS Switch 2 Edition! 😍🧑‍🤝‍🧑Multiplayer🤯4K Texture Support🎥Improved Framerate🎯Crisp UI👆Touch Controls📺TV Mode Resolution🤌Handheld Resolution 💎Increased Geometry🙌Gyro Support🏎️DLSS + DRS🏘️Settlements🎁Cross Save🎮Cross Play🥓Beacon UpdateFree👌 pic.twitter.com/ee3ZSObJv4June 4, 2025 The Nintendo Switch 2 version ofNo Man’s Skywill boast improved framerates, support for 4K textures, touch controls and gyro support, as well as the myriad changes and updates that have come to the game over the past decade. Oh, and this version will also support Nvidia DLSS for smoother performance. The update is coming on Switch 2 launch day, and will also have the game’s latest major update; Beacon. This is just a friendly reminder that if you’re a fan of Nintendo’s anti-gravity racing series, you may also want to check outFast Fusionwhich arrives on launch day. The game costs an impressively low $14.99 / £13.49, and could absolutely be one to check out if you’re not opting for a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to playF-Zero GX. Only two days to go until Fast Fusion will launch on Nintendo Switch 2!#FastFusion #NintendoSwitch2 pic.twitter.com/yixUS00usFJune 3, 2025 Fast Fusionis being developed by Shin’en Multimedia. This impressive team has developed incredible titles likeFast RMXandThe Touryst,so I’m always excited to see it bring a new game out - especially at the launch of one of the most anticipated consoles in recent years. It seems like even more Nintendo Switch games are getting Switch 2 compatibility patches. In addition toXenoblade Chronicles 3,it looks likeKirby Star AlliesandKirby’s Dream Buffetare also getting Switch 2 updates. BRO BRO BRO BRO BROKIRBY STAR ALLIES AND DREAM BUFFET ARE GETTING SWITCH 2 UPDATES????? pic.twitter.com/Egea9jXEryJune 4, 2025 Like withXenoblade,these updates simply say that “several adjustments have been made to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2.” Again, that could mean anything, like simply minimizing compatibility issues. Still, the more performance upgrades we get for original Switch games, the better. Nintendo certainly kept quiet about this one, but it appears that beloved RPGXenoblade Chronicles 3has received an update prior to Switch 2 launch day. Users on X / Twitter have spotted some patch notes for the game. APPARENTLY XENOBLADE CHRONICLES 3 GOT A NINTENDO SWITCH 2 UPDATE????They didn't make a big deal about it and the patch notes are kinda vague so I'm skeptical tbhIdk if they just made it more stable or if they actually did big changes like making it 60 fps lol. Guess we'll see pic.twitter.com/mGw5j9EZ7jJune 4, 2025 In fairness, the patch notes aren’t substantial, simply saying that “several adjustments have been made to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2.” Now, to temper expectations, there’s every chance this is just a very simple patch to stop the game from crashing or registering visual oddities on Switch 2. But if this game does get the 4K 60fps treatment similar toPokémon Scarlet & Violet,then I’ll certainly be planning a replay of this incredible game. Now if we could also get an update patch forXenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition,I’ll be one very happy gamer. As a lover of thebest fighting games, I’m really excited to check outStreet Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Editionon Switch 2 launch day. This version of the game includes all DLC characters from Season 1 (Rashid, AKI, Ed, and Akuma) and Season 2 (M. Bison, Terry Bogard, Mai Shiranui, and Elena), as well as all DLC stages. I got to check out the game at my Nintendo Switch 2 hands-on preview session a couple of months ago, and it plays fantastically on the console with a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. I did note image quality was a touch fuzzier than on other systems, but performance wise, the game doesn’t miss a beat. At least outside of the demanding World Tour mode, which I haven’t been able to see on Switch 2 yet. While I’m sure most of you will be diving intoMario Kart Worldor a hotly anticipated third-party release likeStreet Fighter 6orCyberpunk 2077on day one, it’s worth noting thatNintendo Switch Online’s GameCube classicslibrary will also be available from launch day. Three games will be playable off the bat:The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,fighting game royaltySoul Calibur 2,and the legendary anti-gravity racerF-Zero GX.You’ll need a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription in order to enjoy these titles. I’ve also pre-ordered the Switch Online exclusive wireless GameCube controller from Nintendo’s website, because what better way is there to experience these games than with the iconic purple gamepad? It’s available for pre-order now at Nintendo’s store for $64.99 / £58.99. Admittedly, that is fairly steep given Nintendo has confirmed that while it will work with standard Switch 2 games,there may be compatibility issuesso certainly consider that before you make a purchase. One game I’m really excited to check out on day one isPokémon Scarlet & Violet, which will be receiving a free performance update on Switch 2 launch day. A brief snippet of gameplay was revealed via the Nintendo Today mobile app a couple of days ago, but it seems like more has been fixed than just the improved resolution and framerates. Serebii’s Joe Merrickpoints out on X / Twitterthat animations for background objects appear to have been improved. Case in point, the infamous Artazon Windmill, which now animates smoothly in the distance. If there’s one thing I remember not so fondly about these games, it’s the incredibly choppy animations of objects and characters even close to the player. Hopefully, then, these have been smoothed out with this Nintendo Switch 2 update. Thrilled to show that in Pokémon Scarlet & Violet on the Nintendo Switch 2, the Artazon Windmill has been fixed. This animation fix applies to all distant models that we have seen through the gameSee more on the Serebii preview! pic.twitter.com/w9DW7t1YLyJune 4, 2025 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is the subject of Nintendo’s latest Creator’s Voice video. The tech company developed the original Switch’s custom Tegra X1 system-on-a-chip, and it also created the Switch 2’s custom processor, too. In the video, Huang claims that the Nintendo Switch 2 has the “most advanced graphics ever in a mobile device.” And that could well be true; the Switch 2 handheld supports 1080p resolution at framerates up to 120fps. The device also has support for HDR for brighter, more accurate colors. Good morning, US friends, and good afternoon to those of you in the UK! TheNintendo Switch 2launch is almost upon us, happening tomorrow, June 5. It’s felt like a pretty long wait from its official announcement at the start of the year, but given how fast the year’s gone by, also not too much! If you’ve managed to secure aNintendo Switch 2 pre-order, you’ll probably be receiving a tracking email from your retailer of choice soon, if you haven’t already. So to start things off, a friendly reminder to keep an eye on your email inbox! I’ll be receiving my pre-ordered Switch 2 console tomorrow, and I’m excited to get stuck in withMario Kart World,and experiencingBreath of the WildandTears of the Kingdomat what I hope is a buttery smooth 4K 60fps. Starting with this live blog, there’s going to be plenty of Nintendo Switch 2 coverage in the coming weeks at TechRadar Gaming.

    "title": "One of world's largest oil companies just launched a unique cooling fluid for data centers and AI chips",
    "article_text": "Direct-to-chip cooling promises improved PUE and longer fluid life When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Direct liquid cooling is gaining traction in data centers as traditional air-based systems struggle to manage the demands of modern computing. Shell, one of the world’s largest oil and gas companies, has launched a new direct liquid cooling fluid aimed at meeting the thermal demands of AI and high-performance computing. Shell DLC Fluid S3 is a propylene glycol-based solution designed to cool high-density server hardware by directly targeting heat-generating components such as CPUs and GPUs. It meets the latest Open Compute Project PG25 standards, making it compatible with a broad range of server architectures. Data centers currently account for an estimated 2–3% of global power consumption, but Shell claims its new fluid can improve Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) by up to 27% compared to air cooling, potentially reducing the need for energy-intensive air conditioning. The company also highlights the fluid’s extended service life, corrosion protection across a variety of metals, and fluorescent dye for easier leak detection. “With Shell DLC Fluid S3, Shell now offers both direct-to-chip and full immersion cooling solutions, and we’re not just keeping data centers cool in the age of AI - we’re powering the future of digital infrastructure,” said Aysun Akik, VP New Business Development and Global Key Accounts, Shell Lubricants. “Our growing range of advanced liquid cooling solutions is designed to meet the diverse needs of modern data centers both today, and tomorrow - and are backed by the strength of Shell’s global footprint, supply chain and five technology development hubs around the globe.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!

    "title": "The Nintendo Switch 2 launch mania makes me miss the early iPhone launch days",
    "article_text": "The purity of a new product launch When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheNintendo Switch 2launch is upon us, full of sound and fury, signifying the clickity-clack of a million Joy-Cons, and I'm rather enjoying it. There aren't many tech gadgets that generate this kind of buzz, though I guess Nintendo can be depended on to create it. I still remember the Wii mania, and the original Nintendo Switch was no slouch in the \"must-have department\" either. That may be why, just hours before the official launch, I hustled uptown to the Nintendo Store in Rockefeller Center to take the temperature of the locals. Were they lining up for the Switch 2 even though Nintendo already set up a lottery system that said you could only buy one of the $449 consoles if your name was picked? They were...sort of. At the back of the line were a pair of live-streaming women dressed like characters from SuperMarioBros. They told me they usually streamed themselves playing games. I asked if they and everyone else were lined up for access to the console. The pair, who never paused the stream, laughed and explained that the dozens of gamers standing shoulder-to-shoulder on 48th Street were all in line for a chance to playSuper Mario Kart Worldon Nintendo Switch 2. Under a broad white tent, more than a dozen gamers held controllers with cables that snaked to hidden Switch 2 consoles. The fact that no one could see the new hardware mattered not to the enthusiastic gamers who were all trying to navigate Mario's chaotic world on vibrant 42-inch displays. Next to the tent, Princess Peach and Yoshi stood for photos, and die-hard Mario fans squeezed between them for a hug. In contrast to the boisterous space outside, it was utterly calm inside the Nintendo Store, where a DJ played tunes and a pair of Nintendo Switch 2 display cases sat empty. I assume they were waiting until midnight to slip a pair of consoles inside. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The Nintendo Staff looked pleasant if a little on edge. I think they knew that the tenor might change at midnight, as desperate customers lined up, whether or not they had the special Warp pass. My guess is some will be onlookers, hoping for a glimpse of the first Nintendo Switch 2 owner (maybe they all just want to high-five them). Others might be leftovers from the Mario games, still there, trying to win the race. There was a purity to the whole scene. The excitement didn't feel forced; there were no hype-masters, trying to rile up the crowd in anticipation of the big day. Nintendo may have hiked the price of the more powerful new console by $150 and is charging more for games, but I get the sense consumers don't care. They'll line up for this console and likely sing its praises, regardless of any shortcomings. It reminds me a little bit of the original iPhone days. There was so much excitement, and noAppleemployees there to clap and chant. Steve Jobs didn't even show up at the stores – he didn't have to. The hype was real. While not as intense, this Nintendo Switch 2 moment feels like a launch from another time, and I don't know why, but that makes me happy.

    "title": "PlayStation State of Play June 2025: everything announced from Silent Hill f finally release date to Final Fantasy Tactics remake reveal as it happened",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Not to be outdone by everything else in an already busy week,Sonyannounced a last-minute State of Play presentation that took place on June 4, 2026! Sony promised \"news and updates on must-play games coming to PS5\" and the show certainly delivered with loads of exciting reveals and updates on some of the biggest games coming to PS5. From the reveal ofFinal FantasyTactics: The Ivalice Chronicles, andNioh 3, there are a lot of reasons to be excited as a PlayStation owner. We even had a new hardware reveal in the form of a Sony produced fight stick! If you missed out on the show, you can see all the games announced in the order that they happened below - and our thoughts as each one popped up. The June State of Play started at2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CEST. The State of Play has now concluded, but you can catch a full recording of it below. Here's a list of everything shown at the June 2025 State of Play as it happened. Long-time PlayStation fan and expert, owning every single type of Sony's console since the beginning. Gaming and hardware editor of eight years. Tech journalist with years of experience covering all things PlayStation. Previously worked for the UK's Official PlayStation Magazine in addition to other print and online outlets. Now that everything has cooled down, here's a quick list of everything announced to get you up to speed if you're only just joining in. And that's a wrap on this latest State of Play. What did you think of the show? That's got to be a top tier presentation in my book. 4v4 tag battles have been shown, and they look as chaotic as they sound. It's calledMarvel Toukon Fighting Souls- what a name! It's coming to PS5 and PC in 2026. Another PlayStation Studios announcement! A Marvel collaboration with fighting game giants Arc System Works developing! It looks like an awful lot of fun. Almost likeMarvel vs Capcom -minus the Capcom, of course. That sure is a newGhost of Yoteitrailer, with our protagonist Atsu camping out above a little village. We get a look at her not so cuddly canine companion, plus confirmation of a gameplay deep dive coming in July. Oooh, a PlayStation Studios announcement. 007 First Light, with plenty of spy shenanigans and some Aston Martin driving being shown. That seems about right to me! Time for a trailer for thatJames Bondgame from Io Interactive that we've been hearing so much about lately! New PS Plus Classics Games now! Here is what is being announced: Now ontoFBC: Firebreak, another Game Catalog title coming on June 17. That'sSword of the Sea, so not quite aJourneysequel, but close enough in my books. It will be part of the PS Plus Premium game catalog. A newJourneygame? I'm seeing deserts on screen... Another super colorful game here, with a pirate twist. I'm loving the almost wooden doll-like look of the characters. It's calledSea and Remnants, coming 2026. The Astrobot Limited Edition DualSense is also coming back, with a \"slight twist\" - whatever that means. I guess we'll just have to wait and see. A newAstro Botannouncement now! Five brand new challenge levels are coming to the game, available later this month. There will also be new special bots, such as Atsu fromGhost of Yotei. A new multiplayer game from theRoad 96devs next. It's got a lovely colorful art direction and I'm seeing all kinds of parkour and masked enemies. It's calledTides of Tomorrow, coming out on February 4, 2026. That'sThief VR Legacy of Shadow, coming to PSVR 2. A new game from Vertigo Games, definitely a virtual reality project. I'm getting bigThiefvibes from this one! ANioh 3demo is going to be available today! There goes my sleep schedule, I guess. Confirmed! That'sNioh 3, set to come out some time in early 2026. A new Koei Tecmo game! Some kind ofNiohfollow-up? I'm seeing some massive boss-fights, and lots of soulsike combat. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eaternow, looking absolutely stunning as usual. Lots of boss fights in this little trailer, plus a look at the iconic Snake vs Monkey mode. New hardware reveal - this wasn't something on my bingo card. An official fightstick, made by Sony themselves. How promising! That's calledMortal Kombat Legacy Kollection,coming this year to PS5 and PS4. Now a new game collection from the preservation geniuses over at Digital Eclipse! It looks like it will beMortal Kombatfocussed, and could be an absolute treat forMortal Kombatfans. Carinhas been shown, coming on November 5. This climbing game will have a demo available later today, so keep an eye out for that if you're keen to try it. Ninja Gaiden Rageboundnow, a 2D action game from theBlasphemousdevs.BlasphemousandBlasphemous 2were both superb experiences, so there's plenty of reason to get excited for this. It will be available on July 31, 2025. Everybody's Golfis coming back!Everybody's Golf Hot Shots, coming September 5. If you pre-order, you'll get to play as Pac-Man! A very adorable looking game up next,Hirogami! I really like what I've seen of this one, especially its paper-craft artstyle. Another September release, this time September 3. An indie game here -Baby Steps. This little puzzle game (if you can really call it that) is an open-world experience that challenges you to walk around (trust me, it's harder than it sounds). It lands on September 8. Yep, that'sFinal Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles. It includes both the original game, and a remake version! It will launch on September 30, with pre-orders starting today. A newFinal Fantasyannouncement now. Looks like aFinal Fantasy Tacticsremake! I know some fans will be very, very excited about this. Just revealed October 3, 2025 release date forDigimon Story: Time Stranger. Yep,Digimon Story: Time Stranger. This game has already been announced, but a new trailer is always appreciated. Something Bandai Namco up now. Looks likeDigimonto me. I called it! A newBloodstainedgame calledBloodstained The Scarlet Engagement, coming 2026. This next game looks almost likeCastlevania. Maybe something from theBloodstained: Ritual of the Nightdevs? Let's see... Yep, that'sSilent Hill f. It's out September 25 this year! Amazing. The protagonist is channelling her inner James Sunderland and beating up horrifying enemies with a pipe! That's theSilent HillI know and love. On to the next reveal. I'm pretty confident that this is a newSilent Hill ftrailer. This is one game that I'm personally really looking forward to, especially given the awesome steelbook available with pre-orders here in the UK. Hopefully we get a release date soon! Well this next game looks a bit crazy! I'm seeing plenty of third-person combat, with a mix of futuristic funs and melee attacks. The name?Romeo is a Dead Man, a new game from Grasshopper Manufacture coming in 2026. Yep, that'sPragmata! And a 2026 release window - nice. Oh! This looks an awful likePragmata! Capcom logo on screen confirms it, I think. About time we saw something else about this game! The graphics are very pretty, with some interesting looking combat. On to the next game. Big text on screen, \"what comes after dreaming?\". How intriguing! We have a name!Lumines Arise,coming to PS5 and, surprisingly, PSVR 2 - I guess Sony hasn't given up on VR quite yet... Okay, this looks an awful lot like some kind ofLuminesrevival! I'm always in the mood for a good puzzle game, so sign me up! Our first game! It looks... weird. I'm seeing lots of psychedelic visuals and hearing some super groovy background music. Big PS Vita vibes from this one. The stream is beginning! Hold on to something... The State of Play stream is now live! With a countdown ticking down on screen as we speak. There are just a few minutes to go until it begins proper, so make sure to tune by heading to your platform of choice right now. To make things extra easy, I've also included an embedded version of the stream below - you're welcome! More than 111,000 people have now tuned into the official PlayStation stream, and that number is only increasing by the second! If you need a reminder, it's starting in just ten minutes. Remember that biltong I mentioned earlier? Turns out it was a big mistake. I had a little nibble and now there's some stuck in my teeth. Hopefully I manage to get that out before the stream begins, because it feels pretty grim. Time flies really when you're waiting for a stream about video games to go live! There is now just 15 minutes to go until the State of Play begins, so start getting yourself ready for a non-stop barrage of gaming goodness. Don't think you'll be able to follow the stream live? Don't worry, as I'll be covering everything in text form right here because I'm nice like that*. *It's also my job. State of Play goes live in 30 minutes! https://t.co/fnRmxfaMhHJune 4, 2025 The official PlayStation X / Twitter account has posted to remind everyone that the State of Play presentation is set to begin in 30 minutes (well, now about 25 minutes)! The clock is ticking, gamers. Just thirty minutes to go! With the recent release ofDay's Gone Remastered, not to mention theUntil Dawnremake, the big question on my mind going into the State of Play is which PlayStation game will receive the remake or remaster treatment next. I'm on my hands and knees begging forKnack Remastered, but I don't think it's going to happen. Maybe we'll see some kind ofGod of Warremaster, or maybe even a remaster collection? That would be pretty slick. Although the broadcast hasn't started yet (don't panic!) the State of Play live stream is up on YouTube. It's just in a waiting room stage right now which isn't too exciting, but it does tell us the number of overall active viewers right now. Currently more than 35,000 people are waiting for the stream to begin - and that's just on YouTube. I'm sure that number would be much higher if you tallied up all the other platforms that the State of Play will be airing. There is now just over fifty minutes to go until the State of Play. If you want to watch it live, this is your chance to get some last-minute chores out of the way. I would also recommend getting a snack and a drink so that they are on hand for later. The presentation is only forty minutes long, but you still don't want to risk missing a trailer if you need to stand up and get something from the kitchen. Me? I've got a lovely little bottle of prosecco (please don't tell my boss) and a small packet of biltong ready to go. Yum! OK, I have to go and break for some dinner and to pack for a certain mid-year game festival I'm going to so we'll be putting our live coverage down for a short while. My colleague Dash will be picking this up again in a bit to guide you through the rest of the build-up and the show itself! Surely this is a contender? When it was announced that it was coming to PS5 last month, it came with the information thatSenua's Saga: Hellblade 2would be coming out 'this summer' and we would hear more soon or in the future. Well, a PS5 game-focused State of Play in June seems to fit the bill perfectly for timing, as well as showing off what the sequel will be able to do and look like on PS5 and PS5 Pro. I'm hyped for this one too, as it was one of my top games of last year and I've been itching for a reason to go back and replay it. The game looks and sounds fantastic, is hard-hitting, deeply interesting and impactful, and there's a certain seductiveness to the bleakness of theHellbladeseries that I'm a big fan of. We're now only four hours from the start of tonight's State of Play presentation! What are you hoping for? Any wild expectations or ambitions? I've got one more prediction which feels likely, but then I'll haver to head off for dinner, and we'll pick this back up a bit closer to the start of the show. We know that the PS5 Pro shares some similarities with the PS5 Slim's console covers and they are just as easy to remove - but where the heck are the versions for the premium PlayStation 5? I've been waiting for news on these since launch and today's State of Play seems as good a place as any to reveal them. Plus it'd be a welcome bit of hardware representation among the games. I reckon a really good bet is another look at the upcomingMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eaterremaster of the classic PS2 game,Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. We know this will come out in August, and this is a perfect time to rumble the hype train on for the game and give Naked Snake another few minutes in the sun. And as a PlayStation fan of a...certain age... let's say, this is a game I'm really, really looking forward to coming out and eager to play. The Metal Gear Solid series is synonymous with PlayStation after all, so this is going to be a big one for Sony. You're invited! We're dying for you to join us. pic.twitter.com/lW4hYC6QeoJune 3, 2025 However, something that looks quite likely to appear in the State of Play isFortnite. Posting the above on X / Twitter, the officialFortniteaccount seems to be strongly hinting that the game will have something to do with PlayStation - using the console's famous symbols - and soon, too. Is that a pair of eyes from the Fortnite banana skin/character too....? What could it mean, though? It could simply be a look at the upcoming new season, but could it be something more... Who knows! As much as I want this to be A Thing, I'm not sure seeing more of the next Witcher game from CD Projekt Red is that likely. After all, it was only yesterday that we saw the tech demo at the State of Unreal presentation. It was breath-taking and only bodes well for the game, but i think the safe money is on CDPR keeping more of The Witcher 4 in its pocket for the time being. That being said, stranger things have happened, and I'd love to see more in today's State of Play. I have returned to continue our live build-up and chat in the run-up to tonight's State of Play! I'll continue Dash's trend and look to what I think might come up later today, or what I hope will make an appearance too. And with that, Rob has just let me know that he is out of his meetings and ready to take back over. I'll see you all again later tonight when the show begins! I've heard a lot of rumblings about a potential new trailer forPragmata, that eye-catching Capcom game that showed up in the PS5 reveal event years ago now. Described as an \"all-new action adventure title that depicts a near-future dystopian world on the moon through a deeply profound story and setting,\" the game was set to be a bit of a showcase for the power of modern consoles. That said, we haven't heard anything about the game since its reveal - which is generally not a great sign. Will we see a new trailer tonight? It's possible, and honestly about time we see more. It wouldn't be a State of Play without a barrage of jokey social media posts. Here are some of the most amusing ones that I've spotted on the timeline... The supposed Leaked State Of Play From PlayStation…😑 pic.twitter.com/HaCf6vttXxJune 3, 2025 state of play tomorrow and i'm working 😭😭😭😭 pic.twitter.com/rbZWZSYsiWJune 4, 2025 State of Play a day before the Switch 2 and Deltarune https://t.co/oPpYRDhvL6 pic.twitter.com/0Ep80LpeE3June 3, 2025 A potentialBloodborneremaster, remake, or even just simple PlayStation 5 patch will be high up on the wishlists of many going into this State of Play. How likely do I think an announcement is? Unfortunately not very, as we haven't heard any rumblings or rumors recently to suggest that it's on the way. Still, there's a chance that it's just been successfully kept under wrap. You never know what might be in store... From a newResident Evilgame to moreGrand Theft Auto 6footage, speculation is ramping up as we get nearer to the start time. What do you expect to see tonight? Let us know in a post on X / Twitter tagging us @techradar for a chance to be featured in this coverage! Hello gamers! Dash here, to guide you through the build up to the State of Play show. If you need a quick reminder, the show is set to begin at2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CEST! That means that it's just under seven hours away... No sooner have I started, I actually have to head into some meetings now as I try and do normal day-to-day work around all the excitement of the summer of games kicking off! It's OK, though, as my colleague Dash is stepping in to continue our live coverage in the meantime, and I'll be back before you know it. Right, let's get into the most pertinent details straight away. Today's State of Play will start at2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CEST, and you can watch it on PlayStation'sYouTubeandTwitchchannels. Simple, but it pays to have these ducks in a row ahead of time! Hello and welcome to our live build-up and coverage of today's State of Play presentation! What will we see? Big blockbusters and updates or a focus on smaller games? We're here to guide you through the build-up to Sony getting this summer's presentation off to a flyer, and will be adding some good ol' chat, the latest news, and predictions as we go as well.

    "article_text": "Qakbot hackers dodged the FBI and kept the ransomware flowing When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In a major cybercrime crackdown, the FBI and international partnersdeclared victory against Qakbot- also known as Qbot - back in August 2023. Themalwareoperation, which infected over 700,000 computers globally (including around 200,000 in the US), was linked to $58 million in ransomware-related losses. Described by U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada as “the most significant technological and financial operation ever led by the Department of Justice against a botnet,” Operation Duck Hunt led to the seizure of 52 servers and the confiscation of $8.6 million in cryptocurrency - but, as with many supposed knockouts in cybercrime, the celebration was premature. Within just three months,Qakbot re-emerged, demonstrating that even coordinated, resource-intensive law enforcement actions can have disappointingly limited long-term impact. Following the 2023 takedown, alleged ringleader Rustam Rafailevich Gallyamov and his crew didn’t retreat, they adapted - rather than relying on traditional phishing to distribute malware, they reportedly shifted to more deceptive tactics. And according toThe Register, newly unsealed indictments reveal a novel strategy involving “spam bomb attacks” - overwhelming employees’ inboxes with unwanted subscription emails. The attackers would then pose as IT staff offering to help, tricking victims into running malicious code. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! This tactic enabled the group to regain access to company systems, encrypt files, and exfiltrate sensitive data. “Defendant Gallyamov and co-conspirators would launch targeted spam bomb attacks at employees of victim companies,” court documents state, “and then contact those employees, posing as information technology workers.” Once access was granted, the consequences were swift and severe: data theft, encryption, and ransom demands. Qakbot malware enables attackers to backdoor systems, install additional threats, and harvest credentials. Operators behind ransomware strains such as REvil, Black Basta, and Conti allegedly paid Gallyamov and his associates for access, or even shared a portion of their extorted proceeds. In April 2025, additional illicit funds, over 30 bitcoin and US $700,000 were seized from Gallyamov, but he remains in Russia, beyond the reach of US law enforcement. As federal officials put it, “unless he foolishly decides to leave the protection of the motherland,” Gallyamov is likely to remain untouchable. To stay protected from these kinds of threats, organizations need to invest in thebest antivirus- additionally, using a leadingendpoint protection platformcan help detect and isolate suspicious activity before it escalates into a data breach or ransomware attack.

    "article_text": "Inbox zero here you come When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There are few modern experiences more demoralizing than waking up, picking up your phone to turn off your alarm, and discovering an avalanche of emails burying your inbox in notifications. Forget writing back, just sorting through them all and determining which need responses and how quickly you need to answer can eat up a whole day. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis believes AI should handle all of that organizing and responding, and he and his team have a plan to embed a virtual robot secretary in your inbox so that you never need to crawl through irrelevant sales pitches and unnecessary LinkedIn notifications ever again. Email is the quintessential magical treasure with a dark curse attached. Miraculous instant communication worldwide is burdened with spam, late-night demands for immediate action from a boss, and the dreaded accidental reply-all button. Hassabis thinks AI can restore the good parts of email by handling all the \"mundane chores\" and recommending responses instead of leaving you filled with despair at your triple-digit unread count. Hassabistoldthe audience at the recent SXSW London event he'd happily pay quite a lot of money to end the current tyranny of the inbox. And not in some far-off future. DeepMind is working to make email inboxes self-managing, capable of sorting through incoming messages, deciding which ones matter, and drafting responses that sound like you. So the next annoying email not only won't find you well, it won't find you at all until the AI works up a response for your approval. From a marketing perspective, it's a brilliant approach. Plenty of people rightly worried about some of the implications of AI might have a soft spot for the technology if it can clear up even a couple of hours a week for actual productive work (or even seeing your family). Hassabis described his vision of a “universal AI assistant” that can be proactive and smart enough to act on your behalf. Instead of regularly giving the AI orders and explaining your priorities, the AI will learn from observing how you deal with a variety of emails and perhaps a one-time broad description of your approach to different kinds of messages. It will know not only how you respond to emails, but also which you ignore on purpose and which you are just stumped at figuring out how to answer. An AI assistant of that caliber, \"gives you more time and maybe protects your attention from other algorithms trying to gain your attention,\" Hassabis said. \"I think we can actually use AI in service of the individual.” “ That's the long-term big picture. For now, Hassabis said we can look forward to AI tools that know when to say, “Thanks for the follow-up. I’ll take a look and get back to you soon.” And when to immediately click delete.

    "title": "A new 'Wikipedia for extensions' wants to make your web browser far more secure by exposing dangerous tools",
    "article_text": "ExtensionPedia offers a free security check for browser extensions When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Browser extensions often make browsing easier by blocking ads, autofilling passwords, or providingproductivity tools, but they also pose one of the most overlooked security risks in today’s digital ecosystem. To address this, cybersecurity companyLayerXhas launchedExtensionPedia, a kind of “Wikipedia for extensions,” aimed at providing in-depth risk assessments for over 200,000browserextensions across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Internet users typically rely on app stores to vet these extensions and ensure they are safe. However, LayerX claims that these stores “only do a superficial job of vetting extensions.” While they scan for malware and obvious red flags, they do not investigate behavioral patterns or the ownership lineage of extension code. “When someone installs a browser extension - either for personal or work use - users and their organizations have no idea what permissions the extension has, how reputable the author is, or the extension’s overall risk profile,” said Or Eshed, co-founder and CEO of LayerX. This has created a loophole through which malicious actors have repeatedly introduced spyware, adware, and data-harvesting tools. In recent months, browser-based identity theft and data exfiltration via extensions have become so prevalent that they’ve prompted official warnings from agencies like the FBI. “While browser extensions are often considered harmless, in practice they are frequently granted extensive access permissions to users’ identity information and data,” LayerX notes, “leading hackers to use them as an attack channel for credential theft, account takeover, and data theft.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! LayerX says its service pulls anonymous data from millions of browser sessions via its database, which includes unified risk scores, granular permission breakdowns, and detailed reputation analyses, all in one searchable, public-facing tool. Whileantivirusandendpoint protection platformscan help guard against malicious extensions, the availability of a dedicated risk score could empower users to make more informed decisions. However, users must actively search the ExtensionPedia database and understand the significance of permission scopes or publisher risk scores. The concept is promising, but skepticism remains over whether users will truly comprehend the scores or simply dismiss them as technical jargon. Additionally, the effectiveness of such a database in addressing the broader cybersecurity threat landscape remains to be seen. The concept also assumes users will research extensions before installing them, something that rarely happens in practice. By making extension risk scores public, LayerX is undeniably increasing transparency, but visibility alone does not equate to protection. ExtensionPedia is currently available for free, but its real impact will depend on how widely, and thoughtfully, it’s used.

    "title": "Remember The Simpsons Funday Football tie-in? Sony’s new NHL deal could see more animated heroes on ice",
    "article_text": "Sony and NHL ink deal for expanded tech partnership When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you've ever dreamed of seeing your hockey heroes playing alongside the biggest animated stars thenSony's new deal with the NHL might get you excited. Sony has already expanded into the professional sports world via its Beyond Sports brand, which is key to real-time data processing and the ability to take all that action and translate it into something else. Its partnership with the NFL (National Football League) led tothe airing of theThe Simpsons Funday FootballonDisney+and ESPN last year, and now the NHL could be next for that kind of treatment. The NHL already uses Sony's Hawk-Eye Technology system – a combination of cameras above the ice and wearable sensors on players – but this new deal will expand on that, while continuing the use of Sony cameras for both still photography and video. Most excitingly, it promises to broaden the role that Beyond Sports could play in changing how fans of any age can experience a hockey game. If real-time animated simulcasts are on the horizon as part of this deal, it won't be the first time the NHL and Sony have collaborated on such a venture. In 2023, theNHL Big City Greens Classicwas produced using Beyond Sports technology and that system, along with the Hawk-Eye setup, is now installed in all 32 arenas. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. As with other animated broadcasts, the goal is to expand the appeal and attract a wider audience – one that might be different from or adjacent to those attending the game in person. Speaking to TechRadar, David Lehanski, Executive Vice President of Business Development and Innovation at the NHL, said that the talks began with a question about how the league can reach more fans. Now, though, “We're going to eventually get to a point where we allow the fan to customize so they can have some role in determining what the environment looks like. And then another step after that might be to even give the fans an ability to interact with the content,” Lehanski continued. Those comments echo back toTechRadar’s conversation with Sander Schouten, Managing Director and Co-Founder at Beyond Sports last year. Schouten then hinted that more environments could come depending on the partner, and that we could see more interactive streams. He also highlighted the sheer volume of data being generated and its rapid pace, suggesting that the runway is wide open for various implementations. That could mean multiple streams or different ways of accessing the action – be it on a traditional TV, through streaming, or even in a virtual reality environment. The latter is something the NHL has already explored, both for analysts and for players. For both Sony and the NHL, this is an exciting endeavor – a formalized partnership built on technology already being used in games. It should open the door to more robust interactions and increased investment, enhancing the game experience whether you’re in the stands or watching from home. While neither Sony nor the NHL would comment on future partners for real-time animated moments, I am hopeful we might see a return ofThe Simpsons– not for football, but for hockey.

    "title": "Ready, set, gone: why popups, freezing, and tiny text are causing millions of app users to jump ship and abandon businesses",
    "article_text": "Forget fancy designs - people want simple, glitch-free apps that work When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In the fast-paced world of digital products, expectations are high, patience is limited, and brands invest heavily in aesthetics, sleek interfaces, and gamified user journeys. Yet, what actually drives users away is often much simpler, and far more damaging. Research from Amplitude has claimed intrusive popups, frequent crashes, tiny unreadable text, and unclear privacy settings are now major tipping points that prompt users to delete apps altogether. Some developers argue that popups are a necessary evil for monetization, but as the report found, customer behavior tells a different story. Over half of app users (54%) ignore popups entirely, and only 46% have ever responded to one. Engagement varies dramatically across generations, with 53% of Gen Z users saying they’ve acted on a popup, compared to just 17% of Boomers. “This is a clear signal that people want popups that are better timed, less intrusive, and more relevant to their unique needs - and this is especially important for older generations,” said Lee Edwards, Vice President, EMEA at Amplitude. The data suggests that popups are not inherently ineffective; rather, they’re often mistimed, disruptive, or irrelevant, as poorly placed promotions erode trust instead of driving conversions. But it’s not just about popups. When apps glitch or freeze, the consequences are immediate. Over a third (35%) of users will abandon an app within minutes of it malfunctioning, while 10% won’t even give it that long. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! User loyalty is rare: only 16% of users bother to report problems or contact support, while 58% simply leave, never to return. Beyond bugs, poor design choices add to user frustration. Nearly half (45%) of users who’ve encountered flawed design say it made them feel “enraged,” with the number rising to 59% among Millennials and Gen Z. Small text, forced account creation, and confusing navigation all contribute to the problem - notably, older users are especially frustrated by illegible text, an issue made worse when designers optimize exclusively for modern devices, without considering accessibility on older or smaller screens. What users overwhelmingly want is reliability. An eye-catching app is meaningless if it can’t deliver a stable experience - and in fact, 85% of users prefer a plain-looking app which works consistently over a beautiful one that breaks. To stay relevant, apps must earn their place on a user’s device, there is no room for mediocrity. Even promising concepts like “super apps,” which combine messaging, shopping, banking, and more, appeal to just 41% of users. Ultimately, brands hoping to build loyalty must go beyond analytics dashboards and deeply examine how real users interact, where they struggle, and why they leave.

    "article_text": "Hi-fi, but with horizontal spine support When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We love to give practical buying advice on the latest gadgets here at TechRadar. But sometimes what we love evenmoreis to indulge in the most high-end, cutting-edge, luxurious tech on the planet. That's what we bring you in these Money no Object columns – you canread the whole series here. Struggling to sleep? Perhaps you need to invest in a new bed, friend. And if you've never thought of adding some sleep-specific (or at the very least, Sunday chill-specific) stereo speakers to set you up for the best shut-eye session of your life, well… maybe you should. Look, it's not every day you see averyhigh-end bed with someveryhigh-end speakers built in. But that's what you're looking at here. I only need to glance at The Seventy Five, a collaboration between audio specialist KEF and Savoir, a British bedmaker since 1905, to feel a little more relaxed about life. That is, until I see the price… Just imagine those 10 hand-upholstered panels, gently curving around your crown and discreetly housing two glorious Ci3160REFM, THX Ultra-certified KEF speakers. Don't worry, they're towed in just right, because they're nestled into the penultimate panels around the bed aren't they? Why call this creation The Seventy Five? Because that has long been considered the ideal number of beats per minute a musical track should have, to help you relax. KEF's magnetic removable grilles will allow you to conceal or reveal the speakers within your aspirational bed, but I'm sure you want to know what you're getting in the first instance – because KEF makes some of thebest stereo speakerswe've had the pleasure of testing. At the core of each speaker within The Seventy Five lies KEF’s 12th generation signature driver array, Uni-Q (proprietary tech found in all KEF stereo speakers, which you can read more on in ourKEF LSX II LT review). Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. However, the sound system here is completed with six (yes, six)KEF Kube8b subwoofers, discreetly installed in the base of the bed. These subwoofers feature KEF's iBX technology to extend the bass depth, but make no mistake, in-bed amplifiers, drivers and sealed cabinets are all on board here – a sound system selected and tuned by KEF’s team in Maidstone, UK. What about the bit you sleep on? Well, if you reckon you've read about Savoir within TechRadar's digital pages before today, you're not wrong; the brand featured in our7 most expensive mattresses in the worldarticle not too long ago. But this is expensive with added expensive KEF speakers. Savoir tells me its London Bedworks invests over 150 hours of handcraft into The Seventy Five, to deliver \"a masterpiece of sleeping comfort\". And while you're getting music, there's no need for headphones or wires – Savoir's team has also put wireless charging ports into the bed's side tables, so your devices can power up as you drift off. Ready for some pricing? OK. But maybe sit down. Remember, this is a piece of furniture designed for how people actually use their bedrooms today: reading, listening, watching, winding down… and it's an investment. In the US, The Seventy Five will cost you from $68,605 for a King; in the UK, it's £51,385 for a Super King (because bed sizes are actually different across the pond).

The Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, owned byConstellation Energy, was due to be mothballed in 2027, but will now stay open thanks to Meta's support. The 20-year deal will see the facility provide 1,121 megawatts of \"emissions-free nuclear energy\", with additional incremental capacity of 30MW if needed. The deal will mark only the second US site to host a nuclear reactor built entirely this century, following Plant Vogtle, built in 2023 near Waynesboro, Georgia. \"As we have embarked on understanding and helping to grow nuclear energy in the U.S., we have heard from across the ecosystem that existing nuclear power plants will not be able to stay online indefinitely without partners and investments that help extend existing operating licenses and increase generation capacity,\" Meta said in astatement. \"It’s clear that there are many nuclear power plants serving the U.S. that need long-term support to help our electricity grids remain reliable as energy needs grow.\" \"Keeping an existing plant operating will have the same positive effect as adding new clean energy to the grid, and avoid the disruption that has occurred when other nuclear units have retired prematurely.\" Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Built in 1987, Meta says the Clinton Clean Energy Center support will also preserve over 1,100 local jobs and contributes $13.5 million annually in tax revenue. The plant had been facing closure as long ago as 2017 due to financial pressure, but Illinois passed its Future Energy Jobs Act in 2016, which extended its operations via a zero-emission credit (ZEC) program. This was due to expire in 2027, but Meta's support should now see it operate long past this. “We are proud to partner with Meta because they asked that important question, and even better, they figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy,\" noted said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO, Constellation. \"Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards.” A March 2025 report commissioned by the firm and carried out by The Brattle Group claimed shuttering the Clinton plant would have led to 34 million metric tons of additional carbon pollution over 20 years - the equivalent of an additional 7.4 million gas-powered cars coming onto the road for one year - as well causing as Illinois’ GDP to drop by $765 million annually.

    "article_text": "Your move Apple When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Samsungmay have quietly handed the smackdown toAppleand whatever super-slim phone the Cupertino crew might be cooking up. That's because ina recent video interview with our sibling publication Tom’s Guide, Blake Gaiser, director of smartphone product management at Samsung Electronics America, touted the efforts and innovations the South Korean company made to bring theSamsung Galaxy S25 Edgeto fruition. Describing it as a “Goldilocks” of smartphones to Global Editor-in-Chief Mark Spoonauer, Gaiser championed how the Galaxy S25 Edge is a true high-end phone that could create a whole new category of smartphone. “We do consider it to be a flagship. It is a new innovation piece that we're bringing forth where we're taking out so much weight, so much thickness of this device, while not compromising on the things that are really important to our customers, such as durability, the performance of the chipset, having that flagship 200MP camera,” explained Gaiser. “And so we do believe that this is that kind of Goldilocks for so many of our customers that is going to give them everything they want and not give them the things that they're not looking for.” Gaiser went on to discuss more aspects of the Galaxy S25 Edge, from its design to its cameras and AI. But what resonated with me, as a tech journalist with copious amounts of experience writing about and handling some of thebest phones, is that Samsung may have seriously thrown down the gauntlet at Apple and what it might do with the rumorediPhone 17 Air. I feel Apple will need to bring something special to the table in order to somewhat clap back at Samsung, while also being seen as forging its own path. As it stands, the iPhone 17 Air exists in the realms of rumor and speculation, but I’d place a favourable bet that Apple will look to slim down its next-generation iPhones; as much asI love the design of the iPhone 16 Pro Max, I’m not against it getting a nip and a tuck. Check out the full interview in the video above and then let me know in the comments whether you think Samsung has created something special here or if it's more of a gimmick.

    "article_text": "Malicious ChatGPT and NovaLeads clones are a threat to businesses When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cybercriminals are already usingAI to make phishing emails more convincing, and now they’re manipulating search engine results to spread malware disguised as AI tools. New research fromCisco Talosclaims these fake downloads appear to be legitimate software, often promoted through search engines and social platforms, and are predominantly targeting users in the tech, marketing, and B2B sales industries. Talos recently uncovered several threats distributed this way, includingransomwarefamilies CyberLock and Lucky_Gh0$t, as well as a destructive new malware called Numero. Talos says these threats use familiar branding, fake websites, and misleading metadata to trick users into downloading and running infected software. In one case, attackers created a clone of a known AI service, “NovaLeads,” and usedSEOmanipulation to rank the fake site near the top of search results. When victims downloaded what appeared to be the legitimate installer, it executed CyberLock ransomware, written in PowerShell, which encrypted targeted files and demanded a $50,000 ransom in Monero. The ransom note falsely claimed the payment would fund humanitarian aid. Lucky_Gh0$t ransomware, another discovery, was bundled with realMicrosoftAI tools inside a self-extracting archive named “ChatGPT 4.0 full version - Premium.exe.” Once executed, it encrypted files smaller than 1.2GB and deleted or corrupted larger ones. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The newly identified malware, Numero, is especially destructive. Disguised as an installer for a video AI tool, it repeatedly runs a loop that corrupts the Windows interface by overwriting GUI elements with numeric strings, rendering systems unusable. These campaigns exploit rising demand for AI software and target sectors most likely to adopt these tools quickly. With data centers, businesses, and individuals increasingly reliant on AI platforms, the potential harm from such threats is growing. Talos warns users to be cautious when searching forAI tools onlineand to only download software from trusted vendors. Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

    "title": "A flood of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 leaks have arrived – including a potential launch date",
    "article_text": "Not long to wait now When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Update: June 4, 2025 It seemsSamsunghas now accidentally confirmed the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7's names. As spotted byDigital Trends, Samsung named the gif in itsrecent Galaxy Z Fold 7 Ultra teaseras new 'Galaxy-Z-Fold7-Z-Flip7-Pre-tease-Bartype_1920x1080.gif', referencing the two phones for the first time. Accidental clanger or a little, hype-building easter egg? We'll let you decide. Original story follows: We've already heard plenty ofSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7andSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7rumors in recent months, but a flurry of new leaks just appeared, covering release dates, colors, storage options, and pricing. First up, reliable tipsterIce Universe(viaAndroid Authority) says the foldables will launch at the same time as last year – which would be July 10. However, as the Android Authority report points out, there is some debate among leakers about whether that's accurate. All the signs are certainlypointing towards July, to match the 2024 schedule for Samsung's flagship foldable phones, but we'll have to wait and see whether this July 10 prediction is correct. Time zone calculations need to be considered too, because Samsung's home of South Korea is some 13 hours ahead of the US east coast. Whenever the foldables show up, in most countries they should match last year's models in terms of pricing, according to tipsterPandaFlash(via9to5Google). Last year'sSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6started at $1,899 / £1,799 / AU$2,749, while theSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6started at $1,099.99 / £1,049 / AU$1,799.

Galaxy Z Fold7: 12+256GB 12+512GB 16+1TB Silver ShadowBlue ShadowJetblackCoralredJune 3, 2025 Next, there are a bunch of leaks fromWinFutureand tipsterArsène Lupinabout the colors and spec options on these handsets. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is said to be coming in black, blue, coral red, and silver colors, with either 12GB or 16GB of RAM, and 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of storage on board. As for the Galaxy Z Flip 6, the colors here are expected to be black, blue, and coral red. As for specs, we're looking at 8GB or 12GB of RAM, plus 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage. However, there are some discrepancies between the two sources, so as usual we'll have to wait for full confirmation from Samsung. The more affordable Galaxy Z Flip FE alsogets a mention. In this case you get 8GB of RAM plus 128GB or 256GB of storage, and the predicted colors are black or white. This phone may well show up at the same time as the other foldables. It looks likely to be a busy Samsung Unpacked event in July, with theSamsung Galaxy Watch 8and perhaps aSamsung tri-foldalso set to make an appearance.

    "title": "Hold the phone! Samsung has just teased a Galaxy Z Fold 7 Ultra",
    "article_text": "Samsung's first Ultra foldable could be launching soon When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6is currentlySamsung’s most expensive widely available phone, but this year the company might launch something even pricier than the upcomingSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. That's right: Samsung has strongly hinted that a Galaxy Z Fold 7 Ultra is on the way. In a new post on itsnewsroom, Samsung talks about introducing an \"Ultra-experience\" with a foldable form factor, and while the company doesn’t get specific about when such a product might launch, it concludes by saying “the Ultra experience is ready to unfold”, which suggests it’s coming soon. That could mean we’ll see the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Ultra launch alongside the standard Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and theSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, both of which are expected to land in July. But what would a Galaxy Z Fold 7 Ultra entail? Samsung doesn’t get super specific here either, but it does mention “bigger screens, better cameras and new ways to connect and create,” as well as “industry-leading hardware, cutting-edge performance and seamless AI integration optimized for the foldable format.” And there’s a GIF included (below) that shows the outline of a foldable phone, though the form factor appears much like that of the Galaxy Z Fold 6. However, while this all basically confirms that Samsung is working on an Ultra-level foldable, it’s possible that these features will instead come to the standard Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. After all, that’s rumored to have a new 200MP camera, bigger screens, and more power, so it could potentially be considered an ‘Ultra’ phone in itself. Indeed, as spotted byDigital Trends, Samsung has actually named this new image 'Galaxy-Z-Fold7-Z-Flip7-Pre-tease-Bartype_1920x1080.gif', which references both the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. So, it could be that we’ll still see just one new Z Fold model this year, a product with Ultra-level upgrades that may or may not have 'Ultra' in its name. Alternatively, we might get both a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Ultra – though in that case, it's odd that Samsung would namecheck the former in a teaser image for the latter. That would also call into question all the previous Galaxy Z Fold 7 leaks we’ve seen – might they actually be about the Ultra-branded model instead? Either way, it seems likely that at least one of Samsung’s upcoming foldables will be a big upgrade on what we’ve seen before. Roll on Galaxy Unpacked in July!

    "article_text": "Critics are loving Jesse Armstrong's feature directorial debut When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Successioncreator Jesse Armstrong continues to skewer the world of the awfully rich (and richly awful) with his new tech bro satireMountainhead. Skipping theaters, the new movie premiered onMaxon Saturday, May 31, with a linear broadcast on HBO that evening. Since release, the film has shot up the Max charts and is currently enjoying the global top spot. And while audiences can’t stream theSuccessionfollow-up quick enough, critics are loving what is fast becoming one of thebest Max moviesaround at the moment, with the film currently sitting at a very respectable 79% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Armstrong’s latest dark comedy follows a group of Musk/Bezos/Zuckerberg types as they meet at one of their number's secluded mountain retreat while the world faces AI-fueled turmoil that they may have played a not-insignificant part in creating. Jason Schwartzman pops his head above the Wes Anderson parapet to play Hugo, the owner of the lodge looking to impress his billionaire buddies. Steve Carell, meanwhile, portrays Randall, the elder statesman of the group and an early tech mogul who has been raking it in since before the rest of the group were born. Cory Michael Smith’s Venis is the wealthiest of the bunch and the owner of the social media platform at the center of the storm of disinformation engulfing the globe, while Ramy Youssef’s Jeff is an AI pioneer on the outs with some of the gang. After four seasons of the critically acclaimedSuccession, expectations were high for Armstrong and HBO’s next collaboration, and Francesca Orsi, EVP of Programming at the network is confident their continued partnership will deliver, saying: “We’re ecstatic to be back in business with the singular talent Jesse Armstrong [...].’ Jesse once again raises the bar with a bold examination of modern greed, power and male ambition. That this feature serves as his directorial debut will only elevate what is already thrilling on the page, and we couldn’t be more excited to share this timely film with the world.” Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. As you’d expect with a high Rotten Tomatoes score, critics have plenty of praise for the film, withGlobe and Mailcommenting on the quality of the \"inventively profane” dialogue which is “as enjoyable asSuccession’sat its most absurd,” whileEmpirecalled it a “darkly funny” film with a “chilling final note.” Some responses weren’t as positive, however, as some critics found the film lacked subtlety.Boston Globesaid the movie was “satire as a blunt force object,” and critic Christian Toto criticised the way the film “piles on the hate, not the laughs.” Viewers have been even harsher on Armstrong’s latest, with the film sitting at just a 27% RT Audience Score. Many viewers compared the film unfavorably toSuccession, with one saying it was like the show, but with characters that were \"annoyingly fake and worse, unfunny.” Another called it “the most obnoxious movie I’ve ever seen” while a third said simply: “just terrible.” Viewers over on Reddit were a little kinder though, with one poster calling the film “hilarious,” stating “Steve Carell was incredible in it.” Another praised the “fun dialogue and good laughs,” with other users saying “Ireallyenjoyed this.” Either way, if you’re a subscriber to one of thebest streaming servicesout there and intrigued by what sounds likeSuccessionmeetsGlass Onion, the film is available to stream on Max right now.

Russian President Vladimir Putin“did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond”to recent Ukrainian attacks on airfields hosting Russian strategic bombers, US President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday evening,revealing detailsof their unannounced conversation that day. The US State Department issued thesecurity alertjust hours earlier, advising Americans currently in Ukraine to“identify shelter locations in advance”and to“keep reserves of water, food, and medication.” “Russia has increased the intensity of its missile and drone attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks, and there is currently a continued risk of significant air attacks,”the advisory stated. On Sunday, Ukrainian drones struck multiple Russian airbases in a coordinated assault targeting long-range, nuclear-capable bombers. Moscow said that most of the incoming drones were intercepted, without confirming any losses or carrying out any immediate military response. Kiev also targeted multiple Russian civilian sites in acts of railway sabotage over the weekend, killing at least seven people and injuring over 120 in what Moscow branded as terrorism. Putin on Wednesday described the railway sabotage incidents in Bryansk and Kursk Regions as“undoubtedly a terrorist act”committed by the“illegitimate regime in Kiev,”which he said“is graduallyturning into a terrorist organization.” According to top foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov, Putin informed Trump that these attacks were intended to derail the direct talks between Moscow and Kiev, the second round of which took place in Istanbul on Monday. The two leaders agreed to continue contacts about Ukraine, both at the highest level and through other channels. Trump described the phone call as“a good conversation,”though he noted it was“not the one that will lead to immediate peace.”",

    "article_text": "Ukraine is deliberately escalating the ongoing conflict by targeting civilian infrastructure within Russian territory, President Vladimir Putin has told Pope Leo XIV. According to the Kremlin, the Russian leader and the Pontiff held“a constructive”phone conversation on Wednesday, during which they discussed a number of topics, including the Ukraine conflict. Putin pointed out that against a backdrop of resumed direct talks between Moscow and Kiev, the Ukrainian leadership is“doubling down on escalation [and] conducting acts of sabotage against civilian infrastructure on Russian territory.”He described the recent acts of railway sabotage in Russia’s Bryansk and Kursk Regions as terrorism, the Kremlin stated. The Russian president confirmed that Moscow is interested in settling the conflict through political and diplomatic means, but stressed that its root causes should be addressed to ensure a lasting peace. Briefing the Pope on the progress made during the latest round of direct negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul, Türkiye on Monday, Putin said that the two sides had agreed on exchanging prisoners and the bodies of the dead. He emphasized that Russia is doing everything it can to ensure the reunification of the children who have been separated from their families during the course of the conflict, according to the Kremlin. Putin also drew the pontiff’s attention to the persecution of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church by Kiev authorities, the Kremlin said. He voiced hope that the Holy See would more actively support religious freedom in Ukraine. Putin thanked the head of the Catholic church“for his willingness to assist in resolving the crisis”as well as the Holy See’s role in mediating pressing humanitarian issues between Moscow and Kiev. The Russian head of state and the Pope agreed to strengthen bilateral ties and to intensify efforts aimed at protecting Christians worldwide, the statement read. The 69-year-old cardinal Robert Prevost was elected Pope early last month, the first American ever to assume the role. He succeeded Francis, who died on April 21 at the age of 88.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he held a phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Wednesday to discuss the Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian airbases. Ukrainian drones hit multiple Russian airbases on Sunday in a coordinated assault. Targets ranged from Murmansk in the Arctic to Irkutsk in Siberia. Kiev claims the strikes damaged or destroyed approximately 40 Russian military aircraft, including Tu-95 and Tu-22 long-range bombers. Moscow has not verified these claims, stating that most of the incoming drones were intercepted. Reports suggest the attack was executed using explosive-laden drones launched from commercial trucks that had been covertly brought into Russian territory. Trump made the announcement in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, writing that the call with Putin lasted more than an hour, describing it as“a good conversation.” “We discussed the attack on Russia’s docked airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides,”he wrote, noting, however, it was“not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.” Trump added that the Russian president“did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.” Moscow has confirmed the Trump-Putin phone call. Yury Ushakov, the top foreign policy adviser to the Russian president, told a press briefing on Wednesday that the two leaders agreed to continue contacts on Ukraine, including at the highest level and through other channels. According to Ushakov, Putin informed Trump that Kiev had tried to sabotage the direct Russia-Ukraine talks – the second round of which was held in Istanbul on Monday – by launching targeted strikes on Russian civilian sites under direct orders from the Ukrainian leadership. Putin on Wednesday called the railway sabotage in Russia’s Bryansk and Kursk Regions“undoubtedly a terrorist act”by the“illegitimate regime in Kiev,”which, he said,“is gradually turning into a terrorist organization.”",

    "title": "Germany reports spike in anti-Semitism",
    "article_text": "The number of anti-Semitic incidents recorded in Germany surged by around 77% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to a report by watchdog RIAS. The authors linked the spike to“collective blame”over Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. The document, published on Wednesday, recorded a total of 8,627 anti-Semitic incidents in the country last year, up from 4,886 in 2023. “The extent and quality of anti-Semitic incidents in Germany in 2024 were very similar to the situation in the first months after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel,”the watchdog said, noting that the Gaza conflict“became a pretext for many people to make anti-Semitic statements.” “For Jews in Germany, anti-Semitism remains a phenomenon that shapes everyday life,”the report stated. RIAS said the increase was especially visible in anti-Israel activism. It recorded 5,857 instances tied to anti-Semitism at protests, through posters and stickers, and at schools and universities. Cases targeting Jews and Israelis directly nearly tripled in two years, it said, from 331 in 2022 to 966 last year. The number of right-wing extremism-linked cases hit a record 544 since tracking began in 2020. RIAS recorded eight cases of extreme personal violence, 186 assaults, and 300 threats. Reported incidents also included vandalized Holocaust memorials and anti-Semitic graffiti. Germany’s federal police also track anti-Semitic crimes, though only if they meet criminal thresholds. The agency logged a 20.7% increase in crimes against Jews in 2024 compared to the year prior, with 6,236 incidents. Josef Schuster, the president of the Central Council of Jews, said the RIAS report“bears witness to a daily life that is increasingly characterized by hostility and hatred for many Jews.”He called for more training for police and the judiciary to better identify and prevent these incidents. German Anti-Semitism Commissioner Felix Klein, who previously linked the rise in anti-Semitic incidents to the country’s growing Muslim population, said the Gaza war has come to“serve as a justification”for anti-Semitic acts. “It’s a sad trend that every year we hear how sharply the number of anti-Semitic incidents has risen,”Klein said.“The increase in 2024 was particularly striking – hatred against Jews in Germany has normalized to a shameful level.”He called for a stronger, more focused effort to counter the trend. Germany is home to an estimated 125,000 Jews.",

    "title": "‘Korean Donald Trump’ emerges from the chaos in Seoul",
    "article_text": "On June 3, 2025, a snap presidential election was held in the Republic of Korea in which Democratic candidate Lee Jae-myung won with over 49% of the vote. The election followed an attempt on December 3, 2024 to impose martial law in the country, which led the Constitutional Court to unanimously vote for the impeachment of then-President Yoon Suk-yeol. There were several candidates, but the main contest took place between the ruling conservative People Power Party and the opposition Democratic Party. Chairman Lee is a striking and controversial figure. During the presidency of the previous Democrat, Moon Jae-in, Lee led an independent faction within the party and was considered an even more leftist populist than Moon. Moon viewed him as a dangerous rival and tried to remove him via a series of criminal cases. Lee managed to fend off these attacks and eventually became the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate in 2022 after all of Moon’s protégés lost the primaries. Although he once called himself the ‘Korean Bernie Sanders’ due to his populist slogans and ideas such as universal basic income, his circle now prefers the term ‘Korean Donald Trump’, as both share a flamboyant style and peculiar reputations. Even before entering the presidential race, Lee was implicated in several criminal cases involving corruption, abuse of power, perjury, election law violations, and even cash smuggling into North Korea. The accusations were serious – several of Lee’s close associates were imprisoned. He was, however, saved by a series of miraculous coincidences: Five key witnesses in different cases who could testify against him either committed suicide or died from various causes. Though his enemies consider the deaths highly suspicious, police found no evidence of foul play. The constitutional crisis that led to the snap election began when, on November 15, 2024, Lee received a suspended sentence. Although conditional, the verdict threatened his political career. If upheld by the Supreme Court, Lee would be barred from holding public office for five years. With nearly two-thirds of the seats in parliament, the Democrats intensified their opposition. Yoon attempted to ‘cut the Gordian knot’ by declaring martial law, but the public saw this as a return to military dictatorship, which unsurprisingly failed. After a long deliberation and despite contentious points, the Constitutional Court unanimously impeached the president, as reinstating him would plunge the country into chaos. Lee easily won his party’s primary with 89.77% of the vote. His opponents were the former independent left-centrist Kim Dong-yeon and ex-Governor Kim Kyung-soo, an ally of Moon Jae-in. Before the parliamentary elections, Lee either subdued or pushed out strong figures from other factions, earning accusations that he turned the Democratic Party into a personal fan club. Still, Lee’s path to the presidency was not easy. On March 26, 2025, the Seoul appellate court overturned Lee’s conviction, formally reopening his political path. This surprised legal experts, especially conservatives. The reason became clear: The presiding judges were members of a progressive NGO associated with the Democratic Party. However, on May 1, 2025, the Supreme Court reversed the acquittal and sent the case for retrial. Theoretically, this could disqualify Lee if the outcome was unfavorable, but the Democrats launched protests, calling the court’s decision a coup comparable to martial law. Facing threats of impeachment (parliament can impeach any official, including judges), the judiciary made a ‘compromise’ decision: Lee’s retrial and other investigations would resume only after the election. Disqualifying Lee would decapitate the opposition, which lacked a viable substitute. But there’s an unusual dilemma: The Constitution states that a sitting president can only be imprisoned for treason or rebellion. Yet, if someone under criminal investigation wins and is later convicted, there is no clear precedent. Democrats are preemptively addressing this: A parliamentary committee has reviewed a law that would terminate all criminal proceedings against an elected president and amend the penal code to decriminalize the charges Lee faced. Such legal manipulation doesn’t please everyone. Hence, Lee enjoys both the highest approval and disapproval ratings – meaning a sizable bloc could unite under the slogan ‘anyone but Lee Jae-myung’. While Lee achieved party unity, the conservatives have been plagued by infighting. The party has factions – center-rights, Yoon loyalists, and traditional conservatives. Initially, eight candidates entered the race, and a three-stage process narrowed the field. The first round eliminated four weaker or controversial figures, such as ex-Speaker Na Kyung-won. In the second round, moderate An Heol-su (’the Korean Kaspersky’) and classical conservative Won Joon-pyo – who ran against Moon Jae-in in 2017 and might have been the nominee again if not for Yoon – were dropped. Two finalists remained. One was Han Dong-hoon, Yoon’s longtime ally from the Prosecutor’s Office, former justice minister and party leader. However, Han opposed martial law and voted against it. After Yoon’s impeachment, Han resigned. Analysts saw in him a fresh conservative image, but he lost the final round. Instead, the 2025 conservative candidate is ex-Labor Minister Kim Moon-soo. He has two notable qualities: A former union activist repressed under military rule, he later joined the conservatives. And he was the only cabinet member who refused to apologize after the failed martial law attempt. Instead, he argued that Yoon may have erred in methods, but the problem required resolution. Kim became a symbol of uncompromising conservatism. But party leaders worried whether he could attract undecided voters – those alienated by both Lee and Yoon. Fortunately, they had an alternative. After some thought, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo (also acting president post-impeachment) entered the race. Once a leftist and prime minister in the 2000s, he too joined the conservatives. Some see him as a centrist technocrat; others, a political opportunist. On May 2, 2025 – after the conservative primaries ended – Han announced his independent candidacy. He vowed to act as a transitional“technical president”to reform the government and step down, ushering in a“Seventh Republic.” In fact, all major candidates proposed constitutional reforms. Most advocated limiting presidential power and replacing the current five-year single term with two four-year terms, US-style. Given nearly 40 years since the last constitution, some anti-dictatorship clauses seem outdated. Han’s resignation triggered a mini-government crisis. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok, next in line, resigned minutes before a parliamentary impeachment vote against him. The role of acting leader passed to Education Minister Lee Joo-ho. Han effectively represented the conservative camp. Yoon’s allies saw him as a unifying, rational figure. A split right would guarantee Lee’s win. The party pressured Kim Moon-soo to withdraw for Han, even voiding the primary results. Kim denounced this as betrayal, demanded a new vote – and won again. The old leadership resigned. Han withdrew, urging support for Kim. Meanwhile, Kim softened his rhetoric and leaned toward the center. This showed in debates about whether Yoon should leave the party. While a symbol for conservatives, his presence burdened them with his failures – especially martial law. Ultimately, Yoon left People Power, but might form a new party post-election. There were more candidates. Some from truly left-wing parties, as Lee has shifted right – dropping the idea of basic income and even proposing Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Independents include ex-conservative leader Hwang Kyo-ahn, now ultra-right. But only one got over 5%: Lee Jun-seok, leader of the Reform Party. A center-right former conservative leader ousted for opposing Yoon, Lee is youthful and energetic. Though his party failed to become a ‘third force’, he remains popular. Conservatives wanted him to quit and unify the right. Some party members disenchanted with him have even joined the Democrats. Many promises were made by all candidates, and listing them all here is pointless – each of them essentially promises good things and opposes bad things. Beyond key issues such as North Korea-US relations, party platforms differ little. Where they do, differences stem more from factional struggles than ideology. If conservatives say a cat is black, Democrats will insist it’s white – regardless of the truth. As for where Lee’s victory will take South Korea, that remains to be seen – stay tuned for the next article.",

    "title": "Ex-Trump advisor calls for seizure of US senator’s passport",
    "article_text": "US Senator Lindsey Graham should be thrown in jail or have his passport revoked for“stirring up”the Ukraine conflict, former adviser to President Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, has said. Bannon made the comment after Graham, along with US Senator Richard Blumenthal, visited Kiev last week. There they met with Vladimir Zelensky and discussed, among other things, additional sanctions on Russia and further cooperation between Ukraine and the US. Immediately after the visit Kiev lunched mass drone attacks on multiple Russian airfields, claiming to have damaged over 40 warplanes, including strategic bombers. Moscow has not confirmed the loss of any aircraft and claims to have shot down most of the drones. Bannon and other critics of US involvement in the Ukraine conflict have since speculated that Graham may have encouraged Zelensky to launch the“audacious”attack, which they claim could have led to a serious escalation, given that it targeted Russia’s strategic aviation. Speaking to NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo on Monday, Bannon claimed that by meeting with Zelensky, Graham was giving Ukraine“false hope false hope that we’re there to support them in engaging Russia in a kinetic conflict. “We are not,”Bannon stressed, adding that the US was getting“sucked”into the Ukraine conflict by people like Graham and could soon find it“tough”to get out. “We can’t have Lindsey Graham, and particularly Zelensky, leading us into a third world war with a deep strike into Russia,”Bannon insisted, suggesting that US authorities should either“cancel [Graham’s] passport and don’t let him back in the country, or put him in jail if he comes back.” Following Sunday’s attack, which targeted sites from Murmansk in the Arctic to Irkutsk in Siberia, a number of military experts pointed out that Kiev does not have the technical capability to conduct drone strikes that deep into Russian territory. Guillaume Ancel, a writer and former French army lieutenant colonel, told Le Monde that the attack is“possible and conceivable only with the support of a powerful satellite communications system,”based on intelligence provided by the US. Throughout the Ukraine conflict, Moscow has repeatedly described the hostilities as a Western proxy war against Russia and has condemned foreign military assistance to Kiev as counterproductive to the peace process.",

    "title": "EU to debate accelerating departure of Ukrainian immigrants – Euractiv",
    "article_text": "EU member states will consider what to do with the millions of Ukrainian immigrants currently in the bloc at an upcoming meeting, as a scheme used to skip normal asylum procedures winds down, Euractiv reported on Wednesday. Discussions on phasing-out the Temporary Protection Directive (TPD), alongside a broader review of the immigrants’ legal status in the EU, are expected to take center stage at the bloc’s upcoming Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on June 12–13. The debate comes as member states face mounting challenges in managing the large number of Ukrainian immigrants. As of March 2025, more than 4.3 million Ukrainians had received temporary protection in the EU, according to Eurostat. Although Brussels insists continued support is vital, several governments are reassessing how much assistance they can offer. Germany, which hosts over 1.2 million Ukrainians, has started cutting back welfare benefits, citing sustainability concerns. Poland, which has been one of Ukraine’s main backers since the escalation of the conflict with Russia, has resisted accepting more migrants under the EU’s proposed migration pact. Social tensions have been mounting in the country as some citizens reportedly perceive Ukrainian immigrants as freeloaders and potential criminals. Government data shows that at least 2.5 million Ukrainians reside in Poland, making up nearly 7% of the country’s population. Brussels activated the TPD shortly after the Ukraine conflict escalated in early 2022. First introduced in 2001, the directive provides a wide range of benefits, including residence permits, housing, access to jobs, education, healthcare, financial aid and social services. Although it was initially due to expire in March 2025, the scheme was extended until March 2026. According to Euractiv, talks on possible immigrant exit strategies were gaining momentum behind the scenes due to a“shifting geopolitical landscape.”The European Commission is reportedly assessing the legal framework and a new proposal is expected on Wednesday. More than 6.3 million Ukrainian immigrants have been registered across Europe, with another 560,000 living outside the continent as of April, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). “We are already on thin ice with the latest extension. A straightforward interpretation of the directive would mean that after three years it would lose its validity,”Martin Wagner, Senior Policy Advisor at the International Center for Migration Policy Development, said last month.",

    "title": "Popular weight loss drug raises risk of ‘silent’ cancer – study",
    "article_text": "Ozempic and similar weight loss medications may increase the risk of kidney cancer, according to a major study. However, the drugs reportedly lower the risk of more than a dozen other cancers, suggesting their overall benefit may still outweigh the hazards. A recent study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual conference in May found that people using popular weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic may have a higher risk of developing kidney cancer, the Daily Mail wrote on Tuesday. Researchers looked at the medical records from more than 86,000 patients in Florida over a ten-year period. They found 83 cases of kidney cancer among people taking weight loss drugs, compared to 58 cases in a similar group who were not taking them. The study showed a 33% higher chance of getting kidney cancer for users of these medications. The drugs are part of a group called GLP-1 drugs, which also includes Wegovy and others. Kidney cancer is known as a“silent”disease because it often causes no symptoms early on. By the time signs such as blood in the urine, back pain, or a lump appear, it may have already spread, making survival less likely. Dr. Hao Dai from Indiana University, who led the study, told the Daily Mail on Tuesday that the results do not prove the drugs cause kidney cancer, but he called the findings“concerning”and said more monitoring is needed. Although the risk of kidney cancer was seen to rise, the study also found that the same drugs may lower the chances of getting more than a dozen other cancers linked to obesity, including cancers of the uterus and ovaries. These results support earlier research. A 2023 study of 1.6 million people with diabetes found a 54% higher risk of kidney cancer among those using GLP-1 drugs compared to people using another diabetes medicine called metformin. Doctors believe the increased risk may be linked to side effects like vomiting and dehydration, which can hurt the kidneys. There is also a theory that the way these drugs work in the kidneys may affect how cells grow. Ozempic has also been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to help protect kidney function in people with Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. In those patients, the drug lowered the risk of serious kidney problems by 24%, according to research. Medical experts say more research is needed to better understand how these drugs affect long-term kidney health and cancer risk.",

    "title": "NATO summit to avoid Ukraine membership issue – AFP",
    "article_text": "NATO leaders convening for a key summit this month will deliberately avoid discussing membership for Ukraine, AFP reported on Wednesday, citing sources. The bloc’s members are reportedly wary of raising the issue due to fears it could exacerbate tensions between the EU and US. Members of the US-led military bloc are highly likely to“steer clear of its previous strong statements that Ukraine is on course to join the alliance”when the summit takes place in The Hague in late June, the agency said. One diplomatic source told AFP that the final declaration is expected to omit any mention of Ukrainian membership to maintain unity among member states.“There will be nothing on that,”a NATO diplomat said.“My expectation is we will be absolutely silent.” US President Donald Trump has expressed firm opposition to Ukraine’s bid to join NATO. In February, he suggested that Ukraine“can forget about NATO,”adding that Kiev’s bid was“probably the reason the whole thing started,”referring to the conflict with Russia. Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky is still expected to be present at the summit, but any formal talks between the bloc and Kiev are unlikely, AFP said.“It will be a PR disaster if he’s not there,”another diplomat told the agency. While NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has insisted that Ukraine remains a priority issue at the summit, AFP sources have painted a different picture. They suggested that the overwhelming emphasis will be on trying to satisfy Trump’s demands that member states drastically ramp up their defense spending. It“is the most important part and no one wants to jeopardize that,”the agency’s source said. Russia has stated that NATO membership for Ukraine is a red line and one of the key reasons for the conflict, insisting that Ukraine adopt a neutral status as a key condition for a lasting peace. While Trump administration officials have described NATO membership as“a bridge too far,”Kiev has refused to commit to neutrality or to refraining from hosting foreign troops on its soil, which Moscow also considers to be a red line.",

    "title": "UK pledges 100,000 new drones for Kiev",
    "article_text": "The UK has pledged to supply 100,000 new drones to Ukraine by April 2026, in addition to the 10,000 UAVs it sent last year. The announcement coincides with Britain’s newly unveiled Strategic Defense Review, which proposes steps to rearm its military in light of what it paints as a threat posed by Russia. London has allocated £350 million ($470 million) from its £4.5 billion Ukraine military package to fund new drone deliveries to Kiev, according to a government statement on Wednesday. UK Defense Secretary John Healey is expected to detail the initiative at the upcoming Ukraine contact group meeting in Brussels. “Ukraine’s Armed Forces have demonstrated the effectiveness of drone warfare,”London stated, admitting that Kiev’s demand for UAVs has provided a boost to the UK’s economy. It also unveiled plans to use Ukraine’s drone experience to train its own military. In order to“learn the lessons from Ukraine,”the UK would allocate over £4 billion for autonomous systems and drones for its armed forces. Ukraine has carried out drone attacks, including against civilian sites in Russia, since the escalation of the conflict in February 2022. The attacks have intensified since the renewal of peace talks between Moscow and Kiev in Istanbul. Russia has claimed that Kiev’s Western backers, particularly the UK, France, and Germany, arepushingdrone warfare in order to derail the talks and to serve their own political agendas. London framed its new Strategic Defense Review as“a message to Moscow,”declaring Britain is“ready to fight, if required.”The UK intends to spend £1.5 billion on new weapons plants, £6 billion on long-range arms, and £15 billion on nuclear warheads, among multiple other new expenses. Russia has repeatedly dismissed claims it plans to attack Western Europe as“nonsense,”accusing the West of using scare tactics to justify shifting public funds toward military spending. Moscow has warned that foreign involvement, including arms deliveries, would obstruct peace efforts and ultimately fail to stop Russia from reaching its military goals. Moscow has also criticized the UK’s and EU’s respective militarization drives, warning they risk triggering a broader conflict in Europe.",

    "title": "Arming Kiev could count as NATO defense spending – Euractiv",
    "article_text": "NATO members could formally include weapons supplies to Ukraine as part of increased defense budgets, according to a proposal cited by Euractiv on Tuesday. Members of the US-led military bloc have already provided hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of arms to Ukraine in what isincreasinglyrecognized as a Western proxy war against Russia. Under new proposals, Ukraine’s Western backers would be able to classify such deliveries as contributions to NATO’s collective security, five sources familiar with internal discussions told Euractiv. NATO leaders are expected to approve an increase in the bloc’s defense spending target for members – from the current 2% of GDP to 5% – during a summit scheduled for later this month in the Netherlands. Secretary-General Mark Rutte has reportedly suggested a“dual-track”system that would allow up to 1.5% of GDP to be spent on“defense-related”efforts such as cybersecurity and infrastructure upgrades. Funding directed to support Ukraine’s war with Russia could also be included in the category, Euractiv reported. According to the outlet, the proposed accounting shift is aimed at addressing criticism from US President Donald Trump, who has accused European nations of not carrying their fair share of the burden. The change could also give European NATO members greater flexibility to procure arms for Kiev directly from Ukrainian defense contractors, the report added. Multiple Western officials have publicly characterized the Ukraine conflict as a proxy war. Keith Kellogg, a special envoy on Ukraine policy under Trump,acknowledgedas much on Fox News on Sunday as he warned that actions such as the possible supply of German-made Taurus missiles to Kiev risked complicating any path to peace. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also used the term in February, with the Kremlin agreeing with his statements. The Trump administration has said it intends to walk away from the conflict if peace talks between Ukraine and Russia reach a dead end. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is not expected to attend a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday – the first such gathering the Pentagon wouldskip. The group was created three years ago to coordinate arms supplies to Kiev. Russian officials have accused European NATO members of encouraging a protracted conflict, referring to it as a“fight to the last Ukrainian.”They have stated a preference for achieving Moscow’s goals through diplomacy rather than military means.",

    "title": "Ukraine’s strikes on Russian airfields risk escalation – Trump envoy",
    "article_text": "The recent Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian airfields reportedly hosting nuclear-capable bombers sharply increase the risk of escalation, Keith Kellogg, US President Donald Trump’s special envoy, has warned. On Sunday, Kiev launched a drone raid targeting airfields in five regions, according to the Defense Ministry in Moscow. Officials in Kiev said that the attack was aimed at Russia’s strategic aviation. Ukrainian media reports claimed that the airfields house Russian Tu-95 and Tu-22M strategic bombers, as well as an A-50 early warning and control plane. Russian officials said that the“terrorist attack”was repelled with no casualties but that several aircraft caught fire. In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Kellogg suggested that the attack was upping the stakes in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.“The risk levels are going way up,”he explained.“When you attack an opponent’s part of their national survival system, which is their nuclear triad… that means your risk level goes up because you don’t know what the other side’s going to do.” The envoy also noted that he was particularly concerned by reports – which were not confirmed by Moscow – that Ukraine also struck the Northern Fleet headquarters in Severomorsk, which would have meant that two of the three legs of Russia’s nuclear triad were under attack. He added that when it comes to such kinds of attacks,“it’s not so much the damage you do on the triad itself… but it’s the psychological impact you have.”Ukraine, according to the envoy, also wanted to show that it could“raise the risk level to levels that are basically, to me, they've got to be unacceptable.” Earlier this week, the New York Times reported, citing sources, that Ukraine did not give advance notice to the US of the strikes, and that the two sides currently have no joint planning on operations inside Russian territory. NYT sources also believe that Moscow will mount“a significant retaliation,”although specifics are yet unclear. Following the attacks, Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who now serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, warned that a response was“inevitable.”",

    "title": "Ukraine would ‘suck up every euro’ as EU member – Hungary",
    "article_text": "Ukraine would be a huge drain on EU resources if it became a member of the bloc, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has warned. He accused officials in Brussels of attempting to force the issue despite the cost. Orban, a long-standing opponent of fast-tracking Kiev’s membership bid, launched a nationwide consultation in April asking Hungarians whether they wanted Ukraine to join the bloc. “For Brussels, Ukrainian accession is a vital issue: political damage control and good business in the midst of a losing war,”Orban wrote on Tuesday on Facebook, encouraging citizens to take part in the poll. ”But this business is going to cost European families,”he added.“Ukraine would suck up every euro, forint and zloty that we have spent on strengthening European families, European farmers and European industry.” Orban said he would“protect Hungary and the European Union from the Brussels fever dream of Ukrainian accession.” Ukraine declared joining the EU and NATO as strategic objectives following the 2014 Western-backed armed uprising in Kiev. Both blocs have publicly supported the efforts. The EU granted Ukraine candidate status in June 2022 after the escalation of its conflict with Russia earlier that year. Critics contend that the decision downplayed concerns about corruption and rule-of-law deficiencies in favor of sending a symbolic political message. Russia has identified Ukraine’s NATO ambitions as a key driver of the current hostilities. Russian officials also claim that the EU has evolved from an economic alliance into a military body comparable to the US-led NATO, which they view as a direct threat. EU leaders have been exploring ways tobypassHungary’s veto power on foreign policy decisions, including support for Ukraine. One reported proposal involves replacing unanimous decision-making with qualified majority voting. Other options described in the media include legallyredefiningactions such as weapons transfers to Kiev and sanctions on Russia as matters not requiring full consensus.",

    "article_text": "US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will not attend Wednesday’s Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels, the Pentagon has confirmed. It marks the first time the head of the Pentagon will miss a gathering of the group. The US has been the lynchpin of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which has provided Ukraine with around $126 billion in weapons and other military assistance since its inception in April 2022. Under former Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin, Washington also served as the group’s chair, with the secretary and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff attending its monthly meetings. However, Hegseth will not be present at the meeting of 50 defense ministers in Belgium, Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson confirmed, citing scheduling issues. At the same time, she stressed that“the United States is focused on ending the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible, on terms that establish an enduring peace.” An unnamed US official cited by AP also said Hegseth will not participate in the meeting remotely. According to Politico sources, US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker will represent Washington at the gathering, and Hegseth himself is slated to take part in a NATO meeting in Brussels on Thursday. Politico noted that Hegseth’s absence is yet another sign of“softening of the Trump administration’s relationship with Europe, and Ukraine.”Under Trump, Washington has not announced new military assistance for Ukraine. The Trump administration has increasingly urged EU governments to reduce their reliance on Washington and increase their military spending. Hegseth himself has been skeptical of the US involvement in the Ukraine conflict. In February, he said that returning Ukraine to its 2014 borders was“unrealistic”and that the country is unlikely to join NATO. Nevertheless, the Trump administration has positioned itself as the key mediator in the conflict, consistently pushing Russia and Ukraine to reach peace. Moscow has praised Washington’s efforts, saying the US better understands Russia’s key security concerns caused by Kiev’s desire to join NATO and the bloc’s creeping expansion towards Russian borders.",

The best golf shirts for men are way better than you remember. Only a few years ago, the averagepoloon the PGA Tour used to share more in common with a NASCAR racing suit than a shirt you'd actually want to wear at your local club. (Mortgage lending and insurance logos might pay the bills, but let's be real: Is there anything less cool?) Luckily, for those of us who aren't obligated to shill shady financial products while out sinking putts, there's beaucoup links-ready shirts available right now that look great while still delivering on everything you want from an on-course polo: movability, breathability, and—most important—head-turning style. If you’re in desperate need of a handful of tap-ins, the usual suspects have you covered. But if you really want to school the competition, there's an onslaught of upstart brands taking thegolfshirt to territory it's never been before. We're talking retro-inspired knits, boldly-printed button-ups, and plenty of other options to give you the confidence you need to at leastlooklike you’re about to go low. In other words, we're talking the absolute best golf shirts for men. What happens over the course of 18 holes is still on you, but at least you’ll be the best-dressed person in your foursome. For more intel on how to look fly at tee time, check out theGQ Golf Shop. Nike Golf Nike Material: Polyester |Sizes: XS to 4XL |Colors Available: 25+ Old faithful. The Nike Tour polo has been a mainstay in the golf world for years and remains one of the best picks if you’re looking for a well-fitting performance polo that simply goes with everything. The sweat-wicking Dri-FIT material needs no introduction at this point, but if you need a reminder: Dri-FIT set the standard for all performance materials. It’s the Kleenex of fitness fabrics: People say Dri-FIT to describe just about any fitness apparel, even if it’s notactuallya Nike shirt. You can never go wrong with the Nike Tour. Reigning Champ Nordstrom Material: Solotex mesh |Sizes: XS to 2XL |Colors Available: 7 Reigning Champ is the definition of refined performance. Pairing the best-of-the-best performance materials with timeless silhouettes, the brand has firmly entrenched itself at the intersection of style and engineering. The Solotex Mesh Tiebreak Polo fits the mold, blending one of the breeziest mesh fabrics out there with a simple, easy-wearing fit that is all in the details. Underarm gussets and semi-raglan sleeves allow for a wide range of movement, while metal-snap buttons give it an edge that most polos simply can’t come close to. You’ll fit in at the country club, but this ain’t no country club shirt. Vuori Vuori Material: Recycled Polyester |Sizes: 2XS to 3XL |Colors Available: 5 If you haven’t noticed by now, tennis polos and golf polos are birds of a feather. The Gamepoint Polo from Vuori is case-in-point. The 100% recycled performance material is moisture-wicking and stretchy, meaning you’re free to swing your swing even when the hottest days of summer take hold. The modern athletic fit is flattering on and off the course, and the simple colorways look good on anyone. Lululemon lululemon Material: Nylon, modal, elastane |Sizes: S to 2XL |Colors Available: 2 To the folks who say golf isn't a real sport: Explain these sweat stains. We like this polo because of its sweat-wicking abilities, which are especially helpful when you're baking under the sun in the middle of a summer heatwave. While it might notfeellike it's always working, rest easy knowing that other's won't be able to see the sweat, since the shirt was designed to get rid of the outward appearance of sweat. So while Bogey Bob's dripping from the pits because he forgot his deodorant this morning, you'll be looking cool and dry when you get your birdie. And for the days when you know it won't be that hot, Lululemon makes anEvolution polo, which is 10 bucks cheaper, although you lose the ability to hide your sweat (but it is anti-stink!). Lacoste Lacoste Material: Cotton, Elastane |Sizes: S to 4XL |Colors Available: Varies OK, so Lacoste may be more of a tennis brand, but like its preppy compatriots, the iconic Croc logo is no stranger to the golf course. The country club crossover just makes sense, and we still love the look now. The Contrast Collar Polo, specifically, feels like the ideal golf companion, adding a bit of sporty flair that separates it from the pack. The fit is flattering on any guy and sizes go all the way up to 4XL, so nobody is left out. Johnnie-O Johnnie-O Blending laid-back coastal aesthetics with detail-oriented performance design, Johnnie-O make some of the most easy-wearing, versatile polos in golf. The Performance Jersey Polo is made with a lightweight stretch jersey that lets you move freely on the course while also providing ample protection from the summer sun thanks to its UPF 50 rating. We also love its “Hangin’ Out” fit, which makes it easy to rock tucked-in or untucked. Radmor Radmor Made with organic Peruvian pima cotton, spandex, and Radmor’s RadCycled REPREVE, the Douglas Stadium Pique polo is the quintessential golf polo, blending equal parts style and performance. That’s what Radmor is all about: simple, stylish golf apparel that simply performs, no matter what. This shirt fits great, thanks to the brand’s clever extended range of motion design and with a UPF 35 rating, will protect you from the sun—something you can’t say for most cotton shirts. J. Lindeberg J. Lindeberg The Tour Tech Polo from J. Lindeberg is timeless, yes, but it wouldn’t be a J. Lindeberg piece without a splash of detail that sets it apart from the rest. A mini icon on the collar and embroidered logo on the sleeves give this shirt just enough of aje nais se quoisto stand out among the crowd of refined performance polos you’ll find on the course today. This is one of the more dialed-back efforts from the brand, making it a great addition to an existing golf wardrobe. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Whether you're getting ready for your NFL Draft debut or lacing up for the links, the moose has you covered. This performance polo—complete with a corny-fun “tee time” design—is sweat-wicking and breathable, leaving you stylish and dry on the course. Material: Golf shirts are crafted from a diverse range of materials, each offering distinct advantages. Cotton provides softness, breathability, and moisture-wicking properties, making it a solid choice for keeping you cool and dry on the links. Alternatively, polyester, a man-made fiber, is known for its strength, durability, and wrinkle resistance, making it a perfect option for lightweight and quick-drying golf shirts you can rock all summer. Some shirts are made with additional materials that add protection and comfort. Nylon, for example, is often incorporated for added protection against the elements. Spandex, thanks to its high elasticity and stretch, enhances comfort and flexibility in golf shirts, letting you swing your swing with no restriction. Finally, Merino wool, a natural fiber known for its softness, breathability, and moisture-wicking capabilities, is ideal for golf shirts because of its superior temperature regulation and comfort in various conditions. Style: When picking out a golf shirt, style is just as important as performance. In fact, we are probably more likely to roll up in the course in a shirt that looks good than we are in a performance polo—look good, play good, right? With that said, you have a ton of options when it comes to flexing your personal style on the course. Some shirts are designed with vintage 90s polos in mind, so they’ll be constructed with a boxier fit and (usually) longer sleeves alongside a deep button placket for maximum styling options. Others will be made more modern, with a slimmer fit and performance features. Those aren’t all stuffy picks, though, some performance shirts are just as stylish as their retro brethren. Others don’t resemble the golf shirts you know and love at all—they bring unique features to the links like zipper collars, patch pockets that resemble those on your mechanic’s favorite work shirt, or crazy designs that stand out from the pack. No matter what style you go for, we say pick the one that makes you feel like a pro, even if a pro would never actually wear it on the golf course. Special Features: As we’ve said, a number of polos out there are pretty simple, which isn’t always a bad thing. Sometimes, though, you need a bit more than the standard polo silhouette when you hit the links, whether for style reasons or performance reasons. Many performance brands enhance the fit with gusseted armpits, raglan sleeves, or other features that enhance your ability to move freely. Other shirts will have style features, like utilitarian snap buttons or a zipper collar instead of the standard button, or jacquard interspersed through the shirt for a texture change. Look closely at the pictures each brand throws up on the site and take a gander at the description—sometimes you’ll find a feature you wouldn’t see otherwise. With a solid crew of both new and lifelong golfers on staff, we’ve spent decades testing golf shirts, from actual early '90s polos we stole from our dads, '00s polos we copped in high school, and the modern performance shirts that dominated the scene throughout the 2010s. However, since we’re obsessive style vultures, we naturally dipped our toes into everything the last few years have brought to the scene, from soccer-inspired Blokecore polos to streetwear-inspired tees and tops to gorpcore crossovers from ACG and Adidas Adicross. We test them at the course, of course, but also at our local dive, on date night, and when we travel. In 2025, there’s no limit to where you can rock your golf gear.",

    "title": "12 Best Antiperspirants of 2025 to Stay Dry and Cool, Tested by Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The best antiperspirants are a far cry from the stuff that so many of us have used in the past. They've long been shadowed by that dreaded “A” word, aluminum, which clean beauty enthusiasts suggest you avoid so that you sweat and release toxins. Thoughdeodorantsthese days smell so good that they rival colognes, many of us just can't shake the deodorant funk—no matter how many times we try. Whether walking,running,lifting, or any other physical activity, many of us don't want sweat getting in the way. That's where the best antiperspirants come in. While no antiperspirant will stop sweat completely, it will reduce it significantly. We tested dozens to help find the best ones for your lifestyle, whether you need something for everyday use or a clinical-strength option. The antiperspirants here contain aluminum—still the gold standard in stopping sweat despite the stigma (which we'll address below)—but most importantly, theywork. Dove Amazon Main Ingredient:Aluminum SesquichlorohydrateApplication:StickConsistency:Solid For a reliable antiperspirant that checks all the boxes, Dove Men+Care is hard to beat. I wore it for a full day, and it kept me more than adequately dry, with a subtle scent that won't compete with your cologne. The formula uses aluminum sesquichlorohydrate (don't even try to pronounce it), but it's a milder aluminum compound ideal for those with sensitive skin who still want effective sweat protection. What also stands out is how soothing it feels and how smoothly it spreads on, thanks to the addition of moisturizing cream—it's like moisturizing your pits while keeping them dry. For an all-around reliable workhorse that's easy to find both in stores and online, this stick is your best bet for moderate sweat protection. Jack Black Nordstrom Main Ingredient:Aluminum ZirconiumApplication:StickConsistency:Solid An antiperspirant or deodorant should never outshine a great cologne, but Jack Black's new Reserve Collection is here to change that perception. Most antiperspirants have a somewhat artificial aroma—a chalky, chemical scent. However, Jack Black took a fresh approach by building a scent pyramid, like those found in colognes, into this stick. It opens with top notes of bergamot and citrus, transitions to heart notes of juniper and lavender, and finishes with woodsy base notes of amber and moss. But it's not just about fragrance—this stick delivers on performance, too. Aluminum zirconium, an industry standard, keeps you dry, while vitamin E provides antioxidant support, and aloe leaf soothes the skin. Certain Dri Amazon Main Ingredient:Aluminum ChlorideApplication:Roll OnConsistency:Liquid Rollerball applicators aren’t for everyone, but they offer a potent liquid formula that delivers immediate results. Think of it like your favorite perfume oil, but made for your armpits. A classic in this category is Certain Dri, widely available in most department stores and known for its prescription-level protection for serious sweat defense. Higher concentrations of aluminum chloride mean it should be applied sparingly, ideally before bed, to work overnight. (Avoid using right after a shower, as open pores can be sensitive and cause a burning sensation.) It is unscented and excels at blocking sweat, making it a top pick for anyone needing maximum protection. Old Spice Amazon Main Ingredient:Aluminum ChlorohydrateApplication:SprayConsistency:Liquid-Powder-ish that goes on dry Old Spice has been in the deodorant game longer than many of us, and for good reason—it’s a trusted classic that’s also known for innovation. Take their new dry spray, for example. This formula goes on instantly dry, leaving no running liquid behind—just a soft, talc-like coating under your arms. Aluminum chlorohydrate handles the heavy lifting for sweat-blocking, keeping you cool even during more intense activities. It’s refreshing and oddly satisfying to use, and I’d be remiss not to mention the scent: a blend of lemon, lime, and cedarwood. Toss this in your gym bag for freshening up before and after a workout. Gillette Walmart Main Ingredient:Aluminum ZirconiumApplication:StickConsistency:Gel If there were an award for iconic antiperspirant gels, Gillette would easily take the crown. They’ve been a top seller in that category, and for a good reason—besides the oddly oh-so-satisfying action of dialing the gel through the applicator grates. Their newest formula is a clear gel that leaves no stains or marks on clothing and prioritizes gentle ingredients. While gels aren’t always known for being the most effective at controlling body odor and wetness, this stick provided day-long protection (up to 72 hours) thanks to aluminum zirconium. It’s everything you want in a gel: refreshing upon application and keeping you odor-free and dry all day. Degree Amazon Main Ingredient:Aluminum SesquichlorohydrateApplication:StickConsistency:Solid One of the most common complaints about antiperspirants is that they can stain your shirts (a result of a chemical reaction between the aluminum and your sweat) and leave white residue on your clothes. Degree has tackled these issues head-on with their new UltraClear Stick. This formula applies clear as a solid, preventing white marks and yellow stains. I tested it on a black shirt—no trace left—and experienced the same stain-free results when wearing a white T-shirt. But the innovation doesn’t stop at stain prevention. It also features a proprietary formula with microcapsules that break as you move, releasing bursts of fragrance throughout the day. Great scent, no stains, and wetness protection—wins all around. Kiehl's Nordstrom Main Ingredient:Aluminum ChlorohydrateApplication:TubeConsistency:Cream Cool apothecary-style packaging? Check. Cream formulation? Check. And with Kiehl's delivering the antiperspirant solution? Absolutely. This unscented cream is excellent for sensitive skin, as fragrances can sometimes cause redness or irritation for those prone to it. The main ingredient is aluminum chlorohydrate, the gentler compound, and other natural ingredients like witch hazel for its soothing and astringent properties, plus orange, lemon, and linseed extracts. Don't let the natural deodorant vibes fool you—this cream performs. Micro-sized drying molecules that absorb moisture keep you dry while the cream softens your skin. Duradry Amazon Main Ingredient:Aluminum SesquichlorohydrateApplication:WipeConsistency:Damp and quick drying Durady is a relative newcomer to the underarm scene and has garnered buzz for its transparent ingredients, bold red packaging, and efficacy. While their stick antiperspirant is popular, their unique wipes deserve recognition here (I didn’t know they existed before this research, either). Like other clinical-strength products, apply these to your hands, feet, or underarms before bed. Aluminum sesquichlorohydrate is the leading player here, while other agents tackle odor and condition the skin. Wash off in the morning, apply deodorant, and you’ll notice reduced underarm sweat from the get-go. These unscented wipes are super convenient and great for an easy-to-apply-anywhere on-the-body application. Arm & Hammer Amazon Arm & Hammer may be famous for baking soda-infused kitchen products, but their deodorants are also staples at this point. This unscented stick delivers on being fragrance-free, making it great for those with sensitive skin or anyone who prefers to let their natural scent—or cologne—take center stage. Plus, it's hard to beat the value. Arm & Hammer deodorants are surprisingly effective and often the most budget-friendly option at the drugstore or when bought in bulk on Amazon. Mitchum Amazon If you're after a more cooling feel but prefer the ease of a solid formula, Mitchum's invisible solid is a \"solid\" option. Mitchum has been a trusted name for years, and for good reason—it simply works. Their triple-action formula sounds gimmicky, but it uses aluminum zirconium to keep you dry and fresh. Plus, it does an effective job of tackling odor without leaving behind any residue. It's reliable, affordable, and an excellent option for minimal sweaters when you don't want to consider too many choices. SweatBlock Amazon A doctor developed this antiperspirant for those needing maximum clinical strength protection against hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) and nervous or hormonal sweating. It’s not an everyday go-to; it’s a pre-treatment that provides up to seven days of dryness from just one application. Apply it to your underarms before bed, let it dry, and work overnight before washing it off in the morning and applying deodorant. SweatBlock uses the strongest available formulation of aluminum chloride, making it your best bet for long-lasting, heavy-duty protection against serious sweating. Carpe Amazon Carpe burst onto the underarm scene with tons of hype, thanks to its trendy packaging and game-changing presence in the niche deodorant world. But it’s not just about optics—the dermatologist-approved brand delivers on effectiveness. Aluminum sesquichlorohydrate is the main active ingredient, but what really sets it apart is its lotion-like texture. It feels more like applying a luxe moisturizer to your underarms than an antiperspirant. The formula is non-greasy, quick-drying, and soft, with a slightly more viscous texture than traditional creams. There are a few key things to consider when looking for the best deodorant antiperspirant. Do you need an all-day performer or a tougher formula to prevent sweat? Do you prefer a roll-on or a spray? Solid or gel? Walmart brand or boutique DTC? Different types of aluminum have varying strengths, and some brands use unique blends of ingredients to aid in smoothness and efficacy. But no matter your needs, most people agree on a few basics. According to Jani Friedman, general manager of personal care at Foundry Brands, most folks should consider \"a smooth application, lightweight & non-greasy formula, dermatologist-tested, and free of stuff like parabens and phthalates. And don't forget to pick a scent you like!\" Here, we break down the basics: Active Ingredients:Let's address the elephant in the room—aluminum. Most effective antiperspirants rely on aluminum compounds because they're a proven solution for blocking sweat glands and reducing perspiration. And, while aluminum sometimes gets a bad rap, we might want to relax a little for now. Friedman notes, “While some worry that aluminum might enter the bloodstream through sweat glands and cause health issues, there's no conclusive evidence to support this.” However, we do want to consider the type of aluminum used for effectiveness and irritation levels. Common compounds include aluminum chloride, chlorohydrate, zirconium, and sesquichlorohydrate. Though offered over-the-counter, aluminum chloride is often found in clinical-strength antiperspirants because of its powerful sweat-blocking, though it can be more irritating for sensitive skin. Aluminum chlorohydrate is milder and ideal for everyday use. Aluminum zirconium offers strong protection with less irritation, and Aluminum sesquichlorohydrate balances effectiveness and gentleness, making it suitable for sensitive skin or daily wear. Of course, if you're not interested in aluminum-based antiperspirants, there are plenty of aluminum-free deo alternatives out there, but they may not be as effective. Application/Consistency:Consistency is key in antiperspirants, and application style is a highly personal factor. Solid sticks remain the most popular choice, with brands refining formulas to be lightweight, non-greasy, and non-staining and most with a dry, powdery feel post-application. Cream or lotion-based antiperspirants provide moisturizing and smoothness and are great for sensitive skin. Roll-ons glide smoothly for even coverage and dry pretty quickly, while sprays are quick-drying, ideal for larger areas, and targeted for on-the-go. Gels deliver a cool, smooth application that dries clear. Even antiperspirants follow trends, with all-over body options like wipes gaining traction. As Friedman notes, \"While antiperspirants are most commonly used for underarms, more people are becoming aware of products that help reduce sweating all over the body.\" Skin Sensitivity:Those with sensitive skin should pay close attention to antiperspirant labels. When possible, look for \"hypoallergenic\" options free from harsh ingredients that might trigger reactions. Avoid alcohol, which can cause skin irritation. Instead, opt for fragrance-free formulas or whole body deodorants with soothing, moisturizing creams or lotions for odor control. Also, look for Aluminum chlorohydrate or sesquichlorohydrate, which are generally gentler among the compounds. This antiperspirants guide is a testament to years of research—a.k.a. wearing antiperspirant—and rigorous hands-on testing.

    "title": "How to Use a Foam Roller, According to Experts",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Foam rollers are everywhere these days—at thegym, under your desk, collecting dust under thesofa—but does anyone actually know how to use a foam roller? Done well, foam rolling can ease tightness, increase blood flow, and help you move more freely before or after aworkout. Done poorly, it just feels like a painful waste of time. To figure out how to actually make foam rolling effective, I talked to two experts:James Chung, DPT, a sports physical therapist and strength coach atMotivNYin New York City, andAustin Martinez, CSCS, vice president of training and experience atStretchLab. From how long to roll to which muscles to target (and which ones to skip), they broke down what matters, what doesn’t, and why foam rolling isn’t just about pain tolerance—it’s about purpose. Whether you're using it torecoverfrom a tough training session, loosen up before a lift, or just take the edge off from sitting all day, this guide will help you get more from your foam roller with a lot less guesswork. Think of foam rolling as a reset button for your muscles—not a magic fix, but a quick way to reduce tension, restore mobility, and get blood flowing to the areas that need it most. It works through pressure, not intensity: you’re helping the tissue release and recalibrate, not forcing it into submission. Reducing muscle tension is the primary purpose of foam rolling, according to Martinez. “Because you’re applying pressure to that muscle tissue, you’re breaking up any adhesions that might be within,” he says. These adhesions, he explains, are like tiny sticky glue spots that build up in the muscle tissue over time. “If you have so many of these adhesions, it restricts your mobility, it restricts your flexibility and your movement patterns.” Foam rolling helps break them up, giving the muscle fibers a chance to realign properly, which can improve mobility and help restore more natural movement patterns. If you’re feeling unusually stiff in your hips or shoulders, it could be the result of adhesions limiting how well the muscle can lengthen and contract. Martinez adds that circulation is another key benefit: “It’s going to promote blood flow and circulation into those areas, which can be really beneficial to get new oxygen, nutrients to that muscle tissue.” Chung emphasized that the relief people feel from foam rolling is often less about structural change and more about sensory feedback. “You do get a very temporary reduction in pain and temporary change in sensation, which is enough to increase performance if somebody is limited by the presence of some of those negative sensations,” he says. In practice, that might mean using a roller on your quads or glutes before a lower-body workout to improve range of motion, or targeting your back and lats at the end of the day to reset posture and release tension. It’s not a fix-all, but when used consistently and strategically, foam rolling can be a valuable part of a well-rounded movement or recovery routine. Foam rolling isn’t complicated, but it’s easy to make it less effective if you rush through it, zone out, or target the wrong areas. These are the biggest mistakes experts see—and how to avoid them. Foam rolling isn’t about racing back and forth over a muscle. The real benefit comes from applying sustained pressure to tight areas, not quickly moving over them. Chung recommends finding a tender spot and holding pressure there instead of constantly rolling. “If you spend more time holding a pressure point instead of just rolling, you get a lot more relief,” he says. Like anything else in fitness, foam rolling only works if you’re consistent. “A big misconception is, ‘I'm going to only foam roll when I'm sore, when I feel like I need it,’” Martinez says. “But we know that recovery is best done all the time—especially when you don’t need it.” Making it a regular habit can help prevent that sore, tight feeling from building up in the first place. Foam rolling should target muscle and fascia—not bones, ligaments, or joints. “Stay over the muscle tissue, not trying to roll over bone or ligaments or anything of that nature because one, there's really no benefit, and two, it's going to be painful,” Martinez says. Stick to soft tissue areas like calves, quads, glutes, and lats. More pressure doesn’t always mean more benefit. “You can actually get more relief if you find a level of intensity you can breathe through,” Chung says. Applying a tolerable amount of pressure—not overwhelming force—helps send a signal to your nervous system that it\u0000’s safe to relax, which can lead to better release and recovery. There’s no “right way” to foam roll, but a few expert-backed techniques can make a big difference in how effective it actually is. Whether you're using it to warm up, cool down, or break up stiffness after a long day, these tips will help you get more out of every session. Think of pre-workout foam rolling as prep work: You’re getting blood flowing and priming your muscles for movement. “With your foam rolling before, it can be quicker movements,” says Martinez. Rather than stopping on tender spots, “you’re kind of scanning across the entire muscle,” he says, adding that it’s going to help increase blood flow and prime the muscle. He recommends combining this with with some dynamic stretching to really prep your system for movement. Post-workout, the goal shifts to recovery. Martinez recommends slowing down and spending more time on any tight or tender spots. “Now I’m really looking at breaking up adhesions that I built in through the workout, reducing muscle tension, increasing circulation at a deeper level,” he says. He suggests focusing on specific sections of a muscle—“break it up into threes,” he says—rather than rushing through the whole length. Foam rolling isn’t just about fitness—it’s also a way to learn how your body feels. “In your first few sessions, just focus time on learning your body,” says Martinez. “Are there areas that have a general sense of tension or pain or discomfort? That’s maybe where you hold your stress.” Once you notice those patterns, you can tailor your routine to the areas that need more attention. Chung emphasizes that the goal isn’t to grind into your muscle—it’s to create a release. “If you find a space that feels sensitive and you apply pressure that feels tolerable and hold it there for about two minutes, you get a lot more relief when you take that pressure out,” he says. Sustained pressure, paired with calm breathing, signals to your nervous system that the sensation isn’t threatening—helping the muscle let go. You can use a foam roller on most major muscle groups, but some areas tend to deliver more noticeable benefits—especially if you're looking to ease everyday tension or improve your movement patterns. Here’s where Martinez recommends focusing. “There’s great research out there that a good majority of the back problems and the hip problems we all deal with today really stem from our foot and how our feet move,” says Martinez. That’s why he recommends starting with the soles of your feet and calves. These lower-body areas often impact alignment and mobility further up the chain. “Whether you’re talking the big glute max or the smaller muscles like the glute medius or piriformis,” Martinez says, “these areas are really central to how we move—and how we compensate when something else is off.” Foam rolling your glutes can help counteract the effects of prolonged sitting or heavy lower-body training. Martinez suggests targeting the front and back of your thighs in sections rather than trying to roll the entire length at once. “I can kind of maneuver and manipulate that foam roller over different parts of my body,” he says, noting that scanning through the quads, hamstrings, and calves helps identify where tension lives. You can roll the upper back to release the muscles along the spine and reset posture after hours at a desk. But Martinez cautions against foam rolling bones or joints, which includes the spine. “Stay over the muscle tissue,” he says. “Not trying to roll over bone or ligaments or anything of that nature, because one, there’s really no benefit, and two, it’s going to be painful.” What is foam rolling good for? Foam rolling helps reduce tension, improve circulation, and support smoother movement. “You’re breaking up adhesions and you’re reducing any tension built up in the muscle,” says Martinez. Over time, this can help restore natural movement patterns and ease tightness that restricts flexibility and range of motion. It can also help with recovery. “Foam rolling is a great way to get temporary relief and temporary change in sensation,” says Chung, “which is enough to increase performance if somebody is limited by the presence of some of those negative sensations.” How do I use a foam roller? Start with light pressure and the right tool for the area—larger rollers for thighs and back, smaller rollers or trigger point balls for feet and calves. “The easiest way is usually making sure you’re propping yourself up, so the affected limb is on the foam roller and the other limb is off to the side,” says Martinez. From there, you can “stack” by adding a limb or lowering your body closer to the roller to increase pressure. That could look like placing a foam roller under the calf of an extended leg and then crossing the other leg on top to add additional weight and pressure. And remember: Don’t rush. “If you spend more time holding a pressure point instead of just rolling, you get a lot more relief,” says Chung. How effective are foam rolling workouts? Martinez says results can be surprisingly quick. “It wouldn’t really be unrealistic to see results within your first few sessions.” But he adds that the biggest changes early on are neurological, not physical: “The main results you’re going to see… are not necessarily physical adaptations to the muscle tissue, but rather neurological adaptations from your brain.” In other words, your body becomes more tolerant of the pressure, and your nervous system starts to interpret the sensation as less threatening. That shift alone can help you feel looser and move more freely—even before any structural changes occur in the muscle tissue. Over time, though, with regular use, foam rolling can help your muscles feel more pliable, improve body awareness, and increase your tolerance to pressure—making movement more fluid and less restricted. Foam rolling isn’t a cure-all—but when used intentionally, it can be a powerful tool for moving better, recovering faster, and feeling stronger in your body. Whether you're loosening up tight hips after sitting all day or prepping your muscles before a workout, it’s less about doing it perfectly and more about building a habit that works for you. Start slow. Listen to your body. And stick with it. The results build over time—and so does the way you feel.

You might’ve heard whispers that Speedos aremaking some inroadsamong straight men. It's still early in swimsuit season, so IRL evidence is light on the ground—but where there’s smoke, there’s Lycra-wrapped fire. And if swim briefs (their government name) have caught your eye, we’re here to help you go from Quietly Intrigued to F*ck It, I’m Game. If this is your first foray into the Speedo Zone, a few pieces of advice. A longer outseam (swim briefinseamsare all none-inches long) translates to a higher rise covering more of the land between junk and navel. Dark solid colors are fairly demure, while bright solid colors and patterns will show the contours of your junk. Avoid nude tones unless you’re intentionally aiming for Ken cosplay. Rick Owens SSENSE Martine Rose SSENSE Beyond that, once you survey the landscape, and you’ll see a lot of variation in the Speedo genre. If you’re looking for something with both attitude and sophistication, the pinstripedOur Legacy Workshop x Emporio Armani Pyla Briefsbring both to the table. Bode enters the chat with a ’50s-inspired numberthat your swarthy, thinly-mustached grandpa would’ve loved. If you’re on the hunt for something with a similarly long-ish outseam but a little more showmanship, theRick Owens Champion Edition Jersey Swim Briefsoffer up a suggestive drawstring and a little extra hip coverage. Meanwhile, for the price of one (1) breakfast burrito on DoorDash, you could go Full Goggins and wear the exact sameSpeedo Fitness 2” Solar Briefsthat theWhite Lotusstar wore on arecent coverofCulturedmagazine while making the Internet all sweaty. Go Skittles mode and grab a variety of colors.

Or while on a stunning Mediterranean vacation, amongst Speedo believers and blindingly pale Germans. Really, though, the most important choice when wearing a Speedo-style bathing suit is how you’ll play it. As one woman told GQ, “Fit is crucial but it’s also the energy: super secure in his masculinity and has zero issue if the bros rib him.’” Act cool, and the world will act cool with you.

    "title": "George Clooney Is Hiding His ‘Really Bad’ Broadway Dye Job Under a Baseball Hat",
    "article_text": "“I’m wearing a hat to hide my bad hair,”George Clooneyjoked during his appearance onLate Night with Seth Meyerson Monday. Moments earlier, the actor—whose gray hair has been his sex-symbol calling card for decades—strolled on stage wearinghis usual no-frills suitwith an uncharacteristically casual baseball cap. Underneath the hat lurked a blackish-brown dye job required for his Tony-nominated role in the Broadway production ofGood Night, and Good Luck. In the play, Clooney portrays CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow, who wore his dark brown hair with a deep side part, during the McCarthy era. “I’m wearing a hat to hide my bad hair,” George Clooney told Seth Meyers on Monday. “It’s bad. It’s still dark on top, but it’s gray at the bottom,” Clooneytold Meyers, lamenting that since last dyeing his hair two months ago, he’s now in the dreaded grow-out phase. “It really looks bad. It looks like [I’m] going through some horrible midlife crisis. I’m 64—midlife is a little stretch.” “It looks great on stage,” countered Meyers. “Sure,” replied Clooney, rolling his eyes. He admitted that his wife, Amal Clooney, “thinks it’s funny. She’ll be glad when it’s gone.” Clooney, pictured here with Harvey Fierstein, wore the same hat to a Tony nominees luncheon last month. Nonetheless, it was useful context as to why the actor has been wearing this same gray baseball cap, which appears to be a custom piece ofGood Night, and Good Luckmerch featuring a cartoonish animal logo (asilver fox, perhaps?) and the play’s name stitched in red above the back closure. Earlier this week, he wore the cap to dinner with Amal and U2’s Bono at the Polo Bar in Manhattan; last month, he wore it to a Tony nominees luncheon. Despite the acclaim—andrecord-breaking box-office returns—the show has awarded him, Clooney said he’s prepared to buzz off the dye job onceGood Nightcloses with a final matinee on Sunday, just hours ahead of the Tony Awards ceremony. (In the 2005 film version ofGood Night, and Good Luck, which the actor directed and co-wrote, a younger Clooney played Fred W. Friendly, Murrow’s co-producer.) At the very least, the hair has remained a reliable talking point for the actor throughout the show’s limited run. Clooney—and his uncharacteristically dark coiffure—onstage during opening night of Broadway'sGood Night, And Good Luckon April 3. “My wife is going to hate it because nothing makes you look older than when an older guy dyes his hair,” Clooneytold theNew York Timesin February, adding, “My kids are going to just laugh at me nonstop,” referring to the couple’s seven-year-old twins, Alexander and Ella. “I’m not used to it. You never get used to it,” he told Gayle KingonCBS Morningsin April. “Listen, I startedgetting graywhen I was 25, so I’ve been gray most of my life. So it’s not my favorite look.”",

    "title": "26 Best Jewelry Brands for Men 2024, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The best men's jewelry brands prove there’s never been so many options for fellas looking to flex some gems. As someone who’s started to consistently rock abraceletandhoop earringmyself for the past year, it’s a wave I’ve been happily swept up in—and after a few months spent cautiously, then confidently shining, the appeal of a category I ignored for far too long suddenly makes total sense. Because I increasingly only want to wear my unassuming basics every day, having a couple of glinty bits on me at all times communicates effort, even if I truly just threw on the nearest items of clothing before rushing out the door. Additionally, as someone who loves to know the stories behind the things they own, I’ve loved how most pieces of jewelry are accompanied bya clear explanation of their origin—whether it’s a ring that replicates the flow of a stream near the designer’s childhood home, or a necklace inspired by Roman medallions. Wearing something when you know the story behind it just means more, and that gravitas can ground an entire fit. Of course, there’s also the heirloom element. Unlike clothing fabrics that weaken over time, 925 sterling silver and gold can be endlessly returned to their original polish, while necklaces, rings, earrings and bracelets can all be adjusted to suit any wearer you might one day wish to pass your piece onto. The universe of jewelry options available to men has never been so crowded, so to help you make sense of it all, I’ve narrowed it down to the designers you need to know right now—from the more wallet-friendly upstarts to the wedding day-worthy jewelry wizards. If you’re new to the jewelry game, chances are you’ll want to keep costs down. The good news is that there are many approachably-priced pieces that are good-enough quality to be worn for years to come. That’s where the affordable stalwarts excel. Because they work at a scale that allows them to keep prices lower, they can offer long-lasting designs in fine materials, miraculously often for under $100. Austin McMahon createdMaplein 2014 with the guiding focus of being a “culturally-relevant” men’s jewelry brand. That desire manifests in his satisfying cultural references, including rings inspired by theGrateful Dead’s bearand theNirvana's smiley face logo. Because Maple uses recycled silver, all of its designs feel a touch edgier and heftier. Maple SSENSE Maple SSENSE Over the past decade,Mejurihas become the first name in premium, handcrafted jewelry sold at a mostly-approachable price point. “Everyday fine jewelry” is the idea, and that’s exactly what you’ll find—elevated designs, often available in either sterling silver or gold, that are still simple and comfortable enough to throw on every day and match with your existing wardrobe. Maple Mejuri Mejuri Mejuri Conceived for the guy who doesn’t wear jewelry (sound like you?) Miami-basedMiansaiis affordable, understated, and incredibly easy to wear. That three-part formula enabled it to recently celebrate fifteen years in business, and while new designs drop regularly, many of its very first pieces—likescrew cuffsand cuban bracelets—remain among the brand’s most popular. Miansai Miansai Miansai Miansai If you’re looking to flex on ‘em without emptying your wallet, look no further thanJaxxon. The Odell Beckham-backed jewelry brand offers all manner of iced-out chains and bracelets for maximalists—all made in Italy. Jaxxon Jaxxon Jaxxon Jaxxon Of course, there are the designers who have kept fine jewelry top of mind for almost two centuries. The designers whose names alone are often used as a stand-in for the entire jewelry industry—and who, in some cases, can lay claim to an entire color (a ruby red box, say, or a signature robin-egg blue that earned its ownWikipedia page.) You see their names almost daily in magazines and billboards, but sometimes that intense exposure is enough to make you forget there are some pretty special pieces lining their shelves. Consider this your reminder. The nameDavid Yurmanmay now be synonymous with simple, fine jewelry, but its founder took plenty of divergent roads to get there—first as a 1960s traveling Beatnik, then as an apprentice under various sculptors throughout the 1960s. In the seventies, however, he and his co-founder (and wife) turned their attention to jewelry, and the rest is American craft history. David Yurman David Yurman David Yurman David Yurman Founded in Paris in 1847, we haveCartierto thank for watches. Like,literal watches. In 1903, Louis Cartier created what is thought by many to be the first wristwatch, and since then, the ‘Maison’ has been adorning men the world after with exceptionally-crafted, instantly-recognizable pieces, designed to be passed down time and again. While you may be able to picture a Tank, Santos, and Ballon Bleu from their names alone, their non-horological pieces may have escaped your attention. Cartier Cartier Cartier Cartier Because it’s so known as the place to go for the ladies in your life, the fact thatTiffanyalso makes plenty of pieces for him is often overlooked. But they do! From pendants to rings and embossed cuff bracelets, the Tiffany men’s line is designed with all the same care and quality materials as the rest of the collection (which, for what it’s worth, is plenty worth perusing too.) The brand’s menswear chops were recently boosted even further by the release, this year, of a jewelry line with Pharrell Williams, consisting of sixteen pieces featuring plenty of spikes, pearls, and punky reverse-set diamonds. Tiffany Titan by Pharrell Williams Tiffany Tiffany Titan by Pharrell Williams Tiffany One of the most refreshing developments in both men’s and women’s jewelry in recent years has been a newfound appreciation for asymmetry, odd forms, contrasting gems, matte finishes, and altogether off-kilter creations. Dissatisfied by the options available to them as they learned their trade, these kooky craftsmen launched their brands with a nothing-to-lose, iconoclastic spirit that, viewed together today, has grown into something of a baying army of boundary-pushers. For a decade, London designerRosh Mahtanihas earned a beloved following for her “talismans of strength and courage.” Inspired initially by Dante Alighieri’sThe Divine Comedy, gold classical medallions are naturally some of her most popular pieces (right on time forthisGladiatorfall) but newer designs like the poet’s necklace, which fits any red carpenter’s pencil, show a designer continuing to play around. Alighieri SSENSE Alighieri SSENSE Beepy Bella’suniverse is pure whimsy, all the way down to the cursor that follows you across her website. Founded in New York City by Isabella Lalonde, Beepy’s world includes more than just jewelry—there’s handbags, tops, even “mystery boxes”—but for guys, Lalonde’s rings and bracelets are your best way into wonderland. Beepy Bella Beepy Bella Beepy Bella Beepy Bella Be gone, muted rubies and clear crystals!Bleue Burnham’sjoyous, kaleidoscopic designs always prioritize bright green, pink and yellow gems over your more traditional, humble stones, which is why their designs shine perhaps the brightest of this entire new crop of playful, less self-serious men’s jewelry. Generosity is the energy here: single rings are crowded with diamonds and pearls that evoke a floral bouquet—something the brand played upon when opening their Harrod’s space, where customers received a bunch of flowers with every purchase. Bleue Burnham SSENSE Bleue Burnham SSENSE Based on the English coast, but increasingly popular across the Atlantic—with a full supply at SSENSE and recent pop-up atNew York City's Colbo—Toby Vernon'sThe Ouzetakes all the crowded jewel joys of Bleue Burnham, above, but scatters them a little more casually. The same approach is taken to the silver, which is left raw, rather than shined. Safe to say, these bright, scuffed wonders balance confident shine and humble texture perfectly. The Ouze SSENSE The Ouze SSENSE While Beepy Bella’s sizes still skew smaller,Éliou—started by two childhood best friends with similarly playful aesthetics—has an entire, larger-sized men’s category to help you find the style you really like best. If you need some proof that their juice is worth the squeeze, consider that Harry Styles himself—a man who’s guided more men into jewelry than most—wears a custom necklace from the indie brand. Éliou SSENSE Éliou SSENSE TheSantangeloaesthetic is a favorite of glossy editorial spreads, but its ethos can be distilled to one word: summer. Founder Anna Santangelo has always spent hers clubbing and surfing in California and Sydney, and her materials reflect that: expect plenty of pearls, shells, glass beads and stones, all handmade in New York City. Santangelo Santangelo Santangelo Santangelo As much as I can appreciate a kooky charm or two, not all of the independent studios are focused on breaking the mold in such an eye-catching way. In fact, the below crop of craftspeople have earned devoted followings for the way they ever so subtly elevate simple-seeming pieces, whether with an unusual choice of charm, slightly oversized links, or with a single touch of whimsy mixed into otherwise seriously high quality, stripped back materials. Personally, most of the male-identifying jewelry wearers I know are currently shopping this category more than any other, and I can report that they’ve been satisfied to find long-lasting pieces that are deeply special to them and those who notice, but can just as easily fly under the radar—or a shirtsleeve—when appropriate. Founded in Stockholm fifteen years ago by two best friends,All Bluesnow shares a block in the Swedish capital with Louis Vuitton and Gucci. Still, the designers know that their success has comebecauseof their playful, independent mindset (a collection inspired by a failed omelet was one early success) and so they continue to play with forms and materials today, albeit in a quieter way than the brands above. All Blues All Blues All Blues All Blues There’s a stillness and sense of play toBunney’shand-crafted unisex pieces. Take their animal charms, which can fasten to any necklace you have, or the delightful trompe l’oeil belt ring which, while certainly an investment, will delight hundreds if not thousands of people lucky enough to dine across from you over the course of your lifetime. Bunney Bunney Bunney Bunney Gottlobis currently offering a pretty unique proposition—a bracelet with real soul, for under $100. Made by hand in Cologne, Germany, the repeating-beads jewelry is newly stocked at venerable menswear boutiques, including Neighbour in Vancouver and Nitty Gritty in Stockholm, two ofGQ’sfavorite clothing stores in the world. Gottlob Gottlob Gottlob Gottlob Work around fashion editors, and you’ll hearSophie Buhai’sname mentioned time and again—often after a compliment has been paid to some earrings, a ring, or a necklace. Buhai—who, outside of her own line, also lent her talents to Lemaire when they wanted to launch their own jewelry line—makes pieces that can wear just as well with jeans and sweaters as evening attire, which is why fellas shouldn’t overlook her collections either. Sophie Buhai SSENSE Sophie Buhai SSENSE Established in Bali in 1975,John Hardy'sjewelry is a enjoyable mix of evocative, nature-minded symbols and pared-down designs. Essentially, this is the luxury jewelry brand for those who want their adornments to have a little more soul, a little less shine. Not to mention the fact it's all handcrafted, something you can only really appreciate once it's in (or on) your hands. John Hardy John Hardy John Hardy John Hardy There’s a difference between your everyday silver andgold chainsand the rings and bracelets that get passed down through generations. If you’re here to make an investment in the family jewels—but still want to do so with a new crop of designers—the brands below are here to help you do just that. Lewis Hamilton, Jacob Elordi, and Brad Pitt have all been featured in GQ’s pages wearing pieces fromBernard James. While his designs tend to sell out fast, I’m happy to note that the ‘Flora’ series—inspired by the Brooklyn Botanical Garden—is stocked, and special. Bernard James Bernard James Bernard James Bernard James Perennial A-list favoriteFoundraeis best known for its handmade, 18-karat gold medallions—and for good reason, they’re beauties—but the collection also includes intricately detailed signet rings, necklaces and bracelets, all featuring strength and wisdom-related iconography from a whole range of different cultures and time periods. Foundrae Foundrae Foundrae Foundrae Tanzanite, Purple Sapphire, Tsavorite, Morganite, Garnet, and Aquamarine, all on one 14K gold bracelet? For identical twin designers Dynasty & Soull Ogun, that’s just another day at the office. Because everything’s made to order by hand, shoppers can also choose the exact gemstones they want in almost any design, be it the charming sub-$175 cuff below, or the aforementioned show-stopping tennis bracelet. L’Enchanteur L’Enchanteur L’Enchanteur L’Enchanteur GoldsmithJean Prounismakes her semi-matte fine jewelry the same way the Greeks made theirs 5,000 years ago—using a pure blend of just three metals: fine silver, copper, and 22-karat gold. Prounis is Greek, and it isn’t just her process that’s inspired by her heritage, but also the style of her pieces: weighty, classically-sized gemstones sit inside hefty 22-karat gold casings, while she recently sourced some rare Greek ceruleite to make a truly one-of-one necklace whose future owner I already envy. Prounis Prounis Prounis Prounis While the variety of new aesthetics in men’s jewelry is thrilling, it would be wrong not to acknowledge—nay, honor—the kind of designs that men have been wearing for decades. The thick skulls, dog tags, and revolutionary-minded creations that convey that the wearer believes life is about gathering stories, forming alliances, and living just a little more fearlessly. These pieces may have a little less shine, but boy do they make up for it in grit. Even if you haven’t seen its stores in New York or LA, you’ve probably been in the presence of TheGreat Frog’s jewelrycountless times over the course of your life. That’s because before many of the above brands came along, The Great Frog was the first stop on any men’s jewelry retail mission. Made in London since 1972, TGF’s designs are not for the faint of heart, but if you’re confident enough to rock skulls—winged, snaked, or otherwise—this is my recommendation for where to get ‘em. The Great Frog The Great Frog The Great Frog The Great Frog Rapper turned jeweler Johnel Jamison—also known asJohnny Nelson—delivers awe-inspiring designs that honor Black icons of the not-too-distant past, from Harriet Tubman and Shirley Chisholm to Easy-E and ODB. Some rings—like his Mount Rushmore series, below—even feature four such figures together. All are made to order, carefully by hand, in New York City. Johnny Nelson Johnny Nelson Johnny Nelson Brooklyn’sMartine Alidraws on references from ‘90s grunge and early 2000s hip-hop to make her punchy Cuban link chains, dog tags and chokers, but these aren’t the knockoff Y2K pieces crowding Depop.

Martine Ali SSENSE Martine Ali SSENSE Hailing from Norway,Tom Woodis best known for its gem-inlaid signet rings, which pack a similar punch to The Great Frog’s wares. (Not only are they made with solid 925 sterling silver, but they’re also plated with white rhodium to prevent tarnishing and keep you shining for longer.) While I’d encourage you to assess the full range from all of the brands on this list, sometimes you just want to know what a brand does that you can’t find elsewhere—and with Tom Wood, it’s the seamlessly-executed rings below.

    "title": "Everything Else Clipse Told Us About ‘Let God Sort Em Out,’ the State of Rap in 2025, and Pusha’s Relationship With Kanye",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the weekly newsletter Tap In, GQ senior associate editor Frazier Tharpe’s final word on the most heated online discourse about music, movies, and TV.Sign up here to get it free. Last month, I interviewed Clipse fora GQ Hype story that ran earlier this week. It was a catch-up for me and Pusha T, who I hadn’t interviewedsince his last solo album in 2022, and my first time meeting and interviewing his older brother Malice, whose appearance alongside Push onLet God Sort Em Out—the first Clipse album since 2009, due out later this summer—marks his formal return to the rap game. Talking over quality Manhattan Italian food, the brothers were in good spirits—eager to share their new work, fired up to reassert their place in rap’s hierarchy, and especially candid about everything that’s been going on around them. Between getting into the making of the new record, charting their professional time apart and subsequent reunion, Pusha’s various disagreements with a handful of his rap peers, and explaining how and why the duo left Pusha’s longtime label situation at Def Jam to partner withJay-Z’s Roc Nation, we had a lot to discuss. So much so that there were more quotes and topics left on the cutting room floor for this one than usual—like, say, Pusha saying he’d be open to beats from the guy who producedKendrick Lamar’s “euphoria,” Push recounting an email he once sentKanye Westas an example of how he tried to be the voice of reason on the GOOD Music roster from Day One, or the Diddy trial punchline the brothers threw at me when I asked for “old crazy stories.” Below, find Push and Malice talking about the hardest song they’ve ever written, working with producers aside from Pharrell, and the ways Push always tried to give Kanye meaningful counsel. GQ: Is there more Pusha T solo in the future too? Pusha T: Yeah, there's plenty of music, man. Plenty of music loaded up, ready. Your last couple of projects have been really focused on locking in with one or very few producers. When you think about the future, even vaguely, is it only Pharrell that you see yourself working with or are you open to the idea of opening up? Like, one of my favorite random songs of yours is“H.G.T.V.”with Mike Will, and DJ Dahi gave you an insane beat for “Drug Dealers Anonymous”... Pusha T:Dahi is definitely one of my favorite producers. I also like Cardo. Yeah. I can easily picture you two toe-tagging a Cardo track. Pusha T:Man, listen, Cardo got heat. Really, I'm just trying to make what I want to make. From here on out, I'm only making whatIwant to make. So whoever has that, hopefully we cross paths. When you see me working with P, it's because we know how to always reach that. I'm from the Gang Starr era. Malice:Cohesive. Not reaching out to, like, 12 producers. Pusha T:Right. And I think this formula and what I do, I think that has built the brand that people can trust. When you chase different styles... People don't know what to expect from you or you may look like you're searching for something. You know what I'm saying? I feel like what's worked thus far has just been people always knowing what they're going to get and just getting a higher level of it each time. Who are you guys feeling these days? Pusha T: I'm actually feeling Stove God Cooks. Stove God, to me, is the perfect version of street rap that entertains me that I want to hear. But he also has the charisma and the bars to back it up. It's like entertaining charisma, but the bars are there as well. It's not charisma overload and no bars or vice versa. And he's on the album on a chorus because I feel like he's even good at that. I [see] him as a hybrid of a Max B and mixtape 50. Not that he sounds like them, but he's that type of craftsman. Just Stove? Anybody else? Pusha T: [emphatically] No. Gene? Malice:I like Future. I'll work out to that. Pusha T: Yeah, Future’s great. I thought we were just naming newer guys. Malice: But a lot of the rap that I come across, it's like the guys were taken out, like Pop Smoke, right when I was really getting into them. Him, King Von… Is there an extra weight to those types of moments for you, when a rapper passes prematurely, as someone who stepped away? Malice:Yeah, it is. It is, because you see all the telltale signs surrounding. Right, the danger signs. Malice: I wouldn't even call it a danger sign where you could see it leading up to it, but it's like after it happens, and then you look at everything that was surrounding [them] and it makes sense. On the flip side, was there a song that was a little bit harder to crack, whether that's conceptually, or just writing the verses? Pusha T: I wouldn't say it was a record that was hard to crack, but“Birds Don't Sing”was a hard write. How did you guys even come up with that song, one verse for each parent that passed? Pusha T: Man, the concept came from having a conversation with Pharrell after my mom passed and just thinking to myself and wondering, man, her sickness... was she suffering and just sticking around to see my son and us? And it was bothering me. And just in hindsight, thinking about dialysis and shit like that, shit she was really going through… The process, what it takes out of people. Pusha T: Yeah. So, he just called me one night, and it was like, \"Bro, that song...\" He was like, \"The song is called 'The Birds Don't Sing. They Screech in Pain.'\" You think they singing, but they're really going through it. You see the beauty of them, but really, they're in pain. And I don't know where he got it from, but that evening, he definitely said that, that evening. Malice: When I heard Pusha was writing “Birds,” I was like,This song will never get done because there's no way.Because it was just so touching, so heartfelt, and it had so many emotions, but it was therapy. And looking at everything in hindsight, and then wondering about your parents’ thought patterns and the things that they were going through, but you only know what they're showing you. But now that I look back, it's so many things. I can tell you for one—we were talking about this earlier, but now when I look at my grandkids now, I'm like,Oh, I'm fighting for them now. That's a responsibility, as a man, that I internally have taken on. And I thought,Dang, my dad must've felt the same way. And I know he felt the same way, but I didn't knowwhatthat weight felt like. So, it's like new revelations just open up to me all the time now. Pusha T: Well, it starts off the album... We were like, \"Man, this is actually the hardest record we've ever done by far.\" People were crying every day, we're crying through the sessions. It was a problem. It was like, \"Yo,take a break.\" People in there sewing in the next room, like,n-gga… it was crazy. So we said \"Nah, this don't go at the end of the album. This sets it off.\" Malice, your kids are a little bit older now. Was there a different kind of conversation about you coming back that you had to have with them? Malice: No, but I will tell you that before my dad passed, we had a real conversation and I asked him. We were sitting in the car in front of my house, and I said, \"What do you think about me going back to rapping?\" And he said, \"Son, I think you've been too hard on yourself.\" And mind you, he's a deacon in a church. But he said, \"You still have to live in this world. You still have to provide for your family.\" And just to hear him say that he thought I had been too hard on myself, it was an eye-opener. He always supported us. And my dad wasn't... I don't care what kind of money you brought home, what kind of car you drove. He was never taken by it. You know what I'm saying? He was like, \"That's nice,\" and he was happy for us, but he wasn't like, \"Oh,\" eyes light up and stuff like that. My dad was very chill. And very independent. Pusha T: [Ye] goes on his rants. He's like, \"Where's the gang shit? Where's all this at?\" The one thing that I can say about him is that he knows that every issue that he's having and crying about online right now, I've told him distinctly about those things,distinctly.When he cries, and when he's cursing out Virgil and disrespecting all of the cast of characters that have helped him build a lot of his shit and ancillary helped all of us creatively, right? That man knows that I was the only person who told him like, \"Hey, man, Virgil got his line poppin… Why don't you make your own LVMH, bro? You got Virgil. You got Yeezy. You have Just Don's. His issue with me is because I'm always the truth-teller. And he just never wanted to hear it? Pusha T: Bro,Jerry [Lorenzo], [Kanye’s former manager] Don [C],Virgil [Abloh], all of them… just so you're clear, when I got there, [Ye] was on his fashion journey, and then they all started their own journeys. And he was trying to be down with, I believe it was Louis Vuitton, so badly. I was going to the MAGIC Show in Vegas. And I called him, I said, \"Hey, man, you know I'm at the MAGIC Show, and everybody here is dressed like GOOD Music.\" And I said, \"Yo, what you really need to do is—Virgil was doing Pyrex Vision back then—I was like, \"Yo, what all [your boys] are doing, you need to just round that up, because everybody dressing like all of y’all anyway. \"And put that under your shit.\" And I only did that because I was so embarrassed at him begging to be down with LV so bad, to be honest. Pyrex, Jerry, Don’s snakeskin snapbacks… wow, that would’ve been a powerhouse. This is real. Listen, to add to that, so after that, I sent him an email and told him, \"Hey, this is what you need to do,\" so on and so forth. I forgot how he responded. Steven [Victor] was sitting right next to me. I swear to God, months later, I am in the Mandarin Oriental. This man [Ye] calls me in dead tears talking about, ‘Jerry did a deal with Pacsun, and he didn't give me no money. Oh my God.’ And I said, \"Wait a minute. Stop. Hey, stop it, buddy. Stop.\" I said, \"Go back to that email. Bro, I told you. I told you a long time ago that you should've been the head of the collective, and that's what it should be.\" And I said, \"You can't can't go to people after the fact. These guys were working hard too. They worked hard. They had to find their way without you.\" And they did. Bro, trust me, bro, these rants and stuff, they ain't because somebody's wronged him. It's because he knows I could look you in the face and say, \"Man, I told you all this shit.\" it would've been the biggest thing ever for everybody. I just didn't understand it. I didn't understand why he was so dead ass on being down with LVMH back then. Probably just the institution, and what that union would’ve represented, I guess. I understand that, but at the same time, now look at it. How much was Off-White worth? How much was Yeezy [brand] worth? Okay? Had everything stayed copacetic, how much would the Gap deal would've been worth? How much was Fear of God worth? So my point is, you had LVMH yourself. You had one yourself. Malice: My favorite verse of his is on \"P.O.V.\" I feel like POV almost didn't even make the album, right? I thought that was crazy. And I love “P.O.V.” for Terrence's flow on it. I'll tell you a funny story about that, because T, you have a disgusting line on that song. Out in LA where I live now, I drive an Audi, but I’ve been driving one here for this month that I’ve been in New York… a super nice S6, beautiful. So, I'm blasting the album for the first time top to bottom in the car. And then I hear this guy Push say, \"The only Audi here is driven by my au pair”... like, well, damn. OK. Pusha T[smirking]: My bad, man. I'm sorry. Malice[cracking up]: Don't feel bad. Because when Jay[-Z] said, \"We don't drive X5s. We give them to baby-mamas”... man I was loving my X5 at the time! [laughs] So, you're recording most of this at LV in Paris? Pusha T: Yeah. Is that a cool setting to make this type of music? Because you guys have recorded in random spots before, likeBabyface's house, right? Malice: Wow. How old are you? 34. Malice: How do you know all that? I study, man. Research. Actually, were there any crazy stories from Babyface's house while you were makingLord Willin? Pusha T [breaks into laughter with Malice] No, man! Ain't we done with the crazy stories, man, from people's houses? No, man.No.Be thankful [there weren’t].",

    "title": "Aaron Taylor-Johnson Wears His 007 Credentials on His Wrist",
    "article_text": "Omega likes actors. Actors like Omega. The latest movie star to repthe watchmaker in an official capacity is Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who also happens to be a long-rumored favorite to be the next James Bond. Factor in the Swiss big dog’s official association with 007, and you can imagine how Taylor-Johnson's Omega news went down in the gossip columns. Over the weekend, the actor attended an ‘in conversation’ event for his latest movie28 Days Later,alongside co-stars Jodie Comer and director Danny Boyle. He did so wearing a Speedmaster Moonwatch Professional, making it his watch spot as an Omega man. (Take note that Bond is known for wearing various Seamaster models, never a Speedmaster.) What is far more interesting about this particular watch—and perhaps shows Taylor-Johnson is happy to stoke the rumor mill—is thatit was first leaked by Daniel Craig(ex-007, of course) at the Planet Omega exhibition in November 2023.Omega later announced the watch officially in early 2024. But you don't have to be Bond to look great wearing the white-dial Speedmaster Moonwatch Professional. You don’t get more wearable than a stainless steel case and bracelet with a white dial: it’s clean, classic, and pairs with most outfits (which makes this a great one-and-done grail). It’s also powered by Omega’s Co-Axial Master Chronometer Calibre 3861 movement, which gets the chrono fiends giddy. Plus, it's certified by METAS, which is watch-speak for meeting the most stringent accuracy tests. The reason it's so rigorously tested stems from its roots. The Speedmaster is a tool watch, initially designed with racing in mind, before earning the “Moonwatch” monikerwhen it was blasted into space and worn by astronaut Walter Schirra in 1962 even before it was NASA qualified in 1965.This makes it a flat-out grail for anyone with a thing for Omega. It's rugged, a bit fancy, built tough, and arguably more Bond than a Seasmaster. It’s also a great move for an ambassador looking to show a deep appreciation for the brand’s history. Anyone sipping a martini for every Bond-related IG comment that followed Taylor-Johnson's Omega announcement wouldn't have fared well. Instead, why not flip the narrative, ignore the hearsay, and simply appreciate the horological goodness we are now guaranteed to witness every time Taylor-Johnson steps out in the wild? Hollywood's army of watch collectors—which already includesLeonardo DiCaprio,Timothée Chalamet, andthe aforementioned Craig—is already going strong. Now, we can add Aaron Taylor-Johnson to that watch watch list. Here's hoping his wrist will be used to tease new releases too—an exercise just as exciting as speculating about whether or not he'll be the next Bond. This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "How ‘Animal Flow’ Can Transform Your Daily Life",
    "article_text": "In 2010, theAnimal Flowworkout program introduced the world to quadrupedal movement training (QMT), a ground-based style of fitness that draws inspiration from animal movements. While QMT, or primal fitness, has spent the better part of the past 15 years stalking the fringes of the fitness industry, the workout has recently roared back in popularity thanks to arenewed interest in calisthenics. “We're still seeing this body weight-training boom coming out of Covid,” saysTonalcoach Kristina Centenari. “A lot of people didn't have access to equipment, and they got to understand the benefits of calisthenics.” The key to QMT’s appeal—and the billions of views amassed by the#primalmovementhashtag on TikTok—is how accessible it is. It’s an equipment-free (and also justfree) workout that you can do anywhere. And theresearchsupports its claims about improving not just mobility and stability but alsoflexibility, which has recently been linked to longevity. “It comes back to this idea of functional fitness,” says Centenari. “Like, how can you move through life better?” As a form offunctional fitness, QMT is all about strengthening the body’s weak links to improve your overall physical resilience and real-world readiness. “The idea here is that if you need to get down low and then get back up, or support yourself on your hands, or sort of lean in a weird way, you've built some familiarity with your body,” says Ben Supik, founder and CEO ofActivate Body Personal Trainingin Baltimore, MD. “We want to make sure that the body is well suited to prevent injury—not just when we're going about everyday life, but in weird situations, too.” Granted, nobody’s out here bear-crawling down the street, but it’s movements like this—along with the crab reach, beast activation, and travelling ape, to name a (slightly cringe) few—that can unlock new mobility and put you more in tune with how your body moves through space. “There's research to show that when you’re in this quadrupedal base position—with your hands and your feet on the ground—it really does improve coordination,” says Centenari. Overall, getting down on all fours with QMT can help you improve your mobility and stability, and it’ll also make you stronger. Of course, body-weight training comes with its own inherent limitations, and if your goals involvemuscle growthor a specific strength benchmark, for example, you’d be better served using primal fitness to supplement those workouts, rather than replace them. Even if you’re not interested in going full beast mode, that doesn’t mean you can’t still use elements of QMT to your advantage. “You don’t have to stop everything that you're doing and go practice Animal Flow,” says Centenari, who recommends QMT as a great way for people to activate their muscles before big lifts. For example, “you can prime your serratus anterior muscles for the bench press with a crab reach,” she says. Primal movements are useful for warming up generally, whether you’re heading to the weight room or the soccer field. “One thing about Animal Flow that's great is that it kind of hits everything from head to toe,” says Supik. “After 10 minutes, I've warmed up all the muscles in my body and I'm ready to go play my sport or go lift heavy weights.” It’s also a killer travel workout—the perfect solution to a lackluster hotel gym—and most fitness streaming apps now offer some version of primal training. (Personally, I’m a big fan ofNike Training Club—one of the most slept-on fitness apps out there.) While many primal exercises, poses, and flows might look intuitive, technique is crucial, given the absence of equipment to keep you on form. And the potential benefits are behind a learning curve that might not be for everyone. “When it comes to beginners, the issue is the barrier to entry is a bit high,” says Supik, who recommends people have at least a basic foundation of fitness before experimenting with QMT. “Animal Flow does offer regressions—taking an exercise and scaling it back, based on your capabilities—but it only regresses so far.” Even for the seasoned fitness enthusiast, QMT can be deceptively tricky to grasp. “The floor is often foreign to people who haven't been down there in a while,” says Centenari. “So, be open-minded to learning something new and maybe feeling a little bit uncoordinated or foreign in your body.” And, whatever you do, don’t force it. “Everyone's wrists are tight because we're on phones and keyboards all day,” says Supik. “And to have your wrist bend all the way backwards and support your body weight is literally an impossibility for a lot of people without taking the time to acclimate to it.” Of course, practice makes perfect, and the holistic benefits of QMT could be well worth your investment in mastering a new skill, says Supik. “This could be an interesting way to challenge your body in a new way that mentally keeps the spark going and keeps you motivated to show up.”",

    "title": "Lionel Messi and Carlos Alcaraz Are Keeping This Watch Trend Alive",
    "article_text": "Before its retirement in 2022, Patek Philippe’s Nautilus ref. 5711’s took a year-long victory lap. The series of special editions culminated in the most desirable version of a watch that already had legendarily long waitlists. Patek put the watch out with a dial in Tiffany’s signature light blue. It waslimited to 170 piecesand allocated only to the maisons’ finest clients. One client who didn’t want to bother with the waitlists paid $6.5 million at auction for the watch.Jay-Zowns another, as do Mark Wahlberg, LeBron James, andLeonardo DiCaprio. That whole business kicked off a long succession of light-blue dials that still continues today. Just this week,Carlos AlcarazandLionel Messibothrocked different interpretations of the trend on their respective courts/fields. For his part, Alcaraz wore theRolex Cosmograph Daytonain yellow gold (ref. 1265LN) on an Oysterflex bracelet, while Messi sprung for the newTudor Black Bay Chrono “Flamingo Blue.”(We’re still searching for the legendary blue flamingo that inspired said dial—let us know if you come across one.) Now neither of these watches technically bear“Tiffany” dials—the type actually co-branded with the retailer’s name that used to be fairly common in the mid-20th century and are now largely the province ofPatek Philippe. (There’s a thriving trade in these so-called “double-signed” dials more generally—the type that bear both the manufacturer’s name as well as that of the retailer where they were sold. Examples includeUniversal Genèvechronographs retailed by Hermès,Rolexesretailed by Serpico y Laino, and Pateks retailed by Gübelin.) But the light blue colorway has been adopted by watchmakers both large and small. There’s been a particularly huge rush to adopt the hue over the past couple of years. Take Rolex, for example: Though it largely no longer allows double-branding of its dials, it did release a light-blueOyster Perpetualin 2020 that took the watch world by storm. This year, the brand upped the stakes with a new version of its famed Cosmograph Daytona with a Tiffany-esque blue dial. New Daytona releases are already among the most coveted in Rolex’s catalog and it’s clear that this piece is already finding folks eager to wear it. Alcaraz, who gets first dibs on the best pieces, clearly couldn’t wait to take this one for a spin. Tudor also put out its own spin on a turquoise dial this year. The brand’s “Flamingo Blue” chrono lets folks into the Tiffany-adjacent party without shelling out full-price for a ticket. At $6,050, it’s among the brand’s pricier watches, but it’s still a steal compared to the $37,400 that the Daytona will set you back. Other non-Rolex and Patek brands are also at the party. Consider Bell & Ross’sBR-X5 Ice Blue Steelor Zenith with itsDefy Skyline 36. Even Tissot’sPRX Automatic 80, a cool sub-$1K design, can be had in the recognizable colorway. Whether on the tennis court, the soccer pitch, or on the red carpet, the appetite for this fun and lighthearted shade hasn’t waned yet. Whether you chalk it up to people shoring up theirarsenal of summer watchesor an obsession with America’s foremost luxury purveyor it would appear that Tiffany blue is here to stay.",

    "article_text": "Bradley Cooper thankfully (or sadly, depending on your faith), shot to fame long after flip-flops were worn with diamante-studded jeans andvisor shadesdown in the cluuurb. In the heated, heady days following the millennium, flip-flops were the go-to for tanned boys that, like their patron saints of theJersey Shore, wanted to get crazy, get wild etc. And then, like Ed Hardy, wage growth, andTV shows about people lamping their friendson a night out, flip-flops snapped out at the end of the ’00s. Some were disappointed. Most were relieved. The sigh was universal. But beneath the premature headstone, maybe they were just hibernating. In New York yesterday, Cooper, a man of great taste in sneakers, swapped his usualAir Jordans for—breathe in—flip-flops. First and foremost, to release the dogs in NYC is a brave thing; have you seen the state of those pavements? It also points to a quiet renaissance of sorts. For some months, flip-flops have been plotting their return like a Marvel villain in the end credits. Slowly, surely, confidently, they will get their revenge. And truly, many guys are thrilled about it. Chris Hemsworth has historically stanned a flip-flop. As an Aussie, it makes sense, because beaches, BBQs and a far better quality of life. Chris Pine, an actor who has embraced the wavy in his 40s, has been known to dabble. And now, there's Cooper. Know that the big brands are also having a flirt with flip-flops. Under menswear oracle and creative directorNigo, Kenzo riffed on traditional zori sandals; not flip-flops per se, but a much more elevated sibling in the same universe. The god of fine, fine,fineItalian menswearBrunello Cucinellireleased a very neutral pair. And lest we forget the holy altar of taste,The Row, with its $690 flip-flops from the forever expensive and always elegant Olsen twins. Listen, flip-flops will still have their haters. Fashion brands be damned. This conflict is an ancient one, too. In 2015,The Cutasked guys to “weigh in on the great flip-flop debate.” A whole decade later, Bradley Cooper is making his thoughts known. This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "The Ultimate Guide to Grunge Style—And Why It’s Trending Again in 2025",
    "article_text": "In 1992,The New York Timespublished a glossaryof “grunge slang.” It was presented as a supposedly authentic linguistic tour of Seattle’s then-exploding music scene. The source: Megan Jasper, then a twenty-something employee at Seattle-based Sub Pop Records. The only problem? During the interview, Jasper made up all of the words on the spot. “I thought we’d just start laughing,” she tellsGQfrom her West Seattle home. “It got more absurd with every word.” The reporter didn’t catch on.Cob nobbler(a loser), bound-and-hagged(staying in on a weekend),wack slacks(ripped jeans), plats(platform shoes).The paper ran 14 of her fake slang phrases in their entirety. It was Jasper’s mom who called her to say, “Honey, you’re in theTimes.” That prank—and the fact that it went to print unverified, forever archived as a defining moment of grunge—says a lot about how the outside world saw the movement. It was mysterious and highly marketable. It was also wildly misunderstood. If you ask Jasper, who then worked the label’s front desk checking voicemails on a cassette tape answering machine when Nirvana was still playing club shows, grunge wasn’t a sound or a look—it was a community. A tightly knit, low-budget, high-volume scene of musicians, misfits, and creatives who happened to live in the same chronically wet, flannel-rich city. Sub Pop was ground zero for grunge. What started as a scrappy indie label with a staff of eight became the most influential voice in alternative music. It introduced the world to Mudhoney, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. It thrust a local, Pacific Northwest music scene into the international spotlight. Soundgarden before a show in Chicago in 1992. It was Green River’sRehab Doll—the first record Sub Pop ever put out—that started it all. Two of the band’s members, Steve Turner and Mark Arm, went on to form Mudhoney, a group that Jasper still calls the label’s flagship. “Mudhoney paved the road for so many other bands,” she says. “Mark Arm had this presence—he controlled his space, but there was this unpredictable edge. Maybe he’d jump off stage, maybe not. Maybe he’d get in your face, maybe not. He had this rebellious presence that could cut through anything.” For Jasper, that sound—loud and full of potential—came to define the energy of Seattle itself. And you could feel it at Sub Pop. “Our office was buzzing back then,” says Jasper. “Artists were in and out constantly, music geeks visiting Seattle would stop. It was busy, chaotic, and really special. There’s no way you could be in that space and not feel like something exciting was happening—whether it was new music playing, ideas being thrown around, or visitors stopping in. It felt fresh—it really did feel like anything could happen.” Sitting at that front desk, there was always music on. The phone lines flashed red constantly. People were dropping off T-shirts, posters, and records. Jasper and Jonathan Poneman, co-founder of the label, would walk to get coffee at Pike Place Market in the mornings. The office was just blocks away. Today, Jasper is Sub Pop’s CEO, overseeing a staff of 67. She calls it “organized chaos” compared to those old days. The office is still just blocks from Pike Place Market. In the ’90s as now,Seattle weather was a constant drizzle that would last for months. People wore clothing that was practical. “It’s sort of funny-looking, but it was totally normal to have cut-off jean shorts and thermals,” says Jasper. “That’s how you kept your legs warm. I’m not quite sure why we didn’t just wear long jeans. Looking back, it makes me laugh.” The thermal layering happened on torsos, too—long-sleeve waffle tops worn under thrashed tees and beefy flannel shirts. “Flannels were something punk kids wore, too, but especially out here where the lumber industry was significant, and it was rainy and cool and mild—but not always hot. There was justso muchflannel. Way more than the East Coast,” she says. “People had leather jackets and they’d throw them on over their flannels.” Nirvana on tour in Tokyo, circa 1992. Seattle’s thrift stores were abundant, and that’s where most shopping was done. “No one really had a ton of money, especially music people. So you had to think about what you were going to spend money on, and it probably wasn’t going to be new clothes if you could find something you liked secondhand,” Jasper says. Long hair was part of the grunge aesthetic, too. “I’m not sure why. Maybe just because they were tired of having short punk cuts for so long,” says Jasper. “There was something refreshing about growing your hair out. I grew mine out back then for that reason. I didn’t want to have a mohawk anymore. I didn’t want tostyleit—I wouldn’t have called it that, because it would’ve grossed me out, but that’s what it was. And it felt really good not to.” It didn’t take long for fashion folks to sniff out this emerging West Coast microcosm. Marc Jacobs, 29 at the time, was famously fired from Perry Ellis for the spring 1993 collection he sent down the runway. The plaid patterns and oversized, drapey silhouettes were heavily influenced by what Seattle youth were wearing. (Today, Jacobs’ sprawling fashion empire includes the grunge-inspiredHeaven by Marc Jacobs imprint.) Christy Turlington backstage at the Perry Ellis spring 1993 show, wearing a grunge-inspired look designed by Marc Jacobs. The real grunge community was amused by the fashion world’s sudden attention—and grossed out by it, says Jasper. “If you’re going to a thrift store and getting a really good flannel shirt for a few bucks, it wasbizarreto think someone might buy a brand new one for over a hundred dollars,” she says. “That just seemed obscene. Like, you’d have to hate your money to do that.” The mainstream adoption felt uncomfortable to Jasper and her peers at the time, but looking back, she agrees that grunge fashion is a classic look. Plaid flannel, combat boots, thermals—it’s all easy to wear, it’s comfortable, and it works for people. “Even with decades passing, I actually find it comforting that ‘grunge’ is still talked about in fashion,” she says. “Even through a fashion filter, it’s just normal, wearable clothing. It’s not super editorial. It’s practical. But back then [the attention], it felt really gross.” The thing is, you never know you’re the zeitgeist until it’s printed on a long-sleeve and sold for $200 a piece. “We didn’t think we were part of something that would become so important,” says Jasper. “We just knew we were having fun and it was exciting. The shows were thrilling. It felt like this tight community of people who truly cared about each other. Whether you were a musician or just a music lover, a lot of people came up through the punk rock world and the DIY ethos. That really allowed for this values-driven way of living.” Alice in Chains during an in-store appearance in 1990. It’s something not everybody talks about when considering grunge. There were drugs, of course, but people prioritized their values and it showed up in interesting ways. “Whether that was Nirvana putting out liner notes that talked about not being misogynistic or homophobic, or Pearl Jam taking on Ticketmaster, artists lead with kindness,” says Jasper. “There was an element of trust and a momentum that was building.” That sense of trust showed up in other ways, too. There was a specific night at the Off Ramp Cafe, a divey club in Seattle that hosted up-and-coming acts, and Nirvana was playing. They were on fire. They didn’t want to stop playing and the audience wasn’t ready to go home either. The club did something that would’ve gotten its license revoked had they been busted: they locked all the doors. Jasper was there. It’s one of her favorite memories from those days. “I don’t think that could ever happen now,” she says, “But everyone knew what was happening. Everyonechoseto stay. The band kept playing. We all stayed therewayafter hours, rocking the fuck out. It was such a fun show. It felt so good to break the rules.” Grunge is on the up again.TikTokers are showing off their “fuzz”(Jasper’s ’90s slang for thick wool sweaters). Nirvana and Pearl Jam tees line the shelves at Urban Outfitters and Target. “Kids now, they look at Charli XCX and that’s grunge to them,” says stylist Michael Fisher. “They don’t know the particular references that I had during my youth, but that’s the amazing thing about every generation. You find your age-appropriate heroes.” Fisher dresses a roster of A-listers, including Jake Gyllenhaal. One of Gyllenhaal’s go-to brands, he says, is theItalian fashion house Magliano. The label’s intentionally undone aesthetic channels the spirit of grunge, with muted palettes, raw edges, and slouchy tailoring. Gyllenhaal may not be the first face that comes to mind when you think of ’90s grunge, but that’s the point. Grunge isn’t about fitting a mold—it’s a style that can feel authentic on just about anyone, depending on how it’s styled. Grunge-adjacent looks on the runway from Magliano’s fall-winter 2025 collection. Accessories were, and remain, an important part of grunge fashion. Dr. Martens, of course, says Fisher, but also sunglasses. Specifically the white, round, resin“Clout Goggle”frames by Christian Roth that Kurt Cobain wore often—and that Loewe eventually made mainstream. “To me, it was those sunglasses that you found at the gas station rather than going to Rodeo Drive or Fifth Avenue to buy,” says Fisher. People who weren’t even born when Cobain was alive aresporting cotton tees decorated with his signature X-eyed smiley facein 2025. “Kurt Cobain was a young, forgotten kid who bounced around in his family,” says Jasper. “He was probably written off as a ‘townie’ by so many adults, but his talent was so great. This kid that was written off ended up being the face of a generation.” It’s this spirit of grunge that continues to resonate with people. “When that kind of spirit exists on a scale where you feel like you can actually influence change—whether that’s in your neighborhood or your city or the world—it’s powerful,” she says. “Feeling like you can be a participant—that’s hope. And God knows we’ve never needed hope more than we do right now.”",

When it comes tobusiness casual outfitsfor men, we’re in an era where, in most workplaces, individuality takes precedence over uniformity. Of course, every company has its own set of standards it'd behoove you to take note of, but generally, we’re living in a time where dress codes have fallen out of favor and you’re free to present yourself in any way you please. It’s as good of an opportunity as ever to distinguish yourself from your swagless co-workers by building a work wardrobe that speaks to the now. Dressing for the office during the fairest months presents a challenge in that you're trying to do more withless,and hoping and praying you don't sweat through your shirt. It should come to no surprise that summer calls for looser fits and lighter fabrics. Easy colors and easy formulas. So below, we’ve pulled together five foolproof business casual outfits to help you nail your 9-to-5 this summer and beyond. Go forth and steal these ideas—HR will be none the wiser. Mondays are never easy, and that is forever unfortunate, but you can find a little recourse in the care-free feel of linen. To make material work for your 9-to-5, prioritize linen blends, which offer ease and breathability of the fabric with a touch more structure.

    "title": "All-American Rejects Frontman Tyson Ritter Has Started An OnlyFans. We'll Let Him Explain What He Means By ‘Full-Frontal Rock ’n’ Roll’",
    "article_text": "The All-American Rejects, a constant presence on rock radio in the early aughts with hits like “Swing, Swing” and “Dirty Little Secret,” are used to filling big rooms. But ahead of their next album, due out in 2026, the Oklahoma-bred quartet has been drawn to more intimate spaces. It began about a month ago, when the band accepted a last-minute offer to play a house party near the University of Southern California. It turned out to be a raucous affair—and a lightbulb moment that rearranged their entire approach to touring. “At USC, I saw a Gen Alpha kid get raised in the air by his community, and I saw the veil lift,” says frontman Tyson Ritter. “His eyes were as big as plates…and I just felt like this is something great, so why not do it again?” Reinvigorated, the band has spent the last few weeks on a brief but extremely viral house party tour throughout the US, which found them shredding in an Iowa barn, a Minneapolis bowling alley, and the back yard of a house inNashville, where someone cut a holethrough the fenceto get a glimpse of the band. “Fuck, man! We played 12 shows in 10 days. We are not young boys,” Ritter says. “I've never played 12 shows in 10 days in my entire career.” In the spirit of communing with fans sans traditional gatekeeping and ticketing websites, the band is launching a new online presence—on the subscription-based social-media platformOnlyFans, whose association with a different kind of intimacy is something they’re well aware of. Ritter is a little secretive about precisely what people can expect from theAll-American Rejects' page, which is free to join and, at press time, nudity-free. But Ritter is bullish on what he thinks OnlyFans can do for the band’s relationship with its audience. “I think most people don't realize that OnlyFans was a product of the pandemic that started as a Patreon for artists,” he says. “And then it was infiltrated by a genre that made it become a bit of a trope. It’s a platform that is offering an experience where the artist can set the price, and it's artists-to-fans. There's no middleman, there's no subscription costs, unless that artist chooses to do that. That seems like a good thing.” Ritter chatted withGQabout this unexpected venture, what it takes to get people’s eyeballs (and ears) on creative work in an age of fractured attention, and one of his bigger career regrets. Tyson Ritter: Yeah, I'm starting an OnlyFans. And the All-American Rejects are behind me doing it, and it's really nice to be supported by my band in this wild adventure of 2025 for us. The last three weeks…I don't think anybody would have expected the All-American Rejects to make a ripple in the water ever again. And so the excitement behind this whole thing is like,Where else can we be disruptive?We've always been a band who's got a tongue bursting through the cheek when it comes to our music. So why not, you know, do a little peen bursting through a zipper? They can expect full-frontal rock and roll with all access. I'll leave it to the vagueness of that statement to define itself. Of course. I mean you have these concerts now where you pay to access. It's like a tiered system, right? You have a GA ticket that costs baseline, I don’t know, $250? I think it's more than that. Some of these concerts are like $300, and then in order to get the closer experience, the tier system goes through the roof. I mean, we're bringing people to OnlyFans, and we're saying you're not going to pay anything. If anything, maybe you'll pay 69 cents just because we're little cheeky cats. We're not trying to offer a VIP meet and greet that you just empty your account and max out a credit card. I heard some people have credit cards now just for their concert expenditures. Like, what the fuck happened man? I think about the young band in their garage that haven't broken on TikTok. Because all the young bands think that if they don't break on TikTok that they're not going to be a success. Because now that's the rule: have a gimmick, hopefully the art is in there somewhere to be found. And if you trick people into liking it, then maybe you get to introduce it. Young artists that want to play a mom and pop venue? Those things are getting fucking shut down left and right because of the reality we live in. If I was a young band in a garage, my band wouldn't even have a chance. I'm new to the TikToks. I'm doing my best to contribute without feeling like I'm not being true to myself, because I feel like a lot of things feel very performative on that platform. And a lot of that platform is bought by major labels: $2 million creator campaigns to get your music in front of the world. Is this authentic? Is this real? Yeah, you had payola [on the radio]. Payola feels like it was a fucking kids game. I hope places like OnlyFans can drive young bands to saying,Hey man, here we are. We want to be able to play shows. If you like the music, give us a buck. And if there's 1,000 of you, that's one thousand bucks. And maybe we could rent a venue for a night, buy onto a show.Like, there's unlimited possibilities for fans that are directly connected to the artists to be able to champion a band they like. The purest way to make the cream rise. This shit will be found, and wants to be supported. It’s when the art becomes content. When art becomes content, you are commodifying inspiration, and you are destroying our culture by not sincerely approaching your gift. Maybe you are creative. Some of these people probably are truly talented that are even casually doing this, right? But the approach is what's corrupt sometimes. All I can do, as the elder statesman, man, is just sit back and say,How can we scream in this vacuum for the kid in his garage? I don't think so either. A great example of small voices that are fighting the fight is in Minneapolis. There's a group of musicians that started a band helper fund calledTCUP. They put on the show in Minneapolis with us. Unfortunately, due to rain and fire code in the basement—there was only one exit—[we had to move it]. We really dodged a bullet, not compromising the safety of our audience there. But we ended up going to a bowling alley, and 5,000 people showed up. They were willing to stand in the rain for four hours in hopes to get a free show. What does that say to the human spirit of desire to connect with music, when there might be inaccessibility to it now? And that’s a shame. But I'm so grateful that a little band from Oklahoma had a chance to do something with a spirit of just genuine interest to not only reconnect with them, to reconnect with ourselves and where we started. I feel like this was a gift to our younger selves. That we had no expectations, that it spilled out into something that became more of a cultural conversation, is something you just can't predict. Now we're on the other side of it, there's this responsibility ringing true. I want to see other bands doing this. Internally, people are like,man, people are gonna copy this.I'm like,I don't give a shit! Fucking copy this.Fucking lay it across the United States. Stare eye to eye with the person who loves what you've given them. Yeah, we want to do it thoughtfully. I mean, we've had 700,000 people RSVP for this. And when you have an onslaught like that, you need to stable yourself and do a thoughtful re-assessment of how to do this thoughtfully, to where the crowd is safe, to where we have an infrastructure in place and I'm not calling for two porta potties at 3 pm in Ames, Iowa, when 5,000 people are filling up a latrine to the brim. People were running through cornfields. I literally was like,we need two more porta potties.Thank Christ they landed, like, right when we hit the stage and then the floodgates opened. I saw a girl popping a squat next to her boyfriend. I was like,I'm sorry, I'm sorry.She's like,Can I have a picture?And I was like,This is feral. People were selling two beers for 15 bucks behind a fence, which I thought was actually a decent deal. Way cheaper than an amphitheater. And then yeah, some sly dog…I guess he must have had a hoard of ladders. He was renting them out for 150 bucks behind a fence in Nashville. We were paying for [a] fence that got two boards, like, chopped open by some scallywags trying to sneak in through the side street. I want to play a roller rink because I want to see people shooting the duck and playing snowball while we play. Then a foam party. We're totally gonna do a foam party. A company hit us up and they're like,Hey, we would love to blow foam at one of these. That sounds fucking fantastic. Probably have to get new instruments after, but I've never been invited to a foam party. I wasn't cool enough to go to a foam party. Absolutely. We were just putting together our vinyl as a band. And I said,There's a guy at a label whose job it is to do this,and we're having a creative experience doing it. As opposed to when I was young. It was like,Here's your record, here's the layout.Do we have to be on the record cover forMove Along?Yeah, you look good. Really? Because our first record was this cool go-kart that was from my childhood pasture. And it expressed something about where we were as a band, where we come from—Oklahoma—in a dirt road, go-kart kind of thing. Americana for the All-American Rejects. And then the second record, there was a shift. We went over to Interscope Records. [TheMove Alongcover] is probably one of the bigger regrets of our career, because it told our audience:We are a pop band now.A lot of our fans are likeThat first record, man…Well, it's like, part of you might have liked that first record because you have your whole life to write your first record, and everything about it was pure. My best friend Erin rummaged through my grandpa's junkyard to find that go-kart. I can’t look at thatMove Alongrecord cover in anger. That, to me, is like a tattoo you wish you could remove. But also, she's been there the whole time that you're like,Ah, well. I made that choice. Look at this, lady.[Pulls up his right sleeve to reveal a tattoo of an electrical socket and a cord running through to his chest.]You think a power outlet on your right shoulder at 18 is something you're gonna be like, “Badass!” at 41? That’s ol’ blue right there. But I haven't rubbed her off, because that's a part of my story. This conversation has been condensed for length and clarity.",

    "title": "Is It Better to Get Famous in Your 50s?",
    "article_text": "This story was featured in The Must Read, a newsletter in which our editors recommend one can’t-miss story every weekday.Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Recently, a video ofPedro Pascalwent viral. That's not an unusual thing to happen, but in this one he was spotted at a movie theaterloudly proclaiming, “I am a lazy, 50-year-old bougie bitch.” The “bougie bitch” part of his exclamation was, without a doubt, the funniest part of the clip. But the words that stood out were “50-year-old.” Because, yes, Pascal is 50 years old—and he's embracing it with a sort ofSally O'Malley–like fervor. He's 50! He's gonna kick, stretch, be a lazy bougie bitch, and pretend to lick aglow stick at theLast of Uswrap party. He’s also more visible than he's ever been—and far from alone. Pascal is part of a current coterie of actors who have gotten famous later in life and are having more fun with that newfound celebrity than their greener counterparts. Pascal (who’s on the younger side of this group) is joined in this elite club byColman Domingo, who, at 55 years old, has recently become a two-time Oscar nominee andred carpet icon. And there’sWalton Goggins, widely lusted after at 53 thanks to his turn on season three ofThe White Lotus,spreading a rollicking good time wherever he goes. In a way, we're living in a golden age of newly famous 50-something male stars: unencumbered by the pressures that come with breakout stardom, they’re taking on the industry with a palpable delight that's easy to cheer for. Fame is experienced differently for these men than it is for the likes of, say,Timothée ChalametorAustin Butleror anyone else who hits it big at 24. And it might be evenbetter.(For what it's worth, fame is also experienced differently for women—Hollywood is still regressive when it comes to gender and men are afforded far more opportunities to get famous later in life than women are.) Pascal, Domingo, and Goggins arrived to fame having already established their sense of self, which means their public personas are fully developed. They have critical long-term support systems in place. They aren't testing out identities, figuring out their personal taste, or hanging with the wrong crowd in public view. They’re just having a blast. And, as spectators: We love watching them. Why? For starters, it feels like they’ve earned it. All three of these men first paid their dues in the trenches of the acting business. For a long time, they weren’t leading men. They were working actors—the type of guys who are consistently on television and in film but are not the kind of people the general public knows by name. They were on a similar path to those with a normal non-entertainment career: You work hard and you eventually make good. Their fame is just a cherry on top. Take Goggins, for instance. Goggins was nearly 40 when he got his first major role, inJustified,and then his rise was slow and steady. Those who knew his name loved him. Most just recognized his distinctive face and uniquely Southern voice. “I don’t think people truly knew what to do with me,” Goggins toldGQin a profile earlier this year.“I’m not Brad Pitt. I’m never going to be Brad Pitt. But I am Walton Goggins, and very few people fit in my lane.” Pascal, too, has been at this for decades now. In the 1990s you could see him pop up in tiny roles in the likes ofBuffy the Vampire Slayer,and while you could say he became noticeable after his turn onGame of Thrones, he’s currently on a new plane of stardom just as he hits 50. This summer he's in three major feature films, including the blockbusterThe Fantastic Four: The First Steps,in which he plays the Marvel superhero Reed Richards, as well asAri Aster's COVID-WesternEddingtonandCeline Song'srom-comMaterialists, both from A24. Domingo, meanwhile, was thriving on Broadway for years, but film and television parts were harder to come by. (Actually: You know who was on both the Goggins and Domingo trains early? Steven Spielberg, who gave them each a small role in 2012'sLincoln,basically the go-to movie for people who would later blow up.) Even just a mere four years ago, Domingo was a supporting player, a scene stealer inEuphoriaandFear the Walking Dead,but not the kind of A-list, Met Gala–hosting talent he now is. HetoldThe New Yorkerthat the transition has felt gradual. “I’ve been working for a good 34 years, and I’ve always been forging my own path,” he said. “One of my early agents said, ‘You’re a character actor in a leading man’s body, and it’s going to take a while for the industry to understand that you’re actually both.’ I always believed that I could lead, but it’s actually very challenging to be a character actor, and that’s where I usually find my joy: in discovery.” Their joy is infectious, much of which is telegraphed in their totally experimental, highly celebrated sense of style. See, for instance,the tweetthat wasgoing around before the Met Gala: “Three things are certain: death, taxes, and Colman Domingo having that shit on.” Domingo did have that shit on in Valentino. So did Goggins in Thom Browne, wearing a skirt that he couldn't stop waving around dramatically (not to mention his bigSpeedo moment). Along with rocking biceps-baring tops andknee-high leather boots, Pascal has also infused personal opinions into his fashion. For the trailer launch event forFantastic Four, he wore a Bode shirt covered in international flags. As his stylist Julie Ragoliawrote on Instagram, “If the world’s going to shit, we’re just gonna cuddle it.” He also went to the premiere of Marvel'sThunderbolts*wearing a“Protect the Dolls” T-shirt, highlighting his support for trans rights on one of the biggest public stages. Aside from their boldness, their sense of humor is also crucial. Goggins'sSaturday Night Livemonologuewas proof positive of that. During the bit, he explained that his friends were asking him what it was like to become a sex symbol at 53. He said, “If I'm being honest, it feels fantastic,” to the sound of shrieking audience members. But then he deadpanned, “At least, it did until I Googled myself and read some of the headlines,” at which point he highlighted the press that pointed out his receding hairline and bulging eyes. It's hard to imagine a 20-something star being so upfront and sanguine about the way the internet views his perceived flaws. But that's also what makes Goggins so attractive. There's a playfulness and a security with which all these men approach their work both off and on camera, whether they’re Goggins belting songsas Baby BillyonTheRighteous Gemstonesor Pascal committing to the ’90s rom-com aesthetic of a movie likeMaterialists. They have the confidence to pursue passion projects like Domingo writing a musical aboutNat King Cole that’s running off-Broadway. And when it comes to more dramatic parts, they can draw on decades of experience and gravitas so their roles feel honest and lived in. Mostly, all these dudes just seem like pretty good hangs. I sensed that much while observing Pascal aroundthe Cannes Film Festivalthis year. Pascal was in the French Riviera promoting his role in Aster's wild new film,Eddington, but he truly seemed to seamlessly mix business with pleasure. He evoked an iconic photo ofHarrison Ford while showing off his jacked arms. He showed up to the premiere of Alexander Skarsgård'sleather daddy movie and planted a kiss on him. He was enjoying all the fruits of being in his 50s and newly famous, and, as with Goggins and Domingo, that life looks good on him.",

    "title": "So How Much Is John Wick in Ballerina After All?",
    "article_text": "Ahead of its June 6 release, theJohn Wickspin-offBallerina(full title:From the World of John Wick: Ballerina) was plagued by negative rumors. The movie was filmed in late 2022, but there was additional shooting in 2024, leading some to speculate that what was originally filmed was a disaster. It was whispered (slash reported on blogs) that directorLen Wisemanhad been quietly replaced byJohn WickdirectorChad Stahelski,and that the film’s studio, Lionsgate, demanded moreKeanu Reeves(who plays prodigious assassin John Wick) to make a troubled film more sellable. Wiseman has sincedispelled those rumors, saying that what were called “reshoots”—a term that might suggest a faulty original product—were actually additive elements greenlit by a studio that was very excited about the project’s potential. Wiseman clarified that Stahelski only stepped in because Wiseman had a health scare. We’ll choose to accept that narrative—especially after seeing the film, which may be silly and nonsensical, but is also quite a lot of fun. Let’s get to perhaps the most pressing question aboutBallerina, even if it’s perhaps a little unfair to the titular character: just how much is John Wick in the movie? Reeves’s appearance in the film—which is set between the third and fourthJohn Wicks—is more than mere cameo, but far from a true supporting turn. He’s perhaps in the realm of a “with” or “and” credited performance from a big name who pops in to do a few scenes. We first see John at the ballet-assassin academy where grieving-furious orphan Eve (Ana de Armas) is training. They have a brief exchange and, we assume, that will be it in terms of John’s involvement. But he returns later, for a small but not insignificant piece of action that, yes, may only exist to be spliced into the film’s trailer, but doesn’t feel too tacked-on. Wiseman and writerShay Hattenfind a way to insert John into the narrative in a mostly credible way. Though, really, what does credible mean in the ridiculous and ever-expanding universe of this franchise? TheJohn Wicksequels grow more ornate as they go, introducing heaps of mythology—about ancient assassin clans, rituals and rites, rules and regulations—to what was once, at its inception, a mean and efficient little thing.Ballerinaonly further bloats the lore, folding in a whole new sect of people—a kind of killer commune-cult—whose existence strains even the limits of this already ludicrous series. Yet one happily trots along withBallerinaas it ventures into absurdity. Its silliness is, at least, compellingly rendered. It helps immensely that de Armas is such a limber, confident action performer. We got a too-brief taste of her chops in the James Bond filmNo Time to Die—her single sequence is the highlight of thatotherwise moribund adventure.Ballerinablesses us with two hours of de Armas’s physical prowess, somehow both loose-limbed and crisp. She’s a natural interpreter ofWick-ian fight choreography and gun-fu. But it’s not just guns she’s adept with. Early in the film, an instructor tells Eve that there will always be male opponents stronger than her, so she must get creative and underhanded in battle.Ballerinathen shows us the giddy results of that training, as Eve turns all manner of implements and physical circumstances into deadly agents. The grand set piece of the film is a lone woman’s siege of a snowy Alpine town seemingly entirely populated by trained murderers. It’s a prolonged, multi-tiered parade of carnage, culminating in what I think is the first flamethrower duel I’ve ever seen on film. WhileBallerinacan sometimes be more demure about killing than theJohn Wickfilms—Eve shows a bit of mercy here and there, though John is not entirely without conscience either—during this wintertime melee, Eve gets to killing in brutal, relentless fashion. It’s a gnarly good time, staged with just enough mordant comedy to properly contextualize everything as existing firmly in the realm of make-believe. By the end, it has become abundantly clear that Lionsgate does not mean forBallerinato be a mere spin-off anomaly. The film is pitched as the kick-off to a entire new series, in which Eve is on the run from the people she’s grievously wronged (though, they shot first) and her legacy becomes ever more entwined with that of John Wick, ofIan McShane’s Winston, ofAnjelica Huston’s shiftily ambivalent Director. Based on this first propulsive and sprightly film, I warily await whatever comes next in theBallerinasaga. But if we ever see a movie title starting with “From the World of From the World of John Wick: Ballerina,” it will be high time to reassess.

    "title": "'White Lotus' Stars Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood Say “There Is No Feud” Between Them",
    "article_text": "If you believeWalton GogginsandAimee Lou Wood,reports of their feud have been greatly exaggerated.In a cover story forVariety,the doomedWhite Lotuscouple set the record straight on a number of topics—most importantly, the status of their buzzed about off-screen relationship: “There is no feud,” said Goggins. GogginsandWoodstarred in the third season ofWhite Lotusas Rick and Chelsea, an opposites-attract, volatile, age-gap couple who met theiruntimely demisein the season finale ofMike White’s hotel-murder anthology. Their chemistry was so electric that the public got invested in the status of their off-screen relationship—particularly after they realized that they no longer followed one another on Instagram, and that they each had posted emotional tributes to their characters set to the song“Silver Springs”by famously messy band Fleetwood Mac. Had a rift occurred between the two onscreen lovers? Wood and Goggins say no. The two actors toldVarietythat they had only seen each other once since the season finale ofWhite Lotusbefore sitting for their joint photoshoot and interview. Their reunion was “a visibly emotional one” where the “two embraced for 30 seconds,” according toVariety.The photoshoot reportedly devolved into “a dance party” between the two, and afterward they stepped outside together for a quick break. In the interview, Goggins strongly affirmed that they are on great terms. “There is no feud. I adore, I love this woman madly, and she is so important to me,” he said. He reportedly got teary-eyed before comparing Wood to movie stars likeGoldie HawnandMeg Ryan.“She can do anything, and she will,” he continued. “You watch what the next 20 years of her experience will be. I’ll be on an island, I think Greece. But she’s special. There is no feud. She is love and I know that I am that to her. We care about each other very deeply.” Beyond their alleged feud, both Wood and Goggins had their own personal drama to clear up as well. In April, Wood became the subject of public discourse after shecalled outSaturday Night Livefor aWhite Lotusparody sketch that included a “mean and unfunny” impression of her. Wood toldVarietythat “she was over it the minute I said it,” and that she was also dismayed anyone assumed she was upset with Goggins for agreeing to hostSNL. “I was so upset when people [said that],” she says. “For fuck’s sake, of course Walton should doSNL. That’s got nothing to do with me. He’s fucking had a career for, like, how long?” In the interview,she defendedSarah Sherman,who played Wood in the sketch, while maintaining that she found the parody “misogynistic” and hyper-focused on her appearance, specificallyher teeth. (“I was excited to play her because she’s so iconic, her character is so iconic, and I fucking obviously never meant to hurt anyone’s feelings,” Shermanrecently toldVanity Fair. “Never in a million years did I get into comedy to make anyone upset. I feel terrible that anyone would feel bad.”) Goggins left a positive comment on a video of the sketch before he says he realized Wood was upset, and then he deleted the comment a few hours later. “I’ve been posting for 14 fucking years, and if I’m gonna say something, but I’m gonna say it to your face,” he toldVarietyof the incident. “I don’t use social media in any way, and I’m not a mean guy.” He was wholly supportive of Wood during the interview, telling her at one point, “You have the most beautiful smile in the world. You know that.” Goggins addressed another incident as well: When heabruptly ended an interviewwith the UKTimesafter repeatedly being asked about the status of his relationship with Wood. Goggins said the interviewer’s comments had a “divisive nature,” and that he asked if Goggins and Wood bonded over their teeth. This is what ultimately set him off, the actor said. “What he was insinuating, it was so disgusting. It was so appalling. I was flabbergasted. And I said, ‘Fuck mate, wow. I think we’re done here.’” The last bit of drama the pair cleared up dealt with the alleged Instagram unfollowing. First of all, said Wood, “We don’t give a shite about Instagram.” Goggins had similar opinions on the subject. “If I may add, just to put this to bed? The following or unfollowing. I’m a grown-ass man,” he said. He went on to claim that he’s not great at saying goodbye. “I needed to just back away from everyone” afterWhite Lotuscame to an end, Goggins said. “I haven’t spoken to anyone. I couldn’t handle it. Judge me or don’t. I don’t give a fuck what you think. This is my process. Rick means everything to me, and Chelsea means everything to me. And so that’s what I needed to do for me to process all of this.” Goggins ended the interview by re-following Wood on Instagram, putting that chapter to bed. “It’s all so ridiculous,” he said. “It’s just a part of me just saying goodbye to this character so that now Aimee and I will be friends for fucking ever.” Sure, something like that.

    "title": "“Pro-Life” Admin Nixes Policy Requiring Hospitals to Perform Lifesaving Abortions",
    "article_text": "Cool news out of thewomen-lovingTrump administration: Hospitals are no longer required to perform emergency abortions in order to save a pregnant person’s life. Yes, from the guy who brought us “I respect women, I love women, I cherish women” comesEh, they can die. On Tuesday, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Servicesannouncedthat it wasrescinding2022 guidance issued by the Biden administration that directed hospitals to comply with federal law and provide emergency care for all patients, even if that emergency care meant terminating a pregnancy in a state with an abortion ban. In its statement, the agency said the guidance did not “reflect the policy of this administration.” At the same time, CMS claimed that it would continue to enforce the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, a 1986 law that requires federally funded hospitals to treat or transfer patients in need of emergency care; it snarkily added that it would “work to rectify any perceived legal confusion and instability created by the former administration’s actions.” In fact, the Biden-era guidance was extremely clear: Hospitals in all states were required to attempt to save people’s lives, even if those people were pregnant (what a concept). Probably quite purposely, the statement’s language makes it extremely unclear what a physician in a state with an abortion ban can do, and what could result in their losing their license or potentially going to prison. “We’ve already seen since the overturn ofRoethat uncertainty and confusion tends to mean physicians are unwilling to intervene, and the more unwilling physicians are to intervene, the more risk there is in pregnancy,”Mary Ziegler,a professor at the University of California-Davis,toldThe New York Times.“This is not just withdrawing what the Biden administration did. It’s creating a lot of unanswered questions about what hospitals are supposed to do going forward. So more confusion means more risk.”Lawrence O. Gostin,a Georgetown University health law expert, told theTimesthat it’s more than obvious what the new guidance is trying to do, regardless of the spin: “It basically gives a bright green light to hospitals in red states to turn away pregnant women who are in peril.” At least three women in Texasdiedbetween 2021 and 2023 after being denied abortion care. Meanwhile, a woman in Georgia who was declared brain-dead in February is beingkept on life supportbecause she was about nine weeks pregnant when she was admitted to an Atlanta hospital.

    "title": "Meghan Markle Celebrates Princess Lilibet’s Birthday With a Video of Her Birth Day",
    "article_text": "On Tuesday,Princess Lilibet of Sussexturned four, and her mother,Meghan Markle,is celebrating with a series of Instagram posts showing new views of her andPrince Harry.The first post features one photo of Meghan wearing a linen shirt and holding her daughter on a boat and one taken soon after Lili’s birth in June 2021. “Happy birthday to our beautiful girl!” the Duchess of Sussex wrote. “Four years ago today she came into our lives—and each day is brighter and better because of it. Thanks to all of those sending love and celebrating her special day!” She returned later with a post featuring one photo of Harry and Lili soon after her birth, and another that shows them walking on the beach. Later on, Meghan shared another memory from the past, a hilarious video showing her and Harry dancing in their hospital room before Lili was born. The video is set to “The Baby Momma Dance,” by Starrkeisha, a viral YouTube hit from 2013, and Meghan and Harry both show off their moves for the camera. “Four years ago today, this also happened,” the duchess said in a post that also featured a cry-laughing emoji. “Both of our children were a week past their due dates… so when spicy food, all that walking, and acupuncture didn’t work—there was only one thing left to do!” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Lili, the second child of Meghan andPrince Harry,was named in honor of her great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, who was called “Lilibet” by her parents and sister. The late queen did get to meet her namesake during the Platinum Jubilee weekend in 2022, but no photographer was present. When she was born, her name was announced as “Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor,” but when her grandfather,King Charles III,ascended to the throne in September 2022, she became eligible for the title of princess, andthe palace updated its official websiteto reflect the changein March 2023. Lili is two years younger than her brother,Prince Archie of Sussex,and she was born about one year after Meghan and Harry left their royal roles and moved from the UK to Southern California. Though official photographs of Archie were released soon after his birth, the public didn’t see an image of Lili until one year later, when photographerMisan Harrimanshareda portraitthat he took at her birthday party during the Jubilee weekend. Though Meghan and Harry have attempted to keep their daughter’s face out of any subsequent images, Lili has played a role onher mother’s Instagram account, reflecting the duchess’s evolving feelings about social media. She has also been a part of the press rollout for Meghan’s new lifestyle company, As Ever. When Meghan debuted the brand’s name and visual identity in February, its website featured a photo of the duchess and her daughter running together across a grassy field. This week, Meghan spoke toTina Knowles,mother and business partner toBeyoncé,for her podcastConfessions of a Female Founder,asking for tips about running a mother-and-daughter business. “I wonder if one day I’ll be in business with Lili, and we’ll be building something together,” the duchess said.

    "title": "Inside 'Squid Game' Season 2’s Killer Merry-Go-Round Competition",
    "article_text": "Squid GamecreatorHwang Dong-hyukcan still remember playing Mingle, a schoolyard game in which contestants must form groups based on numbers that are called out. If you’re left without a group, you’re out. In Hwang’s memory, one game came down to him, his best friend, and one other boy. The number “two” was called out. “If we two just hugged each other, then we would be done,” he says. “But somehow we were fighting for the little guy, and we were kind of holding onto his arm trying to form a team of two.” Hwang knew early on that he would include Mingle in thesecond season of his hit seriesSquid Game.The game has a lot of built-in tension—which ramps up significantly if the repercussion of losing is death. “Mingle is a game that sometimes makes you team up, which connotates solidarity, but also sometimes you have to abandon people,” he tellsVanity Fairthrough a translator. “So it has both sides. It’s about unity, but also about dividing between people.” In the season’s sixth episode, the surviving players enter a room to find a carnival-like setting arranged around a giant rotating disk. When the music stops playing, a number is revealed. They have to scramble to form groups of that number, run into one of the smaller rooms surrounding the merry-go-round, and shut the door. If a player is left without a group, they’re killed. (Watch the clip below.) It’s a dramatic game made all the more intense by the interpersonal conflict brewing between the characters—particularly Geum-ja (Kang Ae-shim) and Yong-sik (Yang Dong-geun), a mother and son who are separated in one of the most heart-wrenching scenes of the season. Hwang and his team—which included production designerChae Kyoung-sunand cinematographerKim Ji-yong—created Mingle without the use of CG so that its emotional moments could feel as realistic as possible. “This one was especially challenging because there were so many people involved,” says Hwang. “There was so much intense action going on, and then we also had the emotional trauma.” The Mingle scene was filmed at Korea’s largest soundstage, the Daejeon Studio Cube. Hwang wanted the set to feel welcoming and bright; Chae took inspiration from the design of family-friendly carnivals, especially the merry-go-rounds. “It’s a very fantasy-like carnival, but there’s a massacre going on,” says Chae. She used horse imagery throughout the design while incorporating the show’s signature square, circle, and triangle symbols. The plate really did spin, and could hold hundreds of actors—until it eventually broke down, and wouldn’t start spinning if anyone was standing on it. The team got around the issue by starting the plate while it was empty, then tasking the actors to jump on as the scene began. Sometimes, that meant getting hundreds of people to board at the same time. “So this scene was quite difficult to shoot even before calling out action, and after calling out action,” says Hwang. When Mingle is played on a playground, the participants simply hug each other to show which group they’re in. But Hwang and Chae thought forcing the characters to shut themselves into designated rooms would heighten the tension even further. “Because there’s distance between the merry-go-round and the rooms, there could be more drama,” says Hwang. “And when they do lock themselves up behind the colorful doors, there could be their own stories happening in all of those rooms.” They added a slit in each door so the players inside would see those left behind being killed. Chae adds that lighting was key to the main room’s design. She illuminated the space with 3,000 separate bulbs. “When people set their foot on the set, they were like, ‘Oh, this is really pretty.’ I think that is partially thanks to the shiny and sparkly light bulbs that were hanging there,” says Chae. Kim employed strobe lighting once the game began to add to the feeling of chaos in the room. “We have 200 or more people in the background, and not all of them are professional actors, so we were able to hide a bit with it,” says Kim. “But even for actors in the foreground, it enhanced this chaotic moment.” Kim almost felt like a player himself, running with the actors to get the most intimate shots he could of their panicked faces. His work stands out in the pivotal moment when Geum-ja and Yong-sik are separated. For Hwang, that scene was all about capturing the conflicting emotions both characters are feeling in that moment. “Geum-ja is a very Korean mother who only knows of her son—her son is everything to her,” says Hwang. “So when Yong-sik is being dragged by the two men, she feels relieved that he’ll live. But at the same time, she’s feeling, ‘Oh, is he abandoning me?’ I wanted to really show that inner conflict that she’s having at the moment.” At first, Kang Ae-shim says there was a line in the scene where her character tells her son to go. But eventually, they nixed it, believing it didn’t accurately reflect Geum-ja’s mixed feelings. “I think my character would have a very hard time wrapping our head around what’s happening at the moment.” she says. “She feels relieved that her son might live, but she’s also very, very fearful because she might die herself.” For a moment, it seems Geum-ja might die because she can’t find a new group of three. Then Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) and Hwang In-ho (Lee Byung-hun) grab her up to join their team. Safely locked in their room, Geum-ja vehemently defends her son’s actions, claiming he didn’t leave her behind on purpose. Kang doesn’t view that moment as her character misrepresenting the truth. Instead, she is finding her own way to survive. “I don't think she was lying,” she says. “She really truly believes that her son is a good person—and she didn’t want people to talk badly about her son.” An Exclusive First Look atWicked: For Good The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family All theCast MembersThat Might LeaveSNLThis Fall Rick Steveson Rejecting Fascism at Home and Fears of Trump Abroad Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Pete Hegseth’s “Warrior” Rebranding Seems More About Rewriting American History",
    "article_text": "Pete Hegsethisn’t stopping with Harvey Milk. The defense secretary, it seems, is poised to strip other civil rights icons’ names from naval ships as part of his effort to “reestablish” a so-called “warrior culture” in the military. According to CBS News, the Navy isconsideringrenaming vessels honoring trailblazing Supreme Court justices Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg; the civil rights activist Medgar Evers; labor rights leaders Cesar Chavez andDolores Huerta; the abolitionist and suffragist Lucy Stone and Harriet Tubman, who freed dozens from slavery as a conductor of the Underground Railroad. The considered renamings come after Hegseth ordered the name of gay rights activist Harvey Milk—a former Navy lieutenant who was assassinated in 1978 while serving on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors—removed from an oiler. No new name has been announced for the USNSHarvey Milkor others in the class of oilers named for John Lewis, the late Congressman and civil rights icon. But a Defense Department officialtoldMilitary.com that the order to remove Milk’s name from the ship was intended to coincide with Pride Month. It’s an odious move—an act of petty, culture-war trolling masquerading as toughness and common sense. “This spiteful move does not strengthen our national security or the ‘warrior’ ethos,” former House SpeakerNancy Pelositold CBS News. “Instead, is a surrender of a fundamental American value: to honor the legacy of those who worked to build a better country.” But Hegseth seems to consider the vessel names displays of the“wokeness and weakness”he says has pervaded the United States military: The Defense secretary is “committed to ensuring that the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the Commander-in-Chief’s priorities, our nation’s history, and the warrior ethos,” Pentagon spokesmanSean Parnellsaid in a statement Tuesday. Of course, names themselves appear to be a priority forDonald Trump—and they tap into a vision of American history filtered through the president’s narrow, warped lens. Upon returning to power in January, Trumporderedthe “restoring” of “names that honor American greatness,” which included changing Denali back to Mount McKinley, in honor of the president who never set foot in Alaska, but who—in his telling—“made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.” The directive wasn’t just about restoring the past; it was also one of the most cartoonish exercises in pseudo-patriotic rebranding since “freedom fries.” Gulf of Mexico? Not on Trump’s watch. He denominated it the “Gulf of America”: “We do most of the work there,”he reasoned, “and it’s ours.” If his designations reflect a rather imperial conception of “American greatness,” they also speak to the particular perspective he and his allies have on US history—one where it is apparently “woke” to honor those who fought for equality, but just to honor Confederates who warred against America. “That’s right: [Fort] Bragg is back,” Hegsethsaidin March after reverting Fort Liberty back to its former name, which honored the Confederate General Braxton Bragg. Though Hegseth has framed such moves as correctives to performances of wokeness in the military, therealperformance is in his constant talk of “warrior ethos” and “warfighters,” which are as over-the-top in his effort to project strength as his flag socks and flag pocket square are in his effort to demonstrate patriotism. Speaking of flags: Trump—who has alsofloatedrechristening Veterans Day as “Victory Day”—is set to host a military parade on Flag Day to celebrate the Army’s 250th anniversary…and also, perhaps, his birthday, which also falls on June 14. He has downplayed it as a coincidence: “It’s a very important day,” TrumptoldNBC News’Kristen Welkerlast month. “It’s Flag Day.” ButMonica Crowley, the former Fox News pundit planning the expensive spectacle, regards the overlap as “providential,” and has made clear the parade will honor Trump as well as the military: “I’m sure the crowd will break out into a ‘Happy Birthday,’” shesaidonSteve Bannon’s podcast Tuesday. “We all want to make sure that we celebrate in a manner that is fitting, not just of this extraordinary president, but of our extraordinary country.” An Exclusive First Look atWicked: For Good The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family All theCast MembersThat Might LeaveSNLThis Fall Rick Steveson Rejecting Fascism at Home and Fears of Trump Abroad Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "article_text": "Hollywood is getting to know the talents of anup-and-coming filmmakernamed Malia Ann. She’s better known asMalia Obama,the 26-year-old daughter of former presidentBarack Obamaand first ladyMichelle Obama. Last year, Malia submittedThe Heart—an 18-minute short film she wrote and directed starringTunde AdebimpeandLaTonya Borsay—to the2024 Sundance Film Festival, under only her first and middle names. Her mother understands that Malia wants to strike out on her own, but recognizes that the title of former first daughter is a tough one to shed. “Malia, who started in film, I mean, her first project, she took off her last name,” Michelle said toKate HudsonandOliver Hudsonon theirSibling Revelrypodcast June 2. “And we’re like, ‘They’re still going to know it’s you, Malia.’ But we respect that she’s trying to make her way.” Michelle and Barack, who also share 23-year-old daughterSasha Obama,understand that their kids want to veer away from any “nepo baby” labels. “They are young adult women, but they definitely went through a period in their teens years where it was the push away,” Michelle said. “They’re still doing that…. You’re trying to distinguish yourself. It’s important for my kids to feel like they’ve earned what they are getting in the world. And they don’t want people to assume they don’t work hard, that they’re just naturally handed things. They’re very sensitive to that. They want to be their own people.” “Her first film went to Sundance and all these fancy film festivals, and she didn’t useObamaas a director on the credits,” Barack Obama said on thePivot Podcastlast fall. “I was all like, ‘You do know they’ll know who you are,’” he recalled telling her. “And she was like, ‘You know what? I want them to watch it that first time and not in any way have that association.’” According to the Sundancewebsite,Malia’s debut shortThe Heartis about a lonely man grieving the death of his mother after she leaves him an unusual request in her will. In a “Meet the Artist”videoreleased ahead of the fest, she called it “an odd little story” that she hoped would make viewers “feel a bit less lonely” or remind them “not to forget about the people who are.” Malia recently directeda Nike commercialstarring WNBA starA’ja Wilson.She got her big Hollywood break interning for The Weinstein Company and on the set ofGirls.Later, she was hired aspart of the writers roomonDonald Glover’s Emmy-nominated Prime Video seriesSwarm.Malia even earned a writing credit on the show’s fifth episode, “Girl, Bye,” alongside series cocreatorJanine Nabers.“She’s just like, an amazingly talented person,” Glover toldVanity Fairin 2022. “She’s really focused, and she’s working really hard….

    "title": "Welcome to Praxis: The High-Tech, High-Testosterone Eden That Will Save the World",
    "article_text": "Dryden Brownis a slight man of 29, with a scruffy, reddish beard and a wry, serious demeanor. On the April afternoon we met at the Beverly Hills Hotel, his dark suit seemed out of place in the sunlit ease of the Polo Lounge patio. But perhaps the suit bolsters Brown’s title: CEO and cofounder of a “network state” called Praxis, which is not so much a business as it is an ongoing campaign for a city that has yet to exist. Over the years, this campaign has largely consisted of throwing lavish parties at insular Manhattan clubs, creating company swag in the form of steel Praxis “visas,” and, every couple years, suggesting that Praxis may have found itsnew home. Here is what we know about the city so far: It will be beautiful. Also, it will restore Western civilization, through something called an “acceleration zone,” described onthe Praxis websiteas a special economic zone that will “accelerate technological progress” in areas like AI, biotech, and energy. To do so, Praxishasraisedabout a half billion dollars from the likes ofSam Altman’s Apollo Projects,Shervin Pishevar, CameronandTyler Winklevossthrough Winklevoss Capitol, and built an online community of nearly 89,000 prospective citizens. These citizens are representative of the new right-leaning tech aristocracy: people working for defense tech companies like Anduril and Palantir, three DOGE employees, and members of the influential venture fund Andreessen Horowitz. Brown has no shortage of ideas about how Praxis will save Western civilization, a problem he first became fascinated with while interning atBill Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square, which recentlybackedHoward Hughes Holdings, a company developing master-planned communities like Summerlin, Nevada, and the Woodlands, Texas. But it wasn’t until the election ofJoe Bidenin 2020 that Brown realized that America was, as he puts it, becoming “a wasteland,” helmed by a “king in a coma.” To rescue it, Brown decided to build a city founded on Western values, replete with Gothic architecture and filled with a citizenry that upholds classical values and enjoys reading books likeThe Odyssey. But Brown has long grappled with the project’s most fundamental question: where, exactly, to put it. Nearly six years ago, Brown began scouting the globe for his city’s home. On a dozen adventures, he surveyed countries in the Mediterranean like Italy, Greece, and Montenegro. More recently, he floated Greenland. The Polo Lounge, a favorite meeting spot of Brown’s, seems exactly the kind of place he aspires to replicate in Praxis. After all, this is a man who is keenly sensitive to both architecture and ambiance, a man who hasspoken abouthis aspirations to build a city that has a “neo–Gilded Age” aesthetic. Amid the pink bougainvillea and April sunshine, the solicitous white-suited waiters standing at the ready in terra-cotta archways, Brown announces that he has reached a decision. As it turns out, after all these long years of scouring the earth, Praxis will build right here, in America, about a three-hour drive from the sun-dappled patio where we are currently sitting, and one hour north of Santa Barbara, the old-money coastal town where Brown grew up. The new city will be called Atlas. “The opportunity,” he told me, “is to build on Vandenberg.” Vandenberg is a 100,000-acre US Space Force base in Santa Barbara County that is home tonearly 3,000 military personneland their families. These are people who, according to Brown, are “super mission driven” and “technologically competent.” Brown believes these people need something, and what they need is mission expansion. “This is a story about California,” Brown says, his brow furrowed. “It’s also a story about America. At the highest level, it’s about building the arsenal of democracy so that if we get into a conflict with a geopolitical rival like China, we can actually compete at parity.” The idea goes like this: Let the so-called Praxians build a city on federal land in Vandenberg. They will erect facilities, housing, and offices. They will attract tech talent from nearby Los Angeles and San Francisco. With their newfound city, they will help revitalize American manufacturing. They will build drones and ships and space infrastructure. In doing so, Vandenberg will become the new American industrial base and a proud emblem of Western prowess. In Vandenberg, one gets the sense that Brown is only just getting started. “When I think about Vandenberg…like,What is Vandenberg?” Here, he seemed to ponder the possibilities. “Vandenberg is a spaceport. It’s a portal to the stars. What are the stars? What is out there? It’s a great theater for heroism, for heroic exploration. It’s, like,space…space is not about mining rocks. It’s not about getting some metal off some rocks—that is gonna be handled by AI and robots. What it’s about is building new cultures and new worlds. That’s what it’s about. It’s about expanding human civilization to new places and giving it new forms.” Space exploration is one of the subjects on which Brown has a tendency to monologue. Others, as the name of the new city suggests includeAyn Rand’sAtlas Shrugged,as well as the ideological foundation of America, and Western aesthetics. Like other libertarians, Brown has long been inspired by Rand’s capitalist utopia, Galt’s Gulch. He speaks fondly of the Founding Fathers, framing his own mission in the mythic terms of a knight’s search for the Holy Grail. During the course of our 90-minute conversation, he mentioned the word “hero” five times. Cities backed by technologists are not exactly a new idea. In recent years, tech billionaires have rolled out one sweeping blueprint after another—envisioning utopian hubs of innovation marked by walkable cities, clean energy, smart infrastructure, and gleaming high-rises. One such project isCalifornia Forever, which is backed by a string of blue-chip Silicon Valley investors likeMarc Andreessen, Michael Moritz,andReid Hoffman.One comparative advantage to Praxis’s designs on Vandenberg is that California Forever has alreadysecuredmore than 50,000 acres of land northeast of San Francisco, largely zoned for agricultural use only. But, according to Brown, there is one big problem with California Forever: “Candidly, California Forever is a really boring center-left project,” he says, that is “pandering to the local communities and the farmers or something…. These are boomer, lower-middle-class farmers who hear about Marc Andreessen and are like, ‘This guy seems weird,’” said Brown. “It is low testosterone.” What Brown is building is “more like the Gundo”—thehard-tech hub of El Segundojust south of Los Angeles that has lately become a breeding ground for companies working in defense tech and manufacturing. “This is aJetsons/pioneer/1950s/space-futurism insane city on federal land. It is a revival of the aesthetic, classical ideas in America. It is a high-testosterone futuristic vision versus the chill, community-oriented one.” It is this vision, Brown argues, that is more culturally aligned with America’s future. There is a bifurcation in American culture that Brown likens to the 2010-era competition between Lyft and Uber. Lyft were the good guys; they put pink mustaches on their cars. Uber, meanwhile, was hardcore. “Under Biden, you’d call a Lyft,” he says. “Under Trump, you call an Uber. We’re in Uber world now.” What Uber world consists of are people like Brown who helped pioneer many of the staples of our current masculine era: “We were thinking about the Roman Empire, we had the knight’s armor in our loft, we were drinking, like, raw milk and raw eggs,” says Brown. “We were going to the gym a lot.Sol Brahand the esoteric bodybuilder people…it was a whole thing. It was a countercultural movement, and now itisthe culture. We won.” So, what is actually being done—aside from conversing with a journalist on the subject—to build a new city on Vandenberg? Key to Brown’s decision to build Atlas on American soil is the election ofDonald Trump,whose mission to make America great again vibes with Brown’s own plans to revitalize Western culture. On the campaign trail,Trump promisedto build 10 new cities on federal land that would inspire innovation and manufacturing. These plans, unfortunately for Brown, have seemingly fallen by the wayside during the president’s dizzying first few months in office. Still, it is easy to see how someone with a vibrant proposal for a new American industrial base—for instance, Brown himself—might gently remind the president of hisearlier intentionto build cities that would “reopen the American frontier” and “reignite the American imagination.” But so far, Praxis has yet to secure an Enhanced Use Lease, the permission typically needed to build on the base. When I asked Brown if he was speaking to anyone in the Trump administration about building Atlas on Vandenberg, he grew evasive. “We’ve had a bunch of conversations with a bunch of different people,” he said. “We are private people. We’re a start-up. We’ve been greatly inspired by what they’ve done, by the agenda, and by the conviction around the tariffs and so on.” Then he began speaking abstractly about the process of building a city on federal land, which, to be fair, sounds like a lot of paperwork. For now, there is much that stands in the way of all this testosterone, ample though it may be. Chief among Brown’s concerns: a small, “stupid” bird called the snowy plover that is, as Brown puts it, always “pooping on everything.”Protected under the Endangered Species Act, the bird nests along the Pacific coast, and Vandenberg enforcesannual beach restrictionsduring its nesting season. Last summer, one of Vandenberg’s beaches was forced tocloseentirelyfor nearly three monthsdue to violations. The snowy plover has becomesomething of a mascotfor the California Coastal Commission, the restrictive environmental agencyattackedby Republicans and Democrats alike for limiting construction along the coast. In addition to the little bird, Brown is up against the chokehold of Californian bureaucracy that has long foiled construction projectsas minor as public toilets. Wouldn’t it be easier, I suggested to Brown, to build in a place that was slightly more friendly to his techno-masculine vision of the future? Take Texas, for instance, which has recently become the site ofElon Musk’s company town, Starbase. Here, Brown curtly shook his head as though I had said something stupid. “I’m from California,” he said. “I want to build in California.” It was as simple as that. Besides, who wouldn’t want to build in coastal California? It’s got moderate temperatures, flowering jacarandas, and rocky coastline. The sun was beginning to set and it was time for me to go. Brown had plans with someone else, a fellow Praxian who was meeting him at the Polo Lounge for dinner. (Another primary function of leading a network state, it seems, is networking.) As I stood to leave, I noticed a young man stepping out onto the patio. Even before he introduced himself, I knew he was the Praxian. He looked exactly like the Western aesthetic ideal of a man, which is to say that he looked like a Ralph Lauren model, circa 1980: tall, pale, broad-shouldered, and dressed in a preppy white knit sweater. His name was Samuel. “You must be so excited,” I told Samuel as I put on my jacket. “For your city by the sea.” But Samuel did not know what I was talking about; Brown had not yet informed him of the whereabouts of his future home. Still, it was not the location that mattered so much to him. “I’m flexible,” Samuel said. “I’m ready.” And why wouldn’t he be? His eyes were shining with possibilities for the future. He knew, after all, that it belonged to him.

    "title": "House Republicans Shocked to Learn Bill They Didn’t Read Has Stuff in It They Don’t Like",
    "article_text": "Like small children suddenly learning their actions have consequences—or cynical grown-ups scrambling to cover their asses—a number of House Republicans are now claiming they did not realize what was in theGOP spending billthey voted for last month, and had someone told them, they would not have voted “yes.” One day afterElon MuskdubbedDonald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” a “disgusting abomination,” RepresentativeMarjorie Taylor Greenetook to X to tell her followers that there is no way she would have voted in favor of the legislation had she known it contained a measure she doesn’t like. “Full transparency, I did not know about this section on pages 278-279 of the OBBB that strips states of the right to make laws or regulate AI for 10 years,” the Georgia congressperson wrote. “I am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in there.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Several hours later, RepresentativeScott Perrytook to X to declare Musk was “right to call out House Leadership” for voting for the bill,saying“I wish I had a nickel for every time the @freedomcaucus sounded the alarm and nobody listened, only to find out the hard way we were right all along.” What Perry didn’t note is that all but one member of the House Freedom Caucus voted yes for the bill, including Perry.* Surely an honest oversight! This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Greene and Perry’s mea culpas follow that of RepresentativeMike Flood,whosaidin a town hall last week that he he was unaware the bill would limit judges’ abilities to hold people in contempt, and that he would not have voted for it if he was aware of the measure. It’s not clear if these lawmakers actually didn’t read the bill they voted for—which would be pretty bad given that’s their, y’know,job—or if they knew all along and are suddenly now pleading ignorance because they realize how deeply unpopular the legislation may turn out to be. On Tuesday, SenatorRand Paulwarned: “Once this bill votes, and this debt ceiling goes through, the debt is owned by the GOP, and there is no more campaigning and saying ‘this is the Democrats.’ It will be owned by the Republicans, and I think that’s a huge mistake.” Shortly after his “disgusting abomination” post, Muskwrote: “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.” He left out the part about how he spent hundreds of millions of dollars to elect Trump, a.k.a., the guy who wants this bill passed more than anyone. Probably another mere oversight! Speaking of Musk, while he has been slamming the bill over the trillions it is expected to add to the national debt, there may be another reason he’s come out so vociferously against it: the billions of dollars Tesla isexpectedto lose as a result of the legislation scrapping tax credits for electric vehicles. *RepresentativeAndy Harrisvoted “present.” An Exclusive First Look atWicked: For Good The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family All theCast MembersThat Might LeaveSNLThis Fall Rick Steveson Rejecting Fascism at Home and Fears of Trump Abroad Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Taylor Swift Celebrated Buying Back Her Masters With “Tears of Joy,” While Travis Kelce’s Approach Involves Much More Shimmying",
    "article_text": "When she announced last Friday that she had finally purchased back the master recordings and all associated material for her first six albums,Taylor Swiftwrotein an emotional letter posted to her website that she had “been bursting into tears of joy at random intervals ever since I found out that this was really happening.” Her boyfriendTravis Kelce, however, celebrated the news in his own way: Evidently, it makes him feel like dancing—and recruiting two fellow sports legends to do so. On thelatest episode ofNew Heights, the podcast Travis co-hosts with brotherJason Kelce, published Wednesday, the siblings hosted basketball hall of famerShaquille O’Nealfor a lengthy interview. There was a lot of baller talk, sure, but the most baller discussion came in the final seconds of the interview, when Shaq pulled out his phone during the outro and mumbled, “I gotta show you guys something. Two seconds.\" “Take your time,” Jason told him. Time well spent: Shaq tapped the phone's screen and Swift’s “I Knew You Were Trouble,” from her albumRed, blasted out of its speaker. Immediately, all three men started shimmying and lip-syncing to the track. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. “My favorite song in the world, brother!” Shaq declared. Travis, never one to pass up a chance to show off his status as Swift’s No. 1 fan, proudly shot back, “Just got that song back, too, just bought all that music back too, so it’s finally hers.” While it’s not immediately clear from the snippet whether the song inspiring the dance extravaganza is from the originalRedorRed (Taylor’s Version), it doesn’t really matter: She owns them both now. Shaq has long been a confirmed Swiftie, and even told Page Six ahead of the 2024 Super Bowl, in which Travis’ Kansas City Chiefsbested the San Francisco 49ers, that just meeting the singer would make the whole game experience a touchdown, no matter the outcome: “If I see Taylor Swift and get to shake her hand, take a picture, I’ll be good,” he said. Mission accomplished:Shaq not only met Swift, but gifted her a bedazzled Judith Leiber purse, shaped like a football and customized with 87, Travis’ jersey number. Swift wore it to the game to accessorize her all-black look, and the former basketball player posted photos of himself grinning alongside Swift. Jason, after the 2024 Super Bowl, recalled the atmosphere inside thesuite packed with A-Listers where he and Swift sat: “Turns out, everyone wants to meet Taylor,” he said. “Shaq came in on the frickin’ suite. I mean, dude.” “I think it was my first really understanding kind of some of the things that she has to deal with on a lot of bases because there’sso many star-studded people therethat it’s like dude, everybody wants to come see her,” Jason said. Travis added, “Taylor thrives in those situations, she’s been in 'em countless times in her life.” Of course, Shaq and the boys aren’t the only ones having dance parties. Swift has been spotted out celebrating with friends, including getting dinner at New York City’s Monkey Barwith longtime palSelena Gomezthe day after she announced the sale. Frequent collaborator and friendJack Antonoff, too,posted a video of himself and Swift(and one of her cats, Meredith, always key personnel) singing along to “Getaway Car,” a track fromReputation, which has not seen a re-release. “Rep forever guilt free listening!” he captioned the video.

    "title": "Princess Leonor Arrives in New York After Five Months at Sea",
    "article_text": "Princess Leonorhas just concluded her voyage aboard theJuan Sebastián de Elcano, a training ship used by the Spanish navy. Five months after her departure from the port of Cadiz, the heir to the throne arrived on Wednesday in New York, the ship's last stop in America, where a large group of journalists, authorities and members of the Royal Household staff were waiting for her at the Manhattan cruise terminal. Before arriving, the midshipmen paid tribute to the two mates of the Mexican training ship Cuauhtémoc, who lost their lives on May 17 when the ship collided with the Brooklyn Bridge,reports RTVE. The Royal House has confirmed that Elcano will remain docked at pier 88 of the New York port until June 10, when the companions of the Princess of Asturias are scheduled to re-embark to return to Spain. Princess Leonor of Spain arrives on board the training ship Juan Sebastian de Elcano on June 04, 2025 in New York City. Princess Leonor will return to Spain by plane, but during the next few days she will take part, together with the other midshipmen, in the activities scheduled for this stopover. According to¡Hola!this week, one of these activities will include the participation, along with other Spaniards, includingVictoria de Hohenlohe,the Duchess of Medinaceli,who has been living in New York with her husband for the past two months. Another of the activities planned is the attendance at Carnegie Hall to the showA Musical Fantasy from Spain,which will be performed on Wednesday by the Orquesta Titular del Teatro Real de Madrid. Spanish Navy training ship Juan Sebastian de Elcano arrives in Pier 88 on June 04, 2025 in New York City. On the other hand, it seems that in the end there will not be a visit to the White House like that ofMidshipmanFelipe de Borbónin Reagan's time. Back in Spain, and after a brief reunion with her family, Princess Leonor has another month of naval training on a Navy frigate ahead of her. On June 16, the expected graduation will take place at the Naval School of Marin, a ceremony presided over by King Felipe, where Leonor and her classmates will receive the title of naval ensign. The heiress will join the Air and Space Academy of San Javier (Murcia) after the summer, where she will complete the third and final year of her military training.

    "title": "Renée Zellweger Embraces a New Era of Bridget Jones—and Hollywood Itself",
    "article_text": "Renée Zellwegeris on the verge of making history. If she earns an Emmy nomination for Peacock’sBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy,she’ll also become the first actress to get Oscar and Emmy nods for the same role. And that’s not just a bit of entertainment industry trivia: The possibility is emblematic of anever-changing Hollywood landscape,the rise of streaming media and the fall of traditional theatrical rom-coms. But a now 56-year-old Zellweger seems unfazed by it all. “I don’t think about it from that perspective, necessarily,” she tellsVanity Fair. “But it’s definitely interesting to introduce the character to different audiences. Yeah, it’s a new day, and it’s quite a fun pivot.” Zellweger knows a thing or two about range. After “completing”Tom CruiseinJerry Maguire,and belting from murderers’ row asChicago’sRoxie Hart, Zellweger nabbed two Oscars: a supporting actress trophy for 2003’sCold Mountainand, in 2020, followinga six-year hiatusfrom the screen, best actress for playing Judy Garland inJudy. Her re-entry into Hollywood coincided withthe streaming boom,where Zellweger led the 2019 Netflix limited seriesWhat/Ifand 2022’s NBC limited seriesThe Thing About Pam.On the day we speak, she’s fresh off shootingOnly Murders in the Buildingseason fivewith other new additions likeBeanie Feldsteinand fellow two-time Oscar winnerChristoph Waltz. “It’s ridiculous. It’s so much fun,” Zellweger says. “I’m working with some of my favorite actors and favorite people—what a way to spend the summer.” The newest entry in theBridget Jonesfranchise earned more than $100 million at the global box office and became Working Title’sbiggest post-pandemic filmto date overseas. But in the US, the film was relegated to a streaming-only release. Fighting for thefuture of movie theatersis a conversation worth having, Zellweger says. “It’s something that I talk about with my friends because we love to go and have a popcorn breakfast on a Saturday morning,” she says. “Is it more niche these days? Possibly. But I think there’s always going to be folks like me who love to go and pick a favorite seat and spend some time on a journey together with folks in our community. It’s one of those really rare moments when we can connect.” But how many entries in Zellweger’s filmography—which range from a Farrelly Brothers studio comedy to aRon Howardhistorical drama—would be impossible to make now? “Most of them,” she admits. “The majority of them, definitely.” “And that’s a shame. Because a lot of the things that I’d love to watch and revisit might not be made. There are things that I’m nostalgic for that are more difficult to find. But then again, with streaming, there’s so much [good] content if you dig around long enough.” As an example, Zellweger points to last year’sMy Old Ass,writer-directorMegan Park’scoming-of-age tale starringMaisy Stellaas a Canadian teen who meets her older self, played byAubrey Plaza,during a mushroom trip. “It was just reminiscent of a different time,” she says of the Prime Video title. “It felt like when independent films were at their zenith, and it reminded me of how much I love the immersion in those stories where you connect with these characters, and you root for them, and you feel for them, and you leave feeling just a bit different for having had the experience. Beautiful, beautiful performances, didn’t you think? Knockout.” The same could be said forMad About the Boy. In the hands of directorMichael Morrisand writersDan MazerandAbi Morgan,it’s therare fourth moviein a franchise that sticks the landing on a story that felt shakier in its last two sequels—2004’sThe Edge of Reasonand 2016’sBridget Jones’sBaby. Zellweger had total confidence in Morris’s vision for the latest entry, inspired byHelen Fielding’s2013 novel. “I loved that, when he looked at how to bring the series into the present, he talks about the importance of friendships—how they evolve over time and become vital to how we define ourselves, especially when you’re experiencing the process of bereavement,” she says. “It was important to find how she’s grown, how her values have shifted, how she carries herself differently. Where is she more measured, and what about her is undeniably familiar? He’s a deeply thoughtful director, and I felt really lucky that he was on board for this latest chapter.” Viewers are reunited with Bridget a few years after the death of her husband,Colin Firth’sMark Darcy.“He was always in my thoughts while we were making this film,” Zellweger says. “The history of that relationship is indelible—the ways in which he’s shaped Bridget’s life.” That’s also true ofHugh Grant’seternal bachelor, Daniel Cleaver,who has found friendly peace with Bridget after a few failed attempts at a romantic relationship. “Oh, it’s wonderful, and it’s such familiar territory sharing the Daniel-Bridget universe,” she says. “I love my days with Hugh.” Two new prospects enter Bridget’s life inMad About the Boy. The first isWhite LotusbreakoutLeo Woodallas Roxster McDuff, a 29-year-old park ranger who proves to be more than a May-December fling. The other is Oscar-nominated actorChiwetel Ejioforas Mr. Wallaker, a no-nonsense science teacher at Bridget’s children’s school. But unlike Bridget’s past films, dating here is secondary to her role as a mother to her elementary-aged children, Billy(Casper Knopf)and Mabel(Mila Jankovic). Knopf, who skillfully mimics Firth’s soulful, soft-spoken nature, “is just a pro already,” she says. As for Jankovic: “If you were to conjure Bridget’s child, there she is. She’s the manifestation, surely. Her energy and her joie de vivre—she’s a whirling dervish of wonderful.” Bridget has changed since the early aughts, but Zellweger’s commitment to the role has never wavered. “I just feel really lucky to have shared another round in Bridget’s world with people and this character that I love so much,” she says. “It’s such an unusual opportunity to revisit a character and discover her anew.” In the years since her husband’s sudden death, Bridget Jones has been on autopilot. Then, she’s reminded of advice from her late father, played byJim Broadbentvia flashback inMad About the Boy. “It’s not enough to survive: You have to live,” he tells her. It’s those words that rouse Bridget from her grief and renew her zest for new experiences. Zellweger knows this feeling well: She, too, made the decision to live more life when she took a self-imposed break from acting in 2010. After six years away from the spotlight, “I recognized myself again, when I had a life instead of just a profession,” she toldVanity Fairin 2020. “When I had friends who I saw on a regular basis.” I ask Zellweger if she ever seriously considered giving up acting. “That’s an interesting question that I don’t think that I’d even asked myself,” she says, considering her next words. “I mean, if that’s what needed to happen, and if that’s where the journey led, then okay. But I wasn’t really making any plans. I was just acknowledging what was necessary at the time to feel like I could grow a little bit.” Zellweger says the work “certainly” felt different after her hiatus. She can appreciate the symmetry of playing Bridget two times before the pause and twice more afterwards, but doesn’t seem especially eager to delve into how the experiences differed. Perhaps keeping some things close to the vest is another lesson learned during Zellweger’s interlude. Gaining some perspective paid off, according to Leo Woodall. He calls Zellweger “the warmest person in the world,”tellingVF:“She’s carrying this whole thing on her back, so I wanted part of my job to be serving whatever she needs.” The feeling was mutual. “Isn’t Leo wonderful?” Zellweger asks in her gentle Southern twang. “I so look forward to watching where his career leads him—such a gifted actor and a wonderful person.” Zellweger doesn’t take the responsibility of leading a set lightly. “I’ve worked with some of the most talented and highly revered filmmakers in the world. And the unconditional kindness of a lot of the number ones that I’ve had the good fortune to get to know really left an impression,” she says. “I recognize the work for what it is. It’s a blessing. You’re lucky to get to do what you love as a profession, and it’s a miracle every time a project makes its way into production. It doesn’t work without the contribution of every single person on that set. So the collaboration, it’s essential, and that’s my favorite thing about the experience of storytelling.” While on her break from acting, Zellwegerstudied screenwriting,but has no current plans to pen a Bridget adventure of her own “This [story] is very specific to Helen’s experiences. She shares her own most intimate life moments through the character of Bridget, so authorship belongs to her alone,” Zellweger says. “I feel lucky as an interpretive artist to come in and take what’s there and bring it to life.” What about another project? “Sure. Yeah, there’s some different experiences I’d like to have in the future,” she says coyly. And though there is a finality to Bridget’s journey inMad About the Boy, Zellweger hasn’t ruled out a return, either. “Everybody who’s involved feels such affection for this character and wants to protect the integrity of the experience,” she says. “That Helen might want to tell more stories through the character…I’d feel really lucky about that.” An Exclusive First Look atWicked: For Good The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family All theCast MembersThat Might LeaveSNLThis Fall Rick Steveson Rejecting Fascism at Home and Fears of Trump Abroad Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Balenciaga and Britney Spears Collaborate on a Capsule Collection",
    "article_text": "Toconclude his ten yearsat the helm of Balenciaga in style,DemnainvitedBritney Spearsto collaborate on his final ready-to-wear act for spring 2026, titled “Exactitudes.” Beneath the minimalism of the collection's name lies a dense emotional and visual charge. It captures and celebrates Balenciaga “archetypes,” the result of his questioning of the contemporary wardrobe during his time at the label founded by Cristóbal Balenciaga in 1917. \"The people, silhouettes, vibes and ideas that have been fundamental to my work for this amazing house,\" Demna said in a press release, which accompanies a reinterpretation of the signature red bomber from his very first Balenciaga show, the famous \"mask\" glasses through to the exaggerated multi-layered anoraks from the winter 2018 collection. The artistic director will present his last couture show for the house in July 2025 and will be replaced byPierpaolo Piccioli. Balenciaga spring 2026 collection The capsule series between Balenciaga and Spears, an already iconic collaboration between the most divisive pop star of the 2000s and the designer who transformed the brand, takes the form of an homage but with the gritty DNA that has made the house so successful. The collection features worn T-shirts, XXL hoodies, studded caps and silk twill flags screen-printed withRankinandSteve Kleinphotographs, all with Spears's autograph in azure blue or Barbie pink. Add an assertive Y2K varnish, and the result is something that blurs the line between an artist's merchandise and museum artifact. Kitsch becomes luxury and Spears becomes muse. A synthesis that's not so much a wink as a manifesto. Fashion doesn't document pop culture, it absorbs it, transforms it, archives it and resells it. To this wardrobe is added, of course, a playlist, an accessory now as essential asthe City, the label's it-bag. Curated by Spears herself and hosted on Balenciaga's Music Hub, it blends her personal inspirations with two remixes byBFRND, the house's faithful sound composer and Demna's partner. \"Britney is a pioneer, she defined pop music and inspired generations of artists, reworking her legacy is a great honor,\" said the musician. “Gimme More” becomes the podium soundtrack, whileOops!... I Did It Againcelebrates its 25th anniversary in an electro-funeral setting. All that's missing is confetti and a strobe light. Britney Spears' playlist for Balenciaga “I've always loved fashion and I was so honored and delighted that Balenciaga and Demna chose to collaborate with me on Demna's latest collection for the house. I hope my fans love it as much as I do! These are some of my favorite images from an extraordinary period in my career and life, and I can't wait to share them with everyone,” declared the singer. A privilege that Balenciaga has previously only granted toRuPaul,Aya Nakamuraand the metal band Rammstein. This capsule also marks a passing of the torch. After transforming the house into a black mirror of our times fusing oversized sportswear, social satire and haute couture references, Demna will head to Gucci next.

    "title": "How Rob Franklin Wrote 'Great Black Hope,' the Novel You’ll See by Every Hamptons Lounger This Summer",
    "article_text": "One ofGreat Black Hope’s earliest images of its protagonist, David Smith (called Smith), is a mug shot. Booked on a possession charge after a cocaine bump in a Hamptons night club, “he’d worn,”Rob Franklinwrites in his debut novel, one of the first releases relaunchingSummit Books, “a vintage Marni gingham shirt, loose-fit linen trousers, and a gently startled expression.” Smith is a product of two societies: a louche New York cohort of moneyed, mostly white 20-somethings with jobs like Smith’s (flunky at a DTC art world start-up) or none at all, and the more decorous world of his hometown, Atlanta, where his father dwells as a retired HBCU president. Following the death of Smith’s best friend and roommate, Elle England, the socialite daughter of a former soul star, his train starts to come off the rails. Soon after: the mug shot. With pathos, style, and a laser trained on details that straddle the devastating and the devastatingly wry (at one point, Smith awakens in a strange bed less worried about the man next to him than that he’s landed in the quagmire of Bushwick; in another, he imagines that the only lawyer he’d be able to afford without family intervention would be of the “1-800-GET-U-OFF” variety), the book follows Smith’s Sisyphean struggle with the legal system, alongside the increasingly headline-grabbing details of Elle’s death. (One plot thread finds a fictional writer from this very magazine—albeit one with an unusual fact-checking process—reporting a feature on the story.) 'Great Black Hope' by Rob Franklin Simon & Schuster There’s perhaps no one better suited to discuss the work thanMargo Jefferson,Pulitzer Prize–winning critic, investigator of the personal and political, andchronicler and problematizer of America’s Black elite. In fact, Jefferson, or at least her writing, nearly made a cameo in the novel. In the book’s middle section, Smith returns home to Atlanta, where he fends off setups with the daughters of his parents’ friends and watches his sister do battle with their grandmother over whether their family has predatory landlording to thank for its good fortune. Franklin, who populated Smith’s father’s personal library with the work of E. Franklin Frazier, Frantz Fanon, and bell hooks as a way to “have some of those icons of Black scholarship enter into the world of the novel,” nearly slipped Jefferson’s 2015 memoir,Negroland,onto the shelf, before deciding that “it almost felt like showing my handtoomuch.” “You’ve got a mystery, you’ve got a novel of manners,” Jefferson says ofGreat Black Hope, which is out next week—a comedy coupled with, rather than tragedy, “what Dorothy Parker called ‘the messes.’” ForVF,she and Franklin discuss the mess, the Marni, and more. Margo Jefferson: This book is so much about gradations, contradictions of coexisting privileges, situational switches. Rob Franklin:If we look at two characters like Smith and Elle, who are both products of the Black elite, they're still products of different kinds of the Black elite. Smith is from Atlanta, Southern Black bourgeoisie. His parents are professionals, an academic and a doctor. All of their friends are academics, doctors, lawyers, very much a background rooted in degrees. And a degree of wealth, but not extravagant wealth. Elle is the product of the Hollywood Black elite, and a coastal scene that has a lot more glamour, a lot more overt wealth. The people that she grew up with are the children of actors and athletes and rappers. As a result, it is a scene that’s less preoccupied with the grad school degree or whatever, but it’s also far more glamorous than what Smith is used to. Talk to me about Carolyn too. These two women are the epitome of beauty, glamour, and a certain kind of performative daring. Carolyn is his other closest friend, who is from a wealthy New York family. She’s half English, her family’s entrenched in the fine arts. There’s an East Coast pretension to her background. With both women, part of the appeal to him is the way that his proximity to them gives him access to certain rooms, and a passport to certain social affects, and things that he encodes that he otherwise would not have been exposed to. He’s really drawn to that. But especially with Carolyn, who is a white woman, he also resents that. There’s the assumption that wherever he and Carolyn went together, he had the same privilege that she did. And actually, that’s not true. He knows that his passport into those rooms is revocable and that there are certain expectations being made of him. When Smith is Carolyn’s plus-one to this restaurant opening, there’s a line about, basically, being wealthy and white of late had become unfashionable, at least without the veneer of multiculturalism. And so he is aware that what he adds to this scene of people from the East Coast, or from Europe, who have vacation homes in glamorous places. What he’s adding to their lives is a kind of cultural texture that makes them seem more interesting. There are second layers of tension. Every Black parent—bourgeois, whatever—tells their child, Don’t you dare get in one of these positions, like being arrested, because you can’t get away with it, and it will shame our family. He’s crossed some terrible line. He’s suddenly moved from the path of achievement, and twice as good, onto this other self-destructive path. He later muses on the kids who grew up with him in Atlanta, who were also in Jack and Jill, and went to prep school. Some stayed the course, and did the med school degree, and lived out the expectations of generations of their families, and others self-destructed under the oppressive expectations. You end the prologue with, “He’d worn in his mugshot a vintage Marni gingham shirt, loose-fit linen trousers, and a gently startled expression.” The performance is still going, there. It hadn’t even totally occurred to me that, yeah, our prologue ends with an image, ends with a mugshot. A very chic mugshot. Where he is, again, captured both in the tasteful, upwardly mobile external image that he tries to present to the world, what he was wearing to this club, summer linens and Marni. He’s a character who is not going to emotionally come undone in public. He’s very much trained in a comportment that doesn’t allow him to totally break down in public, even as he begins to realize the gravity of his situation. Smith’s father comes to help see him through the hearings. And of course, they’re the most well-dressed people in the room. I thought, this is another one of Rob’s jokes, because if anything, the bourgeois Black person is going to gussy it up. A long time ago, I said to a friend I’d grown up with in Chicago, “What are you wearing?” We were going to some event in New York. And she sighed and said, “I’m going to be overdressed as usual.” I thought, That’s us! Yes, the perpetual fear of being underdressed. The first time they went, they probably would’ve expected almost everyone was going to be in a suit. They think that’s what you do in a courthouse. You want to present a certain way. But then, in this weird way, in trying to fit in, they actually stand out and become that much more conspicuous. And that hangs over. Though it never hangs over Elle. She has her own destructive and grief-stricken moments, but that doesn’t hang over her. And maybe that’s the difference. She’s not, quote, “bourgeois.” She’s basically café society upper class. That’s such a good point and distinction of this question of presentation. When you are a product of a coastal, New Yorker, LA, Black elite, the question of dressing in a way that’s a little bit too extravagant, that is not so at the fore of the way that people from those milieu are trained in comportment. They feel able to stunt a bit more. She is less restricted by these codes of respectability. But then we also see in her death, and in the coverage of her death, how much straying from a respectable image, ultimately, will catch up with one, and how much a person can be punished in public view for doing that. The way media will borrow, will feed on a certain image history. “The Black woman was found in a sordid place, and her dress was torn off her…” And we see that, as you’ve written about, in pop-cultural history, in the way that glamorous Black women with issues with drugs, like Whitney Houston,Naomi Campbell,who are larger than life, incredibly glamorous women—there’s a resentment from the white media ecosystem that they’re so unapologetic, and they’re so over the top. In the coverage of their experiences with substance use, they, I think, are extra punished for [it]. Talk to me about Carolyn, and punishments that she risks. I didn’t want it to be so Black and white, as like, here’s a Black woman and a white woman in similar circumstances. Here’s how one is discarded, and here’s how the other is allowed infinite chances. I wanted it to be a little bit more complicated. Part of what I was interested in was both how these women are performing femininity, how Carolyn is embodying a particular brand of white femininity that allows her proximity to power, and makes her sexually desirable to powerful men. But also, how she feels really, really constrained by that endless performance, in a similar way to how Smith feels constrained by his performance of “respectable Negro.” Carolyn feels this mask that she’s been wearing, this performance, is a cage, and doesn’t know how to hack her way out of it. I was interested in how all these characters are performing identity, how they’re performing glamour. Smith says that the point of drugs is they obliterate time. His mother asks, “Why would you want to obliterate time?” And, with his mouth full—as she had taught him not to do!—he says, “Why wouldn’t you?” That, in a strange way, is a kind of privilege. That that generation of Blacks have entered, or descended into, a certain kind of, No, I don’t give a shit. “Obliterate time” is so different from Ellison’s “I am an invisible man.” We see three generations of Smith’s maternal lineage, because we see his mother, and we see his mother’s mother. And at the beginning of the Down South section, the middle section of the book, we get this rewind, this flashback to the grandmother’s life story, escaping the deep rural South and coming to the urban South. It’s a hair-raising story. That’s a kind of Black novelistic legacy that you’ve entered into, for a time. I went back and forth on if that section should be cut, where to put it. Why I wanted to preserve it is precisely because of this question of time. Giving a sense of the generational upward, uphill battle. Lifting as we climb. The grandmother, who was born on a sharecropping farm and becomes a lawyer, ascends into the middle class, or the upper middle class, then produces these children who go to Ivy League schools and become professionals. Smith’s a third-generation product of that, who has, as you said, the privilege of wanting to obliterate time. Wanting to indulge to a point that is self-destructive, as a way of shirking the very high expectations and responsibilities he knows are being thrust upon him, but in a slightly rebellious, “fuck this” way. We can see 70 years, 80 years of history over the course of this novel. And all of that uphill climbing can be obliterated in a single night. Which isalsosomething he wants to obliterate, having to fear it, having to be aware of it. He’s a character that really struggles with embodiment, presenting as himself in different rooms, and the anxious hyperattunement to his body that that creates. He’s a character that also struggles with the anxiety innate to having to figure out what it is a person is supposed to do with their life. I was interested [in the character names]. I suddenly realized,Elle, my God: she, her. She’s such a symbol. The names: David Smith, I wanted him to have this everyman name, but then to take Smith as his first name in a way that makes it tasteful, distinct, chic. With Elle England, because her mother’s this soul singer, I wanted their names to have that stagey quality. It made me think immediately of that generation of Black women performers who were taken up by English rock stars. Then I looked up Carolyn. A lot of women are named Carolyn. Its origin is “free man.” There is something that feels classic about the name Carolyn. I did want her to have a slightly old-world aspect. I was also thinking aboutCarolyn Bessette. I knew you were. That brand of elegant ’90s white femininity was definitely coming into play. Names are so tricky. But then, some of them, the name Fernanda, which is for a relatively minor character, I came across this old story, I think in theNew York Post,of this debutante namedFernanda Wanamaker Wetherill. She’s infamous. In the front half of the 20th century, she had a big debutante ball in the Hamptons. Her family rented a nearby estate for an after-party. Her friends went completely wild. They were using china for target practice. Someone was swinging from a chandelier that came detached from the ceiling and fell to the floor. It was covered in thePostand other gossip rags, as the symbol of the ultrarich, the decadence and godlessness of the ultrarich. I like when writers do those kinds of things because you can bring your own association to it, but if you don’t get it, you’re fine. [Elle and Carolyn’s] mothers have both achieved, in certain ways, more than they’ve done. What they can do, so far, is invent themselves as performers and beauties. Both of them are very much still in the process of becoming, and have mastered a level of self-invention, but haven’t figured out the ends to put that towards. Both of their mothers are originally performers. Carolyn’s mother is a ballet dancer turned child psychologist, and Elle’s mother is a soul singer. These are women who used performance to gain a foothold in the world. Their daughters learned the skill of performance, but still haven’t sorted what to do with it. One doesn’t feel the same way about [the character] O. One feels, somehow or another, that they are going to find a way. Maybe because they’re outside of the borders of the world that Smith and Carolyn and Elle know how to navigate. There’s a twinning happening between Smith and O. But O represents this more liberated path, where O is unconstrained by the fixedness of identity. Their identity is a much more slippery thing. We see through that character the immutability of being able to change one’s identity, and all the power in that. They are very exciting to Smith for that reason. He’s totally drawn to this idea that even though, of course, projections will always be placed on you, there is a way to exist without that being a constant mental strain. When I was crafting their relationship, I was thinking about many things. A book that I was thinking about a lot when I was writing this book wasWhite GirlsbyHilton Als.The duality, the idea of twinning. I was almost thinking about two different aspects of my own psyche, of a part that’s so steeped in history and in familial expectations—and then a part that represents future and possibility.

    "title": "“Butthurt” Elon Musk Has Billions of Reasons to Hate the GOP Spending Bill",
    "article_text": "Elon Muskspent much of Tuesday—and the early hours of Wednesday morning—raging againstthe “big, beautiful” spending bill thatPresident Donald Trumpis trying to push through the Republican-led Senate. “This immense level of overspending will drive America into debt slavery!” Muskwroteon X at 2:14 am Eastern, doing little to dispel rumors that he isfrequently hopped up on drugs. He called the bill a “disgusting abomination” and promised to “fire all politicians who betrayed the American people” who voted for it. Musk says he hates the bill because it is expected to drive up the deficitby nearly $4 trillion. But, as White House sources have been quick to tell reporters over the last 24 hours, there are other reasons why the billionaire Tesla CEO is lashing out. As one sourceput it simply to Axios, “Elon was butthurt.” Among other things (like, oh,healthcare coverage and food stamps) the GOP bill would scrap electric vehicle tax credits that Tesla has benefited from.According to Politico, the EV maker stands to lose billions of dollars from tax credits that would expire this year under the current version of the bill. “When businessmen criticize legislation, journalists don’t take them at their word, they look at how the legislation would impact their business interests,” a Republican source told Politico. “They should be doing that in this case.” Axios’s sources, meanwhile, said Musk may also be feeling the sting from President Trump’s decision to withdraw the nomination of Musk palJared Isaacmanas NASA Administrator. According toThe New York Times, thepresident informedMusk of the decision on Friday, the same day as Musk’s big Oval Office sendoff. Musk’s allies reportedly tried to change the President’s mind, to no avail. Trump pulled the nomination after whathe saidwas a “thorough review of prior associations,” a likely nod to Isaacman’s past donations to Democrats. “I'm pretty sure Elon thought the NASA situation was a last insult,\" one White House official told Axios. Musk’s outbursts have apparentlymade Trump “furious,”according to Fox & Friends hostBrian Kilmeade, though the president has yet to say anything about it publicly. The White House referredVanity Fairto press secretaryKaroline Leavitt’s briefing Tuesday,during which she saidthe president is “sticking to” his plan for the bill. “The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,” Leavitt said. “It doesn’t change the president’s opinion.” Trump has said he wants the bill on his desk by July 4th, but it faces an uphill battle in the narrowly divided Senate, where Kentucky senatorRand Paulhas saidhe is “just not open to supporting” such a huge debt ceiling increase.Trump lashed outat Paul in a Truth Social post, writing, “He loves voting ‘NO’ on everything, he thinks it’s good politics, but it’s not.” Missouri senatorJosh Hawley, meanwhile, haspushed backagainst proposed Medicaid cuts in the bill, writing in aNew York Timesop-ed just last month that cutting off poor people’s health insurance would be “both morally wrong and politically suicidal.” But he seemed to be softening his stance earlier this week after meeting with Trump. “Just had a great talk with President Trump about the Big, Beautiful Bill. He said again, NO MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS,”he wrote on X. Hawley, of course, is being careful with his language. The billwouldimpose new work requirements on Medicaid recipients thatexperts say would have the effect of cutting millionsof people off from insurance. Now, GOP senators find themselves having to pick sides in a no-win tug of war. On one side, is Musk, the party’s biggest donor, who has vowed to use his vast wealth to oust lawmakers from office if they vote for this bill. On the other is Trump, the party’s supreme leader and a president who has proven himself more than willing toexact vengeanceon his political rivals. In the middle? Oh, just the rest of us.

    "title": "Mike Tindall Dreams of a Rugby Super Bowl",
    "article_text": "Even after hanging up his boots, ex-rugby playerMike Tindallhas never really left the field. At 46, the former England center — world champion in 2003 and now a well-known figure in the Royal Family — is back in the spotlight with a project as ambitious as it is unexpected: the creation of R360, a brand-new international rugby league modeled on the Grand Prix. The aim? To attract the world's best players, without cutting them off from their international commitments. R360 promises to respect international windows, leaving players available to represent their countries. According to theBBC, the competition would be played mainly in the summer, from April to June and August to September, and while it would not conflict with the men's Six Nations Tournament, it would overlap with both the Southern Hemisphere Rugby Championship and the women's Six Nations Tournament. The tournament would take place in the world's largest cities: London, Paris, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Buenos Aires and Cape Town have been mentioned as potential host cities. For Tindall, this league is the answer to a crisis in rugby's appeal, particularly among the younger generation and the general public. The stated aim: to finally give rugby its equivalent of the Super Bowl, with a world league that would be the “pinnacle of rugby.” The tournament is due to be launched next year and is committed to “unleashing the potential of women's rugby,” headlined by American superstarIlona Maher. For the moment, few details have filtered out about funding or \"institutional backing\" for the project, although owners of teams in other sports, including the NFL andFormula 1, appear to be interested. But Tindall seems determined to shake things up and give rugby a stage worthy of its prestige, by redrawing its contours.

    "title": "And Just Like Hat: Ranking Every Hat on And Just Like That…",
    "article_text": "Does anyone still wear a hat? Yes, if you count the characters onAnd Just Like That…—and Ialwayscount the characters onAnd Just Like That…No matter the occasion, from will readings to “they mitzvot,” you can always rely on Carrie Bradshaw—a woman who is perpetually dressed for a theme party that doesn’t exist—and her motley crew to adorn their heads with the most eclectic accessories imaginable, courtesy of costume designerMolly Rogers.You literally can’t spellAnd Just Like That…without the wordhat. With the HBO Max show’s third season finally here, we’ve gone back and ranked every hat that’s appeared on the series so far. Not necessarily based on style—a concept like that has no place in a conversation aboutAnd Just Like That…—but on factors like intrigue, dramaturgic importance, and the likelihood that its appearance onscreen made me say “hat” out loud. This is a pretty unremarkable hat, all things considered, apart from the fact that it’s what Carrie is wearing when she almost gets hit by a bike. The city should take note: In addition to bike lanes, we need designated lanes for people wearing wide-brimmed hats. Safety first! This is the most normal, boring hat that Carrie owns—and on top of that, she’s actually wearing it for function. Naturally, she pairs it with a coat seemingly made out of a full king-size duvet. In Lisa Todd Wexley’s defense, it might be unclear what one is supposed to wear to a “they mitzvah.” In her case, she decides to imagine what it would look like if Norma Desmond shopped at Jovani. I’m ready for my close-up, Mrs. York Goldenblatt. If you were wondering what Carrie had been up to since the last time we saw her, well, she was clearly busy robbing the Lumineers. To me, the gray wig they hadCynthia Nixonwear during the first season counts as a hat. We all remember where we were when Dr. Nya Wallace was attacked on the subway platform by somebody dressed as Chucky. What you might not remember is that she wasn’t entirely innocent herself: She was wearing a rust-colored Kangol-style hat. Nya’s husband, Andre, is constantly rocking little skull caps similar to this one, even when he’s painting a house. The Miranda I know would never wear this hat. Imagine getting a cameo from Che Diaz, and they’re wearing this? These are the kinds of hats you get with comedy-concert money. It’s rare that Lily gets to wear a hat; she’s usually too busy causing Big’s death or destroying Charlotte’s vintage Valentino skirt with paint. But here, she puts on a beanie to signal that she’s emo now. Lisa Todd Wexley loves a visor, but upon closer inspection…is she also wearing a little yellow purse in the shape of a baseball hat? Hat on a hat, but bonus points nonetheless. Who wears the pants in this relationship? Unclear. Who wears the hat? Both of them. MaybeChallengerswould have gotten that Oscar nomination if its characters had worn Fendi bucket hats during their tennis matches. I guess LTW heard she was supposed to serve and took it too literally. Speaking of bucket hats—they’re a huge part of Rock’s journey. In fact, I’m convinced they chose the name Rock because that’s what they do with bucket hats: they rock them. They’re almost always wearing bucket hats—like this studded one they wore when baking with Anthony. Bonus chef’s hat in the background. I’m impressed that the school’s dress code requires uniforms but allows colorful bucket hats. The second season ends with Seema and Carrie on a beach in Greece, with two hats. While I appreciate Seema’s, its sparse, feathery fringe looks too much like a middle schooler’s mustache. My eye is instead drawn to Carrie’s, which she’s using as a blanket. Classic Carrie. The sunglasses perched on top of Miranda’s green bucket hat do give the impression that this is one of those frog hats…which, honestly, wouldn’t have been a shock. Have you ever wondered what it might look like if Hostess started designing hats? I’m sure this was a beautiful hat before someone sat on it. One gust of wind and this bad boy is three blocks east. Rock hadn’t come out as nonbinary at this point, but this was how they came out as a hat person. And what a way to do it! Charlotte was horrified, but what should she expect after raising her children around Carrie Bradshaw? In the series’ opening moments, Carrie takes a picture of this stranger’s hat, foreshadowing her continued affinity for headwear. The plot point of her capturing eclectic fashion to post on her socials is quickly abandoned, probably because nothing she’d see in the wild could compete with a mirror selfie. I had to pause the television and take a walk around the block the first time I saw this asymmetrical…boater hat? I wouldn’t know where to begin in trying to accurately describe it. The bottom line is, all of Carrie’s friends are enablers. Never go to a will reading without a hat to keep on the table as a witness. Who knows—maybe Big had left the hat something in his will? What’s great about this one is that Carrie primarily wears it across her back like a backpack, rather than on her head. And who can blame her? She’s probably distracted thinking about all the new hats she’ll be able to buy with the money Big left her. Yet another visor from LTW. I love that she is introduced to us as the coolest socialite in town, then constantly dresses like an extra inBarb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar. Carrie wouldn’t let a little something like her husband’s death stop her from serving. I have this exact same thing in blue. It feels wrong to refer to this woman as “Lisa.” She is either Lisa Todd Wexley or LTW. I mean, just behold her trekking through a blizzard looking like Maleficent if she shopped at Barneys—that’s not a “Lisa.” What I love about this one is that it looks like a regular hat that started to melt. One day it will come out that this show is being funded by Big Bucket Hat. That’s the only explanation. Being friends with Carrie Bradshaw means that you sometimes find yourself getting coffee with someone dressed as a pirate. Carrie’s wardrobe has more feathers in it than a production ofSeussical: The Musical. Was LTW going to The Eagle right after this? Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Carrie was so kind to go shopping with Seema even though she was on her way to perform in a matinee ofNewsies. Keep in mind, this is the outfit Carrie put on to go through her storage unit. Even a damn CubeSmart is a runway for this woman. And what was one of the only two items she chose to collect from said storage unit? You guessed it: another hat. This hat, in fact! She took it, and the lamp pictured, to help fill up her new, empty apartment. And to be fair, the hat does take up a lot of space. Not only does Charlotte choose to dress as the owner of the Moulin Rouge to go to the Met Gala, but Harry (seen in the foreground) has on a top hat of his own as well. This is one of the few times Carrie has an excuse for what she’s wearing on her head. She’s hopped up on painkillers after her hip surgery and dons this Easter pageant hat to record her podcast. But was she also high when she bought it? What can be said? Everything about this is perfect. If anybody is looking for outfit ideas for theCowboy Cartertour…look no further. This is the very first shot of our gals onAnd Just Like That…,so it’s only fitting that Carrie sets the tone for the entire series by wearing this little feathered cap. She’s like Robin Hood, but instead of giving money to the poor, she gives it to hat salesmen. I mean…this is insane. Like, they’re just fucking with us at this point, right? A casual stroll through the park wearing an entire bagpipe on her head. Strawberry Shortcake should sue. But after being with these characters and their hats for six original seasons, two movies, and two full spin-off seasons, with a third currently underway—this is exactly the kind of insanity I’ve been conditioned to expect.

    "title": "The Chaos Inside Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s Wedding: “You Don’t Have to Do It. Don’t Do It.”",
    "article_text": "By the time they finally tied the knot in February 2015, Johnny and Amber’s relationship was severely troubled. Years later, Amber would allege that he was an out-of-control addict and rabidly jealous of other men and women, constantly accusing her of cheating. After turning violent toward her, he’d sober up and promise never to do it again, pouring on the love. Amber said she always stayed because she loved him and wanted to protect him, which is also why she hid the danger she was in from the people closest to her and the medical staff assigned to her. She said she was holding out hope that getting married would turn it all around. For Johnny, who has maintained he never assaulted Amber, their nuptials were like a shotgun wedding without a baby. In the lead-up to the wedding, Bruce Witkin was spending time with Johnny in the recording studio. He remembered Johnny saying Amber wanted to get married quickly because they were both going away on film shoots. “She wanted to get it over with. [Depp’s sister] Christi was there and we both told him, so what? You don’t have to do it. Don’t do it. We were trying to tell him—don’t do this until you get a prenup. And Johnny kind of says to Christi, ‘Well you tell her.’ Christi cried and tried to convince Johnny not to go ahead with it. I tried to convince him too.” But Amber insisted. She wanted to get married before Johnny started filming the next Pirates of the Caribbean film, which required an intensive six-month shoot in Australia, where Johnny would have to live full-time. Amber said she was seeking stability by formalizing their union, but Johnny’s camp saw the expeditious wedding plans differently. According to Johnny’s assistant Nathan, “When they were married, Amber would get half of all he’d make on his films. So she wanted to be married before the next Pirates film.” (Heard did not respond to the authors’ interview requests during the book-writing process, but she later testified that the wedding was moved to avoid scheduling delays.) ‘Hollywood Vampires’ by Kelly Loudenberg and Makiko Wholey Amazon Bookshop There would be two weddings in rapid succession: a small civil ceremony in Los Angeles, where they’d make it official, and a larger celebration on Johnny’s private island in the Bahamas within the week. The LA wedding was hastily arranged. Johnny’s assistant Stephen Deuters and his wife, Gina, had traveled to LA from London to help Johnny prepare to film Pirates 5. Amber was always nice and charming to them, even if they felt she was a bit “off.” It took a while for Stephen to catch on to the problems in her and Johnny’s relationship, but he eventually started to pick up on the signs of trouble: the little arguments, the snide remarks. Early on in their relationship, Johnny told Stephen he was worried he might wake up in the middle of the night and she’d be straddling him with a knife. “He’d make sort of offhand comments like that, you know?” Stephen said. “He doesn’t like to moan, or whine or complain. He doesn’t like to show fear. So he would say things like that to me, but kind of giggle.” During the lawsuits that would later come, Stephen tried to tell Johnny’s lawyers about an even more alarming incident, but he could never nail down the precise date. He and Johnny were at the Infinitum Nihil office on Melrose going over work matters. “I could tell he wasn’t really listening to me, which in and of itself, isn’t that uncommon,” Stephen said with a laugh. “He would often drift off when I was talking about work. But something was different this time, and he was looking down at his shoes. And I just said, ‘Are you ok? What’s up?’ And he just sort of looked at me, touched his head, and he had a loose clump of hair on his head and there was a little bit of blood on it. And he went, ‘That was 2 am.’ This time he wasn’t laughing.” Most of the people in Johnny’s life were aware of the red flags in the relationship. Whenever Amber traveled with Johnny, his team always rented out an extra hotel room in case a fight broke out and they needed to be sent to their own corners. “It was hard to see, because we knew him in his prior relationships and it was never like that. Voices weren’t raised. It was such a stark difference with Amber,” Gina said. “But if that’s what they want, then you’re going to support them and you’re going to hope that it works out, and hope they find peace and happiness.” The day of the L.A. wedding, Johnny and Amber rumbled through the streets of Beverly Hills in Johnny’s truck, making their way to his mother Betty Sue’s house as the sun was starting to set. Johnny’s bodyguard of more than ten years, Malcolm Connolly, followed behind. Malcolm ended up at Betty Sue’s driveway first, watching as Johnny pulled up and parked behind him. “Do you really want to do this?” Malcolm asked him in his gravelly Scottish accent. “No man, I don’t,” Johnny replied. Malcolm remembered Johnny had a look on his face that said it all. “Get back in the truck,” Malcolm said. “We’ll fucking drive to Vegas and we’ll talk about it in Vegas, and we’ll fucking face the music after. Get in the truck.” But Johnny wouldn’t get in. \u0000“No. No, I can’t. I wouldn’t do that.” And with that, they turned and walked inside. “I had him for two seconds, you know,” Malcolm said. “He didn’t have a best man except for [his son] Jack and he’s just a kid. He didn’t have someone to say let’s fuck off. Let’s get out of here. I tried.” “She don’t love him,” Betty Sue said venomously, loud enough for everyone in the small room, including Amber, to hear. As the ceremony started, Gina and Stephen stood in the back of the room, out of the way. There were maybe twenty people there in all. Amber and Johnny stood in front of the fireplace facing each other. Betty Sue was seated on one of the couches. All the other guests stood in the back. Johnny was wearing a short- sleeved black shirt, black vest, and black trousers. Amber wore a slinky white silk slip dress with a short lace veil over the back of her head. Jack stood to the couple’s right in a gray T-shirt holding the large black ring box. Patti Smith said a few simple words about love and the importance of communication. Then the hired officiant, a Russian woman named Maria Kharlash, owner of “Instant Marriage LA,” a one-stop-shop for marriage licenses and officiating, positioned herself to the right of Betty Sue and began to read the wedding vows in her thick accent. She turned to Amber and asked her to repeat the vows. As Amber solemnly repeated the vows, looking into Johnny’s eyes, his mother muttered something unforgettable. “She don’t love him,” Betty Sue said venomously, loud enough for everyone in the small room, including Amber, to hear. The officiant carried on. “Do you take Amber as your lawful wedded wife?” “Yeah,” Johnny drawled, casual as ever, as if she’d asked him to borrow a twenty. The officiant, her voice lilting, said, “You do?” “Yes, I do,” he responded, smiling, and swinging his head back toward the officiant. She asked Amber the same question. “I do,” Amber said softly. “She knows her lines,” Johnny joked. Jack handed his father the ring, which Johnny placed on Amber’s finger. The room looked on as Johnny and Amber sealed their vows with a kiss. Four days later, wedding guests arrived on Johnny’s private island. The attendees flew first to Nassau, followed by a trip by tiny seaplane or boat to Little Halls Pond Cay. They were greeted with a black skull and crossbones flag mounted on a rocky jetty, whipping in the warm winds. Johnny’s forty-five-acre island looked like a Corona commercial, covered in brilliant green flora, with bleached white sand beaches and crystal-blue waters. Johnny bought the island in 2004 for $3.6 million with zero existing infrastructure. He’d named the various beaches on the island after those he loved: Lily-Rose Beach, Jack Beach, Gonzo Beach (for Hunter S. Thompson), Brando Beach (for Marlon), Heath’s Place (for Heath Ledger), and Amber’s Cove (formerly known as Vanessa’s Beach). Johnny built a modest round bungalow with a thatched roof. The home was scattered with small trinkets and books and art, and the windows were covered in makeshift curtains made of scarves. As the guests arrived, the island was aflutter with activity ahead of Johnny and Amber’s second wedding ceremony. Chef Russell Borrill, Johnny’s freelance personal chef, had arrived by seaplane two days before the wedding guests and knew he had to get to work right away if he was going to pull off this job. Only a few days earlier, he’d gotten a call from Stephen asking if he could do a rush job catering Johnny and Amber’s wedding: breakfast, lunch, and dinner over several days for up to forty people on a remote private island. All the food would have to be flown in. It was a Herculean task, but Russell loved Johnny as a boss and as a friend, so he’d do whatever he needed to get the job done. He scrambled for a crew, but only his chef friend Robbie was around to help. Russell met Johnny in 2011 on the set of the Warner Bros. filmDark Shadows.He had previously been working for Martin Scorsese, and someone recommended him to Stephen Deuters and Nathan Holmes because Johnny needed to diet to become a “skinny vampire” for the film. “At first he was very quiet and timid around me. I remember one day I knew Lily-Rose [twelve at the time] was coming to set so I got this machine to make pizza dough because I knew she liked pizza. And he asked me, what’s that for? And I said, ‘I’m making pizza for Lily-Rose.’ From then on he was just sweet to me, and once he got comfortable around me he was just a good friend.” “Anything with Amber, I mean—it’s either an amazing kind of time, where everyone’s really happy, or they’re just at each other’s throats.” According to Russell, at first Johnny and Amber behaved the way you would imagine a couple newly in love would. They’d leave “lovey-dovey” Post-it notes for each other around the London house, a rental they lived in while Johnny was in production onAlice Through the Looking Glassin 2014. Russell lived in the same house, his room separated from theirs by only a small corridor. The house was large, with a courtyard and a wooden gate out front, and a comfortable kitchen for Russell to work in. Amber’s friends were often around, and Russell cooked for them, preparing large spreads of different themed foods: Portuguese, French, English. When it was just Johnny and Amber, Russell would prepare buffet-style dinners for them that they’d enjoy together in front of the TV while watching documentaries. But by the time of the wedding, Russell said he’d come to some realizations about Amber. “Anything with Amber, I mean—it’s either an amazing kind of time, where everyone’s really happy, or they’re just at each other’s throats. That’s just how it was, whether it was with her parents, whether it was with friends, or whether it was with Johnny—that always seemed to be what it was. There never seemed to be any calm. When she was being nice to Johnny it was very intense. And when she was horrible to him it was very aggressive.” The prep days before the wedding were chaotic. Russell was emailing with Stephen and the staff on the island trying to gather intel on guests and timing of festivities, but everyone seemed to be as confused as he was. This wasn’t how Johnny’s close team of personal assistants normally operated. Russell messaged Nathan Holmes to find out what was going on. “Nathan had no idea that the wedding was even happening.” At the time, Nathan was in Coomera, Australia, setting up the house where Johnny would stay during the filming of the next Pirates movie following the wedding. When Russell landed on the island, Amber and some of her guests were already there. According to Stephen, 90 percent of the guests were Amber’s friends and family. He’d asked Johnny if he wanted to invite Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter, or any other close friends aside from Bruce Witkin, but Johnny appeared embarrassed and told him he didn’t want to invite anyone. “It was very clear whose party it was, it didn’t feel like a mutual enterprise in any way,” Stephen said. The island staff was busy setting up lounging areas around the beaches, consisting of Moroccan rugs thrown on the sand with colorful oversized pillows and poufs, as well as white yurts farther inland for the wedding guests to sleep in. Chef Russell and his assistant were dismayed to realize there were more logistical challenges facing them. The kitchen was a fifteen-minute golf cart ride from the main dining area and bar, down by the beach. They’d have to transport all the food in chafing dishes, round after round. “It was just absolute chaos, to be honest,” Russell said. “I don’t work that way. But they just wanted me to do my best, I suppose.” Russell had to work with the supplies that he could get to the island last minute. Tara Roberts, the island manager, ended up ordering double of everything because she said Amber wasn’t communicating with her. “I tried to do the fig and prosciutto thing that Amber liked, but we couldn’t get fresh figs on the island, so we used dried, and it ended up being a completely different thing. I did a miso cod dish Johnny likes, filet of beef for a fancy dinner. Each day had a theme; we did a BBQ day with pulled pork and ribs, a Spanish day, Caribbean.” Russell recalled a particularly stressful moment one day in between the lunch and dinner service when Amber and her friends decided they wanted fish tacos. Robbie and Russell quickly defrosted fish, found some avocados in the fridge, and tried to turn out a platter of tacos all while prepping and cooking dinner for the dozens of guests. Russell described the mood of the wedding as tense. And drug-fueled. “I was offered MDMA on the beach by one of Amber’s bridesmaids,” he recalled. “They looked like fuckin’ zombies. If you need that much medication to get along with the person you love, there’s something fucking wrong.” That night, Johnny pulled Russell aside to give him a hug, thanking him. “He told Christi to look after me, and by that he meant give me the really nice wine. That was the Château Pichon, and I heard it was because Amber and her friends were going through it like nobody’s business. There were people walking around with the bottle in their hands, drinking out of the bottle,” Russell recalled. A single bottle costs nearly $500. “When you get a Pichon ’88, you want to decant it and aerate it. Guzzling it down your throat doesn’t really do it justice.” Russell was dismayed by the wastefulness. “Food would be sitting in chafing dishes for hours. People were hungover, people were doing drugs. Some meals were a waste, because no one would actually turn up.” On Saturday, February 7, the ceremony was held on the shoreline under a large square-shaped arbor draped in gauzy white fabric, each post wrapped in greenery and white roses. Amber walked down the aisle as Van Morrison’s “Sweet Thing” played over a PA speaker, arms linked with her dad, who was beaming. Amber’s sister, Whitney Henriquez, officiated, standing up front with a microphone, smiling ear to ear. Amber’s friend Rocky stood to her left in a mauve silk slip dress. Jack stood to Johnny’s right, his best man. The majestic Atlantic Ocean coursed in the background. After the nuptials, Amber and Johnny posed for photos taken with a bright flash beneath the cinematically lit arbor, the sky a rich navy blue. Johnny wore a white suit with a black vest and pocket chain. Amber’s dress was white patterned lace with long sleeves and a plunging back with a long sheer veil trailing behind her hair, which was swept in an elegant updo. They embraced and smiled for the clicking cameras. “They looked high as kites,” Bruce Witkin recalled. Of the thirty-odd guests, Bruce and his wife clocked several members of Johnny’s concierge medical staff. Dr. Kipper and his wife were guests, as well as Nurse Debbie Lloyd and Amber’s newly assigned personal nurse, Erin Falati. “Johnny looked sedated. Amber too,” Bruce said. “They looked like fuckin’ zombies. If you need that much medication to get along with the person you love, there’s something fucking wrong.” Suddenly, everyone looked up. There was a helicopter pulsing above. Amber and Johnny stuck their middle fingers indignantly to the sky. The bridal party followed suit, giving the bird and laughing. Later, the zoomed-out helicopter photos of the island ceremony appeared in several tabloids. Johnny’s friends assumed they were tipped off by Amber and her friends. Their theory was that the ceremony, which Amber had inexplicably moved from the evening to earlier in the day, was intentionally rescheduled to get ahead of the designated no-fly-zone window in order to accommodate the cameras. “They were bringing so much stuff from the mainland, someone could’ve figured out a wedding was happening,” Bruce Witkin recalled. “But I wouldn’t put it past her.” After the ceremony, people gathered up the shore for cocktails while DJ Kelly Cole spun music. Guests looked on as Amber threw her bouquet of white roses and eucalyptus into the evening air. It hit the sand without anyone catching it. The wedding reception was held in Amber’s very own Cafe Cabrones, the wooden cantina Johnny had built for Amber as a gift, a replica of the bar from the set ofThe Rum Diary. It was dive-bar chic, filled with beachy knickknacks, lit by neon bar signs and a Schmidt Beer stained-glass lamp. The most memorable toast of the night came from David Heard, who gestured to the island around him, proclaiming it was all Amber’s now. Amber and Johnny danced their first dance to “When I Get My Hands on You,” a ballad written by Bob Dylan and performed by the New Basement Tapes. They held each other closely and looked into each other’s eyes, lit by the videographer’s bright white box light and the sporadic flashes of cameras, the slow song punctuated by animated and elongated “whoops” and “yeahs” from guests looking on. At the end of the dance, Amber held her fist up to Johnny’s face and pretended to punch at him, smiling. Once seated, the toasts began. Bruce Witkin and his wife, Suzanne, remembered an emotional toast from Whitney, in which she was “basically just crying.” Johnny’s dad stood for a toast in a tan jacket and bolo tie; he looked down at Johnny and joked in a thick country accent, “Well, I’ve known this young fella for quite a few years.” The most memorable toast of the night came from David Heard, who gestured to the island around him, proclaiming it was all Amber’s now, before saying the same of Johnny’s numerous properties in LA. They were all hers now too. The toasts drew to a close and the music was turned up for dancing. Amber changed into a silver lamé slip dress and donned a crown made of flowers. She held hands and swung Jack around the dance floor. He smiled awkwardly while wearing a black Spitfire Wheels hoodie. Lily-Rose didn’t make it to the wedding. Betty Sue, who was being treated for aggressive cancer in Los Angeles, couldn’t come either. Johnny danced with Amber’s mom, Paige, who looked frail but happy, to “I’m on Fire” by Bruce Springsteen. Amber appeared effusive and joyful; Johnny detached and withdrawn. Later that night, sitting next to Gina Deuters at the reception inside the cantina, Amber leaned in and asked her, “Do you and Stephen ever fight?” Slightly weirded out by the question being posed on Amber’s wedding night, Gina replied, “I mean, no, not really,” Amber grabbed Gina’s arm in emphasis. “No. No. Gina. I mean, like . . .reallyfight?” Excerpted from the book HOLLYWOOD VAMPIRES by Kelly Loudenberg and Makiko Wholey. Copyright © 2025 by Kelly Loudenberg and Makiko Wholey.
