    "article_text": "Adi Alexander, father of Edan Alexander, an American hostage taken during the October 7th attack on the Gaza Strip, calls for Trump Administration to bring hostages home. Hamas claimed on Sunday that it would release American hostage Edan Alexander. Alexander, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, has beenheld captive in Gazasince the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel. \"As part of the efforts made by the brotherly mediators to achieve a ceasefire, Hamas has been in contact with the U.S. administration in recent days,\" a statement, translated into English from Arabic, from the terror organization said. \"The movement has shown a high level of positivity, and the Israeli soldier with dual American citizenship, [Edan] Alexander, will be released as part of the steps being taken toward a ceasefire, the opening of border crossings, and the entry of aid and relief for our people in the Gaza Strip,\" the statement continued. PALESTINIAN LEADER DEMANDS HAMAS RELEASE REMAINING HOSTAGES Edan Alexander, born in Tel Aviv and raised in New Jersey, is currently being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.(Hostage Family Forum) It's unclear when Alexander could be released. Fox News learned that the United States had informed Israel of Hamas’s intention to release Alexander as \"a gesture to Americans, without compensation or conditions.\" The United States told Israel that this move is \"expected to lead to negotiations for the release of hostages,\" according to the original framework, laid out by Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, which Israel has already accepted.

Santiago/Getty Images) Israel is preparing for the possibility that this move will be carried out. Khalil al-Hayya, who is Hamas’ political chief in Gaza, echoed the statement, reiterating \"the movement has shown a high level of positivity\" when speaking about the effort to free Alexander. GAZANS SPEAK OUT AGAINST HAMAS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 18 YEARS \"The Hamas movement affirms its readiness to immediately begin intensive negotiations and make serious efforts to reach a final agreement to end the war, exchange prisoners as mutually agreed upon, and manage the Gaza Strip by an independent, professional body, ensuring sustained calm and stability for many years, alongside reconstruction and ending the siege,\" al-Hayya shared in a statement. Raised in Tenafly, New Jersey,Alexander moved to Israel at 18 to volunteer for military service in the IDF’s Golani Brigade. He lived with his grandparents in Tel Aviv and at Kibbutz Hazor, where he was part of a group of lone soldiers. He was kidnapped on the morning of October 7 — a Saturday, he wasn’t required to remain on base. His mother was visiting from abroad, and like many lone soldiers, he had the option to go home for the weekend. But he chose to stay, not wanting to leave his comrades short-staffed on guard duty. There are 59 hostages still in Gaza, at least 24 of whom are assessed to be alive, includingAlexander, now 21 years old after having spent two birthdays in Hamas captivity. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters also released a statement following the announcement of Alexander's potential release, saying that they \"are embracing and supporting the Alexander family.\" Yael Alexander, the mother of hostage Edan Alexander, speaks during The  ‘Run for Their Lives’ rally and run in Central Park on the 100th day since the October 7 attack by Hamas, on Jan. 14, 2024 in New York City.(Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images) \"Should this release be confirmed, the release of Edan Alexander must mark the beginning of a comprehensive agreement that will secure the freedom of all remaining hostages,\" the statement read. \"President Trump, you've given the families of all the hostages hope. Please, complete your mission and bring them all home.\" NEW PULITZER PRIZE WINNER DISPARAGED ISRAELIS KIDNAPPED BY HAMAS ON OCT 7, QUESTIONED THEIR 'HOSTAGE' STATUS President Donald Trump recently marked his 100th day in office, and the families of the five Americans still held hostage urged him to reflect on his strategy and apply pressure on both Israel and Hamas, through both economic and diplomatic means, to secure therelease of all hostages. In addition, fifty members of Congress sent Trump a letter May 9 urging him to prioritize getting the remaining hostages out. \"As months have passed since the most recent exchange, we must keep the five remaining Americans and additional 54 hostages top of mind. The five American hostages include Edan Alexander, Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai and Judi Weinstein Haggai. Only Alexander is believed to be alive while Nuetra, Chen, Haggai and Weinstein Haggai were either murdered on October 7th or in captivity,\" the group wrote in a letter to President Trump. \"Our government’s most solemn responsibility is to keep Americans safe. With that responsibility in mind, we urge you to use all diplomatic tools at your disposal, in concert with our regional allies and partners, to ensure Edan’s release and the release of the remains of the deceased American hostages as soon as possible. Every day in captivity adds to the nightmare for the hostages and their families. We must bring them home now,\" - 50 members of Congress CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While there is evident frustration among the families of the hostages, who have made clear the Israeli government has not offered anywhere near the same level of support or communication provided by both the Biden and Trump administrations, they said that, ultimately, the adversary is the terrorist organization that captured, in some instances, and continues to hold captive their loved ones. \"Prime Minister Netanyahu must immediately fulfill the supreme moral obligation — and the demand of the vast majority of the Israeli public — to bring everyone back: the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for proper burial in our country,\" the organization said. \"No one should be left behind.\" Qatar and Egypt released a joint statement praising Hamas' claim that Alexander would be released. The countries also said they \"reaffirm their continued joint efforts in mediating the situation in the Gaza strip.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor and Army veteran Brett Velicovich shares insight into the United States' drone capabilities and how it compares to adversaries like Russia and China. The U.S. Marine Corps established an attack drone team earlier this year to respond to the rapid development of armed first-person view(FPV) drone technologyand tactics, offering a glimpse into the evolving landscape of modern warfare and how future battles could be fought. The Marine Corps Attack Drone Team (MCADT) will be based at the Weapons Training Battalion, Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia. The FPV drones used will offer squad-level lethality at a range of up to 20 kilometers, nearly 12.5 miles, for under $5,000, compared to more expensive weapons systems with less capability,according to a press releasefrom the service. The Marine Corps Attack Drone Team utilized the Skydio X2D drone as a reconnaissance drone on the range to showcase its capabilities on the battlefield.((DVIDS / U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Joshua Barker)) \"MCADT is committed to rapidly integrating armed first-person view drones into the FMF[Fleet Marine Force], enhancing small-unit lethality and providing organic capabilities that warfighters currently lack,\" said Maj. Alejandro Tavizon, the headquarters company commander at Weapons Training Battalion and officer in charge of MCADT. \"By leveraging emerging technologies and refining drone employment tactics, we are ensuring that Marines remain agile, adaptive, and lethal in the modern battlespace.\" Brett Velicovich, an Army veteran with extensive drone experience, told Fox News Digital that the creation of MCADT has been long overdue as the United States enters a drone arms race withadversaries like China, Russiaand Iran. A Neros Archer first-person view drone sits on a case during a demonstration range at Weapons Training Battalion on Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, March 7, 2025.((DVIDS / U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Joshua Barker)) \"For a while now, we haven't had the needed technology, the needed expertise in low-cost, highly scalable, lethal drone technology that, frankly, is going to be the next part of every piece of the next war that we fight,\" he said. Velicovich argued that the United States is far behind other countries, especially China, when it comes to theproduction of drone technology, and needs to start looking at drones not just as surveillance assets, but as a form of ammunition. He pointed to Russia’s war in Ukraine and the large-scale advancements in domestic drone production that have allowed Ukrainian forces to strike multi-million-dollar enemy tanks and vehicles with drones that cost a few hundred dollars.

FPV drones equipped with fiber optics offer key advantages over traditional UAVs.(Photo by Mykhaylo Palinchak/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)) Ukrainian Defense Minister RustemUmerov announced in Decemberthat Ukraine manufactured over 1.5 million FPV drones in 2024, including reconnaissance, kamikaze and long-range deep-strike drones. Domestically produced drones accounted for 96.2% of all unmanned aerial vehicles used by Ukrainian forces during the year. \"You have companies and manufacturing plants in Ukraine building 100,000 drones per month. One manufacturing plant is building 100,000 of these things per month. That's real scale. That's where we need to be,\" Velicovich told Fox News Digital. The WSJ, citing one Department of Defense estimate, reported that theU.S. has the capacityto build up to 100,000 drones a year.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking at a meeting of the Military-Industrial Commission in late April, said that almost all of the country’s defense enterprises had met their orders in full last year, highlighting Moscow’s efforts to ramp up its war machine. \"Over 1.5 million drones of various types were delivered, with about 4,000 so-called FPV drones equipped with virtual reality control systems supplied to the frontlines daily,\" Putin said,according to a transcriptreleased by the Kremlin. \"I know well, just as many of you here do, that these weapons are still in short supply.

Craig Singleton, a senior China fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that the Shenzhen-based company dominates the global drone market, controlling more than 70% of the worldwide market share. \"That’s alarming, because DJI drones are essentiallydata collectors for Beijing— giving China potential access to sensitive infrastructure imagery, flight patterns, and more.

Success will depend on scaling production, protecting sensitive supply chains, and turbocharging innovation,\" he said. \"It's not just about building drones — it’s about fielding smarter, cheaper and more resilient swarms faster than Beijing.\" DJI drones on display.((Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) | (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) / Fox News Digital) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The U.S. National Drone Association will host the Military Drone Crucible Championship in Florida later this summer, where the Marines and the Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment will compete to demonstrate their drone skills and tactics in modern combat.

    "title": "Putin proposes direct peace talks with Ukraine to end war",
    "article_text": "Vice President JD Vance describes the Trump administration's Russia-Ukraine war strategy and addresses the economic impact of tariffs on 'The Story.' Russian PresidentVladimir Putinon Sunday proposed direct talks with Ukrainian officials to finally bring an end to the war that began with a 2022 invasion by Moscow. Putin has thus far offered few, if any, concessions but is now proposing talks with Ukraine in the Turkish city of Istanbul that he says must be held without preconditions and with the goal of lasting peace. \"We are proposing that Kyiv resume direct negotiations without any preconditions,\" Putin said in a televised statement on Sunday. \"We offer the Kyiv authorities to resume negotiations already on Thursday, in Istanbul.\" The Kremlin chief said talks should address the root causes of the war and that he would speak to Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan later on Sunday about facilitating the negotiations, which he said could result in a ceasefire. RUSSIA'S PUTIN HOSTS CHINA'S XI AT MASSIVE MOSCOW MILITARY PARADE ON RED SQUARE Russian President Vladimir Putin gives a statement to the media at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, May 11, 2025.(Reuters) \"Our proposal, as they say, is on the table,\" Putin said. \"The decision is now up to the Ukrainian authorities and their curators, who are guided, it seems, by their personal political ambitions, and not by the interests of their peoples.\" The proposal was a welcome sign to Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyy, who said Kyiv was willing to negotiate but that Moscow must agree to a ceasefire. \"It is a positive sign that the Russians have finally begun to consider ending the war,\" he wrote on X. \"The entire world has been waiting for this for a very long time. And the very first step in truly ending any war is a ceasefire. There is no point in continuing the killing even for a single day. We expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire – full, lasting, and reliable – starting tomorrow, May 12th, and Ukraine is ready to meet.\" U.S. President Donald Trump said hundreds of thousands of lives will be saved if the \"bloodbath\" of the war could end. \"A potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Think of the hundreds of thousands of lives that will be saved as this never ending 'bloodbath' hopefully comes to an end. It will be a whole new, and much better, WORLD. I will continue to work with both sides to make sure that it happens. The USA wants to focus, instead, on Rebuilding and Trade. A BIG week upcoming!\" Putin's proposal for direct talks came hours after European leaders demanded on Saturday in Kyiv that the Russian president agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire or face new sanctions. But Putin dismissed attempts by some European powers to issue what he described as \"ultimatums.\" The Russian leader said he does not rule out that Moscow and Kyiv will agree on \"some new truces, a new ceasefire\" during negotiations in Turkey, saying that the talks would be the first step towards a \"sustainable\" peace. Russian President Vladimir Putin gives a statement to the media at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, May 11, 2025.(Reuters) Russia had proposed several ceasefires, including a moratorium on striking energy facilities, an Easter ceasefire and most recently the 72-hour truce during the celebrations marking 80 years since victory in World War Two, Putin said. Putin said that during the ceasefire in May, Ukraineattacked Russiawith 524 aerial drones, 45 sea drones, and several Western missiles. But Ukraine accused Russia of violating the temporary truces, including the May 8-10 ceasefire. Despite Putin's offer of peace talks, Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine on Sunday, injuring one person and damaging several private homes, Ukrainian officials said. Putin has maintained his conditions for ending the war despite pressure from Trump and warnings from European leaders. In June, he said Ukraine must officially drop its hopes of joining NATO and pull its troops from the entirety of the territory of four Ukrainian regions claimed by Russia. Moscow has also urged the U.S. to recognize Russia's control over parts of Ukraine. But Russian officials have said they are not against Kyiv's ambitions to join the European Union.

It was Kyiv,\" Putin said. \"Russia is ready to negotiate without any preconditions.\" Putin thanked China, Brazil, African and Middle Eastern countries and the U.S. for their efforts to mediate.

    "article_text": "Fox News Digital spoke with Navy SEAL veterans and the CEO of VetComm about the sewage \"crisis\" sickening SEAL candidates as they train off the coast of San Diego County. The U.S. and Mexico are one step closer to permanently ending a sewage crisis spewing from across the border into waters off the coast of San Diego,Environmental Protection Agencychief Lee Zeldin announced. \"This week, EPA transmitted to Mexico a proposed ‘100% solution’ that would PERMANENTLY END the decades-old crisis of raw sewage flowing in to the U.S. from Mexico. Next, technical groups from both nations will be meeting to work through the details necessary to hopefully reach an urgent agreement,\" Zeldin posted to X on Friday. Zeldin visited San Diego last month, where he announced talks with his government counterparts in Mexico to end the decades-long issue. The problem, blamed on outdated wastewater infrastructure, has persisted for decades, but has spiraled in recent years as Tijuana's population skyrocketed. The sewage water has not only threatened San Diego's massive tourism industry and local residents, but also poses a national security risk as it pollutes the waters where U.S. Navy SEAL members and candidates train, Fox Digital previously reported. EPA CHIEF ZELDIN LAUNCHES TALKS WITH MEXICO TO END SEWAGE HITTING SAN DIEGO, NAVY SEALS: 'OUT OF PATIENCE' The U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command is headquartered in San Diego and is where Navy SEAL candidates complete their arduous six-month Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training at the Naval Amphibious Base Coronado. In February, the Department of Defense's inspector general released a report finding that the Naval Special Warfare Center reported 1,168 cases of acute gastrointestinal illnesses among SEAL candidates between January 2019 and May 2023 that were attributed to the contaminated water. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin attends a meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House on March 13, 2025.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Veterans who spoke to Fox News Digital in April described the contaminated water as a national security crisis. \"This is a huge national crisis,\" Navy SEAL vet Jeff Gum, who was sickened by the water when he was working through SEAL training in 2008, told Fox Digital in a Zoom interview last month. \"Like half the SEAL teams are located in San Diego; the other half are in Virginia Beach. So when you've got half the SEAL teams who are getting exposed to this, then it's a major issue.\" EPA CHIEF TAKES ON MEXICAN 'SEWAGE CRISIS' FLOWING INTO US WATERS WHERE NAVY SEALS TRAIN Zeldin said last month that he and his counterparts in Mexico had launched good-faith talks to update infrastructure and water management facilities, adding that he zeroed in on the \"specifics,\" including drafting a \"comprehensive list of everything that we believe with full confidence is going to end the crisis\" on both the U.S. side ofthe border and Mexico's. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum speaks during a briefing.(Luis Barron/Eyepix Group/LightRocket) \"Now, if you don't do all of the other projects and all you do is clean up the current contamination, that feel-good moment will last about a day,\" Zeldin said during a press conference in San Diego last month. \"We have to stop the flow in. Mexico needs to fulfill its part in cleaning up the contamination that they caused.\" MEXICO IS POISONING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN A BORDER CRISIS ALMOST NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT\"We need Mexico to not just commit to all the projects that will stop the flow, but in order to actually finish this project, they're going to need to commit to that final cleanup,\" he added.

Imperial Beach's Mayor Paloma Aguirre sent a letter to Zeldin in March describing how the raw sewage has sparked one of \"America’s most horrendous environmental and public health disasters,\" as billions of gallons have polluted the Pacific Ocean since 2023 alone.

Many homeowners have been forced to place air quality monitors on their property so they know whether or not it's safe to go outside. And the economic impact is profound, with the sewage crisis hurting area tourism, maritime industry jobs and local property values.\" San Diego is one of thenation's top cities for tourism– behind other national treasures such as New York City, New Orleans and Washington, D.C. – attracting roughly 32 million tourists to the city in 2024, the San Diego Tourism Authority previously reported.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Could thisTampa Bay Buccaneersrookie defensive lineman be the answer to stopping the Philadelphia Eagles’ dreaded \"tush push\" play? Desmond Watson would’ve madeNFL Drafthistory as the heaviest player ever to be taken at 464 pounds with a 6-foot-6 frame, but the Bucs quickly added him as one of their 15 undrafted free agent signings. He’s been coined \"the tush push terminator\" due to his ability to stuff the line of scrimmage, and he was a sight to see at the team’s rookie minicamp. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Buccaneers nose tackle Desmond Watson during rookie minicamp Friday, May 9, 2025, in Tampa, Florida.(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) Watson has already been cutting weight as he tries to make the Bucs’ roster, coming in at 437 pounds for minicamp. Before the draft, Watson discussed his understanding that he would need to cut weight to realize hisNFLdream. He said stopping to eat while driving has been a main reason why he gained so much weight during his time with the Florida Gators. AT 464 POUNDS, FLORIDA DT DESMOND WATSON SEES WEIGHT LOSS AS PATH TO NFL \"Stopping while driving,\" Watson said when asked about bad habits he's tried to shed at his pro day. \"My biggest thing is keep going, get to where I need to get. There are stores and a lot of temptations. That's helped me immensely: Don't go inside the gas station. Pay at the pump. Because inside, it's snacks and all types of things like that. Don't pull over. If you're on the highway, stay on the highway until you get where you've got to go.\" The heaviest player in the NFL last season was Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle Daniel Faalele at 6-foot-8 and 380 pounds. And while there is no official record for the heaviest player in the NFL, many agree it was former Chicago Bears tackle Aaron Gibson, who weighed 410 pounds during his career from 1999-2004. Tampa Bay Buccaneers nose tackle Desmond Watson runs through a drill at rookie minicamp Friday, May 9, 2025.(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) Watson said he’s trying to eat better, especially when it comes to snacking. It’s been peanuts and almonds recently, and his main meals have changed as well. If Watson were to make the Bucs’ roster, they would have quite the formidable defensive interior, especially with his role model, Vita Vea, doing what the rookie hopes to in the NFL. At 347 pounds, Vea’s athleticism is a sight to behold on game day, as he swallows up quarterbacks and running backs alike with his ability to penetrate into the backfield at nose tackle. Watson doesn’t possess Vea’s athleticism, but he can move for his size. He also would’ve set the NFL Combine bench press record if he were present, as he repped 225 pounds 36 times at Florida’s pro day. Before the draft, Watson discussed his understanding that he would need to cut weight to realize his NFL dream.(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And considering the tush push – NFL owners are expected to discuss a potential ban on it later this offseason – having a duo like that in the interior could be the antidote for defenses stopping the short-yardage play that teams are trying to replicate from the Eagles. Watson is also hoping to play for the team he grew up near, as he’s from Plant City, which is east of Tampa.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. TheColorado Rockies’ abysmal start to their 2025 campaign hit a new low on Saturday, as they fell to the San Diego Padres, 21-0, at Coors Field, marking the team’s worst shutout loss in franchise history. Asthe Padrespoured it on, MLB fans couldn’t believe what they were watching, and their voices were heard on social media The on-field product has been atrocious all year, as their 6-33 record is by far the worst in MLB. But a football score was on the board at Coors Field, and the Rockies fans in the stands, who were vastly outnumbered by Padres supporters, were chanting for change. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Colorado Rockies fan reacts in the seventh inning against the Detroit Tigers at Coors Field.(Ron Chenoy-Imagn Images) \"The Rockies are losing 19-0 at the bottom of the fifth,\" one X user posted. \"The crowd is chanting, ‘Sell the Team, Sell the Team.’\" It’s not the first time Rockies owner Dick Monfort has heard chants to sell his team, as they haven’t had a winning record since 2018, losing over 100 games in each of the last two seasons. Longtime Denver Gazette columnist Woody Paige gave his take after watching Saturday’s game. MLB ROUNDTABLE: ARE THERE ANY GOOD TEAMS IN THE AL WEST? ARE THE GIANTS LEGIT? \"Delusional Dick Monfort said before season in rare form Rockies could have the best defense in history of baseball,\"Paige wrote on X. \"Roxhead was just a bit outside. Rockies lead MLB in errors and are last in fielding percentage. Go back to Greeley, Dick, and take the stink with you.\" A young kid held up a sign in the stands that read, \"My arm is rested if needed!\" showing how desperate fans are to see a good product. \"Send the Rockies to Triple-A,\" another X user posted. \"Leagues should step in and take teams from inept ownership, McCourt style,\" another wrote. \"Rockies ownership is just not worthy of having that team anymore. The [Nolan] Arenado trade was the absolute end.\" San Diego Padres first baseman Gavin Sheets is congratulated by shortstop Xander Bogaerts after his home run in the first inning against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field.(John Leyba-Imagn Images) On the other hand, some noticed that there were still a lot of fans in the stands despite the horrendous deficit. Just look at the crowd when Padres starFernando Tatis Jr.smacked a three-run homer to make it 19-0. One fan gave a perspective on why Monfort would never sell. \"It’s 20-0 #Padres in the sixth inning and fans are doing the wave having the time of their lives,\" an X user posted. \"This is why the Monforts won’t sell the #Rockies. Fans don’t care. Good weather, beer, etc. Pathetic for a true baseball fan.\" One of those true baseball fans urged Rockies supporters to stop going to games after watching last night. \"As a Colorado native it is absolutely embarrassing that people still go to the games then complain how bad they are,\" he wrote. \"…YOU ARE THE REASON THE MONFORTS WONT SELL. STOP ATTENDING AND GIVING THEM MONEY.\" In the end, at least the Rockies’ social media team is trying to find a way to make light of the situation.

    "article_text": "Check out the best highlights between the Cincinnati Reds and the Houston Astros. Houston Astrospitcher Lance McCullers Jr. said his team’s fans have turned on him in the worst way. After a rough start on Saturday, where he allowed seven earned runs in just one-third of an inning pitched against theCincinnati Reds, McCullers said he received death threats from Astros fans online. \"I understand people are very passionate and people love the Astros and love sports, but threatening to find my kids and murder them is a little bit tough to deal with,\" the 31-year-old right-hander said. \"So, just as a father, I think there have been many, many threats over the years aimed at me mostly, and I think actually one or two people from other issues around baseball actually had to go to jail for things like that. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Houston Astros starting pitcher Lance McCullers Jr. walks off the mound after a pitching change during the first inning against the Cincinnati Reds at Daikin Park.(Troy Taormina-Imagn Images) \"But I think bringing kids into the equation, threatening to find them or next time they see us in public, they’re going to stab my kids to death, things like that, it’s tough to hear as a dad.\" Houston Police Department andMLBsecurity have both been alerted to the threats against McCullers, the organization said. This was only McCullers’ second start for the Astros since the 2022 World Series, as he’s been battling through several injuries over the last two seasons. PAT MCAFEE SHARES MESSAGE WISHING DEATH ON HIMSELF, INFANT DAUGHTER FOLLOWING CANADA COMMENTS It was disastrous from the start as Elly De La Cruz hit a three-run homer after McCullers walked TJ Friedl and hit Matt McLain with a pitch to start the game. McCullers got an out following the home run, but two more walks and two hits after that quickly turned the game to a 5-0 lead. Manager Joe Espada had to pull the plug on McCullers, but the base runners on second and third were still his responsibility. They came across later in the 10-run first inning for Cincinnati. Houston Astros starting pitcher Lance McCullers Jr. walks off the mound after a pitching change during the Cincinnati Reds game at Daikin Park.(Troy Taormina-Imagn Images) Espada also spoke on the death threats against his veteran starter. \"There are people who are threatening his life and the life of his kids because of his performance,\" Espada explained. \"It is very unfortunate that we have to deal with this. After all he’s done for this city, for his team, the fact that we have to talk about that in my office – I got kids, too, and it really drives me nuts that we have to deal with this. Very sad, very, very sad.\" McCullers is a two-time World Series champion trying to find consistency on the mound once again. His injury problems began in spring training in 2023, when a muscle strain in his pitching arm shut him down. Then, in June of that year, he underwent season-ending surgery to repair a flexor tendon in his arm as well as remove a bone spur. McCullers’ rehab didn’t go as planned either. In July 2024, he was shut down from throwing and it was announced he would miss the entire season. He would finally get his chance back on the mound on May 4, where he threw three scoreless innings against the Chicago White Sox.

I just want to be a good pitcher for the Astros, and I believe I’ll get there. But, like I said, I just think that having to worry about that, worry about leaving town and leaving them and things like that or dropping her off at school, I just think… there should be some type of decency.\" McCullers, who made the All-Star team in 2017, owns a career 3.55 ERA with the Astros, even after his rough outing on Saturday. He also has a 3.47 ERA in 19 postseason games, all with Houston. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Jonah Williams, a freshman at Texas, appeared to spark some discontent from theFlorida faithfullate in the game.

    "title": "Maine teens battling state Democrats on girls' sports bill after enduring trans athlete chaos in high school",
    "article_text": "Maine teens Carrlyn Buck, Hailey Himes, Cassidy Carlisle and Lucy Cheney recount their chaotic high school sports experience in a state that aggressively protects trans athletes in girls' sports. A four-woman squad of Presque Isle High School student athletes helped lead a march onMaine's state Capitolbuilding in Augusta last week. They went to spar with state legislature Democrats over three bills that would ban biologicalmales from girls' sports– an issue that has sent their state and sports seasons spiraling into chaos in 2025. For three of them, it was their first political rally, and they were taking center stage. They had to wade through pro-transgender counter-protesters outside the building, and dismissive liberal lawmakers inside it. \"It was a little intimidating knowing they don't have the same beliefs as us,\" Hailey Himes, a first-time protester, told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Maine girls' track and field athlete Hailey Himes(Courtesy of Hailey Himes) But Himes said she realized she had to join the fight to protect girls' sports from trans athletes when her English teacher assigned her an essay on the subject on March 12. Just one month before that, Himes and other female athletes witnessed the pole vault jump that plunged their state into a national conflict, when a trans athlete won first place in girls' pole vault for Greely High School in early February. \"I watched this male pole vaulter stand on the podium and we were all just like looking we were like ‘We’re pretty sure that's not a girl. There's no way that's a girl,'\" Himes said. \"It was really discouraging, especially for the girls on the podium not in first place. So that motivated me to fight for them.\" So Himes, along with her track and field teammates Lucy Cheney and Carrlyn Buck, marched on Augusta, following the lead of fellow Presque Isle track athlete Cassidy Carlisle, who has already taken part in two marches in Augusta and trips to Washington, D.C., to meet with GOP leaders on the issue. The group had gained plenty of experience in dealing with controversies involving trans athlete, close to home for years together. Years earlier, the girls saw their high school rocked by a situation involving a trans athlete, when a biological male joined the girls' tennis team. \"We all heard of it from friends and none of us do tennis so it was just kind of a word of mouth kind of thing,\" Cheney said. \"At that point we couldn't really do anything about it because the administration agreed to let them play so we really just had to accept it, and really no one else on the team really wanted to accept it, but they had to.\" Maine girls' track and field athlete Lucy Cheney All four girls added that it quickly became one of the most-discussed topics in Presque Isle High School when it first happened, and it continued throughout the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years, before the trans athlete graduated last summer. Now, this year, they've all had to compete under the shadow of a national conflict between their state and President Donald Trump because Gov. Janet Mills and the Democratic majority have committed to keeping trans athletes in girls' sports. Mills' stance risks costing the state's high schools federal funding, while leaving Carlisle, Himes, Cheney, Buck and their teammates facing the anxiety of competing against trans athletes in the state's track and field playoffs. MAINE ROCKED BY TRANS ATHLETE DOMINANCE AT GIRLS' TRACK MEET AMID ONGOING LEGAL CONFLICT WITH TRUMP When the four teens got into the Capitol on Thursday, they came face to face with the individuals who were fighting to keep trans athletes in their sports. The Maine legislature's Democratic majority has been actively and aggressively resisting the Trump administration for months over the president's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order. But now three Republican-backed bills –LD 868,LD 233andLD 1134– were on their own floor to reverse its policy, and over a dozen Maine high school girls' athletes were there to fight the Democrats for it. \"They definitely asked a lot less questions to the people who they didn't agree with than the people who they did agree with, and you could tell they did not feel as compassionate,\" Cheney said of the Democratic leaders. \"They got emotional just when [pro-trans speakers] were sharing, and it seemed like they really cared for them, and they wanted to support them, and it didn't feel as much as they wanted to hear our side.\" Buck said that when the Democrats did come to them with questions, they seemed \"hostile.\" \"They just seemed more hostile toward our testimonies when they did ask questions,\" Buck said. \"It felt like a lot of questions were being pestering.\" Maine girls' track and field athlete Carrlyn Buck Still, the teens made sure to let everyone in the chamber know what it was they were dealing with, as the trans athletes competing in Maine's track and field playoffs threaten to upend their entire season. A trans-identifying athlete who competed for North Yarmouth Academy in Yarmouth, Maine, recently dominated the girls' 800-meter and 1600-meter events at the Poland-NYA-Yarmouth-Seacoast meet, prompting national outrage. \"For my teammates, and some of my best friends on the team that are in the events with [the trans athletes], it's really unfortunate for them, and just our team as a whole because those points will impact our team ranking,\" Himes said, adding that another local girl suggested her parents won't allow her to compete in the same event with a trans athlete. Buck added, \"It's not just about the points, it's also that our teammates are going to feel discouraged when placed in an event against them because they're going in already knowing that the outcome is decided, with playing against a biological male who is biologically stronger than them, so they have no chance.\" Carlisle is already very familiar with that feeling of defeat, having lost to the same athlete who dominated the Poland-NYA-Yarmouth-Seacoast meet in past running and skiing competitions, dating back to 2023. On top of that, she first had to experience changing in the same locker room with a male in seventh grade when a trans student was in her gym class. MAINE GIRL INVOLVED IN TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE REVEALS HOW STATE'S POLICIES HURT HER CHILDHOOD AND SPORTS CAREER Maine high schooler Cassidy Carlisle running in a track event.(Courtesy of Cassidie Carlisle) But even now, as an ascending crusader against trans inclusion in girls' sports, having attended marches, meetings of GOP attorneys general and even a Department of Justice press conference announcing a lawsuit against Maine over the issue, she says she still has a friend who is transgender. \"I communicate with them almost on the daily, we never have negative interactions,\" Carlisle said. \"For people that want to say we're not accepting, that's not the problem. We don't have a problem in general with trans people. We have a problem when it starts to impact our lives.\" Carlisle has saved her resentment, not for trans people, or even the trans athletes, but for Mills. \"She is directly looking at us and saying ‘I don’t care about you,'\" Carlisle said. \"When I vote next time, I'll absolutely take that into consideration.\" All four teens plan on making regular trips to the state Capitol to lobby on behalf of LD 868, LD 233, and LD 1134 until they are signed into law, as they seek to keep males out of their sports, and keep federal funding going to their schools. \"Our schools need federal funding,\" Carlisle said. \"So for [Mills], now she's not just looking at Maine girl athletes and saying ‘I don’t really care about you.' She's looking at students in Maine and saying ‘I don’t care about you and I don't care if your school gets funding, because I'm going to pick a fight that really doesn't need to be picked.'\" The DOJ has accused the state of \"openly and defiantly flouting federal anti-discrimination law by enforcing policies that require girls to compete against boys in athletic competitions designated exclusively for girls,\" according to a complaint obtained by Fox News Digital. Mills, the Maine Department of Education and the Maine Principals' Association have held firmly in support of continuing to enable trans inclusion in girls' sports across the state, citing the Maine Human Rights Act as the precedent for determining gender eligibility. Meanwhile, two Maine school districts have already taken matters into their own hands, as MSAD No. 70 and RSU No. 24 have each moved to amend their own policies to keep trans athletes out of girls' sports. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Presque Isle High School girls' athletes, from left, Carrlyn Buck, Hailey Himes, Cassidy Carlisle and Lucy Cheney.(Fox News Digital) And in addition to those school districts and young women like Carlisle, Buck, Himes and Cheyney, Mills and the Democrats may ultimately end up facing more internal resistance than external. Asurvey bythe American Parents Coalition found that out of about 600 registered Maine voters, 63% said that school sports participation should be based on biological sex, and 66% agreed it is \"only fair to restrict women’s sports to biological women.\" The poll also found that 60% of residents would support a ballot measure limiting participationinwomen’s and girls' sports tobiological females. This included 64% of independents and 66% of parents with kids under age 18. But so far, the governor has remained firm in opposing Trump on the issue, even at the cost of taxpayer-funded legal fees. \"I’m happy to go to court and litigate the issues that are being raised in this court complaint,\" Mills told reporters in April.

    "article_text": "Dr. Josef Wegner, Penn Museum curator who is based in Philadelphia, recently uncovered a groundbreaking discovery: an unknown pharaoh's tomb, dating back 3,600 years. (Credit: Josef Wegner for the Penn Museum) Archaeologists confronted by a false door at an excavation site were stunned to find that it led to the tomb ofEgyptian royalty.

    "article_text": "Apple provides ways to manage your messages more efficiently. Ever wondered why yourtext messagessometimes fail to send, show up pixelated or don’t appear at all on the other person’s end? It might not be your phone, but your carrier’s messaging support. Knowing the difference between SMS, MMS and RCS and how your carrier handles them can save you money, improve message delivery and ensure you’re using the full potential of your messaging app. A person texting on their phone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Before you can figure out which phone carrier fits your messaging needs, it helps to understand the differences between the three main types of mobile messaging — SMS, MMS and RCS. Each has its own capabilities, limitations and impact on your experience. Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals — plus instant access to myfree Ultimate Scam Survival Guidewhen you sign up! SMS (Short Message Service)is the most basic form of text messaging and has been around since the early days ofmobile phones. It allows users to send plain text messages with a strict character limit of 160 characters. SMS messages are sent over the cellular network, which means they work even if you don’t have a data plan or access to Wi-Fi. This makes SMS one of the most reliable messaging options available, especially for simple communication. It works for all phones, even older models, which makes it universal. MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service)builds upon SMS by allowing the transmission of multimedia content. With MMS, users can send images, videos, audio files and even GIFs. The character limit is significantly higher, typically up to 1,600 characters, although this can vary depending on the carrier. MMS messages also travel over the cellular network but require mobile data to send and receive. They do not require Wi-Fi, but because media files are larger, the reliability can vary. Some carriers compress MMS files or fail to send them if they exceed certain size limits, which means your carefully chosen vacation photo might arrive as a pixelated blur. RCS (Rich Communication Services)represents the next generation of mobile messaging. It is designed to upgrade the SMS and MMS experience by providing features that rival popular messaging apps like iMessage and WhatsApp. With RCS, users can send high-resolution photos and videos, audio clips, emoji, stickers and even read receipts and typing indicators. There is no character limit, andthe service works over Wi-Fior mobile data instead of over standard cellular channels. While RCS allows larger files, some messaging platforms or carriers may still apply soft limits or compress images/videos to ensure consistent performance. However, for RCS to work, both the sender and the recipient need to have RCS enabled on a supported messaging app and carrier. Google Messages is the most reliable app for accessing these RCS features, especially on Android devices. However, it should be noted that Apple devices do not support RCS natively because Apple relies on iMessage for similar functionality. HOW TO STOP SPAM TEXT MESSAGES ON YOUR PHONE Now that you know what SMS, MMS and RCS are, it’s important to understand how your phone carrier influences your messaging experience. From hidden fees to message delivery issues, the provider you choose can make a big difference in how well these technologies work. Not all carriers treat these messaging types the same. While SMS is often free and unlimited on many plans, MMS messages may incur additional charges, especially on prepaid or international plans. RCS messages, on the other hand, use mobile data or Wi-Fi and typically do not incur per-message fees, making them a cost-effective option if supported. For example, carrier A might offer unlimited SMS but charge for every MMS sent. Carrier B might include MMS in the plan but cap the number of SMS messages. Carrier C could fully support RCS, letting users send messages over Wi-Fi for free. Choosing the right carrier based on how you communicate can help avoid surprise charges. While SMS and MMS are universally supported, RCS still depends on carrier infrastructure and the messaging app being used. Some carriers support RCS only through their proprietary apps, which may not be compatible with all devices. Others support \"universal RCS\", which works across multiple platforms but still requires the right app, most reliablyGoogle Messages. If you’re hoping to use RCS features like high-resolution image sharing, read receipts and typing indicators, it’s important to ensure your carrier not only supports RCS but also supports it universally across devices and apps. Otherwise, your message may silently fall back to SMS or MMS if the recipient’s carrier or device does not support RCS. Illustration of text messaging on a smartphone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) ANDROID FEATURE PREVENTS SENSITIVE CONTENT IN GOOGLE MESSAGES As of May 2025, all major U.S. wireless carriers and most of their sub-brands and MVNOs (mobile virtual network operators) fully support SMS, MMS and RCS messaging. This includes both Android and iPhone users (with iOS 18.4 or newer for RCS on iPhone). You can expect full support for SMS, MMS and RCS on the following carriers: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, US Cellular, C Spire, Consumer Cellular, Cricket, Family Mobile, FirstNet, H2O Wireless, Metro by T-Mobile, Mint Mobile, Boost Mobile, Google Fi, PureTalk, RedPocket Mobile, Spectrum Mobile, Straight Talk, TracFone, Ultra Mobile, US Mobile, Visible and Xfinity Mobile. If you are using one of these carriers, you can expect the latest messaging features, including high-resolution media sharing, read receipts, typing indicators and the ability to send messages over Wi-Fi or mobile data. For the best experience, make sure your device is updated to the latest software and that you are using a supported messaging app. BEST WIRELESS PHONE PLANS RCS support is expanding internationally, with carriers like Orange and Sosh in France offering RCS on iPhones running iOS 18.4 beta. To check if your international carrier supports RCS on iPhone: HOW TO GET RID OF ROBOCALLS WITH APPS AND DATA REMOVAL SERVICES Apple and Google are rolling out support for RCS Universal Profile 3.0, which brings end-to-end encryption for RCS messages, enhancing privacy and security across platforms. Some carriers may still be updating their infrastructure, so check with your provider or device settings if you do not see RCS options enabled. If you use a smaller or regional provider not mentioned above, or if you plan to travel internationally, it is important to check with your carrier about its current support for RCS, especially if you use an iPhone. While international support for RCS is expanding, it is not yet universal. When you are abroad, reliable messaging becomes even more critical. SMS is the most dependable option and works almost everywhere, making it a safe choice for staying connected. MMS, on the other hand, can be inconsistent overseas due to differences in network standards and carrier agreements. RCS is even less predictable outside your home country, as it relies on mobile data or Wi-Fi and often does not function while roaming unless your carrier specifically enables it for international use. So, if you are traveling or using a less common carrier, always confirm whether your plan includes international MMS and RCS support. This will help you avoid unexpected gaps in communication or surprise fees and ensure your messages reach their destination reliably. GOT A BANK TRANSFER ALERT TEXT? IT MIGHT BE A SCAM. HERE’S WHAT TO DO Email-to-text is a feature that lets you send a text message to someone’s phone number directly from your email. To do this, you use a special email-to-SMS gateway provided by the recipient’s mobile carrier. For example, to text a friend on AT&T, you’d send an email to something like 1234567890@txt.att.net. However, not all carriers support this, and some may block the feature altogether to prevent spam or limit abuse. Even among those that do support it, there can be differences between how SMS (text-only) and MMS (media messages) are handled. Below are examples of the special email addresses (called gateways) that let you send text messages via email: AT&T Verizon T-Mobile If you rely on this feature, such as sending yourself reminders from your email or receiving system alerts to your phone, it is important to check whether your carrier supports it. Be aware that not all carriers clearly document this capability, especially smaller providers like Spectrum Mobile or Xfinity Mobile, which may restrict or not support it at all. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? A man texting on his iPhone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) To enhance your mobile messaging security, follow these best practices: 1. Avoid clicking on unknown links or messages and install strong antivirus software:Be cautious with links or attachments from unknown sources because they can lead tophishingor malware attacks. Also, install strong antivirus software on your device to protect against malware and viruses.

Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals — plus instant access to myfree Ultimate Scam Survival Guidewhen you sign up! Michael Bown and his reunited dog Millie(Petco Love) Michael's story began with a simple act of trust,leaving Milliein the care of a close friend. But as Michael recalls,\"She got a little spooked out on the walk with him and slipped out of her collar. This was in the East Village in New York, and she just sort of took off. I think she was trying to find me or figure out where I was.\" His friend chased Millie for blocks, desperately trying to catch up, even attempting to flag down cyclists and passersby. But Millie, a quick and determined pit bull mix, was gone. \"He called me on the phone and was just, you know, sort of, like, panting and freaking out saying, like, 'Hey. So sorry, but, you know, this is what happened. I'm not able to find her.'\" Michael immediately turned around, driving straight back to New York. He and his family searched the city until 2 a.m., visiting police stations and firehouses and posting in Facebook groups and lost pet websites. \"It was like looking for a needle in a haystack, especially in New York,\" he said. Michael Bown and his reunited dog Millie(Petco Love) 5 BEST PET TRACKERS The next morning, Michael's mother uploaded Millie's photo and microchip information toPetco Love Lost, a free, innovative platform that uses AI-powered photo matching to reunite lost pets with their families. Within minutes, Michael received two alerts, one with an image match and another with a microchip match. Both pointed him to an emergency vet clinic in Paramus, New Jersey. \"It was fantastic. I had never heard ofanything like that technology. It couldn't have worked better,\" Michael shared. \"From the time she went missing to when I was able to find her, I think it was only thirteen, fourteen hours. So, yeah, I mean, less than a full day from that happening, or from her, you know, getting off the leash, to me reuniting with her.\" Millie’s lost and reunited photos(Petco Love) BEST PET TECH GIFT GUIDE Millie's adventure was as harrowing as it was miraculous. After running nearly ten miles from the East Village to Harlem, she was struck by a car. A Good Samaritan stopped traffic, scooped her up and drove her to an emergency vet in New Jersey. The staff treated her for scrapes, cuts and a leg injury and uploaded her photo and microchip info to Petco Love Lost, where the system's AI matched her with Michael's report. \"The technology was great. All we had to do was upload a picture of her, and then we were able to just get matched back with her through that picture, and, sort of like the AI technology of her getting matched, with the veterinary group also uploading a picture of her. So, yeah, I mean, it's crazy technology these days and how quickly, you know, people can get reunited with their pets,\" Michael said. Michael Bown and his reunited dog Millie(Petco Love) HEARTLESS SCAMMERS ARE PREYING ON PEOPLE’S LOST PET ANGUISH Aaron Klein, director of product at Petco Love Lost, explained the magic behind the platform. \"Petco Love Lost uses photo-matching technology to instantly scan and compare a photo of a lost or found pet against our massive, centralized database of pets,\" Klein said. \"This includes photos from most animal shelters across North America, as well as from platforms like Nextdoor Neighbors by Ring and direct posts from community members. What used to take hours, manually searching shelter websites, scrolling through social media and piecing together information, is now done in less than a minute. \"The Petco Love Lost system automatically matches pets based on up to 512 data points, and as soon as you report your pet, we continue monitoring all incoming pets,\" Klein added. \"If we find a possible match, you'll get a new match alert via text and an email right away, so you never miss a lead. This real-time, automated approach makes reunions faster, more accurate and less stressful for pet parents.\" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Michael Bown and his reunited dog Millie(Petco Love) Reuniting lost pets with their families is a huge challenge, especially in a city as sprawling as New York.

    "title": "3 ridiculous ways to celebrate motherhood",
    "article_text": "After the death of her 8-year-old daughter, Maddy, Lisa Schein made the generous decision to donate Maddy's organs, giving the gift of life to four people. The Ohio mother was able to listen to her daughter's donated heart beat. Is there a better way to strengthen thebond between mother and childthan to share a ridiculous experience or two? Well, maybe. But celebrating motherhood in joyful, unconventional ways just might be highly underrated, because experiencing the absurd together has the power to create lasting memories and spawn all kinds of delight. Here are just three ways you might do that … if you dare, you rebel, you. GOOD SAMARITANS SAVE FLORIDA MOTHER, TWO SMALL CHILDREN FROM ATTEMPTED KIDNAPPER IN DRAMATIC VIDEO Maybe you’d like to say, \"Yes,\" to a kid’s request for mismatched crazy clothes for the day. Jill Baughan, her mom Mary Ellis, and their friend, celebrating in a most ridiculous way.(Photo by Mike Patterson) Say, \"Yes,\" to dessert first. Say, \"Yes,\" to a popup dance party. Turn on your plug-in disco ball (You have one of those, right? If not, I highly recommend.), turn on the dance music and celebrate — anywhere! The kitchen, the bedroom, even the bathroom. (Nothing like a disco shower experience first thing in the morning.) Say, \"Yes,\" to making impromptu \"movies\" for posterity. (Or just for fun!) Or maybe, like I did once, you could say, \"Yes,\" to an adventure in yucky weather. One rainy daywhen my daughter was 4years old, I had a lot to do and was cleaning the house when she approached me with this perfectly ridiculous suggestion: \"Mommy,\" she said, \"Let’s put on our swimsuits and get umbrellas and go walking in the rain.\" To be clear: my first thought was, \"This is wrong on so many levels.\" For one thing, we lived in a neighborhood where the houses were close together; we all knew everybody’s business. So, for sure, everyone would be able to see Jamie and me in our beachwear, ambling down the street like we did this all the time. I feared turning into a side show for the neighborhood circus. And, come on, it was so rainy. And I was so busy. Say, \"Yes,\" to making impromptu \"movies\" for posterity. (Or just for fun!)Or maybe, like I did once, you could say, \"Yes,\" to an adventure in yucky weather. I almost said, \"No.\" But when she looked at me with those excited, big blue eyes, I thought, \"Oh well. She’s only 4 once.\" So, we did it. We both put on our swimsuits, grabbed our umbrellas and went for a 20-minute walk in the rain. Forty years later, she remembers those 20 minutes. So, do I. And that priceless memory isalways God’s gentle reminderthat He made this day and provided all the opportunities for joy in it — no matter how small, no matter how goofy-looking — and that I should embrace them for all they’re worth. Which is quite a lot. Actually, children can teach us a thing or two about crazy gifts.  Our grandson once gave us a gift that he took special care to pick out, a perfectly ridiculous one that he just knew would fill us with grandparental glee: It was a coffee mug shaped like a golden toilet. I am not even kidding. And we continue to enjoy that one as it sits on our bookcase (Um … not in our kitchen with all the other boring mugs.) and makes us laugh. You can plan a road trip to nowhere. Life's a journey, not a destination.(iStock) So, maybe you could inhabit that spirit and give your child socks with your child’s face on them, a practical joke kit, or a goofy, raucous game, like Twister. Or you could turn the tables and gift your own mom with something absurd that would bring her joy. My mom’s birthday was December 4, and when I was a child, I thought the most wonderful birthday present I could give her was a corsage that she could wear during the Christmas season. Year after year, I \"blessed\" her with exceedingly tacky corsages made of fake snowmen, fake poinsettias and tiny goofy-eyed elves. I was proudest, though, the year I found a corsage with a disproportionately large aluminum snow shovel in the middle. I remember being absolutely ecstatic at the thought of my mom parading around all December with a snow shovel pinned to her chest. One day, long after I became an adult, I was thinking about those annual gifts I gave her and decided to \"bless\" her with another one, since all the corsages of old had mysteriously disappeared over the years. So I went to a florist, told her the story and asked if she could fashion me the tackiest corsage imaginable. And did she ever. It was perfectly hideous, and my mom loved it so much she made it into a Christmas ornament and hung it on her tree. And every Christmas thereafter we got to relive that joy. Ah, so much potential for a good time here. You might let your child plan the day — the food, the activities, the clothes — and just do it all! And that priceless memory is always God’s gentle reminder that He made this day and provided all the opportunities for joy in it — no matter how small, no matter how goofy-looking — and that I should embrace them for all they’re worth. Which is quite a lot. Plan a road trip to nowhere. Plan a \"yes\" day with a twist: You’ll say, \"Yes\" to everything (within reason!), but each yes comes with a crazy challenge, like \"Yes, we can put marshmallows on our pizza, but we have to talk in pirate voices the whole time we’re eating.\" Or maybe you’d like to plan something spectacularly ridiculous for your own mom, like I did. One year my mom and I were at the Virginia State Fair, passing a photo stand where you could get your picture taken with a chimpanzee. \"Mom, let’s get our picture taken with the chimp!\" I pleaded. I was 35 years old at the time and still begging my 70-year-old mom to let me do fun stuff. I know, I know. But to my disappointment, she repeatedly refused. Finally, I asked, \"Why not?\" But celebrating motherhood in joyful, unconventional ways just might be highly underrated, because experiencing the absurd together has the power to create lasting memories and spawn all kinds of delight. \"Well,\" she said, \"someone might look at it 50years from now and think it was a three-generation photo.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION To my sorrow, our chance to make merry was gone — until about 20 years later, when my relatives from Indiana were coming to my home in Virginia for a family event. One night two weeks before their arrival, I had an idea. \"How fun would it be,\" I thought, \"to secure a photographable chimp and redeem that lost opportunity from years ago!\" In short order, I found one, and on the appointed day, when I saw the chimp and her handler coming up our sidewalk, I told my mom, \"Put on some lipstick. I have a surprise for you!\" She was all excited this time, and for 90 unforgettable minutes, we were engaged in a primal frolic with this little ape — slightly scary since, by the end of our time together, we were all acting pretty much alike. The sweetest moment of the day, however, was when my mom and I at long last sat down for our photo with a chimpanzee. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That photo sits on my dresser today as a reminder that celebrating motherhood with ridiculousness in all its forms not only brings moms and kids great joy, but I believe it makes God smile with us. And that’s the best celebration of all. Jill Baughan is an author, speaker and podcaster. Her latest is\"No Matter What: 90 Devotions for Experiencing Unexpected Joy in Tough Times.\"",

    "title": "Army ditches helicopters for new radical air assault planes",
    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Brett Velicovich joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss Secretary's Hegseth's sweeping Army transformation, how Russia has responded to the U.S. minerals deal with Ukraine and the military bolstering drone technology. It’s a plane. It’s a helicopter. It’s both. Meet \"FLRAA,\" theArmy’s new tiltrotorfor Future Long-Range Air Assault. This is how the Army will island hop in the Pacific to fend off China. And by the way, Chinese President Xi Jinping has nothing like it. With a stunning announcement, the Army did more than ax 40 generals and open the door to AI.The Army bet its futureon this radical aircraft, whose engines swivel to take off and land like a helicopter, or fly high and fast like an airplane. This aircraft was on pace to enter the Army inventory in the early 2030s. PETE HEGSETH SAYS WEST POINT PROFESSOR WHO RESIGNED OVER TRUMP ADMIN EDUCATION OVERHAUL 'WILL NOT BE MISSED' Then came the Army shake-up. On May 1,Secretary of Defense Pete Hegsethdirected the Army to focus more on the Indo-Pacific. In that region, sheer distance and Chinese missile threat rings are locking out current helicopters. For the mission of air assault – when troops move into hostile and contested areas by rotary-wing aircraft – the hard truth is that the Army has a looming capability gap. The Army’s new tiltrotor for Future Long-Range Air Assault could be arriving much faster than expected. \"We can't actually do the large-scale, long-range air assault today\" with the speed and distance required in modern warfare, Maj. Gen. Brett Sylvia, commanding general of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, said last year. That’s unacceptable, given Xi’s growing appetite for military confrontation. So now the Army wants its revolutionary plane ASAP. On Wednesday, May 7, Army Chief of Staff General Randy George told Congress he wants to move it up several years, \"into the 2028 timeframe.\" Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll said he met with prime contractor Bell Textron to talk about a rush order. It’s easy to see why. The acronym-happy Army says \"FLRAA\" will fly 1,700 nautical miles without refueling and carry 12 passengers at a speed near 300 mph. Compare that to the 183 mph for the Black Hawk helicopter it is replacing. For pilots, the extra range, speed and survivability of a tiltrotor is a huge improvement on a helicopter. With a tiltrotor, they can zoom all over the battlespace with impunity and land any time, any place, in any conditions. You may be familiar with the V-22 Osprey, which first flew in 1989 and is now flown by the Marine Corps, Navy and U.S. Air Force special operations forces. As the first operational tiltrotor, the V-22 has had ups and downs, but beyond question, the V-22 proved itself in combat in Afghanistan. In another vivid example, in 2013, three battle-damaged Air Force MV-22s flew 500 miles from South Sudan to Entebbe, Uganda, spewing fuel, to save the lives of wounded Navy SEALs aboard. No wonder the Army pounced on the tiltrotor concept. However, the Army FLRAA is an all-new design based on the prototype V-280 Valor, which first flew in 2017.  It is slightly smaller than the V-22, with a 47-foot fuselage consisting of an aluminum structure and carbon fiber composite skin. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The big advance for \"FLRAA\" is in the tilt mechanism. On the older V-22, the whole engine nacelle housing pivoted. For the Army’s aircraft, that headache is gone. The two engine nacelles stay put on the wing. Only the propellors rotate, to switch between helicopter and airplane mode. This is much safer, and the improved rotor design also increases agility and maneuverability in low-speed flight while in helicopter mode. The Army’s new tiltrotor for Future Long-Range Air Assault will help improve US capabilities in the Pacific. The other major difference is that the Army’s tiltrotor is designed as a multi-mission aircraft. Door guns on each side mark it as a dedicated air assault platform. Contrast that with the V-22 which only has a tail gun. The new Army tiltrotor also carries so-called \"launched effects,\" which is military lingo for a variety of drones, such as self-protection decoys released to divert enemy fire, sensor drones to hunt targets, drones that do electronic warfare jamming and of course weapons drones for the kill. With its range capability, the Army tiltrotor can drive these drones deep into the battlespace. With drone operations in mind, software matters, so the plane has an open systems digital backbone ready to plug in new systems anytime. Even more intriguing, the FLRAA has the potential to fly by itself. At 240 knots it can deploy from Hawaii to the Philippines in 20 hours. In the future, \"FLRAA\" may also be able to self-deploy, moving to the theater by flying autonomously as an unmanned aircraft and rejoining with crews at a forward location. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It’s easy to see why. The acronym-happy Army says \"FLRAA\" will fly 1,700 nautical miles without refueling and carry 12 passengers at a speed near 300 mph. Compare that to the 183 mph for the Black Hawk helicopter it is replacing. The Army sees the Pacific islands like a chessboard. If China threatens, the tiltrotor \"FLRAA\" can move soldiers rapidly to land in contested areas and block Chinese forces from taking over. Now the Army just needs to give its radical new plane a proper name. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REBECCA GRANT Dr. Rebecca Grant is vice president of the Lexington Institute.",

    "title": "Trump’s 'Art of the Deal' diplomacy just delivered a global win—without a shot fired",
    "article_text": "Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss President Donald Trump’s announcement that India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire, following escalating tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations. Something extraordinary happened on Friday, but you likely didn’t see it in the headlines. In Washington, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) quietly approved a $2.3 billion bailout package forPakistan. On the surface, it was just another financial deal. But beneath the surface, this vote tied together three of the most pressing foreign policy theaters in the world: India-Pakistan, Ukraine-Russia, and U.S.-China. INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE'S EFFORT TO PULL INDIA, PAKISTAN BACK FROM THE BRINK OF WAR And the common thread? President Trump’s return to \"Art of the Deal\" diplomacy. The $2.3 billion IMF package included a $1 billion tranche under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and $1.3 billion under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF). But many experts were surprised this vote even happened, let alone passed. Just last year, Pakistan’s IMF bailout was contingent on its assistance in rearming NATO during theUkraine war. The Biden administration leaned heavily on Pakistan to support weapons transfers, using routes like the Nur Khan Airbase to send munitions to Europe. Indian soldiers stand guard as a Kashmiri Muslim man walks by,  in Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Friday, May 9, 2025. (AP Photo/Mukhtar Khan)(AP) This time around, the vote looked shaky. The Trump administration has made it clear it wants to end the war in Ukraine—and all wars that bleed U.S. taxpayers without clear gain. Meanwhile, India was lobbying both the IMF and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to block funding to Pakistan, citing terrorism financing concerns. And then came the vote. India abstained. So did China and Russia. The \"yes\" votes came from the United States and the United Kingdom. If you’re wondering why the U.S.—under Trump’s second term—would back a loan to a terror-linked state in the middle of a war, here’s the answer: because the deal was far bigger than Pakistan. Let’s unpack what likely happened. A Strategic Concession from India? India’s abstention puzzled many. It had taken a strong stand against the IMF loan, arguing that it violated basic principles of counter-terror financing. For India to let it slide signaled something else was in play. Trump’s first major diplomatic focus post-inauguration was reworking America’s global trade deals, and India was high on the list. The president had long called India the \"tariff king,\" and negotiations had been underway to reduce agricultural and industrial tariffs. In fact, Vice President JD Vance had been dispatched to New Delhi—not a low-level envoy. Vance's trip to New Delhi was key. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) There were signs a deal was close. But the momentum was disrupted by a major terrorist attack in Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan-based groups. The India-U.S. trade deal went into a holding pattern. Now, India’s IMF abstention appears less like inaction and more like a trade-off: a quiet concession, in return for favorable terms in the broader trade agreement with the U.S. Pakistan’s Clock Was Ticking Pakistan, for its part, was running on empty. It reportedly had only four days of ammunition left and faced near-total economic collapse. Though some NATO members had sent emergency aid, the U.S. itself has been moving to reduce entanglements with NATO and phase out military support in Ukraine. But here’s where it gets more interesting. The United States has long had an internal debate over Pakistan. During the Cold War and the war on terror, some intelligence factions saw Pakistan as a necessary partner—even when it meant funding terror groups like the Mujahideen. In more recent years, others have shifted toward India as the natural counterweight to China. This division within U.S. security circles matters, because it means that the fight over Pakistan is both internal and external. And yet, the Trump administration pushed the vote through. Why? One likely condition: a ceasefire in the India-Pakistan conflict. But there may have been another condition—one that had China’s fingerprints all over it. Why Did China Sit Out? If there’s one country that stands to gain from Pakistan’s financial boost, it’s China. Pakistan is deeply indebted to China through Belt and Road infrastructure deals. And more to the point, most of its military imports come from Chinese manufacturers. Any fresh IMF cash would likely end up buying Chinese weapons. So why did China abstain from voting on Pakistan’s loan? Simple: Because Trump likely barred it. Sources close to the matter suggest that strict terms were placed on the loan—stipulating that IMF funds cannot be spent on Chinese or Russian weapons systems, only American ones. That alone would have removed China’s incentive to back the package. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Add to that the increasing chatter over Chinese versus Western arms systems in the India-Pakistan conflict—and China’s abstention begins to make a lot of sense. One Vote. Three Wins. By pushing this IMF package forward under strict conditions, the Trump administration appears to have pulled off a remarkable maneuver: All in one vote. There were no headlines. No press briefings. No declarations of success. But that’s often how real power operates. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Critics may scoff at the idea that Trump is capable of high-level diplomacy. But for those tracking the architecture of global influence—this vote was not noise. It was signal. It was a reminder that American power, when wielded with strategic clarity, doesn’t need to announce itself loudly. It just needs to move the board. Quietly. Completely. Effectively. And if you were watching this one closely, you saw just that.

    "title": "Will President Trump protect the Christian Afghan refugees who fled here to escape martyrdom?",
    "article_text": "President Trump, during his speech to members of Congress on Tuesday, called the withdrawal from Afghanistan \"disastrous and incompetent.\" President Trump is not shy about defending Christianity. His bold commitment to protecting Christians from persecution is one reason that most evangelicals have voted for him in three straight elections. While I am grateful for his strong stand for religious liberty, I’m concerned by his administration’s recent actions threateningAfghan Christiansto self-deport \"immediately\" or face criminal prosecution, fines and deportation – to a Taliban regime likely to kill them for their faith in Jesus. Recently, many Afghan Christians who werelawfully allowedto enter the United States, who have been living and working lawfully in communities throughout the United States, received letters with a stark message: \"It is time for you to leave the United States.\" The message insists that the Department of Homeland Security \"is terminating your parole,\" the legal mechanism that allows these individuals to be safely in the United States. \"Do not attempt to remain in the United States – the federal government will find you… depart the United States immediately,\" the letter concludes. Similar letters were apparently sent to hundreds of thousands of others who entered the U.S. lawfully in recent years. But no case is as troubling asAfghan Christians, for whom deportation would likely mean martyrdom. Persecuted church watchdog Open Doors classifies Afghanistan as among the ten most dangerous countries for Christians. The situation for Christians has deteriorated since the Biden administration’s calamitous 2021 withdrawal that left the Taliban in power. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ENDS TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS FOR THOUSANDS OF AFGHANS AMID DEPORTATION PUSH Of course, President Trump himself surely did not draft this letter, and I suspect it was sent so broadly by leaders within the Department of Homeland Security without considering the full ramifications. As the administration hears from conservative evangelical leaders like Franklin Graham, I am praying President Trump will override whoever made the decision to send these letters and allow Afghan Christians to remain lawfully in the United States. At least long enough to submit and receive fair adjudication of asylum requests, or until Congress passes the Afghan Adjustment Act, a bill co-led in the last Congress by Senator Lindsey Graham, that would allow Afghans with parole to apply for permanent legal status so long as they clear stringent vetting processes. President Trump is absolutely right, of course, to prioritize border security, and most evangelical Christians are thankful for the quick progress he has made to secure our borders. Likewise, almost all evangelical Christians are glad that immigrants convicted of violent crimes are being deported. But evangelicals also agree with President Trump when he praiseslegal immigrationof individuals who come \"with love for the country.\" Afghans and others denied religious freedom abroad love this country profoundly – and certainly should not be expelled from it now. Likewise, evangelical Christians want the U.S. to keep its doors open to carefully vetted, lawfully admitted refugees, including Christians from countries like Afghanistan and Iran who faced persecution or even martyrdom in their repressive countries of origin. Last year, roughly 30,000 Christian refugees were resettled from the fifty countries where Open Doors US says that Christians face the most severe persecution in the world. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), my denomination, has repeatedly reaffirmed the biblical call to welcome refugees, who are individuals lawfully admitted to the United States after fleeing a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons such as their religion, race or political opinion. Seven in ten evangelical Christians, including about two-thirds of those who voted for President Trump last November, tell Lifeway Research, the SBC’s research arm, that they believe the U.S. has a moral responsibility to receive refugees. As President Trump concludes a 90-day review of the refugee resettlement, nearly 20,000 Christians, including a number of prominent evangelical leaders, have affirmed a statement urging him to restart refugee resettlement, with a particular concern for those persecuted for their faith in Jesus. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Of course, as Christians, we affirm the dignity of all people as made in the image of God, not only fellow Christians, so we’re also concerned with the wellbeing of those at risk of persecution who are not Christians. But it turns out that most refugees resettled in recent years have indeed been Christians, as are roughly four out of five of those vulnerable to deportation right now. I know that President Trump values legal immigration and is a champion for persecuted Christians. I hope and pray he’ll listen to the appeals of evangelical voters, override the actions of overzealous staffers and protect Afghans and others persecuted for their faith in Jesus.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us 23andMe, the genetic testing giant once valued in the billions, is now navigating Chapter 11 bankruptcy and notifying millions of current and former customers that they may be eligible to file claims as part of the restructuring process. The company and 11 of its subsidiaries, including Lemonaid Health and LPRXOne,filed for bankruptcy protectionon March 23 of this year in the Eastern District of Missouri. Customers were alerted Sunday that they have until July 14 to file claims for losses incurred. The bankruptcy follows a tumultuous 18 months for 23andMe, marked by declining sales, executive departures, and a devastating data breach that compromised sensitive personal information of nearly 7 million users. The breach, publicly disclosed inOctober 2023, exposed customers’ names, birth years, relationship labels, percentages of DNA shared with relatives, ancestry reports, and self-reported locations,according to TechCrunch. The fallout triggered multiple class action lawsuits and a wave of customer mistrust that severely undercut the company’s consumer-facing business. Now, customers who were affected by that breach — specifically those notified by 23andMe that their information was compromised between May and October 2023 — may file what is known as aCyber Security Incident Claim. Those who suffered financial or other damages due to the breach can submit a claim as part of the bankruptcy case. Customers with other types of grievances unrelated to the cyberattack, such as issues with DNA test results or the company’s telehealth services, may submit a separate claim under theGeneral Bar Date Package. Congress has alsoexpressed concerns about the privacy implicationsof the bankruptcy. 23andMe’s fall from grace was swift, and its woes were compounded by its ambitious but costly expansion into digital health and telemedicine, which included the$400 millionacquisition of Lemonaid Health in 2021. Originally aimed at diversifying 23andMe’s offerings beyond consumer DNA testing, the moves strained 23andMe’s financial resources and failed to deliver the growth the company needed. A proposed $30 million settlement in a related class action lawsuit over the cyberattackremains on holddue to the bankruptcy proceedings.

The firing was reported byCBS NewsandPolitico, and seemingly confirmed bya statement from Representative Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the Committee for House Administration. “Donald Trump’s termination of Register of Copyrights, Shira Perlmutter, is a brazen, unprecedented power grab with no legal basis,” Morelle said. “It is surely no coincidence he acted less than a day after she refused to rubber-stamp Elon Musk’s efforts to mine troves of copyrighted works to train AI models.” Perlmutter took over the Copyright Office in 2020, during the first Trump administration. She was appointed by Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, whoTrump also fired this week. Trump alluded to the news on his social network Truth Social, when he “ReTruthed”a post from attorney Mike Davislinking to the CBS News article. (Confusingly, Davis seemed to criticize the firing, writing, “Now tech bros are going to attempt to steal creators’ copyrights for AI profits.”) As for how this ties into Musk (a Trump ally) and AI, Morelle linked toa pre-publication version of a U.S. Copyright Office reportreleased this week that focuses on copyright and artificial intelligence. (In fact, it’s actually part three of a longer report.) In it, the Copyright Office says that while it’s “not possible to prejudge” the outcome of individual cases, there are limitations on how much AI companies can count on “fair use” as a defense when they train their models on copyrighted content. For example, the report says research and analysis would probably be allowed. “But making commercial use of vast troves of copyrighted works to produce expressive content that competes with them in existing markets, especially where this is accomplished through illegal access, goes beyond established fair use boundaries,” it continues. The Copyright Office goes on to suggest that government intervention “would be premature at this time,” but it expresses hope that “licensing markets” where AI companies pay copyright holders for access to their content “should continue to develop,” adding that “alternative approaches such as extended collective licensing should be considered to address any market failure.” AI companies including OpenAI currently face a number of lawsuits accusing them of copyright infringement, and OpenAI has also called for the U.S. government to codify a copyright strategy thatgives AI companies leeway through fair use. Musk, meanwhile, is both a co-founder of OpenAI and of a competing startup, xAI (which ismerging with the former Twitter).

When the company firstannounced Whoop 5.0this week, it said members who wanted the new device could either extend their subscriptions by 12 months or pay a one-time upgrade fee of $49 ($79 for the model with EKG sensors). This seemed inconsistent with Whoop’s overall value proposition, where it chargeshigher subscription prices(ranging $199 to $359 a year) while allowing customers to upgrade their hardware for free. More specifically, it seemed tocontradict a statement on the company’s websitepromising users free hardware upgrades if they’ve been members for at least six months. After customers began complaining, the company responded witha Reddit postboth announcing a more expansive upgrade policy and claiming to clarify its overall approach. Now, anyone with more than 12 months remaining on their subscription is eligible for a free upgrade to Whoop 5.0 (or a refund if they’ve already paid the fee). And customers with less than 12 months can extend their subscription to get the upgrade at no additional cost. While the company said it’s making these changes because it “heard your feedback,” it also suggested that its apparent stinginess was tied to its transition from a model focused on monthly or six-month subscription plans to one where it only offers 12- and 24-month subscriptions. “We also want to acknowledge that a previous blog article incorrectly stated that anyone who had been a member for just 6 months would receive a free upgrade,” the company said. “This was never our policy and should never have been posted.” There’s been a mixed response to these changes on the Whoop subreddit, with one moderatordescribing itas a “win for the community.” Other posters were more skeptical, with onewriting, “You don’t publish a policy by accident and keep it up for years. Removing it after backlash doesn’t erase the fact [that] it is real.” There were also a number of complaints from users who said they had 11 months left on their subscriptions, so they just missed the free upgrade cutoff.

The FT says it spoke to multiple sources who describe Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion in OpenAI to date, as a key holdout needed to approve the restructuring. While the crux of the negotiation is how much equity Microsoft will receive in the new for-profit entity, the companies are also reportedly renegotiating their broader contract, with Microsoft offering to give up some of its equity in exchange for access to OpenAI technology developed after the current 2030 cutoff.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The mobile controller companyBackboneunveiled itsBackbone Procontroller this week, which brings iOS and Android gaming experiences to the next level. A successor to the Backbone One controller, the Pro features full-size joysticks, re-mappable buttons, and Bluetooth compatibility, making for a more premium gaming setup. Unlike its predecessor, the Backbone Pro doesn’t need to be attached to a phone to work, meaning that you could use it as a wireless controller. That functionality gets extra useful when using cloud gaming services like Xbox Game Pass. You can play a game with the Backbone Pro controller on your TV, then plug your phone into the controller and instantly pick up where you left off on mobile. “Our thought is, gaming should be a lot more straightforward,” founder Maneet Khaira told TechCrunch. ”It needs to be really simple and work more like AirPods when you connect to screens.” Backbone is betting big on the growth of mobile gaming, which has only been accelerated by expanding cloud gaming options, but so far, Backbone seems to be cementing itself as the top hardware maker for mobile gamers. It also helps that Backbone isteemingwithcelebrity investorslike Ashton Kutcher, The Weeknd, MrBeast, Post Malone, and Amy Schumer, as well as gaming insiders like Discord founder Jason Citron. But as someone who doesn’t use Xbox Game Pass or similar cloud subscriptions, I never quite understood the hype around using a smartphone as a gaming device. I already have a Nintendo Switch, a device specifically made for gaming, as opposed to my iPhone, which is designed for a bazillion other things. So to test the Backbone Pro, I downloaded some games on my phone that I already play on the Switch, solely for the purpose of comparing the gameplay experience. The verdict? I have logged about 13 hours of gameplay on the iOS version of Stardew Valley over the last three days. I’m not fully sold on mobile gaming — answering texts while playing a game is kind of annoying — but I have to say, I’d much rather sit on the couch with the Backbone Pro than the Nintendo Switch, which prioritizes screen size over comfort. The Backbone Pro shines in its ergonomics. Sometimes, when you pick up a new iPhone, it feels familiar, yet slightly off, and it takes some time to get used to the feel of the new device before the differences stop being noticeable. This was the experience I had playing theNintendo Switch 2, as opposed to the original console. But the Backbone Pro’s design feels so naturally intuitive that I didn’t even experience those few minutes of discomfort. Seconds after plugging my phone into the controller’s USB-C port for the first time, I could play Hades — a game rife with chaotic button mashing — just as easily as I do on the Switch. I find the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller uncomfortable for games like Hades, so that’s saying something. “Meta, when they were designing the Quest, they would do multiple iterations of a headset [prototype] in a week, because they could print them and then rapidly test them, get feedback, and iterate,” Khaira said. He took inspiration from that technique when developing the Backbone Pro, investing heavily in the same kind of technology. Backbone 3D-printed over 9,000 different parts before landing on the model that ultimately shipped, making microscopic tweaks to every facet of the controller before arriving at something that makes Joy-Cons feel like Fisher-Price toys. This level of precision and versatility comes at a cost. The Backbone Pro retails for $169.99, which is a bit steep considering that you could buy a refurbished Nintendo Switch Lite for the same price. But for serious players who need that cross-device functionality, the Backbone Pro could be worth it. If you’re not moving back and forth between Xbox Game Pass on your TV and your phone, you could probably be fine with the original Backbone One, which is $99.99.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The tech industry seems to have two thoughts when it comes to where human workers fit into the AI-powered world they are creating: Either theythink that all the jobs, except perhaps their own, will be done by bots.(VC Marc Andreessenseems to thinkthat his work as an investor could never be automated). Or they think that bots will do the icky, boring work, acting as human companions in jobs while humans do brand-new jobs that the bot revolution creates. The latter is the one most supported by historical evidence. The World Economic Forumpredicts that 92 million roles will be displacedby current technological trends, but that 170 million new jobs will be created. For those who don’t have the economic power, or the intellectual interest, to get a master’s degree in AI and machine learning — especially the people who now occupy unskilled labor roles like warehouse workers — what does the bot-filled future look like for them? Amazon offered a hint of one sort of path on Wednesday when it announced major progress toward replacing warehouse workers with robotswith its new Vulcan robot that can “feel.” “Vulcan is helping make work safer by handling ergonomically challenging tasks, while creating opportunities for our teammates to grow their skills in robotics maintenance,” CEO Andy Jassyposted on X. In one breath, Amazon’sblog postabout Vulcan described how the robot will work alongside humans, gathering items from the warehouse’s highest and lowest shelves, so humans won’t have to climb ladders or bend down all day long. Humans will then gather items stored only in the middle and/or items that the new “feeling” robot still somehow can’t manage to pick up. In the next breath, Amazon talks about how it is training a small number of warehouse workers to become robot technicians, as it uses the bot for more of the warehouse picking role. “These robots — which play a role in completing 75% of customer orders — have created hundreds of new categories of jobs at Amazon, from robotic floor monitors to onsite reliability maintenance engineers,” the blog post said, adding that it offers a job retraining program for some workers to gain these robotic maintenance skills. Although Amazon didn’t say so, this would obviously not be a 1:1 conversion. It wouldn’t require an army of humans to oversee the robots in the same way it needs them to fulfill warehouse orders directly. Nor would everyone have the aptitude or desire to become robot mechanics. But the fact that Amazon included info on its retraining program alongside its Vulcan announcement is meaningful. That’s because there’s been very little evidence so far of what the post robots-doing-all-the-jobs looks like for working-class humans. (One AI startup founder evensuggestedto TechCrunch that in an AI-does-all-jobs world, the humans would somehow just live on government-issued welfare.) But perhaps, instead of grocery clerks, there would be “automation monitors,” much like we have one clerk overseeing every row of self-check today. Instead of fast-food cooks, workers would oversee the cook bots, and so on. Running robots becomes like operating a PC: Pretty much everyone needs to know how to do it to be employable. Then again, this fully bot future may never really materialize. Bots could remain the purview of only the biggest and most deep-pocketed companies — like with Amazon or how they’re used in things like automotive manufacturing — while the vast majority of retail, restaurants, and driving jobs continue to be done by humans. At least for decades more. Remember, Amazon is a company that was trying to sell its just-walk-out automation Amazon Go technologyto a wider retail/grocery industry. The retail industry is none too fond of its biggest competitor, Amazon, and wasn’t terribly interested. The tech was later found to beusing humans in India to watch and label videos, and even Amazon later scaled back on its use. Such tech (by Amazon or others) ishardly visiblein the wild today.

That may be a mistake. Best known for its stunning islands, sun-soaked cities, and deep historical roots, Greece has been quietly laying the foundation for something less expected — a modern, resilient tech economy. While the international spotlight often misses it, something real is happening on the ground, as this editor discovered this week across dozens of conversations in Athens. The country that once stood at the precipice of economic collapse hasn’t merely rebranded itself as an “Innovation Nation.” It’s turning clever marketing into reality, with policy shifts, investor interest, and a renewed sense of purpose around tech and entrepreneurship. Indeed, in asit-downThursday night with Greece Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, he made the case to TechCrunch that Greece isn’t just catching up but poised to surprise. “There is significant room to grow,” he conceded, but “the stars are aligned.” It didn’t happen without effort. Greece, Mitsotakis explained, made a “conscious decision” half a dozen years ago to expand beyond its traditional economic strengths like tourism and hospitality. “Tech could be 10% of our economy. This is perfectly doable,” he said, citing rising startup formation, increased capital flows, and an energized and growing base of founders and VCs in the ecosystem. Drawing from his own background in venture capital — he founded Greece’s first incubator in 2001 — he spoke with a fluency not often heard from heads of state. While Greece may be arriving late to Europe’s tech party, that timing could actually prove to be an advantage. Because it didn’t have the capital to make bad bets, Greece has sidestepped some of the inflated valuations and failed ventures that are weighing down more mature ecosystems. With a relatively clean slate, the country is moving quickly to seize on emerging technologies – particularly artificial intelligence. Thanks to AI, in fact, the Prime Minister sees a chance to potentially skip ahead. “We want to use technology to leapfrog,” he said. “Not just to catch up, but to actually do better than many European countries.” He pointed to Greece’s success in digitizing public services – saying it had far exceeded even Germany in some respects – and to pilot programs like a Microsoft-backed AI system that slashed government contract review times from hours to minutes. That dual strategy of nurturing startups while modernizing government forms the backbone of Greece’s AI ambitions. Mitsotakis envisions Greece as a laboratory for responsible innovation, particularly in areas like health, civil protection, and defense. “We’re not just talking about what the startup community is doing. We are the clients of the technologies. And we want to have more of a startup mentality as a government.” A critical ingredient of this transformation is talent. Greece is working to reverse the brain drain that saw thousands of skilled workers leave during the financial crisis. “The tax breaks are there — a 50% discount on income tax for seven years,” he said. But he also acknowledged that “people are not going to come back just for a tax break. They will come back if they have a good job opportunity, if they feel they can do something rewarding and they can actually grow their business in Greece.” To that end, in our conversation, we touched on recentchangesto Greece’s “Golden Visa” program that now grants a residence permit to third-country nationals who invest a minimum of €250,000 in a Greek start-up registered on the Greek National Startup Registry; we also talked about two new programs introduced last year designed to bring skilled foreign workers and entrepreneurs into the country. (While the last initiatives are still in the pipeline, they seem to reflect a broader commitment to openness.) “This is a global war for talent,” Mitsotakis said. “We need to make it easy for either Greek talent to return or for people who can live anywhere to choose to work here.” Mitsotakis also emphasized the importance of expanding tech beyond Athens, with hubs emerging in Thessaloniki, Heraklion, and other university cities. “This should also be a story about regional development.” Still, the Prime Minister acknowledged ongoing challenges, including the dizzying pace of legal reform, the need for more late-stage capital, and the complexities of doing business across the European market. But what he believes Greece now offers, unlike during the depths of the crisis, is predictability, stability, and momentum. “Is this country moving in the right direction?” he asked rhetorically. “The answer is yes.” For Mitsotakis, the ultimate goal is to make Greece’s progress “irreversible.” While legacy building isn’t his focus, he said, both Mitsotakis and the roughly 300 investors and founders who gathered for our sit-down — some of whom have happily moved back to Greece from the Bay Area, London and elsewhere — clearly want to ensure that the country’s progress continues apace. “We can’t [perform] miracles,” said Mitsotakis. “We can’t make up lost ground in a couple of years. But I think we’ve broken out of the vicious cycle of the past, and I do see technology as a great opportunity, both for the private sector and for the government.” You can catch our full interview with Mitsotakis below.

    "title": "PM promises tougher visa rules to fix 'broken' migration system",
    "article_text": "Sir Keir Starmer has promised to overhaul a \"broken\" immigration system, with plans to tighten English tests for all visa applicants and their adult dependents among the reforms being considered. Migrants will also have to wait 10 years to apply to settle in the UK, instead of automatically gaining settled status after five years, under the plans. Labour's long-awaited migration rules, to be published on Monday, will \"create a system that is controlled, selective and fair,\" the prime minister said. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the idea Sir Keir \"is tough on immigration is a joke\" and promised to push Parliament to introduce cap on migration. Labour have signalled the plan to raise English language requirements across every immigration route into the UK, though have not set out full details. For the first time, adult dependents will also be required to show basic language skills to help them integrate, find jobs and avoid exploitation. The BBC has been told the changes are likely to require a change to primary legislation, delaying implementation until the next parliamentary session in 2026. In a statement ahead of his speech on Monday, Sir Keir said: \"When people come to our country, they should also commit to integration and to learning our language.\" Critics have warned the rules may split families if partners or parents struggle to learn English. But research suggests that migrants themselves consider language important. In 2021, nine-out-of-ten migrants reported speaking English well, according toanalysis by the Oxford University Migration Observatory. Only 1% of migrants self-reported not being able to speak English at all. But those with poor English skills were much less likely to be employed, the analysis found. The move is part of a wider effort to \"tighten up\" what the prime minister called a \"broken\" immigration system. The changes will also end automatic settlement in the UK after five years. Most migrants will need to stay at least ten years before they can apply for settle status and begin the path to gaining full citizenship. At the same time, a \"fast-track\" settlement will be established for nurses, engineers, AI experts and others who \"genuinely contribute to Britain's growth and society\", Sir Keir said. A ten-year route to settlement would make the UK \"more restrictive than most other high-income countries,\" Madeleine Sumption, Director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, told BBC News. The main impact of the change will be \"more visa-fee revenue to the Home Office\", because people on temporary visas pay ongoing fees to be here, Ms Sumption said. A longer settlement process will also make it \"harder for migrants to settle in, because more will lack the rights that come with permanent status\", she added. But Sir Keir described the plans as a \"clean break from the past\" that will \"ensure settlement in this country is a privilege that must be earned, not a right\". Successive governments have tried unsuccessfully to reduce net migration, which is the number of people coming to the UK minus the number leaving. Net migration climbed to a record 906,000 in June 2023, and last year it stood at 728,000. The Immigration White Paper, brings together months of research by officials and will lay out Labour's plan to get tougher on migration in the wake of big gains made by Reform UK in the local elections. The threshold for Skilled Worker Visas is expected to be increased to graduate level, tightened from the current A-level measure - while the list of exceptions to the rules for temporary shortage visas in some industries will be narrowed. Home Secretary Yvette Cooperrevealed on Sunday that Labour will change the rulesto ensure care workers will no longer be recruited from overseas. Instead, firms will be required to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. Cooper told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg it is \"time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad\". These two changes will cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year, Cooper said. The Liberal Democrats said the immigration system was in \"tatters\" and trust had been \"shattered\". \"Labour must now focus on fixing our broken immigration system and the Liberal Democrats look forward to scrutinising the government's plans to ensure a system that works for our economy and our country,\" home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart said. The Conservative Party said that - while it agrees with the plan to end care worker recruitment from abroad - it would force a vote on a \"binding migration cap\". \"But Starmer and Labour will vote it down,\" Chris Philp predicted. He called Labour's plans \"too little\" and argued that if the government had stuck with Tory changes, net migration would have dropped \"by about 400,000\". Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said that his party's strong performance in the local elections in England was due to public anger about both legal and illegal migration.

    "title": "Zelensky challenges Putin to meet him after Trump demands Ukraine-Russia talks",
    "article_text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin \"personally\" in Istanbul on Thursday for talks over ending the war. His post on X came shortly after Donald Trump demanded Ukraine agree to Putin's offer of direct talks between the two countries in Turkey. \"There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. Personally,\" Zelensky wrote. He had earlier said his country was open to talks with Russia but only after a ceasefire was in place. Western powerscalled for a 30-day pause in fighting to begin on Mondayafter European leaders spearheading the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" met in Kyiv on Saturday. Putin's offer of direct talks followed that intervention. On Sunday Trump then posted on social media that Ukraine should agree to this \"immediately\" and it would provide clarity on whether there was a way to end the war. \"At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the US, will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly\" he said, adding: \"Have the meeting, now!\" In his post on X, Zelensky said he hoped Russia would agree to the ceasefire before the talks. \"We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy,\" he said. In a late-night address on Saturday, Putin invited Ukraine to take part in \"serious negotiations\" over the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Putin said he could \"not rule out\" the possibility that the talks could result in Russia and Ukraine agreeing \"a new truce\" - but did not address the calls for a 30-day ceasefire directly. The Russian leader said: \"This would be the first step towards a long-term, lasting peace, rather than a prologue to more armed hostilities after the Ukrainian armed forces get new armaments and personnel, after feverish trench-digging and the establishment of new command posts.\" Moscow has previously said that before Russia could consider a ceasefire, the West must first halt its military aid to Ukraine. On Saturday, the Ukrainian president played host in Kyiv to UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, France's Emmanuel Macron, Germany's Friedrich Merz and Poland's Donald Tusk, who later called Trump to discuss their plan. Sir Keir later told the BBC the US president was \"absolutely clear\" that their suggestion of an immediate ceasefire was a \"demand that must be met\". Appearing at a news conference with Zelensky, they warned that \"new and massive\" sanctions would be imposed on Russia's energy and banking sectors should Putin not agree to the unconditional 30-day ceasefire \"in the air, at sea and on land\". Russia and Ukraine last held direct negotiations in March 2022 in Istanbul, shortly after Moscow launched its invasion. More than three years later, both sides have agreed, in principle, to resume negotiations. But talks and a deal are very different things. Both sides seemingly retain their red lines, which are as far apart as ever. Donald Tusk says the massive Warsaw blaze was \"for sure\" ordered by the Russian special services. Capt Ibrahim Traoré, 37, is portraying himself as a champion of pan-Africanism. France, Britain, Germany and Poland met President Vlodomyr Zelensky to discuss an unconditional ceasefire. Global leaders urge Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire from Monday, warning of further sanctions if it does not comply. The prime minister is in Kyiv as leaders vow to \"ratchet up pressure on Russia's war machine\".",

    "title": "Mr Bates and Mr Loverman win top Bafta Awards",
    "article_text": "Mr Loverman and Mr Bates vs the Post Office were among the big winners at Sunday's Bafta TV Awards, in a night which threw up several surprise winners. ITV's dramatisation of the post office scandal, which ledto widespread public outcry about the false convictions of sub-postmasters, was named best drama series, while ITV was given a special award to recognise the show's impact. Producer Patrick Spence said: \"This story only had the impact it did because the people that watched it stood up and demanded action with rage.\" Meanwhile, Mr Loverman, about an elderly man whose marriage falls apart after his long-term affair with his male friend is revealed, won two major acting prizes. Accepting the prize for limited series on behalf of Mr Bates vs the Post Office, Spence said the response to the show proved that the public \"cannot abide liars and bullies\". He added that \"maybe it is a warning to those who are supposed to have our backs, that they'd better not abuse that power\", and said: \"Our show didn't change the law, the people of this nation did that.\" Managing director of ITV Studios, Kevin Lygo, said it was \"part of a long tradition on TV\" that such dramas \"shine a light on corruption, criminality, miscarriages of justice... but nothing, I think, has had quite the effects Mr Bates has had\". However, two of the drama's main stars Toby Jones and Monica Dolan missed out on acting prizes. Instead, best leading actress went to Industry star Marisa Abela, while best leading and supporting actor were won by Mr Loverman's Lennie James and Ariyon Bakare respectively. \"I didn't think this was coming my way,\" said James, describing his win as a \"fantastic honour\", as he paid tribute to his fellow nominees, including David Tennant, Martin Freeman and Richard Gadd. James paid tribute to Bernardine Evaristo, who wrote the book the series was based on. \"Thank you for trusting us with your characters,\" he said. Bakare, who played his lover, said: \"This award stands on the shoulders of those who came before me, those who might have been afraid to come out, to be who what they want to be, and I just say thank you for them.\" Abela, who has also played Amy Winehouse in the musical biopic Back To Black, described her leading actress win as \"insane\". She noted that she was cast in the show, about a group of young finance graduates, \"when I was in my final year of drama school, and my agent who signed me in my final year is here tonight - Saskia thank you so much for believing in me\". \"I've been filming Industry for about six years now, and Bad Wolf and HBO, the fact that they let us carry on after season one, it's mental. They're the best.\" Ruth Jones won best female comedy performance for her role in Gavin & Stacey: The Finale, which was broadcast at Christmas and brought the hugely popular sitcom to a close. She accepted her award in character as Nessa, beginning her speech in her alter-ego's distinctive Welsh accent and saying: \"I'm not gonna lie, this is immense. \"I've won a Bafta before, course I have, in 1976,\" she continued as Nessa. \"It was the Barry Arcade Fruit Technician Award.\" She concluded her speech - returning to herself - by thanking her \"dear, talented, lovely, kind, funny friend, James Corden, with whom I have shared this astonishing journey for the past 17 years, and without whom, Nessa Shanessa Jenkins would not exist\". There was another Gavin & Stacey reference elsewhere in the ceremony, when host Alan Cumming asked Rob Brydon to finally answer the question of what happened on the show's notorious fishing trip. As Brydon began to speak, Cumming interrupted: \"Oh, sorry, Rob. We've got to go straight on with the next award. We'll pick it up at next year's Baftas.\" Danny Dyer won best male comedy performance for his role in Mr Bigstuff, in which he played one of two brothers with wildly different personalities who try to patch up their sibling rivalry. Dyer said he was \"choked up\" by his win, before joking: \"So my acting was so bad, it was funny?\" In an expletive-laden speech, he said it had been \"an honour to share the screen\" with his co-star Harriet Webb, and thanked writer and co-star Ryan Sampson, who he called the \"best thing to come out of Rotherham\". \"He's never done the same thing twice, which is not something I can say,\" Dyer joked. \"You wrote this part, you won this for me mate, I really appreciate it.\" Blue Lights, a police drama set in Northern Ireland, was named best drama series, Alma's Not Normal won best scripted comedy, and EastEnders was named best soap, in the year it celebrates 40 years on air. The Traitors missed out on the three prizes it was nominated for, with best reality series instead going to Channel 4's Jury: Murder Trial, which restaged a trial of murder in front of two juries of ordinary people. Baby Reindeer star Jessica Gunning won best supporting actress, repeating her earlier wins at the Golden Globes, Emmys and SAG Awards. \"Gosh thank you Bafta, wow,\" she said. \"I sometimes do this kind of cheesy thing where I look back on the younger me and moments in my life, and I imagine the kind of then me, seeing me now, and think, 'little did we know'.\" She said she was so proud to be part of this show before saying co-star Richard Gadd \"changed my life\". She concluded by wishing him: \"Happy birthday, nipple.\" Rylan Clark and Rob Rinder won the factual entertainment prize for their Italian travel series, Rob & Rylan's Grand Tour. \"We didn't know what we were making when we landed in Venice,\" reflected Clark. When he saw the programme's edit, \"I said, 'we're either going to get cancelled or we're going to win a Bafta, and I'm so glad it was the latter!\" Rinder thanked the pair's mothers, \"for allowing us to be our true selves,\" before Rylan joked: \"And BBC Arts, now we won a Bafta, can we have a bigger styling budget?\" Elsewhere, Would I Lie To You? was named best entertainment programme. Panelist Lee Mack noted the show had never previously won despite being nominated eight times, and joked that Bafta's change of sponsor to P&O Cruises, which host Rob Brydon used to front adverts for, might have had an effect. \"The whiff of scandal hangs heavy in the air,\" laughed Brydon, but reassured the audience: \"I stopped those adverts five years ago, there is no connection.\" Kirsty Wark, who left BBC Two's Newsnight last summer after 30 years, received the Bafta Fellowship, the highest honour bestowed by the British Academy. Wark said it was a \"privilege and an honour\" to be recognised. \"Things have changed so much and so radically since the 70s, not least the shoulder pads, the office drinks trolley, and film crews the size of football teams, but always the chance to learn and go. \"I've been lucky to interviews politicians to painters, architects to economists, musicians and a few monsters.\" She paid tribute to her colleagues, saying: \"It takes a village to raise a programme.\" BBC Breakfast's Post Office Special won the news coverage award, while BBC Sport's Paris 2024 Olympics took the sport coverage prize. Strictly Come Dancing won the memorable moment prize, the only award of the night voted for by the public, for blind comedian Chris McCausland's waltz to You'll Never Walk Alone His professional dance partner Diane Buswell said it was \"such an honour\" to win, joking: \"Chris is not here tonight, but that's what happens when he insists on driving himself to these kinds of events.\" \"He told me to say that,\" she laughed, before reading out a message on McCausland's behalf: \"After 22 years in comedy, I win a Bafta for dancing. It hurts, but I'll take it.\"",

    "title": "The rare disease in a remote town where 'almost everyone is a cousin'",
    "article_text": "Before Silvana Santos arrived in the little town of Serrinha dos Pintos more than 20 years ago, residents had no idea why so many local children had lost the ability to walk. The remote town in north-eastern Brazil is home to fewer than 5,000 people, and is where biologist and geneticist Santos identified and named a previously unknown condition: Spoan syndrome. Caused by a genetic mutation, the syndrome affects the nervous system, gradually weakening the body. It only appears when the altered gene is inherited from both parents. Santos's research marked the first time the disease had been described anywhere in the world. For this and later work, she was named one of the BBC's 100 most influential women in 2024. Before Santos arrived, families had no explanation for the illness affecting their children. Today, residents talk confidently about Spoan and genetics. \"She gave us a diagnosis we never had. After the research, help came: people, funding, wheelchairs,\" says Marquinhos, one of the patients. Where Santos is from in São Paulo, Brazil's largest and wealthiest city, many of her neighbours were members of the same extended family originally from Serrinha. Many of them were cousins of varying degrees, married to each other. They told Santos that many of people in their hometown couldn't walk, but that no-one knew why. One of the neighbours' daughters, Zirlândia, suffered from a debilitating condition: as a child, her eyes moved involuntarily and over time, she lost strength in her limbs and needed to use a wheelchair, requiring help with even the simplest tasks. Years of investigation would lead Santos and a research team to identify these as symptoms of Spoan syndrome. They would go on to find 82 other cases worldwide. At the invitation of her neighbours, Santos visited Serrinha on holiday. She describes her arrival as stepping into \"a world of its own\" - not just because of the lush scenery and mountain views, but also due to what seemed to be a notable social coincidence. The more she walked and spoke with locals, the more surprised she was at how common marriages between cousins were. Serrinha's geographical isolation and little inward migration mean that many of the population are related, making marriage between cousins far more likely and more socially acceptable. Worldwide, marriages between relatives were estimated at around 10% in the early 2010s. More recent data shows the rate varies widely, from over 50% in countries like Pakistan, to 1-4% in Brazil and less than 1% in the US and Russia. Most children born to pairs of cousins are healthy, experts say. But these marriages do face a higher risk of a harmful genetic mutation being passed down through the family. \"If a couple is unrelated, the chance of having a child with a rare genetic disorder or disability is about 2–3%. For cousins, the risk rises to 5–6% per pregnancy,\" explains geneticist Luzivan Costa Reis from Brazil's Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. A 2010 study led by Santos showed that more than 30% of couples in Serrinha were related, and a third of them had at least one child with a disability. Santos set out to find a diagnosis for the people of Serrinha and she began planning a detailed genetic study, requiring multiple trips and eventually leading to her relocating to the region. She drove the 1,250 miles (2,000km) to and from São Paulo many times in the early years of her research. She collected DNA samples door-to-door, chatting to locals over coffee and gathering family stories, all the while trying to locate the mutation causing the disease. What was supposed to be three months of fieldwork turned into years of dedication. It all led to the publication in 2005 of the team's study revealing the existence of Spoan in the Brazilian hinterland. Santos's team found that the mutation involves the loss of a small fragment of a chromosome, which causes a gene to overproduce a key protein in brain cells. \"They said it came from Maximiano, a womaniser in our family,\" recalls farmer Lolô, whose daughter Rejane has Spoan. Lolô, now 83, married his cousin and never left Serrinha. He still tends cattle and relies on family to care for Rejane, who struggles with daily tasks. But the genetic mutation behind Spoan is far older than the legend of Old Maximiano: it likely arrived more than 500 years ago with early European settlers in the north-east of Brazil. \"Sequencing studies show strong European ancestry in patients, supporting records of Portuguese, Dutch, and Sephardic Jewish presence in the region,\" says Santos. The theory gained strength after two Spoan cases were found in Egypt, and further studies showed that the Egyptian cases also shared European ancestry, pointing to a common origin in the Iberian Peninsula. \"It likely came with related Sephardic Jews or Moors fleeing the Inquisition,\" says Santos. She believes more cases may exist globally, especially in Portugal. Although there's been little progress toward a cure, tracking patients has brought some change. Rejane recalls how people used to be called \"cripples\". Now, they're simply said to have Spoan. Wheelchairs brought not just independence, but also helped prevent deformities - in the past, many with the condition had been left simply lying in bed or on the floor. As Spoan progresses, physical limitations worsen with age and by 50, nearly all patients become fully dependent on carers. This is the case for Inés's children, who are among the oldest in Serrinha. Chiquinho, 59, can no longer speak, and Marquinhos, 46, has limited communication abilities. \"It's hard to have a 'special' child. We love them the same, but we suffer for them,\" says Inés, who is married to a second cousin. Larissa Queiroz, 25, the niece of Chiquinho and Marquinho, also married a distant relative. She and her husband, Saulo, only discovered their common ancestor after several months of dating. \"In Serrinha dos Pintos, deep down, we're all cousins. We're related to everyone,\" she says. Couples like Larissa and Saulo are the focus of a new research project which Santos is also involved in. Backed by Brazil's Ministry of Health, it will screen 5,000 couples for genes linked to serious recessive diseases. The goal is not to stop cousin marriages, but to help couples understand their genetic risks, says Santos. Now a university professor, she also leads a genetics education centre and works to expand testing in the north-east of Brazil. Though she no longer lives in Serrinha dos Pintos, every visit feels like coming home. \"It's as if Santos is family,\" says Inés. The BBC Radio Northampton Headfest event offers children the chance to learn, relax and get moving. Buckinghamshire Mind promotes its schools' peer support scheme during the run of Dear Evan Hansen. Scientists test Mounjaro and Wegovy - the big beasts of weight loss medication - to see which is best. Patients who spend a long time in hospital will be able to \"visit\" some popular landmarks. Georgia says it took a \"psychotic episode\" before anyone took her mental health seriously.",

    "title": "BBC team's tense encounter with sanctioned Israeli settler while filming in West Bank",
    "article_text": "Dust was rising on the track. It hung in the hot midday air as the white jeep came towards us. The driver was less than a minute away. \"I think it's Moshe Sharvit,\" said Gil Alexander, 72, a devout religious Jew who tries to protect Palestinian shepherds from intimidation by Jewish settlers. Over the last yearwe've been documenting his work with shepherdsin the northern Jordan Valley, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The man approaching us was placed under sanctions by Britain and the EU last year after they said he had used  \"physical aggression, threatened families at gunpoint, and destroyed property as part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace Palestinian communities\". In a casereported by our colleagues at BBC Eye Investigateslast year, a Palestinian grandmother alleged that Moshe Sharvit had forced her to leave her family home in October 2023. Ayesha Shtayyeh also said he pointed a gun at her head and threatened to kill her. \"We've been here for 50 years…What have I ever done to him?\" she asked when BBC Eye interviewed her. She said her family's troubles began after Moshe Sharvit established a so-called 'outpost'- a settlement that is illegal under both Israeli and international law - chasing away the family's sheep, damaging property and constantly threatening them. The alleged incident with the gun was the final straw. Moshe Sharvit did not respond to BBC Eye's requests for a response to Ayesha's account. Back on the mountainside, the man accused of this violence stopped his car and approached us. Nodding towards Gil Alexander he asked us: \"Do you know he's a very dangerous guy?\" When our translator explained to Moshe Sharvit we were from the BBC he said: \"Ah the BBC… great lovers of Israel…\" He went on to call us bad and dangerous people. Addressing our translator he said: \"So, do you understand that they're the people who are most dangerous to the State of Israel?\" Then he phoned the police, asking them to come to the scene. When he wasn't calling the police he filmed us filming him. Moshe Sharvit and Gil Alexander represent starkly different visions of Israel's future. Moshe Sharvit believes all of the West Bank - which settlers and the Israeli government call Judea and Samaria - were given by God to the Jews. In this he is supported by senior ministers in the government, including the Minister of Finance, Bezalel Smotrich, and the Minister of Public Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir. Both men are settlers and leaders of far-right ultranationalist parties. Smotrich has said Gaza will be \"totally destroyed\" and that its people will be \"totally despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places\". The 'other places' he envisages are foreign countries. Ben-Gvir, who is responsible for the police, has convictions for inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organisation. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, relies on the support of the far-right settler movement to keep his government in power. He criticised the sanctions imposed on Moshe Sharvit and other settlers, saying his government viewed the move \"with great severity\". US sanctions against Moshe Sharvit were dropped when President Donald Trump came to power. The UN's top court ruled last year that Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is against international law and that all settlement activity is illegal. Israel rejects this and argues that settlements are necessary for security, citing lethal attacks by Palestinian gunmen on settlers, such as the killing of three people last January in the West Bank. Settlement expansion is anathema to Gil Alexander. He considers himself a Zionist, but within the existing borders of Israel. These are the frontiers that existed before it seized the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war, after neighbouring Arab countries launched a surprise attack. He is part of a network called the Jordan Valley Activists – Moshe Sharvit calls them \"anarchists\" - offering solidarity, and working for peaceful co-existence with the Palestinians. \"What they [the settlers] want to see happen,\" Gil Alexander told us, \"[is] that it will be an area completely free of Arabs. It isn't Moshe. It's all the people above him who sent him here. Meaning from the top\". Moshe Sharvit's desire to have the Jordan Valley empty of Palestinians is shared by the leader of the regional council, a government-supported body, David Elhayani, who has visited the sanctioned settler. In his air conditioned office about 15km (9 miles) from Moshe Sharvit's settler outpost he told us \"the notion of settler violence is an invention of the anarchist, extreme left meant to harm the settlement image\". As for the future of the Palestinians, he was emphatic. They should go to neighbouring Jordan. \"This country needs to be free of Arabs. It's the only way. It's a global interest. Why global? Because the minute there won't be Arabs here it will be a Jewish nation for the Jews who won't have to hurt each other, there won't be conflict, there won't be anything.\" Gil Alexander and Moshe Sharvit have a history of antagonism. During an altercation on a Palestinian farmer's land in January 2023, Moshe Sharvit says Gil Alexander tried to seize his firearm from its holster. While speaking to our translator he produced a video of the incident on his phone. \"You can see Gil Alexander. Same hat and glasses. That's me. Here you see he grabs my gun.\" Gil Alexander says he was acting in self-defence after Moshe Sharvit had grabbed his walking stick, and the phone of his friend and violently pushing it. He says he feared Moshe Sharvit was going to use the weapon. As a result, Moshe Sharvit got a restraining order which forbids Gil Alexander from being within 2.5km (1.5 miles) of his farm. The police have charged Gil Alexander with illegal possession of a weapon (the one he allegedly tried to take from Moshe Sharvit) and assault. The issue will be considered by the Israeli courts. Moshe Sharvit himself is the subject of a restraining order forbidding him to approach a Palestinian family living near his outpost for six months, since March this year. During our encounter the settler claimed that Gil Alexander had breached his restraining order by taking us to the high ground overlooking the valley. The peace activist told us later that he had mistakenly strayed just over half a kilometre inside the area of the order. Although Moshe Sharvit's settlement is illegal, even under Israeli law, it has not been removed. Human rights organisations and numerous eyewitnesses testify that the Israeli army and police frequently stand by while settlers attack Palestinian villages. The violence has escalated sharply since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 kidnapped, and which triggered the Gaza war. According to a report issued by the UN office for Humanitarian Affairs there were 1,804 attacks by settlers against Palestinians in the period January 2024 to March 2025. The Israeli human rights group, Yesh Din (There is Law), reported that only 3% of complaints made against settlers resulted in a conviction. In six days last month - from 22 to 28 April - the UN recorded 14 incidents involving settlers that left 36 Palestinians injured. In the tense atmosphere on the mountainside, and wanting to avoid any escalation, we decided to leave. As we walked away, Moshe Sharvit went to his jeep and drove ahead of us, stopping where the track turned down the mountain. Our way out was blocked. There was no-one we could appeal to apart from the man preventing us from leaving. Again, he phoned the police asking them to come. Gil Alexander phoned the police and his lawyer. Our team was worried that more settlers would come. Then something surprising happened. I suggested to Moshe Sharvit that he should agree to be interviewed. After a brief pause, he said: \"Bring the camera.\" What followed was less an interview, than a series of declarations. He was doing the work of God, he said. Why did local Bedouin shepherds say they were very afraid of him? I asked. \"No, that is a lie. They're telling stories so the world will think we're crazy. It's not true. It's all lies that are built on lies of dozens of years of lying…\" he said. \"The Arabs, since the formation of the country and before - all the past 77 years they've been preoccupied with harming the people of Israel, harming the land of Israel and causing the nation of Israel to be miserable and pitiful. But they don't understand that the harder they try, the Lion will wake from his sleep and within one day we'll end this story.\" He repeated the analogy of the Lion later in the interview saying, in what sounded like ominous words, that the Palestinians were \"pushing the lion so hard into the corner that there will be no choice left but to finish this story\". \"7 October was small. One day it'll be big.\" As for peaceful co-existence such as Gil Alexander supports, he said there was \"no such thing as peace with enemies who try to destroy you\". Moshe Sharvit's brother Harel was killed fighting in Gaza in December 2023. His world is the pastureland, the stony hills of the Jordan Valley, his sheep and cattle, the bed and breakfast he has opened. He produced a glossy video, replete with a backing track of American country music, to promote his venture. He spoke with contempt for the British sanctions against him. They were a new kind of antisemitism, he claimed. \"The minute someone tries to hurt me I get stronger. My spirit…I receive energies, my spirit continues on its mission, I continue advancing forward and planting roots deep into the land of Israel. I'm not bothered by Britain or America or anyone.\" Then he drove away. We were free to move on. Later as we were having lunch in a café about 15km (nine miles) away, a policeman appeared, looking for Gil Alexander. He went with the police officer for questioning. After about an hour he returned, telling us he had been ordered not to enter the Jordan Valley for two weeks. He plans to lodge his own complaint against Moshe Sharvit over the incident. We went to Gil Alexander's home in a kibbutz inside Israel that overlooks the Valley. Gunmen from the Palestinian city of Jenin fired at the kibbutz two years ago. Gil Alexander is not a pacifist. If he is attacked by Hamas or any other group, he will defend himself. He said: \"A son of our friends, two months ago he was killed here by a terrorist. He was a soldier in the reserves, 46 years old with six children. He volunteered for the reserves to protect me.\" \"If the army hadn't been there, they would have come here. He was killed while defending me. And today he is buried next to my two sons.\" But Gil Alexander seemed weary as we sat drinking tea amid the bright red flowers of his well-tended garden, and the fluttering yellow flags that symbolise Israel's hostages held in Gaza. He spoke of a beloved nephew killed fighting in Lebanon in an earlier war. Did he not, I wondered, at the age of 72, think about retiring from the struggle and enjoying his garden? He laughed. There was no chance of that. After two of his sons took their own lives – one was in the army, the other was about to enter the military – he had found a purpose in working for what he calls the \"humanitarian\" ideals of Judaism. \"After the tragedies of my sons, if I don't find meaning in life, I'll go crazy… And the things I do, are things I believe in. And these are things I also got from my father who was in the French underground during World War Two and fought for French liberation but was against any type of occupation and said, 'Occupation is Occupation.'\" Two days after our encounter with Moshe Sharvit, a lone woman peace activist filmed him banging on the window of her car and rocking the vehicle. The woman is clearly frightened by the intimidation. Moshe Sharvit acts as if he has nothing to fear. With additional reporting by Oren Rosenfeld and Nik Millard. Edan Alexander, 21, is believed to be the last living captive with US nationality in Gaza. British-Israeli hostage Emily Damari, 28, who was held captive in Gaza, is visiting the UK for the first time since her release. Emily Damari, who is visiting the UK for the first time since her release, tells of how happy she is to be \"home finally\". One family said the hostages were at risk \"every day\" they continued to be held captive. UN agencies say they will not co-operate with the proposed system because it appears to \"weaponise\" aid.",

    "title": "Tributes paid to teenagers who died in swimming incident in Donegal",
    "article_text": "A vigil has been held in memory of two teenage boys who died after getting into difficulty in the water near Buncrana in County Donegal. They have been named locally as 16-year-old Emmanuel Familola, originally from Nigeria, and 18-year-old Matt Sibanda, from Zimbabwe. Hundreds of people attended the special service at St Mary's Oratory in Buncrana which was led by the Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown. He began the service by welcoming Matt and Emmanuel's family. Bishop McKeown said there was a \"real palpable sense of gloom hanging around everybody today\". However, he said he was struck by the number of people who turned up for the service. He said the Buncrana community pulled together in the face of tragedy, which he said showed their strength, but he also highlighted their welcome of people from abroad to the local community. \"They are strong looking inwards and supporting one and another, and strong looking outwards welcoming newcomers and that's a real blessing on everybody,\" he said. Irish government minister and Donegal TD, Charlie McConalogue, was among those who attended the service and said the news had come as an \"absolute shock\". \"The community came out, really really strongly for the prayers service here, to try and provide some support and comfort to their families and friends,\" he said. \"We've had our share of tragedies over the years in Inishowen and Buncrana and unfortunately it has visited two families here again.\" Mr McConalogue said he would work with the local community and liaise with the families and schools to ensure they received support. Miriam Killeney lives in Buncrana and attended the service. She said many in the community are still in shock about the incident. \"It was such a beautiful day and suddenly we got the news, the town has suffered tragedy in the past, so for a lot of people it brought that back up again for them,\" she said. \"That is going to be something that will be very important going forward to support the children in the school and the parents.\" The tragedy unfolded on Saturday afternoon after the Irish Coast Guard received a report that there were a number of people in difficulty in the water. Later that evening, an18-year-old male's body was recovered from the water. A juvenile who was rescued from the water was taken to Letterkenny University Hospital, where he died in the early hours of Sunday morning. A third teenage boy managed to make it back to shore. Evelyn McLoughlin principal of Scoil Mhuire in Buncrana, where Emmanuel attended, said there were \"no words\" that could \"fully capture the pain and sorrow that we are feeling\". \"We are truly heartbroken,\" she said. Paying tribute Ms McLoughlin added: \"Emmanuel embodied the true ethos of Scoil Mhuire, he was known for his warm personality, gentle humour and thoughtful nature. \"He immersed himself fully in our school community and was highly regarded by staff and students alike.\" She added that the school will provide support for Emmanuel's brother, who is a student there, \"through his unthinkable loss\". Kevin Cooley, principal of Crana College, where Matt attended, added: \"As beautiful as today is, there is a dark cloud of sadness over Buncrana. \"Matt joined Crana College in January 2024, he was welcomed with open arms,\" he said. \"He was preparing for his leaving cert at the start of June. He was a determined young man, he was the most respectful young man you could ever meet. \"We share our thoughts and prayers to the families.\" Mr Cooley also thanked the emergency service for their efforts. Speaking to BBC News NI, local priest Fr Francis Bradley said: \"You can only imagine they [the families] are absolutely devastated. \"It's difficult to witness, but powerful to witness a mother's love, her feeling of total abandonment. \"Last night, a mother sitting cradling her son, I've looked at the Pietà, but to see it brought alive in that way is very moving. \"To hear her call out his name, even though there was no hope, to know all I could do was stand in silence in the hope that there was a good shepherd calling his name. \"Here we do not view them as immigrants or asylum seekers, to us they are parishioners.\" Joe Joyce from Lough Swilly RNLI said when they got the call they immediately launched two lifeboats. \"One of the teenagers managed to make it back ashore,\" he told BBC News NI. A former RNLI crew member, who was on the lough in his own personal boat, assisted the incident. \"He came on scene and and pulled another 16 year old out of the water. \"Around nine, half nine, we were starting to scale down the search as we lost the daylight and the Coast Guard had their drone team up. \"An object was detected in the water. That object turned out to be a person, an 18-year-old teenager. \"He was recovered by the Coast Guard to the pier in Buncrana, where a doctor on scene pronounced him dead.\" The mayor of Inishowen, Sinn Féin's Jack Murray, told BBC News NI the community is \"devastated.\" \"On what was such a happy day, Donegal won the Ulster Championship, the Sun was shining and then that filtered through, the worst news possible that these two young men have lost their lives, it is horrendous,\" he said. Paying tribute to the two teenagers, Murray said they were \"of different nationalities from Africa, who were talented young boys\". \"It is just so sad that their lives could be cut short so tragically,\" he said. \"This is a community that has been visited by tragedy far too often,\" he added. \"I would like to think and hope that their families know that we are all thinking of them.\" 100% Redress councillor Joy Beard said people in the area are in \"shock.\" \"We are absolutely heartbroken,\" she said. Beard added that Buncrana is a \"strong community\" that will \"rally around\" the families. She also paid tribute to the emergency services and coast guard. Fianna Fáil councillor Foinán Bradley said that the three teenagers involved in the incident \"came to Buncrana a number of years ago with their families\" and that they had \"integrated really well into the community.\" He added they were \"known by many people here in Buncrana\" and the community was \"very, very fond of them\". He described the community as \"numb\" following the incident. \"There is a very sombre air over the whole area this morning.\" Two other teenage boys, under the age of 18, were rescued from the water. Mr Doherty and his family work seven days a week at the attraction, and hope to reopen in the summer. Restrictions will apply to Mullingar in County Westmeath, Milford in County Donegal, and Kells-Oldcastle in County Meath from Tuesday 6 May. The fire broke out at Doagh Famine Village in Ballyliffin at approximately 16:00 local time on Saturday. Donegal TD Pearse Doherty says the the church in Derrybeg has been completely gutted by the blaze.",

    "title": "Concerns over strangulation-during-sex presentation that was made for schools",
    "article_text": "A council has been criticised for creating a PowerPoint presentation that appeared to endorse strangulation during sex that was intended to be used in schools. The slides included the sentence: \"It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first.\" Bridgend council said it was part of a \"draft version\", never shown to children and the slides were dropped following feedback from professionals. But experts and politician Natasha Asghar have asked why the Welsh authority \"deemed appropriate\" to include an illegal act in any draft of the presentation. Bridgend council commissioned the school resource from their in-house domestic abuse service, called Assia, and a presentation was leaked last year. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan were among those sent an open letter raising concerns of parents and professionals that deliver sex education lessons. Claire Waxman, the Victims' Commissioner for London, also told The Times that the material was \"deeply concerning\". Former Conservative MEP Baroness Jacqueline Foster also spoke out, telling Parliament that non-fatal strangulation was a criminal offence that could be punished with imprisonment. The Welsh government said non-fatal strangulation was \"dangerous and illegal\" and added the resources Bridgend council gave schools \"make this clear\". Bridgend council have since issued a\"clarification\" statementthat said \"the slides were part of inaccurate or out-of-date information that was either updated or removed\". But it raised further questions as to why the material and messaging existed in the first place, so BBC Wales asked them for more information. The authority said the slide was part of an \"active presentation\". \"The idea was that the presenter would use the slide to stimulate debate before advising participants that non-fatal strangulation is actually a dangerous, illegal crime which carries significant penalties,\" said Bridgend council's statement. They said that part of the presentation was dropped following feedback from professionals consulted during the drafting process. Sources including Michael Conroy, who trains professionals like teachers to deliver sex education lessons, have told the BBC that they understand the presentation was offered to schools and youth settings to show. However, the council denied this and said it was only sent \"as a work in progress with a small group of professionals for their insight and views\". \"It was presented as this is what we will teach to children, there was intention there,\" said Mr Conroy, a former personal, social and health education co-ordinator in schools, who did not receive the presentation from the council directly. When Mr Conroy first saw the slide in question, he said it was \"terrifying\" and there was not any additional information about safety on other slides. \"The idea that someone is saying it's ok to strangle a person if you get a yes is atrocious,\" added Mr Conroy ofMen at Work. \"It's the opposite of safeguarding, it's a terrible breach of trust.\" Welsh Parliament member Natasha Asghar said she had been contacted by \"concerned parents\" and called for Bridgend council to release the material. \"I'm requesting both versions of this PowerPoint presentation,\" said the Conservative Senedd member who sits on the Children, Young People and Education Committee. \"We shouldn't disguise the fact those responsible for creating the content originally deemed this appropriate. We need to look into this to make sure children are being taught properly.\" Despite the council saying that the slide was not to be used in isolation, she said: \"It does not negate from that fact those responsible for the content originally deemed it appropriate. This is where I have my concerns.\" Ms Asghar said she had written to the council leader but was without a reply. The example has raised concerns from parents, experts and politicians about what is being taught to children in school during sex education lessons. \"I know government will dismiss this as the work of just one sex ed provider but all parents should ask to see the materials their children are being taught in PHSE,\" said Fiona Mackenzie, who led a campaign to end the so-called rough sex defence in the Domestic Abuse bill. \"This is up to government to take control of sex ed materials, opening sex ed up to the market means anyone can set up to tell children how to have sex.\" Bridgend council said in a statement: \"We want to again confirm that local children are not being taught to believe that dangerous sexual behaviour is acceptable as long as consent is in place.\" The Welsh government reiterated that \"at no point were inappropriate materials shared for use in schools or seen by learners\". They said they had given extra funding to provide \"expertise and support\" to schools and local authorities and make sure resources were \"age appropriate and in line with legal requirements\". \"We have always been clear that any resources must be developmentally appropriate and in line with the legal requirements of the mandatory Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) Code,\" the Welsh government statement added. The UK government have been approached for comment. If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via theBBC Action Line.

    "article_text": "Get your cowboy hats ready as theEurovision Song Contestis back this week, with country trio Remember Monday representing the UK. But that's not all the week has in store. Final Destination Bloodlineshits cinemas,Doom: The Dark Agesis released, and the second series ofInside Our Mindsis out on BBC Two. Read on for what's coming up this week... Skimpy costumes, wacky performances and furious flag-waving... it can only beEurovision. This year's song contest is taking place in Basel, Switzerland. All-female trio Remember Monday, made up of Lauren Byrne, Holly Anne-Hull, and Charlotte Steel, will represent the UK with their song What The Hell Just Happened. It's a quirky, catchy girls-together anthem – and the biggest creative risk the UK has taken at Eurovision for years,writes my colleague Mark Savage. But will it be enough to push us up the Eurovision rankings? Well - it's not long to find out. The grand final will take place on Saturday, hosted by Graham Norton and streaming live on BBC One and iPlayer. Right before the final, Norton is also starring ina new episode ofDoctor Who, taking his Eurovision commentary duties to an Interstellar Song Contest. This week, prepare to be scared asFinal Destination Bloodlinesis released in cinemas. It's the sixth film in the horror franchise, which first came out in 2000 - and you can expect it to follow a similar premise of people cheating death, only to find death coming after them. In Bloodlines, a college student - haunted by a recurring nightmare - tries to find a way to end the cycle, and therefore to save her family from an untimely demise. After so many instalments, the challenge for filmmakers includes creating new and different death sequences that we haven't seen before. But early reactions on social media have been positive by those who've watched it. \"The kills are glorious and inventive and shows that this concept still works well for movies,\" saidThat Hashtag Show'sHunter Bolding. The AU Review's Peter Graydescribed it as\"amusingly gory and self aware,\" adding: \"Fans will eat this up! Big, bloody, fun!\" Following his series Inside Our Autistic Minds, presenter and naturalist Chris Packham is back with a second series ofInside Our Mindsto explore what it's like to live inside attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia. Over two episodes, Chris will meet four contributors who will reveal to their friends and family how they really feel inside, and what ADHD or dyslexia mean for them. Speaking ahead of their release,he told Radio Timesthat people who call ADHD a \"fad\" are \"prejudiced\". \"That very urgently needs countering in this time of divisive culture wars, with assaults on inclusivity and diversity,\" the Springwatch presenter, 64, said. Inside Our Minds starts on Monday at 9pm, on BBC Two and iPlayer. By Tom Richardson, Newsbeat reporter There's a joke among software developers whenever a piece of new, questionably useful tech is launched (smart fridges, anyone?) Can it run Doom? The answer is usually \"yes\" – the 1993 classic has been made to work on microwaves, treadmills and even medical equipment. But you might need a bit more processing power forDoom: The Dark Ages, out on PS5, Xbox and PC from Thursday. Following up 2020's Doom: Eternal, The Dark Ages plunges player character the Doom Slayer into a Medieval hellscape filled with demonic enemies and an arsenal of frankly ridiculous weapons. So far, so Doom. But early previews suggest the latest entry in the series is something of a departure, featuring larger open areas to explore, a heavier focus on storyline and gameplay that encourages players to think defensively (when they aren't pelting enemies with streams of projectiles). Having said that, players can also equip themselves with a shield lined with chainsaw blades, pilot a Godzilla-sized giant robot and ride a dragon – all to a heavy metal soundtrack, of course. And it doesn't get much more Doom than that. As rehearsals continue in Basel, Sweden, the UK's Eurovision act say want to avoid \"nul points\".

The warning covers areas including Wales, the Midlands, west of England, London and the South East from 12:00 BST to 22:00 on Monday,the Met Office said. Up to 50mm (1.9in) of rain could fall within a few hours, with a possibility of delays and some cancellations to train and bus services. England has had its driest start to spring for 69 years, the Environment Agency said earlier this month. Showers are forecast to drift in from the south in the early hours of Monday, the Met Office said. Temperatures across the board are due to remain mild in the high teens or early 20s. The Met Office said there was the \"potential for minor localised issues\" and flash flooding. Sunshine and settled conditions will return across the UK for the rest of the week, with temperatures forecast to reach 23C in some parts. Last week, the Environment Agency warned that water companies that more must be done to safeguard water supplies. Many places have gone without any rain for weeks, including Preston in Lancashire and parts of Fife which have been dry since mid-April. According to the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology's three month Drought Index, large parts of the UK are in the 'extremely dry' category. After a week of good weather, Paris was hit by a hailstorm and thunder on Saturday afternoon. At least 10 million people remained under winter weather advisories and warnings as of Thursday morning. Teams are working every day to make trees safe and reduce the number that come down in high winds. Strong winds are expected to cause travel disruptions and power cuts across the country.

    "article_text": "Amber Heard has announced the arrival of twins in an Instagram post shared on Mother's Day in the United States. The American actor revealed that she had welcomed daughter Agnes and son Ocean and was \"elated beyond words\" to celebrate the \"completion\" of her family. Heard, 39, welcomed her first daughter, Oonagh, in 2021. Under a picture of three pairs of feet, Heard wrote: \"Becoming a mother by myself and on my own terms despite my own fertility challenges has been the most humbling experience of my life.\" The actor said she had chosen motherhood \"responsibly and thoughtfully\" and \"couldn't possibly burst with more joy\". She described her family as one she had \"strived to build for years\". \"To all the moms, wherever you are today and however you got here, my dream family and I are celebrating with you,\" she added. When Heard announced the birth of her first daughter in 2021, she spoke about her desire for it to be \"normalised to not want a ring in order to have a crib\". \"I now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way,\" she wrote on Instagram at the time. Heard is best known for her films The Rum Diary, Drive Angry, Zombieland and Aquaman. She was married to actor Johnny Depp from 2015 to 2016. After their marriage ended, the pair accused each other of domestic abuse and engaged in two lengthy and high-profile defamation cases. In the Depp v. News Group Newspapers (NGN) trial in 2020, Depp lost his UK libel case against the Sun newpaper after Heard gave evidence to back claims in the newspaper that he was a \"wife-beater\". In the widely publicised Depp v. Heard trial in the US, Heard was found liable for defaming Depp. For six weeks in 2022, a court in the US state of Virginia heard details of the couple's volatile relationship. Depp sued his ex-wife for defamation over an opinion article she wrote for the Washington Post that alleged she was a domestic abuse victim, although it did not mention him by name. Heard counter-sued. Jurors awarded Depp - who denied abusing Heard - $15m (£12m) in compensatory and punitive damages. Heard won one of three counter-claims against Depp and was awarded $2m in compensatory damages.",

Kevin Flatley, 49, died at the scene after he was hit by a motorcyclist in Lanestown, in the north of the county, shortly before 13:00 local time on Sunday. A motorcyclist, a man in his 30s, was seriously injured in the incident and has been taken to Beaumont Hospital in Dublin where his condition is described as critical. Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said he was deeply saddened by the death of his colleague and extended his sympathies to Mr Flatley's family and friends. \"Kevin has over 26 years of dedicated service to An Garda Síochána and the people of Ireland,\" he said. He also revealed that Garda Flatley was the \"90th member of An Garda Síochána killed in the performance of duty\". \"His death is a terrible reminder of the dangers faced by gardaí,\" he added. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday evening, Mr Harris said it was a \"terrible loss for us all\". \"Kevin has been a very faithful public servant,\" Mr Harris said. He added that he was very well-known and well-liked throughout the organisation. The Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) said he was \"very shocked and deeply saddened\" to hear of Garda Flatley's death. Speaking in Cork to RTÉ News, Micheál Martin said he wanted to extend his \"deepest sympathies to his family, to his friends and to the entire membership of An Garda Síochána\". He added that \"gardaí work bravely on our behalf to keep us safe every day\" and it was \"truly shocking\" that this has occurred. Irish President Michael D Higgins said Garda Flatley had \"dedicated his career to public service and to keeping people safe\". \"The loss of a garda has a deep impact on society due to this strong connection and my thoughts are with his family and all those who knew and cared for Garda Flatley across his life,\" he added. General Secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI) Ronan Clogher described the news as \"devastating\" and called it a \"dark day\" for An Garda Síochána. \"We are in shock and numbed at the news this afternoon. No Garda shift is ever routine, but this one has ended in the most horrendous of circumstances.\" The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said: \"The loss of an officer is felt across the entire policing family and our thoughts are with his family, friends and An Garda Síochána colleagues at this difficult time. \"Kevin's death is a stark reminder of the risks that police officers face every day as they work to protect the public and keep people safe.\" The one-week pilot sees stewards beside the iconic Dublin figure to discourage people touching the statue's breasts.

    "article_text": "The Taliban government in Afghanistan has banned chess until further notice due to fears the game is a source of gambling. Officials said the game has been prohibited indefinitely until its compatibility with Islamic law can be determined. Chess is the latest sport to be restricted by the Taliban. Women are essentially barred from participating in sport at all. Since seizing power inAugust 2021, the Taliban has steadily imposed laws and regulations that reflect its austere vision of Islamic law. On Sunday, Atal Mashwani, the spokesman of the Taliban government's sports directorate, said chess in Islamic sharia law is \"considered a means of gambling\". \"There are religious considerations regarding the sport of chess,\" he told AFP news agency. \"Until these considerations are addressed, the sport of chess is suspended in Afghanistan.\" One cafe owner in Kabul, who has hosted informal chess competitions in recent years, said he would respect the decision but it would hurt his business. \"Young people don't have a lot of activities these days, so many came here everyday,\" Azizullah Gulzada said. \"They would have a cup of tea and challenge their friends to a game of chess.\" He also noted that chess is played in other Muslim-majority countries. Last year, the authorities banned free fighting such as mixed martial arts (MMA) in professional competition, saying it was too \"violent\" and \"problematic with respect to sharia\". \"It was found that the sport is problematic with respect to Sharia and it has many aspects which are contradictory to the teachings of Islam,\" aTaliban spokesperson said last August. MMA competitions were effectively outlawed in 2021 when the Taliban introduced legislation prohibiting \"face-punching\".

    "article_text": "Relatives and friends of those who died or were injured in the Bradford City fire were among the crowd of people who attended a 40th anniversary memorial service. The service took place at the Bradford City Fire Memorial sculpture in Centenary Square at 11:00 BST. The City of Bradford Brass Band played You'll Never Walk Alone, before the City Hall bell tolled 56 times to mark the number of people who died. A wreath was also laid on behalf of King Charles III. Mayor of Bradford Beverley Mullaney said the service was set up to help people \"come together to pay tribute\". She added: \"It is important to the city and district that we take time to remember those who were affected and those who continue to be affected by the tragic events on 11 May 1985.\" The service also included Canon Pastor Oliver Evans, who is the Bradford City AFC club chaplain, giving a welcome speech. And Reverend Andy Bowerman, Dean of Bradford, also gave a short reflection. The rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone was chosen because of the song's association with the tragedy. Within days of the disaster,  a supergroup including Gerry Marsden, Rick Wakeman, the Who's John Entwistle,  Phill Lynott, Motorhead and the Nolans joined a number of TV and sports stars on a new version of the classic terrace anthem. It reached number one in the charts and proceeds were donated to the families of those affected by the fire. After the memorial service finished, the City Hall opened for a short while for fans and visitors to view a memorial bell at the top of the civic staircase in the hall. The bell, which came from the first fire engine to arrive on the scene on 11 May 1985, was donated to the city by the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.

    "article_text": "It was almost like meeting a sporting hero, and while 103-year-old Francis Greene has never stepped foot on a professional football pitch, he still left me feeling star-struck. Among other things, he is a World War Two veteran, accomplished pianist, successful businessman, and a great-great-grandfather. But most importantly, for me at least, he is a life-long Swansea City fan with almost a century's worth of memories. While I have 33 years under my belt, when Francis attended the Swans' season-ending 3-3 home draw against Oxford United last weekend, it brought down the curtain on his 97th campaign. \"We'd shut up the shop on a Saturday lunchtime, and I'd clutch on to dad's hand as we made our way through the crowds and queue up at the North Bank turnstiles,\" Francis reminisced with a twinkle in his eye. \"The noise, the smells, the singing were almost too much for a six-year-old to bear. \"But it enchanted me, from that first game, I was hooked.\" You never forget your first time, and this was his - a 2-1 victory over Oldham Athletic in 1928. Francis' story will strike a chord with football fans right around the country, how their side was their first love, staying in their hearts their entire lives. He was born in February 1922, at number one Goat Street, a stone's throw from the old Vetch Field, where the club played. It was from there his dad ran the family fishmonger's, Coakley-Greene, which was established in 1856, and is still running today. Like most youngsters, though, the dream was not to cheer on from the side lines - but to be out on the pitch himself. A promising right-half for Swansea Town Boys, Francis was in the same youth set-up as full-back Jackie Roberts and winger Ernie Jones - two of the fiveAlice Street gang. \"I was never probably good enough to play for the Swans, but it was so much fun trying,\" he said. His passion for playing wasn't dampened, though, and he added: \"Every moment I wasn't in school or helping in the shop, I'd be out on the street kicking a ball around with those boys. \"But you had to scarper like hell when you heard the policeman's whistle and saw him coming around the corner. \"Boy you'd be for it if he caught you playing near the cars.\" Francis' playing ambitions were curtailed by the looming threat of World War Two. Rather than waiting to be called up, he chose to enlist, training as a mechanic in the RAF ground crews, who kept Spitfires in the air during the Battle of Britain, the London Blitz, and acted as fighter support for bombing raids over Germany. \"In some ways I think my time standing on the North Bank [of the Vetch] prepared me for the RAF,\" he said. \"You felt you were part of something bigger than just you. \"An esprit de corps, a friendship and a comradeship that you never experienced in civvy street, apart from on the terraces. \"Football is a bit like war - you have to know what your job is, how it fits into the system, and how every other man is depending on you doing it to the best of your ability.\" A huge part of this bonding on the terraces revolved around learning, and singing together, the team's songs. Through misty eyes, Francis starts reciting a few lines from \"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\" - a song more commonly associated with another team in recent times. \"Long before West Ham picked it up and made it their own, we used to belt out 'I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles',\" he said. \"That made me so proud to be properly part of the crowd.\" He described it as \"a proper badge of honour\", and while some were too rude to repeat, one rather quirky song makes him chuckle as he thinks back. \"After the war, the favourite was the Woody Woodpecker song from the cartoon – 'Hahahaha, It's The Woody Woodpecker Song' – I've no idea how that one caught on, but it was a lot of fun to sing it,\" he said. Francis' favourite players during his childhood were fullbacks Syd Lawrence, and Wilfred Milne - who still holds the record for the most Swans league appearances at 586 between 1920 and 1937. \"Those two were lightning, up and down the pitch, left and right, sometimes it was as though we had 13 men on the field, so much was the ground they covered,\" he said. But it was after returning to the North Bank when he was demobbed, that he saw some of the most iconic figures of Welsh football. \"Of course John Charles went to Leeds and Juventus, before he ever got to play for the Swans, but Mel Charles and Mel Nurse were there,\" he said. \"It's incredible that one street in Cwmbwrla could produce so much talent. \"Then you had another set of brothers, Ivor and Len Allchurch. \"We had so much talent in those years, and all born within walking distance of the Vetch.\" Francis took over the family fish business, as well as becoming an executive for Littlewoods department store. As well as cheering on the Swans, he also became an accomplished pianist in his spare time - appearing in a BBC Wales documentary, playing to enthralled crowds at Swansea Market. It is after covering more than half a century of his life and football support that we arrive at a point that is both mine, and Francis' favourite memory. This is the open top bus tour following promotion to the top tier of English football for the first time, under John Toshack, in 1981. Francis was 59 and I was three. \"Yes, we were probably on Kingsway [in the city centre] together that day – who knows how far apart – but by then I was a little bit too big to be sitting on my father's shoulders like you were,\" he said. \"The same as you, I can remember the open-top parade, the ticker-tape, and the players waving. \"I'd been going 50-odd years by then, and I never thought I'd see us bumping elbows with Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal in the top flight.\" And this sums up football supporters - from those Francis sang with on the Vetch terraces in the 1920s, to fans on the city's streets celebrating in 1981, and youngsterssaying goodbye to legendary player Joe Allenat the Swansea.com stadium last week. You may not know each other personally, but through your songs, memories, high and lows you experience together, in some way, you are always family.",

    "title": "Amorim admits he may have to leave if poor form continues",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Man Utd are 'not scared of losing' - Amorim Ruben Amorim has conceded he should step aside as manager if Manchester United take their poor league form from the end of this season into the next campaign. United's appalling finish hit another low note at Old Traffordas they lost 2-0 to a West Ham sidethat had failed to win any of their previous eight games. As well as questioning his own future, Amorim said: \"We are losing the feeling that we are a massive club and it's the end of the world to lose a game at home. \"If we are not scared of losing a game as Manchester United and don't have that fear anymore, it is the most dangerous thing a big club can have.\" Amorim's side have only beaten relegated duo Ipswich and Leicester in the league since 26 January and are on their joint worst winless run in the Premier League of seven games. \"Everybody here has to think seriously about a lot of things,\" said Amorim. \"Everybody is thinking about the [Europa League] final. The final is not the issue. We have bigger things to think about. \"I'm talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team. We need to change that. \"It's a decisive moment in the history of the club. \"We need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave because we will not have a next season like this. \"If we start like this, if the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different people.\" On a three points for a win basis, United are heading for their worst tally since their 1930-31 relegation campaign, when they would have collected 29 points in a 42-game campaign. United are on 39 points and 16th in the table, with only Europa League final opponents Tottenham and the three relegated teams below them. Amorim said he was \"embarrassed\" by the situation. The Portuguese knows regardless of whether United win or lose in Bilbao on 21 May, there has to be major surgery of the kind Ralf Rangnick spoke about during his spell as interim boss following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021, otherwise, he will be out of a job. West Ham victory inflicts more league pain on Man Utd Manchester United's 17 Premier League defeats this season are their most in a league campaign since 1973-74 (20), when they were relegated to the second tier. With nine home Premier League defeats the Red Devils have suffered their joint-most home losses in a single league campaign, along with 1930-31, 1933-34, and 1962-63. Ruben Amorim's side are currently winless in seven Premier League games (D2 L5), their joint-longest ever run in the competition, also going seven without victory from September to November 1992 (D5 L2). They have also fallen 1-0 behind 12 times at Old Trafford in the Premier League this season, with only already-relegated Leicester (15) doing so more at home in the 2024-25 competition, while it's the Red Devils' most in a single Premier League campaign, overtaking 11 times in 2023-24. This was West Ham's first league win at Old Trafford since 2006-07, ending a run of 16 league trips there without a win (D3 L13). West Ham completed only their fifth ever top-flight double over Manchester United, after 1926-27, 1928-29, 1976-77, and 2006-07. Manchester United created a higher expected goals tally than West Ham (2.28-1.56) but still lost 2-0 Asked what he thought when he looked at the Premier League table, Amorim replied: \"How is a manager of Manchester United supposed to feel in that position? Embarrassed.\" If United beat Tottenham in the Europa League final, they will qualify for next season's Champions League. Conservative estimates suggest it could be worth around Â£100m to the club, even if they were to get knocked out in the play-offs given they would have had five home games and generated crucial revenue through prize money. While owners Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazer family might view that as an imperative given they are addressing losses in excess of Â£370m over the past five years with a second round of redundancies, and limits on perks like free tickets and travel to Bilbao for staff members, for Amorim, the prospect of competing on the highest European stage is a dubious one. \"The final is by far the smallest problem in our club,\" he said. \"We need to change something that is deeper than this. Playing in the Premier League and Champions League for us is the moon. We need to know that. \"I'm not concerned about the final. They will be focused but I don't know what is best, if it's playing in the Champions League or not.\" The damning allegation United's players pick and choose their games has lingered for some considerable time, dating back to Jose Mourinho's time as manager at the club, which began in 2016. Players have come and gone and successive managers have been sacked but the issue remains, albeit never with consequences in terms of results as acute as this season's have been. \"In the Europa League, we don't play quite well but we have a little bit of that urgency in having to win games,\" he said. \"We manage to find a way to win. We are so focused. \"In these games in the Premier League, sometimes we are not focused. It's hard to explain that. There is a lack of urgency in everything we do. It's a big concern.\" The concern is so big, according to Amorim, it is eating away at United's status. What used to be known as a 'big club mentality' is disappearing. \"There's a lack of urgency when we're defending our box and there's a lack of urgency when we are near the box,\" he said. \"We need to be more aggressive and feel that it is the end of the world when we are not winning a game. \"There is a feeling that it's OK because we cannot change our position so much. It is a big concern.\" Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy though told BBC Match of the Day, he feels there is too much negativity coming from Amorim. He said: \"I get confused with some of Amorim's interviews and the amount of negativity that comes from them. \"I am not a big fan of a manager continually talking negatively about how bad things are. I would like to hear more solution-based answers. \"They have got a final to look forward, he hopefully has a summer of a lot of activity in the window and moulding his own team. I always felt the leaders of the clubs I was at if they were trying to look forward it helped the players, rather than constant negativity.\" Latest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views Get Man Utd news notifications Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "'We are all frustrated' - Marinakis defends 'scandalous' confrontation",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played How Marinakis on-pitch confrontation unfolded It was the last thing that Nuno Espirito Santo needed. His Nottingham Forest side had just squandered the chance to take a significant step towards securing Champions League football next season by conceding a late equaliser to rivals Leicester City. The Portuguese coach was shaking hands at full-time with Leicester midfielder Oliver Skipp, who he briefly managed at Tottenham, when Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis intervened. The Greek businessman, clearly furious at the result, delivered what appeared to be the most public of dressings down to his manager. Former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville called Marinakis' actions \"scandalous\". Marinakis defended his actions in a post-match statement, saying: \"We were frustrated around the injury of Taiwo [Awoniyi] and the medical staff's misjudgement on Taiwo's ability to continue the game. \"This is natural, this is a demonstration of the passion we feel for our club. \"Today is a day for celebration, because after 30 years Nottingham Forest is now guaranteed to be competing on the European stage once again - a promise I made to our supporters when we achieved promotion. \"With two more games to go in the Premier League, we must keep believing and keep dreaming, right to the final kick in the final game. We are extremely proud and close to Nuno and the team, and we must all celebrate the historic achievements of this season.\" Nevertheless, his confrontation with the manager made for an uncomfortable watch, particularly when you consider the Portuguese coach has taken the club from the brink of relegation in 2024 to European football in 2025. Forest are now guaranteed some form of European football next season, something the club last experienced 30 years ago. This video can not be played On pitch clash with Marinakis 'no big deal' Nuno was keen to stress that the Greek owner's actions were down to  \"confusion\" over the use of striker Awoniyi. The Nigerian emerged from the bench following Leicester's late equaliser, charged with finding a winner. He showed his desperation to score when he slid in at the backpost in the hope of connecting with an Anthony Elanga cross, only to collide with the goalpost. The 27-year-old was down for several minutes as he received treatment, inadvertently halting any hopes Forest had of quickly restoring their lead. Awoniyi signalled he was fine to continue, persuading Nuno to leave him on the pitch, instead bringing on Jota Silva for midfielder Elliot Anderson to use their last substitution window. But the forward remained in discomfort, which Nuno said infuriated owner Marinakis. \"It [the conversation with Marinakis] was due to the situation and the confusion over the substitution of [Taiwo Awoniyi],\" Nuno said. \"We made a [different] sub and after that we played with one man less so that frustrates everyone. \"When a player is down, you get information that he is OK to continue, then we make a sub and it turns out he can't continue. We are all frustrated with that. \"Football is emotions. It's difficult to control [and] especially when we had so much expectation and the fans were incredible.\" Pushed on whether he was comfortable with being approached in so public a manner by Marinakis, Nuno again praised the owner. \"ItÂ isÂ becauseÂ ofÂ theÂ ownerÂ andÂ hisÂ passionÂ thatÂ weÂ areÂ growingÂ asÂ aÂ club.Â He pushesÂ us.Â HeÂ wantsÂ usÂ toÂ beÂ better,\" Nuno added. \"ItÂ isÂ hisÂ passionÂ andÂ desireÂ toÂ beÂ aÂ bigÂ clubÂ -Â 30,000Â peopleÂ feltÂ theÂ same today.Â ForÂ sure,Â manyÂ ofÂ themÂ wouldÂ goÂ onÂ theÂ pitchÂ andÂ shakeÂ usÂ down. \"UsÂ asÂ aÂ club,Â weÂ oweÂ aÂ lotÂ toÂ theÂ MarinakisÂ family.\" Nuno's defence might not quieten any criticism of Marinakis. Speaking on Sky Sports following the match, former Manchester United captain Neville described the Greek's actions as an \"absolute joke\". \"What the Forest owner has just done on the pitch over at the City Ground is absolutely scandalous and if I was Nuno I'd be going and having a strong word with him because that is an absolute scandal. \"He's just qualified for European competition. To be remonstrated with on the pitch in front of their own fans is an absolute joke.\" The former England defender later posted on X, urging Nuno to \"go and negotiate his exit\" adding the manager \"does not deserve that\". Former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy, told BBC Match of the Day the incident should not be overblown. He said: \"It's not great, but let's put it in perspective. It is injury time. They are in Europe and have had a great season. It would be remiss to dwell on some small interaction.\" While ex-Southampton boss Russell Martin, added: \"It is an impressive reaction from Nuno. I don't think he could have handled it any better. \"You cant pin that on one person. The player is uncertain, maybe in hindsight they should have taken a breath.  But the level of disappointment shows the level of Forest's improvement this season.\" Marinakis' time at Forest has not been without incident since he bought a controlling share in 2017. The businessman, who also controls Greek team Olympiakos and Portuguese side Rio Ave, has helped to make the club a Premier League force. The 57-year-old was handed a five-match stadium ban in 2024 after spitting on the floor towards match officials following a 1-0 defeat to Fulham. He later said he had \"no regrets\" over his actions because they were due to \"big mistakes\" by the officials. In April, documents filed at Companies House showed that Marinakis had ceased to become a \"person with significant control\" of NF Football Investments Limited, the vehicle that owns the City Ground club. The Greek had taken the decision to dilute his shares, placing them in a blind trust. However, he remains Forest owner and is committed to the club. Instead, the move has been seen as a decision taken in preparation for the club potentially qualifying for the Champions League. Uefa's rules would not allow both Forest and Olympiakos to play in the Champions League next season given both sides are owned by Marinakis.

    "title": "'Not nice to hear' - were Trent jeers 'shocking' or 'understandable'?",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Sad to see Alexander-Arnold leave Liverpool this way - Murphy Boyhood Liverpool fan Trent Alexander-Arnold was standing on the Anfield sideline ready to make his 373rd club appearance, but there was something slightly different about this one. For probably the penultimate time at Anfield - and the first time since announcing he will leave when his contract expires in June - the 26-year-old pulled on Liverpool red. Real Madrid are expectedto be Alexander-Arnold's next club. And a section of the Liverpool support took their first chance to let him know their feelings about his decision, booing him during thedraw with Arsenal. The jeers were mixed with cheers from other supporters, but former Premier League title winner Chris Sutton described the reaction as \"shocking\", while Alexander-Arnold's team-mate of eight years, Andy Robertson, told Sky Sports it was \"not nice\" to hear the boos. \"But you can't tell people how to feel,\" he added. \"That's how I feel about it and I'm not going to tell anyone else how to feel about it. \"Disappointed to lose a good friend, he's an amazing player and an amazing person. He has pushed me through and made me a better player. His legacy will always be there, he's done so much for this club. \"He will be missed for me as one of my best friends in the game. We've done it all together. He's took me to levels I never knew existed. It hasn't been an easy one for Trent but he has made the decision.\" Arne Slot named Trent Alexander-Arnold as a substitute, with Conor Bradley starting at right-back Liverpool boss Arne Slot told journalists at Fridayâs news conference that Conor Bradley would start at right-back, rather than the departing Alexander-Arnold - and it was then wondered whether he would be given any more minutes before leaving Merseyside. But, with Bradley on a yellow card and Liverpool pushing to take all three points against the Gunners, Slot made the decision to introduce the England international. He told BBC Match of the Day: \"Everybody can have their own opinion and you can express it in any way you want to. \"I heard mixed opinions but the only opinion I have is I owe it to the players and fans to try to win a game of football. \"And if Conor Bradley can't go on because he is tired and I have Trent Alexander-Arnold on the bench, I will bring him in because we want to win this game of football. And he was very close for us to win it because he had two or three passes... What makes him so special, for me. \"It is quite simple: If I want to win, I bring him in and that's what I did. For the fans, they are entitled to have their own opinion.\" BBC pundit Sutton sympathised with Alexander-Arnold, who has won nine trophies with the Reds. He said: \"Trent Alexander-Arnold deserves far greater respect than he was shown today. What has he done wrong? He's won every trophy and wants a different challenge. \"It wasn't all Liverpool fans but it was shocking and embarrassing from the ones that did boo him.\" Alexander-Arnold leaves as modern Liverpool great - but fans will feel hurt How could Liverpool replace Alexander-Arnold? In 2021, Alexander-Arnold put pen-to-paper on a four-year contract. Two years later, Jurgen Klopp made him vice-captain. Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy, told BBC Match of the Day: \"I was expecting some negative reaction and I get why but I didn't expect the enormity it was. \"I think it is sad for it to end this way. But he is a big boy, he mas made a decision. You can't please everyone all the time and he has to keep his head high.\" Fellow Liverpudlian Jamie Carragher, who spent his entire career at Anfield, summed up the emotions of the fans. \"I think the manager will be shocked by how vociferous the reaction was,\" Carragher said on Sky Sports. \"That might be his last game for Liverpool but, if frustrated with Trent, sing Bradley's name, sing Gerrard's name. Don't boo your players because it opens you up to criticism. \"Liverpool supporters think playing for Liverpool is the utmost and when you're a local player, like Trent is, like I was, you can't see yourself as bigger than the club. \"Supporters of any club wouldn't want to hear this, but most players in that dressing room probably want to play for Real Madrid. \"I've been in that dressing room, with players who have left us for Real Madrid or Barcelona. \"It's sometimes really hard for supporters. You feel like they fall for it every time, that a player loves them and then moves on.\" Former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand posted on X: \"I can't believe Liverpool fans booing one of their own. \"I understand that some of you guys are not happy with his decision etc BUT to boo Trent after he has won the lot with you is baffling! Didn't cost you a penny.\" Jason:I am sorry. You can't sing You'll Never Walk Alone every week and then boo your own player. That's not how it works. As a Liverpool fan, Trent will forever be the incredible talent that directly helped us win so many trophies. Trent YNWA. Matt:The thing that bothers me is, would match going fans still boo if Trent left with a big transfer fee? We weren't happy with Coutinho when he left on a big transfer fee, we're not happy when Trent leaves on a free. Ultimately, for me, he's won everything, he's given everything, I'm disappointed he's moving on but fair play. Rob:I am a loyal paying LFC fan and I and the vast majority of our LFC fan group think the booing was an embarrassment and a disgrace. If there is any blame it's on the club for not offering him a new contract last season. That will have put doubt in his mind about his future here so he would have needed to look at his options. Tom:Here's an opinion from a paying Liverpool fan: to disregard the years of service Trent has given to this club, the soaring success he's been pivotal to and the wonderful memories he's given us fans and boo him in his final games is an utter disgrace. Fans bang on about loyalty this, loyalty that - the rank hypocrisy is galling. Ben:I wouldn't boo Trent but he's deliberately ran his contract down and leaving Liverpool for free, so I can understand why some would.

    "title": "'A pricey forearm swing? Champions League all that matters for Chelsea'",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Pundits' verdict on Jackson dismissal Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca went through his full range of brave faces, but he will know just how expensive the damaging defeat at Newcastle United could prove to be. Maresca has been keen to emphasise what he regards as Chelsea's progress since he succeeded Mauricio Pochettino in the summer. The reality, especially what passes for reality at Stamford Bridge, means the final judgement will only come once the Premier League season concludes. The Italian regards Chelsea's advance to an upcoming Europa Conference League final meeting with Real Betis as the clearest signal of an upward trend under his guidance. The brutal truth is that this is a competition Chelsea have been expected to win. There will be no flowers handed out at Stamford Bridge for winning Europe's third-tier tournament. For a club of Chelsea's ambition, not to mention vast financial outlay, the Champions League is what matters. That is where the club believes it should be. The Blues are still clinging on to the final Champions League spot with two matches remaining but, with just a point separating them and seventh, it is far too close for comfort. And the 2-0 loss on Tyneside places a heavy load on their final two games at home to Manchester United, then, with great significance as they are chasing the same lucrative prize, away to seventh-placed Nottingham Forest on the last day. If Chelsea win the Conference League but do not qualify for the Champions League,  Maresca must expect this season to be judged as failure, however harsh that judgement may seem. The stakes could not be higher, not least for Maresca, who has had a somewhat loveless relationship with Chelsea fans never fully convinced by the studied passing style which is his trademark. This defeat means Chelsea have lost six of their last nine away games in the Premier League, winning one and drawing two. Since Christmas Day, only Leicester City and Southampton (both four) have picked up fewer away points in the competition than Chelsea's five. It is a flaw that has brought Chelsea to the point where the success of their season hangs in a delicate balance. And all this makes the act of wild indiscipline from striker Nicolas Jackson after 35 minutes at St. James' Park, with Chelsea already trailing to Sandro Tonali's early goal, not only reckless but potentially very expensive. Only Jackson can explain what possessed him to launch himself forearm first into the face of Newcastle defender Sven Botman, a red card the inevitable outcome once referee John Brooks was directed towards the screen by the Video Assistant Referee. Jackson not only left Chelsea short-handed at Newcastle, he will now miss those pivotal final games that could shape so many futures at Stamford Bridge. This may yet be one very pricey swing of a forearm. Newcastle beat 10-man Chelsea to close in on Champions League Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca in despair during the loss against Newcastle United Chelsea's owners may reflect more favourably on Maresca's first campaign in charge should they make the top five and the Champions League, while key player Cole Palmer will feel more comfortable in Europe's elite competition. Maresca was aiming in the wrong direction when he suggested the noise inside the Tyneside cauldron made the officials' decision to send Jackson off. This was on the striker â no-one else. His words made a somewhat hollow sound when he said: \"If the referee decides it's red, it's because they decide and they are convinced. It can be easy to make some decisions like this in this stadium with its noise. \"Sometimes you get the feeling that some decisions are from the noise. It's not only for this game, it is for the next two games, for him the season is finished.\" Ironically, Maresca's shrewd tactical tweaks for the second half improved Chelsea. He replaced Noni Madueke with Reece James and moved Palmer into a false nine role against Newcastle's three centre-backs until counterpart Eddie Howe countered with changes of his own. Maresca's argument did carry weight when he said: \"To come here and for one hour to play with 10 players is not easy. In the second half the team showed effort, spirit [and] energy. We must keep this spirit and energy.\" It was all for nothing, however, as Bruno Guimaraes' stoppage-time effort took a deflection off Malo Gusto to loop agonisingly over Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez. Chelsea showed enough in the second half to demonstrate that all is not lost. The Champions League remains a realistic destination, but that final-day visit to The City Ground is assuming heavier significance. The Champions League is the bottom line for Chelsea and Maresca and much rests on it for so many at Stamford Bridge. One inexplicable act from  Jackson may just make it more difficult to achieve.

    "article_text": "Emma Raducanu lost in the first round in her sole previous appearance at the Italian Open Emma Raducanu produced an impressive comeback to beat Veronika Kudermetova and set up an intriguing fourth-round meeting with Coco Gauff at the Italian Open. Britain's Raducanu beat the Russian 5-7 6-0 6-1 in a topsy-turvy match in Rome. Raducanu served for the first set but was broken and lost three games in a row before reeling off eight games of her own. She grew in confidence as Kudermetova faltered, clenching her fists and yelling in celebration after a thumping forehand winner secured victory. \"The best thing for me was recovering from the first set after serving for it,\" the world number 49 told Sky Sports. \"I'm so happy that I didn't let the rest of the match get away from me - I think that's big progress maybe compared to the matches I've played in the past.\" Raducanu will face a tough test against fellow former US Open champion Gauff, who reached the Madrid Open final earlier in May. \"It's exciting - it's going to be a match where I can test myself,\" said Raducanu. \"She's a great fighter, a great opponent but it's good that we can be in the same tournaments now and that I'm in the second week of these Masters. I'm really happy and proud of myself.\" Raducanu said on Friday that she was still \"finding her feet\" on the clay but her movement, particularly sliding behind the baseline, improved as the match progressed. She often spoke to Mark Petchey and Jane O'Donoghue in her coaching box. Petchey offered vocal encouragement throughout the match. She and Kudermetova exchanged early breaks before a sterling return winner from Raducanu allowed her to serve for the set at 5-4. However, the Briton's first serve percentage dropped and she handed back the break on a double fault, before Kudermetova won three games in a row to take the first set. However, the Russian crumbled from there on. An unfortunate bounce off a Raducanu shot wrong-footed Kudermetova in her first service game - and visibly annoyed, Kudermetova lost a 40-15 lead to suffer a break of serve, with her forehand in particular losing all timing. Raducanu moved better, sliding in and out of the corners, and rushed her way through five games in a row before Kudermetova took a medical timeout. The Briton was smart during that timeout, staying on the court and hitting balls rather than sitting down and risk losing rhythm. When Kudermetova returned, Raducanu picked up where she left off, taking the set at the third opportunity through another Kudermetova error. Draper smashes racquet during hard-fought Rome win Collins ends Swiatek's Italian Open defence A stunning return of serve from Raducanu put her a break up in the third set and she led 2-0. And despite Kudermetova then getting on the board, the Briton proved too strong, firing forehand winners, dictating the rallies and returning serve excellently to secure her place in the next round. Earlier, world number one Aryna Sabalenka fought back to beat fellow Grand Slam champion Sofia Kenin 3-6 6-3 6-3. Belarusian Sabalenka, champion in Madrid last week, is the heavy favourite for the title after Iga Swiatek's surprise third-round defeat on Saturday.

    "title": "Warrington defeat Leigh to reach Wembley",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Warrington beat Leigh to reach Challenge Cup final Betfred Challenge Cup semi-final Warrington (15) 21 Tries:Tai, Vaughan, KingGoals:Sneyd 4Drop-goal:Sneyd Leigh (4) 14 Tries:Ipape, Niu 2Goal:O'Brien Warrington Wolves secured a second consecutive Challenge Cup final appearance with victory over local rivals Leigh Leopards in a pulsating match at the Totally Wicked Stadium. Edwin Ipape put Leigh ahead after just 49 seconds but tries from Rodrick Tai, Paul Vaughan and Toby King, and the impeccable kicking of Marc Sneyd put Sam Burgess' side in control. Leigh, who won the 2023 final, refused to give up as Tesi Niu went over twice in the second half, but Sneyd's shrewd drop-goal with the last action of the first half kept daylight between the sides, in sweltering conditions. Wire, who lost to all-conquering Wigan Warriors at Wembley last year, will face Hull Kingston Rovers in the final on 7 June. Leigh were the form side going into the game after five straight wins had taken them to third in Super League, while Warrington had lost three of their previous four and have struggled since losing playmaker George Williams to injury. They were boosted by the return of Sneyd after he fractured an eye socket in April, but he was off to a poor start as his attempted kick in the Wolves' first set of six was charged down by Ipape, who picked up and ran half the length of the field to finish. Leigh sought to press home their advantage but Dufty came up with a marvellous tackle and ball steal, over the line, on Darnell McIntosh as he caught a Lachlan Lam chip to the corner. That invigorated Warrington after their early setback and when they finally cut loose down the right, Josh Thewlis, making his 100th club appearance, picked up a bouncing pass and when Josh Charnley attempted to intercept his pass to Tai, the ball looped into the air and Tai athletically grabbed it to touch down. The excellent Paul Vaughan had begun that move with a sharp off-load, and he grabbed the second try for himself, powering over from dummy half despite the presence of three tacklers. Sneyd converted both tries, added a penalty, and then slotted over the telling drop-goal at the end of the half to make up for his early error. Leigh began the second half with serious intent, but Thewlis produced a remarkable tackle to bring Ipape up inches short of the line before Niu finished off Gareth O'Brien's break to blow the game open once more. King seemed to have sealed the win as he scored from Dufty's lofted pass, with Sneyd adding another classy conversion from wide on the left, but again Leigh hit back as Niu grabbed his second try. Warrington held firm to spark scenes of celebration as they head to Wembley seeking their first Challenge Cup triumph since 2019. Warrington head coach Sam Burgess told BBC Radio Merseyside: \"I'm proud of them. We had a lot of bumps and bruises and lost both wingers, which is really hard to manage, and then lost Fitzy [Lachlan Fitzgibbon] but we're used to it nowadays so we just get on with it. \"We all witnessed the effort the players put in. I thought it was a decent game of rugby, a tough game, and both sides were very good. Leigh had some great moments as well. \"After the first minute I was proud of the players' ability to emotionally control their actions and get back into our game cycle and get a foothold in the game. [On Sneyd]\"He's a brilliant player. He's a strong-willed character and he came to me and said, 'I want to train this week and play,' and it's so valuable to have those guys around because they drive hard standards, when he's just had surgery.\" [On Vaughan]\"He's been brilliant all year but today he really took the game by the scruff of the neck early and dragged the team forward. We're doing everything to keep him.\" Leigh Leopards head coach Adrian Lam said: \"I'm very frustrated and disappointed. It was just some dumb individual things at times and we couldn't get the flow or find any rhythm in the game. \"I thought we weren't even close for a lot of the game. I felt like we were chasing it the whole time, we weren't connected as a group, defensively we were poor, and at times they just fell through us and made [Paul] Vaughan look like he was in his prime. \"I think emotionally we are going to be hurt from that, and it will take us some time to get over it, but we've got to pick ourselves up quickly.\" Warrington:Dufty; Josh Thewlis, Tai, King, Ashton; Ratchford, Sneyd; Yates, Powell, Vaughan, Holroyd, Fitzgibbon, Currie.

    "title": "This American pope: Leo XIV’s bloodline reflects the US melting pot",
    "article_text": "Pope Leo XIV, who on Thursday was elected as the first-ever US-born leader of the Roman Catholic church, has a familial bloodline that reflects his homeland’s fraught relationship with race – and why the nation’s stature as a melting pot of origins has long endured, records unearthed by genealogists show. The maternal grandfather of 69-year-old Robert Prevost, the newly minted pope, was evidently born abroad in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, according to birth records that professional genealogist Chris Smothers cited toABC Newsin a recent report. When Leo’s grandfather, Joseph Martinez, obtained an 1887 marriage license to wed the future pope’s grandmother, Louise Baquié, he listed his birthplace as Haiti, which at the time was the same territory as Santo Domingo, Smothers noted. Baquié’s birth records, meanwhile, indicate that she was born inLouisiana’s most prominent city,New Orleans, to parents who were reportedly married at a local Catholic church. Records from the 1900 census show that Joseph – apparently the son of a Louisianan – and Louise lived at a home in New Orleans’s Seventh Ward, a bastion for the city’s Creole people. The couple’s home later was among hundreds that were demolished to make way for a highway overpass linking New Orleans’s suburbs to its globally renowned French Quarter,a movethat drastically reduced the area’s population and economically devastated the scores of Black businesses that had been prevalent there. Those same census records identified Leo’s maternal grandparents as Black. Two of his aunts were similarly identified, just about four years after the Plessy v Ferguson US supreme court case – which originated inNew Orleans– upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation in the country. By 1920, the Martinez family had moved north to Chicago and away from the racially oppressive US south. The future pope’s mother, the Chicago-born Mildred Agnes Martinez, was eight at the time. And the census that decade listed the Martinezes as white. It would not be until 1954 that the US supreme court would issue the ruling that overturned the Plessy v Ferguson precedent and deemed racial segregation unconstitutional – and even then, many communities across the nation spent years flouting the decision. Multiple genealogists theorized that the Martinezes may have strategically shifted their racial identity to assimilate in Chicago, which – though further north – has had itsown historyof discrimination and oppression on the basis of skin color. “You can understand [that] people may have intentionally sought to obfuscate their heritage,” Jari Honora, a family historian for the Historic New Orleans Collection,toldthe Associated Press. Honora added that “always life has been precarious for people of color”. Mildred Martinez eventually married Louis Marius Prevost. The librarian and her husband – a second world war veteran and educator – raised three sons in Chicago. The youngest, Robert, was ordained a priest in 1982; became the worldwide leader of the Catholic religious order colloquially known as the Augustinians; led a Peruvian diocese; was made a cardinal by Pope Francis in September 2023; and headed the Vatican entity in charge of selecting new bishops around the world. The US registered a record-setting 47.8 million immigrants in 2023, three-quarters of whom were naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents or visa holders – all of whom buttressed the country’s centuries-old, metaphorical reputation as a melting pot. That status has come under threat whenDonald Trumpclinched a second US presidency the following year – and his administration mounted animmigrationcrackdown marked by steady news of detentions and deportations after he returned to the Oval Office in January. Leo’s fellow cardinals elected him to succeed the late Francis after a two-day conclave that concluded less than four months into Trump’s second presidency. And one of Leo’s older brothers, suburban Chicago resident and retired Catholic school principal John Prevost, quicklytoldthe New York Times: “I know he’s not happy with what’s going on with immigration.” Social media users just as rapidly flocked to an account seemingly belonging to Leo and noted how it had demonstrated a willingness to be critical of the administration’s positions. One of the account’s entries reposted an article about Catholic bishops in California who attributed “racism and nativism” to Trump’suseof the phrase “bad hombres” for certain Mexicans. It wasn’t immediately clear how much Leo might be a foil to the chief executive of the global superpower from which he hails, among other issuesconfronting the pope. And there is no indication Leo has ever publicly discussed his racial identity much. John Prevost, for his part,toldthe Times that his brothers did not discuss their Louisiana roots. He also said his immediate family did not identify as Black. A Vatican news releasesaidLeo’s father was of French and Italian descent. It said the pope’s mother was of Spanish ancestry. Whatever the case, Loyola Marymount University professor Kim R Harris, who teaches African American religious thought and practice, remarked to the AP that she hopes Leo’s papacy “brings to light who we are as Americans and who we are as a people of the diaspora”. “When I think about a person who brings so much of the history of this country in his bones,” Harris said, “it brings a whole new perspective and widens the vision of who we all are.”",

    "title": "Trump claims ‘total reset’ in US-China trade relations after tariff talks in Geneva",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has hailed a “total reset” in US-China trade relations after the first day of talks between top American and Chinese officials in Geneva aimed at defusing atrade warsparked by his tariff rollout. The US president praised the “very good” discussions and deemed them “a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner”. “We want to see, for the good of bothChinaand the U.S., an opening up of China to American business,” he posted on his Truth Social platform early on Sunday, adding: “GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!” He did not elaborate on the progress. Earlier, top US and Chinese officials wrapped up the first day of talks in the Swiss city aimed at de-escalating tensions that threaten to hammer the global economy. Negotiations were expected to continue on Sunday, a source close to the discussions said. China’s vice-premier, He Lifeng, met for about eight hours with US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, in their first face-to-face meeting since the world’s two largest economies heaped tariffs well above 100% on each other’s goods. Trump’s tariffs imposed on China this year currently total 145%, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching 245%. China has slapped retaliatory levies of 125% on US goods, cementing what appears to be a near trade embargo between the two countries Neither side made any statements afterwards about the substance of the discussions nor signalled any specific progress towards reducing the crushing tariffs as meetings at the residence of Switzerland’s ambassador to the UN concluded about 8pm local time (1800 GMT). Bessent, Greer and He were meeting in Geneva after weeks of growing tensions prompted by Trump’s tariff blitz starting in February and retaliation from Beijing that has brought nearly $600bn in annual bilateral trade to a virtual standstill. The trade dispute, combined with Trump’s decision last month to impose duties on dozens of other countries, has disrupted supply chains, unsettled financial markets and stokedfears of a sharp global downturn. The location of the talks in the Swiss diplomatic hub was never made public. However, witnesses saw both delegations returning after a lunch break to the gated UN ambassador’s villa in Cologny. Earlier, US officials including Bessent and Greer smiled as they left their hotel on the way to the talks. Bessent declined to speak to reporters. At the same time, Mercedes vans with tinted windows were seen leaving a hotel where the Chinese delegation was staying. Washington is seeking to reduce its $295bn goods trade deficit with Beijing and persuade China to renounce what the US says is a mercantilist economic model and contribute more to global consumption. Beijing has pushed back against what it sees as external interference and wants Washington to lower tariffs and clarify what it wants China to buy more of. China’s official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary on Saturday that the US’s “reckless abuse of tariffs” had destabilised the global economic order, but added that the negotiations represented “a positive and necessary step to resolve disagreements and avert further escalation”. Economic analysts have low expectations of a breakthrough. Trump said on Friday that an 80% tariff on Chinese goods “seems right”, suggesting for the first time a specific alternative to the 145% levies he has imposed on Chinese imports. He has suggested the discussions were initiated by China. Beijing said the US requested the discussions and that China’s policy of opposing US tariffs had not changed. The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told Fox News on Friday: “The president would like to work it out with China. He would like to de-escalate the situation.” Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, clarified that the US would not lower tariffs unilaterally and that China would need to make concessions. The Swiss economy minister, Guy Parmelin, met both parties in Geneva on Friday and said the fact the talks were taking place was already a success. “If a road map can emerge and they decide to continue discussions, that will lower the tensions,” he told reporters on Friday, saying talks could continue into Sunday or even Monday.",

    "title": "Australia’s rental crisis is not what you think it is",
    "article_text": "Footage of long queues at the doors ofproperties for leasehas become a regular feature of property reporting over the past few years. Landlords have upped their asking rents by double digits. Ahead of last weekend’s election, the Greens campaigned hard for rent freezes to stop the “unlimited rent increases” they claimed the major parties tacitly supported. There have been horror stories of single parents struggling to find an affordable home, while a lack of housing plagues residents indisaster-stricken towns such as Lismore. Yet the rental crisis is not what you think it is. That’s because for the vast majority of renting households, it’s not a crisis at all. Ben Phillips, an associate professor at the Australian National University Centre for Social Research and Methods, says talk of a national rental crisis is “overblown”. Phillips says much of the media attention has been focused on the rapid rise in advertised rents, which peaked at well over 15% in 2024, according to property research firm CoreLogic. That’s the fastest annual rate on record, according to this data stretching back about two decades. And since the end of 2019, this measure of rents has climbed by nearly 50%. But Phillips, a member of the Albanese government’s economic inclusion advisory committee, which has advocated for a major lift in the jobseeker payment, says these online advertised rents are only a small and unrepresentative share of the total rental market. They reflect how difficult and pricey it is to move rentals, or rent for the first time. What they don’t reflect is how much most of the roughly 3 million households with a lease are actually paying. And there, the picture is very different. The most comprehensive database on rents paid is produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as part of its consumer price index (or CPI, which measures inflation) series. The ABS each month tracks rental rates for about 600,000 properties, or nearly one in three leased homes. And by this measure, rents have climbed by 19% in just over five years - or less than half the CoreLogic reported rate. That’s not nothing, but it is two percentage points less than the overall increase in the CPI over that same period. In other words, rents have been a drag on overall inflation. Michael Fotheringham, the managing director of the AustralianHousingand Urban Research Institute, says Phillips’ analysis is right. The Corelogic rental data “show a more inflamed market than ABS data, and that’s because a significant proportion of renters are in a stable situation”, Fotheringham says. “They have been in that property for more than a year, and have a landlord who is not looking to jack up rents whenever they can,” he says. On the other hand, there are also renters who are struggling to find a property at a time when the national vacancy rate is at a record low of 1% – as it has been for the past two years – against a more typical rate of 2.5%. “They are both correct [the two sets of data] but they are talking about different things.” That said, Fotheringham says, there is a “fundamental problem with the word ‘crisis’”. The problems in the housing market have not appeared suddenly, like a natural disaster, he says, and an emergency response is not the way to fix the problems that ail the housing market. “We have a badly broken housing system that we have been sleepwalking into for 40 years. We need long, slow, multifaceted programs. It’s taken decades to get us into this mess, and it won’t be fixed by Christmas.” Phillips, in the research paperAustralian Rental Cost Trends, says the confusion over how much rental prices have increased boils down to the difference between the “stock” of properties versus the “flow” of properties. “Economists often make this distinction using a bath tub analogy,” he writes. “A smallflowof hot water (new rent data) makes little difference to a much colder and largerstockof water in the bath (all rents in the market).” Averages can hidea multitude of sins, but Phillips says the Albanese government’s boosts to rental assistance and parenting payments have helped cushion the impact of higher rents on lower income households. “There are people who are struggling, but the talk of a generalised rental crisis is overblown,” he says. Phillips’ analysis shows that rental affordability has actually improved over the past decade, with renters’ incomes rising faster than rents. Despite a recent uptick, he estimates that rental costs as a share of renters’ incomes have dropped “fairly substantially” from 28% in 2013 to 26% now. Similarly, a little over one in five renting adults in 2023 reported at least three forms offinancial stress– a threshold for severe pressure, according to the latest Hilda survey. That’s a lot, but it’s not much changed from the recent low of one in six in 2021, and it’s about the same as the 15-year average.",

    "article_text": "Former cabinet minister Ed Husic has promised to be “constructive” from the backbench despite taking aim at his deputy leader in an explosive interview on Sunday. “I want to play a constructive role,” he told Guardian Australia. But he added that he would speak out on “important” issues, no longer constrained by cabinet solidarity, the principle that all ministers express support for their collective decisions. Dumped from the cabinet on Thursday, Husic blamed deputy minister and right faction heavyweight,Richard Marles, whom he accused of being a “factional assassin”. On Sunday morning he told the ABC’s Insiders programhe believed his role in publicly criticising Israel was a factor in his ousting from cabinet. On Sunday afternoon he said he would continue to speak out. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “I won’t speak on everything but I will speak on the important things, the things my community and the country cares about,” he said. “Robust debate occurred in some of the most successful long-term Labor governments. They thrived in that environment back then and we can right now.” Husic had accused Marles of being a “factional assassin”, and said the prime minister should have intervened to save him. “The difficult issue here is that we’ve had barefaced ambition and a deputy prime minister [who] wields a factional club to reshape the ministry,” he told the ABC’s Insiders. “I think people when they look at a deputy prime minister, they expect to see a statesman, not a factional assassin.” Neither Marles, nor the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, or others in the cabinet responded in public to Husic’s comments on Sunday. Husic and former attorney general Mark Dreyfus were dropped by the right faction. The cabinet was oversubscribed with members of the New South Wales right faction, which forced Husic out, though he said he had volunteered rather than fight in a national ballot against his ministerial colleagues. In Victoria, Dreyfus was moved to make way for younger and newer MPs to enter the ministry. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Albanese has a highly experienced and mature cabinet, with many of its members having been a part of the Gillard and Rudd ministries between 2010 and 2013, including Chris Bowen, Mark Butler, Penny Wong, Tanya Plibersek and Julie Collins. Before the election, nine of the 23 cabinet ministers – or nine of the 22 after Bill Shorten resigned – had not previously been in the Rudd or Gillard ministries. During the election campaign, Albanese said some of his most senior ministers would remain in their portfolios – including Richard Marles, Jim Chalmers, Katy Gallagher, Penny Wong and Don Farrell. It’s expected new ministers will receive calls on Sunday afternoon, with Albanese understood to be announcing the new ministry on Monday, ahead of their swearing in at government house on Tuesday. NSW MP Michelle Rowland, a former senior lawyer, has been tipped to become the attorney general, replacing Dreyfus. Industrial relations minister and solicitor, Murray Watt, has also been mentioned as a possibility for the role. Western Australian MP Anne Aly may join the cabinet, with the western state a crucial part of Labor’s win in 2022, having lobbied for an extra spot. Senior ministers Mark Butler and Jason Clare may move to new portfolios, while Daniel Mulino, a new entrant to the ministry from Victoria and a Yale-educated economist, could fill the assistant treasurer role. There has also been speculation that Plibersek will move from the environment ministry.",

    "title": "Zelenskyy challenges Putin to meet in person for peace talks",
    "article_text": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy has challenged Vladimir Putin to meet in person for peace talks in Istanbul on Thursday, in a dramatic gambit after a weekend of diplomatic flurry. His comments came after Putin rejected a demand fromUkraineand European allies to sign up to a 30-day ceasefire, but said Russia was ready for direct negotiations with Ukraine. Putin said delegations from the two countries should meet on Thursday in Turkey. Although European leaders insisted there should be no negotiations until Putin agrees to a ceasefire, Donald Trump put pressure on Zelenskyy to agree “immediately” to negotiations this week in a post on Truth Social. Shortly afterwards Zelenskyy went public with his surprise offer. “We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy,” the Ukrainian president said in a statement. “There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.” The two leaders have not communicated directly since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and there have been no publicly known talks between Moscow and Kyiv since March 2022, shortly after the war began. Trump said in a statement on his Truth Social platform that Ukraine should “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!”. He said: “President Putin of Russia doesn’t want to have a Cease Fire Agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH. Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY. At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the U.S., will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!” The demand for a 30-day ceasefire was set out on Saturday during a visit to Kyiv by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, who together with Zelenskyy made a phone call to Trump before holding a joint press conference. Britain’s Keir Starmer said that if Putin rejected the offer, “we will respond, working with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions and increase our military aid for Ukraine’s defence to pressure Russia back to the table”. Putin’s response to the ultimatum came in the unusual form ofa statement read out to journalistsin a ceremonial Kremlin room at close to 2am local time. He accused Ukraine of breaking previous ceasefires, but said that “despite this” he was suggesting the two parties meet for talks, which he said could take place in Istanbul this Thursday. He did not say who would attend, though observers widely expected him to send his top diplomatic aides. “We are ready for serious talks with Ukraine, and we want to solve the root causes of the conflict,” he said. Putin’s tone appeared carefully calibrated to reject Europe’s demands but also make Moscow appear to be playing constructively in the eyes of the Trump administration, which has tended to be much softer on Moscow than on Kyiv until recent days. Putin made a point of thanking the new US administration for its efforts to resolve the conflict. Trump’s response suggests the tactic may have succeeded, delivering a significant blow to western unity. However, his Truth Social post also hinted at the frustration he has reportedly expressed in private in recent days over Moscow’s hardline demands in the war in Ukraine. By proposing a direct meeting with Putin in Istanbul, Zelenskyy appears to be seizing the initiative, putting pressure back on the Russian leader – who rarely travels spontaneously – to either attend or back down. Prior to Trump’s intervention, Zelenskyy and his chief of staff Andriy Yermak had both ruled out talks before a ceasefire. “First a 30-day ceasefire, then everything else,” said Yermak. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, had also written on X on Sunday morning that no talks would be possible until Putin agreed to the ceasefire. “There can be no negotiations while weapons are speaking. There can be no dialogue if, at the same time, civilians are being bombed,” hewrote. The flurry of back-and-forth offers and ultimatums suggests fast-moving diplomacy around the conflict, but behind the rhetoric it is not clear how much of the fundamental positions of the two sides have changed. Ukraine and its European allies want a full ceasefire, after which negotiations would start on a comprehensive settlement including a European “reassurance force” inside Ukraine, the exact composition and duties of which are still under discussion among allies. Putin, on the other hand, wants to keep fighting to increase the pressure on Ukraine to sign up to a number of Moscow’s core demands, which have changed little since the start of the war. As well as territorial claims to the regions it occupies, Moscow is expected to demand guarantees over Ukraine’s future political and military decisions. The Kremlin has already made it clear it would not accept western troops stationed in Ukraine. A top Putin aide, Yuri Ushakov, said on Sunday that the previous first round of Istanbul talks, in spring 2022, should serve as the basis for any new negotiations. Leaked drafts of those discussions suggest that the Russian terms presented amounted to an effective surrender for Ukraine. Trump’s support for Putin’s idea came afterhis Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, backed the European position, in a sign that the US president is often unpredictable even for his own team. “As President Trump has repeatedly said, stop the killing!! An unconditional 30 day ceasefire first and, during it, move into comprehensive peace discussions. Not the other way around,” Kelloggwroteon X. In the hours after Putin’s address on Sunday morning, Russia launched more than 100 drones at Ukraine, as a three-day ceasefire unilaterally declared by Putin came to an end. The ceasefire was pegged to the 80th anniversary of victory in the second world war, for which Putin presided over amilitary parade in Moscow on Fridaywith guests who included the leaders of China and Brazil. Kyiv rejected that ceasefire, saying it was a cynical attempt to avoid attacks on Russia during the set-piece parade, while Moscow continues to reject calls for a longer-term ceasefire.",

    "title": "Ukraine war: Trump envoy says ‘ceasefire first, talks later’ after Putin’s peace talk proposal – as it happened",
    "article_text": "General Keith Kellogg has reacted to the Russian president’s suggestion for talks with Ukraine on Thursday Donald Trump’s special envoy toUkraine,Gen Keith Kellogg, has reacted to Vladimir Putin’s proposal for direct talks with Ukraine. Retweeting the New Zealand prime minister’s support for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire,he wrote in a post on X: Even the Prime Minister of New Zealand gets it. As President Trump has repeatedly said, stop the killing!! An unconditional 30 day ceasefire first and, during it, move into comprehensive peace discussions. Not the other way around. Putin has not rejected the US-backed European ceasefire proposal, which has been offered to start tomorrow. But instead offered direct talks with Ukraine on Thursday. He seems to want to appear open to some form of negotiation to curry favour with the Trump administration. After Putin’s late night proposal, US president Donald Trump posted to Truth social: A potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine! Think of the hundreds of thousands of lives that will be saved as this never ending ‘bloodbath’ hopefully comes to an end. It will be a whole new, and much better, WORLD. Russian president Vladimir Putinproposed direct talkswith Ukraine on 15 May in Istanbul to achieve what he claims could be “the restoration of a long-term, lasting peace” if certain conditions are met. Putin said he wants to address what he calls “the root causes of the conflict”. In response, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia’s consideration of ending the war is a “positive sign” and that Ukraine is open to direct talks with Russia later this week, but only if Moscow signs up to an unconditional ceasefire first. European leaders from the UK, France, Germany and Poland demanded on Saturday in Kyiv that Putin agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire starting tomorrow or face “massive” new sanctions. Putin has dismissed what he said was the attempt by some European powers to lay down “ultimatums”. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, responded to Putin’s proposal for direct talks by saying there can be no proper negotiations while “civilians are being bombed”. German chancellor Friedrich Merz said Russia’s offer to negotiate directly with Ukraine is “a good sign” but “far from sufficient”. Donald Trump’s special envoy toUkraine, Gen Keith Kellogg, backed the 30 day unconditional ceasefire and said Putin should too. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said he was “ready to host negotiations” in Istanbul on Thursday, telling Putin in a phone call that a “window of opportunity” had opened for peace. Moscow and Kyiv have not held direct talks since March 2022, shortly after the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion in February of that year. Despite Putin’s call for so-called peace talks, Russia on Sunday launched a drone attack on Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine, according to officials. Thanks for following along today. We are now closing this blog. You can read all our Ukraine coveragehere. Ukrainian troops have carried out over 100 attacks on the western Russian region ofBelgorodover the past day, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov has said. We have not been able to independently verify this information. Lithuania’s foreign minister,Kęstutis Budrys, has condemned Russia’s continuing attacks onUkrainedespite Vladimir Putin’s offer for talks on Thursday (for context: overnight, the Ukrainian air force said Russia attacked Ukraine with 108 drones). “Putin’s answer to yet another ceasefire proposal: a swarm of 100 drones raining down on Ukraine overnight,”Budrys wrote in a post on X. “Putin is playing his usual game – wielding terror as leverage and stalling for time to avoid any real path to peace.” He added: Talking peace while Russian bombs keep falling on Ukrainian civilians is a farce. The rules are clear - unconditional ceasefire from Monday or face new tougher sanctions. The fact that Putin rushed to hold a press conference less than 24 hours after European leaders, backed by the US, demanded an unconditional ceasefire tells us everything. This approach works - and we must stick to it. Now we must follow through. If Russian guns do not go silent by Monday, a new round of sanctions must be enforced - without hesitation. When Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion ofUkrainethree years ago, he demanded that Ukraine renounce joining Nato, sharply cut its army, and “protect” Russian language and culture to keep the country in Moscow’s orbit. He since has also demanded that Kyiv withdraw its forces from the four regions Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022 but never fully occupied —Donetsk,Luhansk,ZaporizhzhiaandKherson. There areunconfirmed reportsthat the White House is considering recognising Russian control ofCrimea,which was illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, as part of a broad US proposal to end the war in Ukraine. Kyiv has said formally surrendering Crimea is a red line that goes against Ukraine’s constitution and would be a concession unconscionable to Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russian officials also have said that any so-called peace deal should involve releasing Russian assets that were frozen in the west and lifting other US and EU sanctions. The US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, will attend the informal Nato foreign ministers meeting in Turkey between 14- 16 May to discuss ending Russia’s war inUkraine. “Looking towards the Nato summit in The Hague this June, the secretary will advance President Trump’s agenda of ensuring that our allies contribute their fair share to making Nato stronger and more effective,” the state department said in a statement. Rubio said last month that Trump was still interested in trying to negotiate a truce deal, but added that the US had many other priorities around the world and was willing to “move on” unless there were signs of progress. Donald Trump’s special envoy toUkraine,Gen Keith Kellogg, has reacted to Vladimir Putin’s proposal for direct talks with Ukraine. Retweeting the New Zealand prime minister’s support for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire,he wrote in a post on X: Even the Prime Minister of New Zealand gets it.

The Kremlin said Turkish presidentRecep Tayyip Erdoğanhad told Vladimir Putin in a call that he “fully supported” the Russian leader’s proposal for direct negotiations withUkraineand was ready to host the talks in Istanbul on Thursday. Here is a summary of the call, provided by Turkey’s directorate of communications: President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke by phone with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The call addressed the Türkiye-Russia relations as well as regional and global matters. Welcoming President Putin’s statement for the peace talks between Russia and Ukraine to be resumed in İstanbul, President Erdoğan said that Türkiye stands ready to host the negotiations that will lead to a lasting solution. Noting that a window of opportunity to achieve peace has opened, President Erdoğan said that a comprehensive ceasefire would create the necessary environment for peace talks. It is approaching 3pm in Kyiv. Here is a roundup of the main events so far today: Russian president Vladimir Putinproposed direct talkswith Ukraine on 15 May in Istanbul to achieve what he claims could be “the restoration of a long-term, lasting peace” if certain conditions are met. Putin said he wants to address what he calls “the root causes of the conflict”.

German chancellor Friedrich Merz said Russia’s offer to negotiate directly with Ukraine is “a good sign” but “far from sufficient”. Despite Putin’s call for so-called peace talks, Russia on Sunday launched a drone attack on Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine, injuring one person in the region surrounding the capital and damaging several private homes, according to officials. You can read more on the latest developments from Ukraine inthis story. Poland’s prime ministerDonald Tuskis the latest to respond to Vladimir Putin’s proposal for direct talks withUkraine. Writing in a post on X, Tusk, who was with other European leaders in Kyiv on Saturday, said: In response to our appeal, the Russians have proposed peace talks starting May 15. The world, however, іs waiting for univocal decision on an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. Ukraine is ready. No more victims! The new German chancellorFriedrich Merzsaid on Sunday that Russia’s offer to negotiate directly withUkraineis “a good sign” but “far from sufficient”. “We expect Moscow to agree to a ceasefire that allows real talks to take place. First the weapons must be silenced, then the discussions can begin,” he said in a statement carried by the Agence France-Presse news agency. Merz,who was confirmed as chancellor after a shaky start on Tuesday, has promised to put staunch support of Ukraine at the heart of his government amid persistent concerns over US security commitments to Europe under Donald Trump. As the Guardian’s Europe correspondent, Jon Henley,notes in this story, Merz is more open than his predecessor Olaf Scholz to sending German long-range missiles to Ukraine and to deploying German troops as part of a peacekeeping force. He joined the UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron and Polish prime minister Donald Tusk in Kyiv on Saturday where they met Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a show of support for Ukraine. Nato member Turkey, led byRecep Tayyip Erdoğan, has positioned itself as a potential mediator in the war between Russia andUkraine. It has maintained cordial ties with both sides and has voiced support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and provided it with military help, while opposing western sanctions onRussia. Erdoğan on Sunday told his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron that a “historic turning point” had been reached in efforts to end the war, according to the Turkish president’s office. In a phone call, Erdoğan was quoted as having told Macron: A historic turning point has been reached in efforts to end the war between Ukraine and Russia, that this opportunity must be seized, and that Turkey is ready to provide all kinds of support, including hosting negotiations, to achieve a ceasefire and lasting peace. As a reminder, Russian president Vladimir Putin said the proposed talks with Ukraine – to “solve the root causes of the conflict” - should be held in the Turkish city of Istanbul on 15 May, as they have been before. Pope Leo XIVhas given his first Sunday message to crowds in St. Peter’s Square in Vatican Citysince his election as pontiff last week. The new pope called for an “authentic and lasting peace” inUkraineand a ceasefire in Gaza and release of all Israeli hostages. Leo called on the world’s major powers for “no more war”. He said he carries in his heart the “suffering of the beloved people of Ukraine” and appealed for negotiations to reach an “authentic, just and lasting peace”, carrying on the tradition of the late Pope Franciswho had called for talks between Ukraine andRussiato end the war and repeatedly condemned the senseless deaths of civilians. Russia says its soldiers are continuing with their “special military operation” – what the Kremlin calls the full-scale invasion of Ukraine - now that the three-day ceasefire has ended (see post at10.08for more details on this temporary truce). Russian forces have slowly increased the size of territory they control over the past year, making incremental battlefield gains mostly in the east ofUkraine.",

    "title": "‘Never again war’: Pope Leo calls for peace in Ukraine in first Sunday address",
    "article_text": "Pope Leo XIVhas called for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and pleaded for an end to global conflicts, which he likened to a “third world war in pieces”. In his first Sunday address at the Vatican, thenew pontiffurged an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian aid inGazaand the release of all hostages. He also welcomed thetruce between India and Pakistanand referenced the end of the second world war in 1945. Appearing on the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica, Leo blessed tens of thousands of people gathered in St Peter’s Square and echoed pleas for peace by his predecessor,Pope Francis. “I, too, address the world’s great powers by repeating the ever-present call, ‘never again war’,” he said. It was the pope’s first public appearance since he stepped out on a balcony last Thursday after a two-day conclave thatelected him as the 267th pope. Previously a little-known cardinal, Robert Prevost, 69, is thefirst US leaderof the Catholic church. Vatican observers seeking clues to the direction and style of his papacy noted he delivered the blessing not from a studio window used by his predecessors, but from the central balcony. He wore a simple white cassock without the formal red cape, and instead of reciting the Latin Regina Caeli prayer, he sang it. “I carry in my heart the sufferings of the beloved Ukrainian people,” he said. “Let everything possible be done to achieve genuine, just and lasting peace as soon as possible.” Speaking amid renewed internationalpressure on Russia to halt hostilities, Leo called for the release of war prisoners and the return of Ukrainian children to their families. He also urged a ceasefire in Gaza, which Israeli forces have continued to pound, the return of hostages seized in the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023, and humanitarian aid for the “exhausted civilian population”. Food and medicine shortages have left babiesseverely malnourished. Leo noted that many countries celebrated Mother’s Day on Sunday and wished all mothers, “including those in heaven”, a happy Mother’s Day. Earlier, he celebrated a private mass in the grottoes beneath St Peter’s, which contain the tombs of previous popes. On Saturday, Leo crossed Rome to pray at the tomb of Francis, who broke with tradition by asking to be buried at the basilica ofSanta Maria Maggiore. Leo’s formal installation mass is due next Sunday, 18 May.",

    "title": "Trump to embark on Middle East trip to meet Gulf allies",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumpthis week will embark on the first foreign trip of his second administration with a tour of the Middle East, as he looks to secure investment, trade and technology deals from friendly leaders with deep pockets amid turbulent negotiations around numerous regional conflicts, includingIsrael’s war in Gaza. The tour through the Middle East is largelya repeat of his first international trip in 2017, when he was feted in the region as a transactional leader eager to secure quick wins and capable of providing support for the regional monarchies’ economic and geopolitical interests. His negotiations inSaudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates will focus on a number of topics, including oil and trade, investment deals, the regional conflicts in Israel-Gaza and Yemen, and negotiations over the Iran nuclear programme among other issues. But Trump’s key goal is to come out of the region saying that he put America first, say observers. “I think what he’s clearly looking to get out of this is deals, the announcement of multiple multi-billion dollar deals,” said Steven A Cook, the senior fellow for Middle East and Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. “The president’s approach to foreign policy is heavily influenced by … his version of economic statecraft, which is to look towards the wealthy states in the Gulf and their very large sovereign wealth funds as sources of investment in the United States,” he said. Trump has already announced Saudi Arabia’s commitment to invest $1tn into the US economy and is hoping to secure big-ticket investments on Monday’s visit. That would be consistent with his “America first” policy of prioritising domestic interests, Cook said. Those countries may also seek access to advanced US semiconductor exports, and Saudi Arabia will want to ink a deal on civilian nuclear infrastructure, which had previously been tied to the country’s normalisation of relations with Israel. In a departure from previous policy, theTrump administrationhas indicated the two issues are no longer linked. The Middle East trip is notable for the US president’s lack of plans to visit Israel, where Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet havefloated plans to launch a larger invasion of Gazaand expel the Palestinian population there in what critics have called a broad plan of ethnic cleansing. The Israel-Gaza war will loom large over the negotiations, as Saudi Arabia has said it will not normalise relations with Israel unless there is a clear path to a two-state solution, and many countries in the Middle East have spoken out againsta proposal that beganwith Trump to expel Palestinian from Gaza to other Arab countries. “He could have gone to Israel like he did last time,” said Elliot Abrams, former deputy national security adviser under George W Bush and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. He added that Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, had cancelled a planned trip to Israel. “I think there’s some tension here … [Israel] knows that Trump is going to be spending a week in the Gulf hearing about Gaza, Gaza, Gaza, Gaza every day. So it’s not the best moment in US-Israel or Trump-Israel relations.” There is a growing understanding in Washington and Israel thatTrump has taken a step backfrom attempting to mediate the war in Gaza. His administration said that they would negotiate a new aid deal without the direct involvement of the Israeli government to renew deliveries of aid into Gaza, which is suffering its worst humanitarian crisis of the war since a ceasefire collapsed in March. “He’s the only one who speaks the same language as Netanyahu, and he’s the only one who can speak to Netanyahu in a language that Netanyahu will understand,” said Ami Ayalon, a former director of the Israel Security Agency, also known as the Shin Bet. “Trump again, when it comes to to the hostages, when it comes to our relations in the Palestinians, has become the center of everything in the Middle East,” he said. That turns Trump’s attention to the things he can get done. He has said that he plans to decide on his trip to Saudi Arabia on an announcement thatthe US could refer to the Arabian Gulfor the Gulf of Arabia rather than the Persian Gulf. That has angered Iran at a moment when the Gulf states appear largely in support of US efforts in talks on the future of the Iranian nuclear programme. As opposed to 2017, the Gulf states have largely spoken in support of renewed negotiations between the United States and Iran over the nuclear programme, but those governments were said to be unclear on the details of any deal as of yet. “US partners have confided to me that there are US statements on all of these issues, but they don’t yet see US policies,” said Jon Alterman, the director of the Middle East Program at CSIS, a thinktank. “The US government doesn’t speak with one voice and its actions remain uncoordinated.” In Saudi Arabia, Trump has enlisted his son-in-law Jared Kushner to act as a point man for the discussions ahead of the trip, CNN has reported. Kushner, who was Trump’s envoy to the region during his first administration, is said to be tasked with making progress in discussions of Saudi Arabia joiningthe Abraham accords. But his role is also tainted by a perceived conflict of interest given his family’s business interests in the region. Yet with such a complicated tableau of economic and geopolitical interests in the region, there are questions about whether the Trump administration has the focus and the team to pursue a comprehensive policy in the region. Many in Trump’s orbit say that US policy should place lower priority on the Middle East, and focus instead on China and the Indo-Pacific region. “I think the sense that there’s these pieces that the President is negotiating don’t respond together, and that his priority really is essentially domestic focus, securing, you know, agreements to invest in the estates,” said Cook. “Regionally, the president would like these issues to go away, and that’s why he has these compressed timelines he doesn’t want to focus on.”",

    "title": "There is suffering everywhere you look, says mother of emaciated baby girl trapped in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Siwar Ashour was born into war and hunger and has known nothing else. She is now in real danger of dying without ever having known a moment of peace or contentment. The six-month-old Palestinian girl, whose painfully emaciated body symbolised the deliberate starvation of Gaza when sheappeared on the BBCthis week, was only 2.5kg when she was born on 20 November last year. From birth, Siwar had a problem with her oesophagus that has made it hard for her to drink breast milk and left her dependent on specialised formula, which is in critically short supply. Her parents’ home in al-Nuseirat, halfway up the coast on the Gaza Strip, was bombed earlier in the war, which began in October 2023 when Hamas killed 1,200 people inIsrael, leading to an Israeli assault that has so far killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza. They lived in tents for a while but it was almost impossible to get food or water in the camp and it also came under Israeli fire. They tried going back to al-Nuseirat to stay at Siwar’s grandparents’ home, but that was bombed, too. All that was left of the building was a single room, which they shared with 11 other people. That was where Siwar was born. “I was exhausted all the time. There was no privacy, and I couldn’t get any rest,” Najwa Aram, Siwar’s 23-year-old mother said. “There was no food or proper nutrition, and when I gave birth to her, she was not like other babies.” “When she was born, she was beautiful despite the weakness visible on her features,” she said. “But now she is unnaturally thin. Babies her age are supposed to weigh six kilograms6kg or more – not just 2 to 4kg.” Najwa found out last month she was pregnant with her second child, but lives in terror of losing Siwar before her brother or sister is born. She has moved to Khan Younis to stay with her mother, but has spent most of the past few months in hospital with her frail daughter. Her husband, Saleh, is blind, and had to stay behind in al-Nuseirat. The relentless bombing has forced the family to move several times, like almost all families inGaza, and has torn them apart. “Even though Siwar’s father is blind, he used to play with her a lot. He visited us in the hospital only once, as he cannot move without someone accompanying him,” Najwa said. “He fears for her even more than I do – he is deeply attached to her.” The family has no source of income so relies on charity kitchens for food and some humanitarian aid, but that too is in desperately short supply as Israel’s total blockade of Gaza approaches the 70-day mark. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN relief agency, Unrwa,said this week: “the manmade and politically motivated starvation in Gaza is an expression of absolute cruelty”. Najwa and her mother have a single sack of flour left, as well as a few tins. “Once this runs out, we won’t be able to buy anything due to the high prices,” Najwa said. Even more critically, supplies of the special milk formula that Siwar needs are harder and harder to find. “I am also suffering from malnutrition. Still, I try to breastfeed Siwar, but she refuses and continues to cry, completely rejecting me,” Najwa said. “That’s why I’ve had to rely more on formula milk. When I used to breastfeed her, one can of formula would last a month. Now it runs out in less than a week.” Najwa and her daughter spent much of March in hospital in Deir al-Balah, where there was a milk formula that seemed to work, bringing Siwar’s weight up to 4kg. “I noticed that Siwar started to smile and play, which made me happy and gave me hope that her health might improve.” But that fragile moment of hope crumbled when they were discharged, and Siwar started losing weight again. She was referred to Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, where mother and daughter remain, for now. “The doctors are doing everything they can to take care of her, but she also doesn’t tolerate the formula they prepare for her,” Najwa said. “The hospital situation is bad. There are six patients in each room. Everywhere you look, there is suffering. There’s a child in worse condition than Siwar.” “Seeing my daughter in this state every day gives me insomnia,” she said. “I’m constantly anxious and overthinking. Sometimes I can’t bear seeing her like this, and I start crying. I’m so afraid of losing her. Can’t the world open the crossings to allow in milk, food, and medicine. All I want is for my daughter Siwar to live like the rest of the children in the world.” Dr Ahmed al-Farah, the director of the children’s and maternity building at the Nasser medical complex, said between five and 10 new malnutrition cases are being recorded there every day. “We’re seeing severe cases.Malnutritionappears in children in a horrifying and extremely visible way,” Farah said. “We have nothing to offer them. They need proteins, but there are none. We try to provide a little milk, perhaps powdered milk, but we can’t offer anything more. “On top of that, the severe overcrowding in hospitals leads to increased disease transmission among children,” he added. There is only enough fuel left at the Nasser complex to keep the generators going for another 48 hours. They have already had to shut off electricity on the administrative floors to make it last a little bit longer, but the power supply will soon have to be cut to the overcrowded patients’ wards. “We are helpless in the face of their needs – we cannot provide food, supplements, medication, or vitamins appropriate for their conditions,” the doctor said. “I studied malnutrition in medical school textbooks. I used to think that study would remain theoretical, something we’d never see in real life. But now, those textbook descriptions have come to life before our eyes in Gaza,” Farah said. “I call on the world to see us as human beings – we were created just like everyone else.”",

    "title": "India and Pakistan both claim victory after ceasefire declared",
    "article_text": "India andPakistanhave both claimed victory after a ceasefire was declared over the weekend, which brought the two nuclear-nations back from the brink of war. After days of escalating clashes that culminated in both sides launching missile and drone strikes on each other’s major military bases – the closest they had come to full-scale war in decades – the ceasefire between India and Pakistan wasdeclared by Donald Trumpon Saturday evening. On Sunday, Trump further congratulated the two countries on “having the strength, wisdom and fortitude to fully know and understand that it was time to stop the current aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many, and so much”. Within hours of the truce announcement, there were fears it had fallen apart after firing restarted along the disputed border inKashmirand missiles and drones were once again launched into Indian-administered Kashmir. However, by Sunday morning things were quiet on both sides of the frontier, leading many to hope the fragile peace would hold. Each side accused the other of triggering the violations and Pakistan said it remained “committed to faithful implementation of ceasefire”. The Indian army said in a press briefing it had conveyed a message, through its “hotline” with Pakistan, that if there were any more cross-border provocations “our firm and clear intent to respond to these fiercely”. Both India and Pakistan claimed the ceasefire as a victory, fuelling a surge of nationalistic fervour on both sides of the border. India’s defence minister, Rajnath Singh, said on Sunday the “roar of Indian forces reached Rawalpindi, the very headquarters of the Pakistani army”. He said the military offensive, named Operation Sindoor, was “not just a military action but a symbol of India’s political, social and strategic willpower”. In Pakistan, parades were held near the border to shower the military with petals, and the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, declared 11 May to be a day “in recognition of the armed forces’ response to recent Indian aggression”. Writing in Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper, commentator Baqir Sajjad called the ceasefire a “calculated victory” by Pakistan that “firmly denied a much stronger India the military edge and diplomatic narrative it sought to dominate”. Parties and rallies were held across the country to mark the day, particularly in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, which was on the frontline of weeks of aggressive cross-border shelling. Raja Farooq Haider Khan, a former leader of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, led a celebratory rally near the disputed Kashmir border. “We are celebrating the bravery of our armed forces today who defended us,” he said. He offered his gratitude to Trump for helping to resolve the conflict. “This time we were so close to war so his involvement was very welcome. But we have to say that without resolving the Kashmir issue long-term, peace can’t prevail in the region.” Sahad, a resident in Neelum Valley in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, said the past few days had been the scariest of her life. “No one can be happier than us as we live under the shadow of border posts and Indian firings. Everyone is happy to have our normal lives back,” she said. There were also celebrations on the Indian side of the border. However, residents near the disputed frontier said that while a ceasefire was welcome, it did not solve the underlying problem of the often bloody dispute between India and Pakistan over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which goes back to the partition of India in 1947. Lal Din, 55, a resident of Poonch, the worst-affected area along India’s border in Kashmir, where hundreds of houses were destroyed and dozens killed in the cross-border fire, said Kashmiris has seen this same situation – “temporary ceasefires brokered by global powers” – many times before. “The core issue remains unresolved – soldiers still face each other with weapons and tanks,” he said. “Today it was one dispute, tomorrow it will be another, and the guns will roar again, trapping civilians like me in the crossfire. We’re just numbers in this clash of nuclear powers. I beg both sides: resolve your differences, live in peace, and let us live.” After weeks of mounting tensions, the attacks this week began on Wednesday when Indian missilesstruck nine sitesin Pakistan, killing 31 people. India has said those strikes were aimed at “terrorist infrastructure and terrorist training camps” as retribution for an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in whichmilitants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, which it blamed on Pakistani-backed extremists. The situation escalated further after India accused Pakistan of two consecutive nights of drone attacks. The US took sizeable credit for brokering Saturday’s ceasefire, with Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, and JD Vance, the vice-president, reported to have spent 48 hours embroiled in intense diplomatic negotiations with the two countries, finally convincing them to lay down arms on Saturday. Other countries, including Saudi Arabia and the UK, were also credited. Vance had initially said the US would not interfere in the escalating hostilities between the US and Pakistan, claiming it was “none of our business”. However, according to sources, their attitude shifted after concerns were raised by US intelligence that the conflict posed a risk of escalating into a full nuclear threat. The reportedly pro-active role played by the US in the ceasefire, including phone calls made by Trump himself, seemed to have piqued the president’s interest in the subcontinent and he pledged to substantially increase trade with both India and Pakistan. At a press briefing on Sunday, Indian military spokespeople offered more details on its offensive against Pakistan and claimed it was Pakistan that had first requested a ceasefire. India said five of its soldiers were killed by Pakistani firing over the border and claimed Pakistan lost about 40 solders in firing along the line of control. It also claimed to have killed 100 terrorists living over the border in Pakistan. The numbers could not be verified. It also claimed to have “downed a few Pakistani planes”, though it did not elaborate further. Asked about claims made by Pakistan, and backed up by expert analysis of debris, that Pakistani missiles had downed at least three Indian military jets during the offensive on Wednesday, including multimillion-dollar French Rafale jets, India said “losses are a part of conflict” and that all its pilots had returned home.",

    "title": "Amid fragile ceasefire, Trump promises to boost trade with India and Pakistan",
    "article_text": "A fragile ceasefirewas holding between India and Pakistan on Sunday, after hours of overnight fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as US president Donald Trump said he would work to provide a solution regarding Kashmir. The arch-rivals were involved in intense firing for four days, the worst in nearly three decades, with missiles and drones being fired at each other’s military installations and dozens of people killed. A ceasefire agreement was reached after diplomacy and pressure from the US, but within hours artillery fire was witnessed in IndianKashmir, the centre of much of the fighting. Blasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities near the border under blackout, similar to the previous two evenings, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses. Late on Saturday, India saidPakistanhad violated the understanding to stop firing and that Indian armed forces had been instructed to “deal strongly” with any repetition. In response, Pakistan said it was committed to the ceasefire and blamedIndiafor the violations. By dawn, the fighting and explosions reported overnight had died down on both sides of the border, according to Reuters witnesses. Power was restored in most areas along India’s border towns after a blackout the previous night. Trump praised leaders of both countries for agreeing to halt the aggression. “While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great nations,” he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. “Additionally, I will work with you both to see if ... a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.” In the border city of Amritsar, home to the Golden Temple revered by Sikhs, a siren sounded in the morning to resume normal activities brought a sense of relief and people were seen out on the roads. The fighting started on Wednesday, two weeks after26 men were killed in an attacktargeting Hindus in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. “Ever since the day terrorists attacked people in Pahalgam we have been shutting our shops very early and there was an uncertainty,” said Satvir Singh Alhuwalia, 48, a shopkeeper in Amritsar. “I am happy that at least there will be no bloodshed on both sides.” Officials in Pakistan said there was some firing in Bhimber in Pakistani-administered Kashmir overnight but nowhere else, and there were no casualties. The two countries, born out of British colonial rule in 1947, have gone to war three times - twice over the region of Kashmir. Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan both rule part of Kashmir but claim it in full. India blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of Kashmir that began in 1989 and has killed tens of thousands. It also blames Pakistani Islamist militant groups for attacks elsewhere in India. Pakistan says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists. The combined death toll in the recent skirmishes has reached nearly 70, officials have said.",

    "title": "Less than 1% of UK biosecurity budget goes on tackling invasive species, figures show",
    "article_text": "Less than 1% of the government’s biosecurity budget goes on tackling invasive species, despite the danger they pose to British wildlife, figures suggest. Conservationists warned the funding to address non-native plants and animals was failing to match the risk they posed to “cherished” native species, from water voles to ladybirds, as well as to waterways, homes, businesses and local green spaces. They have called for more resources for border checks to stop non-native species arriving here, and funding for local groups to tackle the problem on the ground. A freedom of information request to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) byWildlifeand Countryside Link (WCL) shows only £2.47m of the estimated £250m biosecurity budget was spent on invasive species. Of that figure, only £250,000 was being channelled to local groups tackling non-native species – such as the rhododendrons and giant blackberries that are strangling woodlands and grasslands – conservationists said. The figures also showed £22.7m of the wider biodiversity budget – about 3% of the spend on protecting important habitats and species – was put towards stopping all invasive species, including Asian, or yellow-legged, hornets, WCL said. The conservationists said the hornets, which pose a threat to honeybees and other insects, bucked the trend of low funding, with more than £2.2m spent solely on fighting them, while just under £500,000 was spent in the same period on local action for wider invasive species. Research found that efforts in the UK have delayed the hornets’ establishment, whereas the insects have already taken hold in many other countries. However, WCL warned the hornet was likely to establish here at some point, showing the need for greater border check powers and resourcing to stop these species arriving in the UK in the first place. Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion The wildlife experts said invasive species played a major role in more than 60% of extinctions worldwide. Examples in the UK included water voles being preyed on by non-native mink, as well as red squirrels facing competition and disease spread by their grey cousins. Lisa Manning, policy officer at WCL, said invasive species were “one of the biggest risks” to cherished species, adding they “wreak havoc” on waterways while damaging businesses, homes and local green spaces. She warned: “We need more border check powers and resources to prevent new harmful species arriving. “And more funding is needed to fight invasive species that have already arrived, so local groups can stop struggling on an annual basis and take the long-term action needed for nature.” A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: “This government will never waver in its duty to protect the UK’s biosecurity. “That’s why we are bolstering our national biosecurity with a £208m investment to set up aNational Biosecurity Centreand, just last week, announced £10m of funding for cutting-edge surveillanceprojects to detect the spread of diseasesand non-native species.” An APHA spokesperson said: “Our teams work hard to tackle the threat of invasive non-native species, which cost the GB economy nearly £2bn a year, and help deliver a seamless border that maintains frictionless trade while protecting biosecurity. “Members of the public who encounter invasive non-native species should report them, following instructions on theNon-Native Species Secretariatwebsite.”",

    "title": "NHS scheme to prevent brain injuries in childbirth extended across England",
    "article_text": "An NHS programme to boost maternity safety and prevent brain injuries during childbirth is to be rolled out acrossEngland. The avoiding brain injuries in childbirth (ABC) programme is designed to help maternity staff better identify signs that a baby is in distress during labour so they can act quickly. It is also intended to help staff respond more effectively to obstetric emergencies, such as where the baby’s head becomes lodged deep in the mother’s pelvis during a caesarean birth. The government said the programme, which will begin from September and follows apilot scheme in nine maternity units, would reduce the number of avoidable brain injuries during childbirth, helping to prevent lifelong conditions such as cerebral palsy. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: “All expectant mothers giving birth in anNHShospital should have peace of mind that they are in safe hands. This vital programme will give staff across the country the right tools and training to deliver better care to women and their babies, reducing the devastating impact of avoidable brain injuries.” The mostrecent datafrom the neonatal data analysis unit at Imperial College London shows that 2,490 babies had at least one episode of care for brain injury during or after birth in 2021, equating to 4.2 per 1,000 live births. The pilot scheme, which launched in October, was delivered by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) and the Healthcare Improvement Studies Institute (This). Ranee Thakar, the RCOG president, said: “The ABC programme supports multidisciplinary maternity teams to deliver safer, more personalised care. Hundreds of maternity staff, including obstetricians, midwives and anaesthesiologists, have been involved in developing and testing this quality improvement programme. “We have heard what a difference it makes, supporting teams to work effectively together in time-sensitive and high-pressure situations. The RCOG is extremely proud to have been part of this fantastic collaboration.” The government said the programme should give clinicians more confidence to take swift action managing an emergency. The RCM chief executive, Gill Walton, said: “The ABC programme has brought together all those involved in maternity care, offering practical solutions to some of the most acute clinical challenges. “Crucially the ABC programme tools and training have been developed based on the voices of women, families and maternity staff. This has been the key to the success of the pilot programme. Equally, the will and drive of midwives and the wider multidisciplinary team to improve safety and outcomes for women and their families has been evident across the course of the training at the pilot sites.” The programme is expected to reduce inequalities in maternity outcomes across England so that most maternity units achieve outcomes comparable to the current highest-performing 20% of trusts. Prof Mary Dixon-Woods, the director of This, said the programme would reduce unwarranted variation. “The pilot has shown that it’s possible to train people effectively and efficiently,” she said. “A national commitment to implement the programme at scale will be important in ensuring that the benefits are seen.”",

    "title": "Eighty percent of England’s peatlands are dry and degraded, mapping shows",
    "article_text": "New mapping of England’s peatlands has revealed that 80% of the habitats are dry and degraded. Scientists mapped England’s peatlands and peaty soils for the first time using satellite imagery, artificial intelligence and in-depth data analysis to create the most complete map to date, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said. The open source map, launched on the government’s website on Monday, models the extent, depth and condition of England’s peat, encompassing vegetation, gullies and human-made and natural draining channels. Healthy peatlands can help to tackle the climate crisis, reduce flood risk, improve water quality and support rare wildlife including the golden plover, curlews and 25 species of dragonflies. However, degraded peat means carbon is emitted into the atmosphere, contributing to global heating. The map found that peaty soil covers roughly 8.5% of England’s surface, with the most extensive peatland habitats in the Pennines, North York Moors, parts of the Lake District and the uplands of the south-west. However, the research also found that 80% of England’s peatlands were in a dry and degraded condition. The map showed that while three-quarters of the peatlands are covered by plants and land use types associated with dryer conditions, only 1% were covered by important peat-forming plants such as sphagnum moss. Dr Sallie Bailey, Natural England’s chief scientist, said: “Trying to map something that’s largely underground, changes in volume depending on whether it’s rained recently and tries to swallow you up every time you set foot in it comes with its challenges, which makes this map extraordinary in its accomplishment and something of a global first. “Mapping peat to this level of detail will help us maximise the benefits of peat and massively advances our understanding of the role our peatlands are playing in a changing climate.” Defra has said understanding how much peat England has is the first step to calculating how much carbon it holds and how much it is releasing. Ministers also hope that land managers will use the map to better understand and restore peatland, through measures such as blocking drainage channels to re-wet the land, and that it will help decision-makers in balancing biodiversity and carbon storage with food security. Tony Juniper, the chair of Natural England, said: “The benefits of healthy peatlands are well documented. They are our biggest natural carbon stores, essential to the water cycle and refuge to some of our rarest plants and wildlife, such as the carnivorous sundew plant, marsh violet, and charismatic birds like golden plover and curlew. “The England peat map will allow us to make far better and more informed decisions when it comes to managing peatlands – targeting restoration efforts to the most degraded peat and identifying the best opportunities for nature recovery.” Caroline Thorogood, the National Trust’s lead for peatlands, said: “The data in the map will help us take a significant step forward to more accurately map peatlands that we own and care for in England and understand their condition. “This will allow us to better identify priorities and action future work to recover our precious peatlands, helping nature thrive and providing benefits such as carbon storage and water regulation.”",

    "title": "English test among range of Labour measures to control immigration",
    "article_text": "Adults accompanying foreign workers to the UK will be expected to pass an English language test and care homes will beprevented from recruiting staff from abroadas part of a swathe of new measures to be revealed by Keir Starmer to “tighten up” the immigration system. Amid a recent surge in support forReform UK, the prime minister will say on Monday that overseas arrivals should commit “to learning our language” and will promise to overhaul a “broken system” that encourages businesses to “bring in lower-paid workers”. The government will also end the right of foreign workers to automatically apply for settlement in the UK after five years, instead extending their wait to a 10-year requirement, the prime minister will say. The announcements are part of Labour’s long-awaited white paper on immigration to be put before parliament on Monday, and follow the electoral success of Nigel Farage’s party in the local elections this month. Also included will be plans to deport more foreign criminals, tell employersthey must train UK staffand requirements that skilled workers entering Britain have a degree. Net migration, the difference between the number of people moving to the UK and the number leaving, stood at 728,000 in the 12 months to June 2024. Under the last Conservative government, the figure surged to more than 900,000. “Every area of the immigration system, including work, family and study, will be tightened up so we have more control,” the prime minister is expected to say on Monday. In language more closely associated with populist parties, Starmer will say the white paper “will ensure settlement in this country is a privilege that must be earned, not a right. “And when people come to our country, they should also commit to integration and to learning our language.” Every adult accompanying a worker into the UK will be expected to pass an online English Level A1 test, which demands understanding of everyday expressions, and seeks questions and answers on simple personal details such as where he or she lives. If workers apply for an extension to a visa, their dependants will be expected to pass the more advanced English A2 test. If they apply for settlement, they will be expected to pass a B2 exam, which requires them to understand “complex text on both concrete and abstract topics” and “interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity”. English language requirements across every immigration route will be raised at some point in the future, sources said, which could force people who arrive in the UK from war zones to be tested on language skills before being granted permission to enter the UK. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said on Sunday that thecare worker visa would be closedfor overseas recruitment under proposals in the white paper. Asked by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg where care homes would recruit staff from, Cooper said companies should recruit from a pool of people who came as care workers in good faith but had been “exploited” by unscrupulous employers. “Care companies should be recruiting from those workers. They can also extend existing visas. They could recruit as well from people who are on other visas, who are already here. But we do think it’s time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad,” she said. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Cooper declined to set a specific target for net migration, but said ministers believed changes to certain visas could result in “up to 50,000 fewer lower-skilled visas” over the next year. At present, foreign criminals are only reported to theHome Officeif they receive a jail sentence and only those given a year behind bars are usually considered for deportation. Under new arrangements, the Home Office will be informed of all foreign nationals convicted of offences – not just those who receive prison sentences – and will be able to use wider removal powers on other crimes, including swifter action to remove people who have recently arrived in the country but already committed crimes. The Home Office will also introduce rules so that any foreign national placed on the sex offender register, regardless of sentence length, will be classed as having committed a “serious crime” with no right to asylum protections in the UK. Other proposals are expected to include new rules so that companies that repeatedly fail to show efforts to recruit UK-based staff, rather than recruit from abroad, could lose their right to sponsor foreign workers. Sectors targeted by the government include engineering and IT. It is expected that work visas will be strictly time-limited for most jobs that do not need graduate-level skills. Foreign students who have studied for degrees in the UK will face tighter rules over their right to remain after finishing university. Ministers also plan to introduce a Labour Market Evidence Group, made up of officials from industry and skills bodies, as well as from the government and the Migration Advisory Council. It would, the Home Office said, “inform understanding of where sectors are overly reliant on overseas labour and reverse underinvestment in domestic skills”. As well as winning control of 10 councils on 1 May, Reform UK, which is promising an effective freeze on most migration, is topping most polls of national voter preference. Reacting to the proposals, Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “It’s right that ministers look to address concern over immigration but the public wants principled competence rather than populist performance.” Care England, which represents care homes, has labelled the changes to care visas a “crushing blow to an already fragile sector”, while Unison has linked “hostile language” to a “fall off a cliff” for applications for care visas. Martin Green, Care England’s chief executive accused the government of “kicking us while we’re already down”. “For years, the sector has been propping itself up with dwindling resources, rising costs and mounting vacancies,” he said.“International recruitment wasn’t a silver bullet, but it was a lifeline. Taking it away now, with no warning, no funding, and no alternative, is not just shortsighted – it’s cruel.” Christina McAnea, general secretary of the Unison union, said that the “NHS and the care sector would have collapsed long ago without the thousands of workers who’ve come to the UK from overseas”.",

    "title": "Hamas says it will release last living American hostage in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Hamasannounced on Sunday that it will release the last living American hostage in Gaza, Edan Alexander, anIsraeli-American soldier who was kidnapped on 7 October 2023. Donald Trumpconfirmed the news ina social media post, writing that Alexander, 21, “is coming home to his family”. “This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,” the US president added. The captive’s release is set to take place on Tuesday, Reuters reports, citing a source familiar with the matter. Trump begins atrip to the Middle Eastthe same day, although there is no stop in Israel on his schedule as of yet. The president is set to visit Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff,toldthe Israeli newspaper Haaretz he will travel to Israel on Monday. “Right now, the intention is to return Edan Alexander home to his family,” Witkoff said. Adam Boehler,the US special envoy for hostage affairs, is traveling to Israel with Alexander’s parents, a US officialtold Axios. The office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in astatement: “The US has informed Israel of Hamas’s intention to release soldier Edan Alexander as a gesture to the Americans, without conditions or anything in exchange. The US has conveyed to Israel that this is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of hostages according to the original Witkoff framework, which Israel has already accepted. Israel is preparing for the possibility that this effort will be implemented.” The statement made clear thatIsraelhad not agreed to a ceasefire, and intends to continue its military assault on Gaza. “In accordance with Israel’s policy, the negotiations will be held under fire, based on the commitment to achieve all of the objectives of the war,” Netanyahu’s office said. Israel will not be asked to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of Alexander,Axios reports, but will have to agree to a temporary ceasefire and a halt to drone flights over Gaza to allow Alexander to safely leave the enclave. Alexander’s family said ina statementreleased by the Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum: “The family confirms that it has been informed of Hamas’s announcement and that it is in constant contact with the American government regarding the possibility of Edan’s expected release in the coming days.” Boehler,the hostage envoy, told Reuters the planned release of Alexander was “a positive step forward” and asked forHamasto also release of the bodies of four other Americans who have died in captivity in Gaza. According to Haaretz, the four dead Americans include two who were serving in the Israeli military, Omer Neutra, 21, and Itay Hen, 19, and two older Israeli-Americans, Judih Weinstein-Haggai, 70, and her husband Gad Haggai, 73, were living in the Israeli kibbutz Nir Oz on theGazaborder when it was raided by Hamas-led militants on 7 October. Khalil al-Hayya, a Hamas leader in Gaza, said in a statement the group is ready to “immediately start intensive negotiation” to reach a final deal that will end Israel’s deadly war on Gaza. Over the last year and a half, Israeli forces have killed at least 52,800 Palestinians while forcibly displacing 2 million survivors –including babies– across the narrow strip amid widespread food and aid shortages due to Israeli restrictions. Meanwhile, 59 hostages remain in Gaza. According to Trump, just 21 remain alive. The governments of Qatar and Egypt, which have been brokering talks aimed at ending the war in Gaza, said ina joint statementthat Hamas’s decision to release Alexander was “a gesture of goodwill and a positive step toward resuming negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire”. Alexander, who was born in Israel but raised in the US by Israeli parents, moved to Israel in 2022 after graduating high school and enlisted in the Israeli military. His parents and two younger siblings still live in Tenafly, New Jersey. “Pray that Hamas follows through and Edan gets to come home,” JD Vance, the US vice-president, posted online on Sunday. “If they do, it will have been another triumph of Steve Witkoff, who continues to face withering attacks for freeing hostages, negotiating complex diplomatic proposals, and serving his country (at great financial cost)”.",

    "title": "White House claims China trade deal reached while Beijing hails ‘important first steps’",
    "article_text": "The White House has announced that a trade deal withChinahas been struck aftertwo days of talks in Geneva, while Beijing has hailed “important first steps.” The announcement on Sunday came after the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told reporters that there had been “substantial progress” in talks between his team and that of theChinesevice-premier, He Lifeng, in Geneva on defusing the trade war between the world’s two largest economies sparked byDonald Trump’s 145% tariffs. At a news conference later on Sunday, He, the top Chinese trade official, called the talks “candid” and said substantive progress had been made to reach an “important consensus”, according toChina’s state-run media. The two sides will issue a joint statement agreed during the talks on Monday, the vice-premier said. In televised remarks that wereposted on social mediaby the White House, Bessent said he would give more details on Monday, “but I can tell you that the talks were productive”. The US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, who spoke alongside Bessent,suggestedmore strongly that a deal had been reached. “It’s important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought,” Greer said. “Just remember why we’re here in the first place,” he added. “The United States has a massive $1.2tn trade deficit, so the president declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs, and we’re confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to resolve, work toward resolving that national emergency.” The two sides have agreed to set up a joint mechanism focused on “regular and irregular communications related to trade and commercial issues,” China’s international trade representative Li Chenggang said. Asked if a communique on the talks would arrive before financial markets opened, Li replied: “If the dishes are delicious, timing is not a matter … Whenever released, it is going to be big, good news,” he said. The meeting was the first face-to-face interaction between Bessent, Greer and He since the world’s two largest economies imposed tariffs well above 100% on each other’s goods. Financial markets have been on edge for signs of a thaw in the trade war that has already begun to disrupt supply chains, prompt layoffs and raise wholesale prices. Although Bessent has said the bilateral tariffs were too high and needed to come down in a de-escalation move, he did not offer any details of reductions agreed and took no questions from reporters.On Saturday night, Trumpwroteon his social media platform that the two sides were working on “a total reset … in a friendly, but constructive, manner.” “Many things discussed, much agreed to,” Trump posted. “We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!,” Trump added. Trump’s rhetoric, that China needs to be “opened” to US business seemed to ignore a half century of trade between the two nations since one of his political heroes, Richard Nixon, visited China in 1972. The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, confirmed to CNN that the US will continue to keep “a 10% baseline tariff to be in place for the foreseeable future” even on imports from nations the US strikes new trade deals with. On Sunday, Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said: “What’s going to happen in all likelihood is that relationships are going to be rebooted. It looks like the Chinese are very very eager to play ball and renormalise things … they really want to rebuild a relationship that’s great for both of us.” Last week, Trump and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer,announced a limited bilateral trade deal. Hassett said the UK agreement provided a “really exciting blueprint” and that he had been briefed on 24 deals with other countries that are in the works. “They all look a little bit like the UK deal but each one is bespoke,” he said. Meanwhile, Lutnick dismissed reports of dock workers and truckers losing their jobs as a result of the tariffs. “This is just a China problem right now,” Lutnick said. “The rest of the world is 10% [tariffs]. So don’t overdo it.” “Prices are going to stay stable once this policy is done,” Lutnick added. The fact the talks are even happening “is good news for business, and for the financial markets”, Gary Hufbauer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview while the talks were ongoing. But Hufbauer cautioned he was “very sceptical that there will be any return to something like normal US-China trade relations”. Even a tariff rate of 70-80% would still potentially halve bilateral trade, he said. “The devil will be in the details,” said Cutler from ASPI. “Without the details, it’s hard to assess whether the meeting was successful or not.” Reuters contributed reporting",

    "title": "Trump officials ‘created confrontation’ that led to arrest of Newark mayor",
    "article_text": "Trump administrationhomeland security officials were responsible for starting the confrontation on Friday at aNew Jerseyimmigration jail that led to thearrest of Newark’s mayoras well as threats to detain three members ofCongress, the representatives said Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union. TheDemocraticrepresentatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez – all of New Jersey – visited the controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center known as Delaney Hall on Friday to inspect the facility. As they waited to enter Delaney Hall, Newark’s mayor, Ras Baraka, arrived – and as he left the property, he was arrested outside by Ice officials accusing him of trespassing, leading to a commotion at the entrance of the jail. There evidently was shoving and pushing between federal immigration officials and the members of Congress, which Watson Coleman, McIver and Menendez blamed on the immigration officials. On CNN’s State of the Union, the Congress members said immigration officials had ample opportunity to deescalate the situation before someone called in and instructed masked agents toarrest Baraka. “They created that confrontation, they created that chaos,” McIver said. Since the ordeal on Friday at Delaney Hall, homeland security officials haveaccusedthe Congress members of staging a “bizarre political stunt” there while alsoaccusing McIverof “bodyslamming” authorities at the scene. McIver rejected those allegations. “I honestly do not know how to bodyslam anyone,” McIver said. “There’s no video that supports me bodyslamming anyone. “We were simply there to do our job – there for an oversight visit.” For their part, officials have threatened to arrest the three members of Congress in connection with Friday’s commotion at Delaney Hall. Watson Coleman told CNN on Sunday that those threats stemmed from the Trump administration’s “determination to intimidate people in this country”. The Delaney Hall facility was recently reopened by Ice, as the agency continues toexpand its detention networkto assist in the Trump administration’s aspirations to carry out mass deportations. The facility operator says it has the capacity to detain 1,000 people. Delaney Hall is owned byGeo Group, a massive, private prison company with Ice facilities throughout the US. The Trump administration in February gave a 15-year contract worth $1bn to Geo Group to operate Delaney Hall. However, the new contract comes amid legalchallenges to Ice detentionin New Jersey. Newark’s municipal government recently filed a lawsuit against Geo Group claiming that the company did not have the proper permits to operate the facility. There is also a separate legal battle playing out in a federal appellate court related to private immigration detention in the state. In 2021, Phil Murphy, theNew Jerseygovernor, signed a law barring immigration detention in the state. Another private prison company, CoreCivic, which runs the only other immigration jail in the state, sued New Jersey’s state government. CoreCivic receivedsupport from the Biden administrationin its suit, and a federal judge ruled in favor of the company. The state challenged the federal judge’s decision, and a federal appellate court heard arguments for the case only recently.",

    "article_text": "Iran and the US have ended a fourth round of talks on a surprisingly upbeat note, despite the two sides appearing far apart on the central issue of a uranium enrichment programme on Iranian soil. The talks in Muscat, Oman lasted four hours and were described as positive by the US side. The Iranian foreign ministry said the “talks had been difficult but detailed to better understand each side’s positions”. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said: “We have moved away from general areas to a great extent and have gone into details. In such circumstances, negotiations have become more difficult.” Speaking before the talks started, Araghchi said Iran will not in any circumstances back down from its “right” to enrich uranium for energy. He added weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran’s security doctrine. One of the difficulties in the talks, he said, was the conflict between the US statements in and out of the negotiating room. He added: “Iran may place restrictions on things such as its dimensions, size, level and amount in order to build trust, for example, in a period similar to the previous period” – a reference to the restrictions placed on the purity and stocks of Iran’s enriched uranium under the original nuclear deal signed in 2015. Further talks were likely in a week, Araghchi said. US president Donald Trump quit the nuclear deal in 2018, and politically needs to show any new agreement places tight restrictions on Iran. Ahead of the talks there had been fears of a breakdown as the US administration slowly gravitated towards adopting a harder public line. US special envoy Steve Witkoff implied the US would never allow Iran to benefit from the peaceful technology of uranium enrichment, saying all its technology must be dismantled and destroyed. Sign up toFirst Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Israel remains in the background of the talks, repeatedly urging Trump not to trust Iran and instead end any ambiguity about the true purpose of Iran’s nuclear programme by destroying it altogether militarily. Witkoff said on Friday: “An enrichment programme can never exist in the state of Iran again. That’s our red line. No enrichment.” Araghchi called on the US side to stop making demands through the media, saying it made the negotiation process more complex. The difficulty in the US position is that many other countries are allowed to enrich uranium domestically, while Israel has an undeclared nuclear programme. But the US argues Iran’s record of non-disclosure of its nuclear programme and high levels of enrichment make the Tehran regime a special case.",

    "title": "US transportation secretary plans to reduce flights at Newark airport",
    "article_text": "The US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, plans to reduce the number of flights in and out of theNewark Liberty international airportfor the “next several weeks”, as the facility – one of the country’s busiest airports –struggleswith radar outages, numerous flight delays and cancellations due to a shortage of air traffic controllers. Speaking on NBC’s Meet the Press, Duffy said he would convene a meeting with all the airlines flying out of Newark this week to determine the reduction, adding that it would fluctuate, with a larger reduction coming in the afternoons when international flight arrivals make it busier at the airport, one of the main hubs serving the New York City area. “We want to have a number of flights that if you book your flight, you know it’s going to fly, right?” he said. “That is the priority. So you don’t get to the airport, wait four hours, and then get delayed.” The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said radar at the facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark airport went black for 90 seconds at 3.55am Friday, similar to an incident on 28 April. On Sunday morning, a separate air traffic control equipment outage caused the FAA to implement a ground stop of about 45 minutes for Newark flights, CNN transportation reporter Pete Munteanwrotein an X post that cited an advisory from the air traffic control system command center. An equipment outage Sunday also led to a ground stop at Hartfield-Jackson Atlanta airport beginning at about 10.40am to noon local time, another air traffic control system command center advisory said. There has been an average of 34 arrival cancellations per day since mid-April at Newark, according to the FAA, with the number of delays increasing throughout the day from an average of five in the mornings to 16 by the evening. They tend to last 85 to 137 minutes on average. TheTrump administrationproposed a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the US air traffic control system on Thursday that includes six new air traffic control centers as well as technology and communications upgrades at all of the nation’s air traffic facilities over the next three or four years. Duffy said on Sunday that he also planned to raise the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers from 56 to 61 as he tries navigating a shortage of about 3,000 people in that specialized position. He plans to give those air traffic controllers a 20% upfront bonus to stay on the job. However, he says many air traffic controllers choose to retire after 25 years of service, which means many retire at about the age of 50. “These are not overnight fixes,” Duffy said. “But as we go up – one, two years, older guys on the job, younger guys coming in, men and women – we can make up that 3,000-person difference.” Asked on Sunday whether it was safe to fly in and out of the Newark airport given the various issues there and elsewhere, United Airlines’ chief executive officer, Scott Kirby – whose company uses the facility as a hub – said: “It absolutely is.” “And the reason is, when these kinds of outages happen, we train for them,” Kirby added. “We have backup procedures. We have backups to backups to backups to keep the sky safe, which is always the number one priority.” Guardian staff contributed reporting",

    "title": "US, China hail ‘substantial progress’ made in tariff talks in Geneva",
    "article_text": "Beijing and Washington have both hailed the progress made at the end of a weekend of closed-door discussions in Switzerland aimed at de-escalating trade tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump’s aggressive worldwide tariff rollout in March and China’s retaliation. Following the talks on Sunday at the Geneva villa of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters: “I’m happy to report that we’ve made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks.” “The talks were productive,” he added. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who also took part in the two days ofclosed-door talkswith Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, said that the differences between the sides were “not so large as maybe thought”. He Lifeng also lauded what he called “important progress” in the trade talks with the US. Speaking to reporters in Geneva, he said the atmosphere of the talks with Bessent and Greer had been candid, in-depth, and substantive, echoing similar language from the US delegation. Both countries said they would put out a joint statement on the talks on Monday. After the first day of negotiations, Trump had posted on his social network Truth Social that the discussions had been “very good”, describing them as “a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner”. Beijing had yet to comment Sunday, but on Saturday, Chinese state news agency Xinhua described the talks as “an important step in promoting the resolution of the issue”. The Chinese delegation was expected to speak to the media on Sunday evening. The meetings marked the first time that senior officials from the world’s two largest economies have met face-to-face to tackle the topic of trade since Trump slapped steep new levies on China last month, sparking a robust retaliation from Beijing. “The talks reflect that the current state of the trade relations with these extremely high tariffs is ultimately in the interests of neither the United States nor China,” Citigroup global chief economist Nathan Sheets told news agency AFP. He called the tariffs a “lose-lose proposition”. The tariffs imposed by Trump on the Asian manufacturing giant since the start of the year currently total 145 percent, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching a staggering 245 percent. In retaliation, China put 125-percent tariffs on US goods. Ahead of the meeting, Trump signalled he might lower the tariffs, suggesting on social media that an “80% Tariff on China seems right!” However, his press secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the US would not lower tariffs unilaterally, as China would also need to make concessions. Going into the meeting, both sides played down expectations of a major change in trade relations. Bessent underlined a focus on “de-escalation” and not a “big trade deal”, while Beijing insisted that the US had to ease tariffs first. The fact that the talks are even happening “is good news for business, and for the financial markets”, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. But Hufbauer cautioned that he was “very sceptical that there will be any return to something like normal US-China trade relations”. Even a tariff rate of 70 to 80 percent would still potentially halve bilateral trade, he said. Among some of the more moderate Trump officials, such as Bessent and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, “there’s a realisation that China is better equipped to deal with this trade war than the US”, said Hufbauer. The Geneva meeting comes after Trumpunveiled a trade agreement with the United Kingdomon Thursday, the first deal with any country since he unleashed his blitz of global tariffs, but which maintains a 10-percent baseline levy on most British goods. Following the US-UK trade announcement, analysts have voiced pessimism about the likelihood that negotiations will lead to any significant changes in the US-China trade relationship. In his Truth Social post, Trump claimed the talks had made “GREAT PROGRESS!!” “We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business,” he said.",

    "title": "Hamas says it will release US-Israeli captive Edan Alexander",
    "article_text": "Hamas has said it will release a US-Israeli captive held in Gaza, as the group confirmed it was engaged in direct talks with the United States towards securing a ceasefire in thewar-ravaged enclaveand getting aid flowing again to a suffering Palestinian population. The Palestinian group released a statement on Sunday: “Israeli soldier Edan Alexander, a dual US national, will be released as part of the steps taken towards a ceasefire, reopen the crossings, and deliver aid and relief to our people in the Gaza Strip”. Israel has blocked all aid going into Gaza, including food, medicine and fuel, for 70 days. The Hamas statement did not indicate when the 21-year-old Alexander would be released, but it is thought to be in the coming 48 hours. Israeli media reported that US envoy Steve Witkoff will be in Israel on Monday as part of the deal. The announcement comes shortly beforeUS President Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle Eastthis week – which does not include a trip to Israel. Trump and Witkoff have frequently mentioned Alexander by name in the past few months. Witkoff later confirmed Hamas had agreed to release Alexander in the hopes of restarting ceasefire talks. Alexander, who grew up in the US, was taken from his military base during the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack. In its statement on Sunday, Hamas said it was willing to “immediately begin intensive negotiations” that could lead to an agreement to end the war and would see Gaza under a technocratic and independent administration. “This will ensure calm and stability for many years, along with reconstruction and the end of the blockade,” the group said. Qatar and Egypt, the two main mediators, welcomed Hamas’ announcement, saying they considered the group’s move a gesture of goodwill and an encouraging step toward the parties’ return to ceasefire negotiations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Sunday that the US told Israel that Hamas’s freeing of Alexander would lead to negotiations for the release of more captives. The statement added that Israel’s policy hasn’t changed: negotiations will be conducted under fire with a continued commitment to achieving all war objectives. Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, said: “It’s unclear exactly what kind of reaction the Israeli government officials had with these direct talks between Hamas and the United States, but last time they were quite angry and that’s because the Israelis weren’t involved and had no knowledge of those talks and the Americans hit back by saying they didn’t need anyone’s permission to negotiate with any of the actors involved because they were American captives held in Gaza”. “There are a lot of questions from a lot of different angles, specifically from the family members of those captives, from the larger part of Israeli society who have been protesting in the thousands for more than 1.5 years, accusing Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war for his own personal and political gain. And in fact, Israeli officials have been saying the quiet part out loud in recent weeks, saying that the captives were not the main priority for the Israeli government and that they had other goals and objectives they needed to achieve”, she added. “The family members of captives say that the Israeli government is choosing land grabs over the lives of Israelis who are still being held in Gaza”, she continued, referring to the Israeli government’s decision to expand its offensive in Gaza with a view to reoccupying parts of the territory. Earlier on Sunday, two Hamas officials told the AFP news agency that talks were ongoing in the Qatari capital of Doha with the US and reported “progress” had been made. One Hamas official, speaking about the talks with the US, said there was “progress made … notably on the entry of aid to the Gaza Strip” and the potential exchange of captives for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody. A second official also reported progress “on the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip”. Israel shattered the last ceasefire, which lasted two months, on March 18, launching a major offensive in Gaza and ramping up its bombardment of the territory. It has also cut off all aid to Gaza since March 2, saying it would pressure Hamas to release the remaining captives. None have been released since the fleeting truce earlier this year, when several captives were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. A total of 59 captives are still in Gaza, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Starvationhas taken hold across Gaza due to the Israeli blockade. Earlier this month, the Israeli government approved plans to expand its offensive in the Gaza Strip, with officials talking of retaining a long-term occupying presence there. The Health Ministry in Gaza said on Sunday that at least 2,720 people have been killed since Israel resumed its assault, bringing the overall Palestinian death toll since the war broke out to 52,829.",

    "article_text": "Israel has launched air attacks on Yemen’s Hodeidah governorate, according to the Houthi Interior Ministry. The attack late on Sunday came after the Israeli army said it had warned those present at three Houthi-controlled ports in the area to evacuate. It was the latest salvo in exchanges between Israel and the Houthis. Israel bombed the Hodeidah port after a Houthi attack nearBen Gurion Airportin Tel Aviv earlier this month. Israeli strikes have also targeted parts of the Yemeni capitalSanaaand the main international airport there. The Houthis have been firing missiles at Israel and on Israeli targets in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians under fire since the war on Gaza began 19 months ago. Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed more than 52,000 people, including 57 whostarved to deathdue to the total Israeli siege since March 2, according to Palestinian officials. Aceasefire dealbetween Yemen’s Houthis and the United States does not include any operations against Israel, the group’s chief negotiator announced earlier this week. The Houthis stopped firing on Israel during the Gaza ceasefire earlier this year, but resumed when Israel imposed its punishing blockade and then resumed the war soon after. The US military had beenlaunching daily air strikes across Yemenfor nearly two months, destroying infrastructure and killing dozens of people, including children and civilians.",

    "title": "Fact-checking Trump’s claim of securing $10 trillion in investments for US",
    "article_text": "Since returning to the White House, US President Donald Trump has touted corporate andforeign US investmentannouncements as proof he is ushering in “the golden age of America”. On January 21, Trump said that before he’d finished the “first full business day” of his second term, the United States had “already secured nearly $3 trillion of new investments”. On April 2, he said, “It looks like we’re going to have about $6 trillion of investments”. Six days later, Trump told National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner attendees that the investment total was “now revised up to about $7 (trillion)”. During an April 30 NewsNation town hall, Trump speculated that “it could be more than $8 trillion”. On May 4, Trump told Kristen Welker, the host of the NBC News programme Meet the Press, “I think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country.” On May 6, Trump told reporters, “I think the real number could be $9 or $10 trillion.” Finally, on May 8, Trump said, “We have now close to $10 trillion — think of that, $10 trillion” in investments. “We’re talking about essentially two months.” That’s far beyond the figures the White House has released publicly. We tallied the White House’s public lists of investments; they amount to $2.1 trillion in corporate investments, or at most $5.1 trillion when including promised investments from other countries. Experts cautioned that the promised corporate investments are not guaranteed to materialise in full, or during Trump’s presidency, and some of them would have occurred regardless of who was president. Trump isn’t the first to overstate new investments on his watch. Outgoing US President Joe Biden said in 2024 that his bipartisanCHIPS and Science Acthad attracted $640bn in private investments; economists told PolitiFact that Biden’s numbers were based on what companies had announced, which is not the same as dollars already spent. Roman V Yampolskiy, a University of Louisville professor and a specialist in artificial intelligence, which dominates the promised investments Trump cited, said, “Historically, large-scale investment announcements often overpromise and underdeliver. There is a performative element to them, especially in politically charged contexts. They function as political theatre as much as economic commitment.” SinceTrump’s inauguration, the White House has publicised investment announcements from three countries and roughly 60 companies on its website, including in a “non-comprehensive running list”. Many of the highest-dollar corporate announcements were in March and April. Corporate announcements in the White House’s lists total approximately $2.1 trillion worth of US investment. The White House separately has cited commitments from the United Arab Emirates to invest $1.4 trillion over the next 10 years; from Japan to “boost” its investment in the US to $1 trillion; and from Saudi Arabia to invest $600bn in the US during Trump’s presidency. Combined with the corporate announcements, these bring the total to about $5.1 trillion, $4.9 trillion short of Trump’s figure. But the $5.1 trillion total has caveats. For example, the White House said “Japan announced a $1 trillion investment in the US”, but the article it linked said in 2023, Japan’s US investment was $783.3bn and Japan would “boost” that to $1 trillion. That’s an increase of $216.7bn rather than a new $1 trillion investment. That would put the total value of newly pledged US investment at about $4.3 trillion. The White House figures can’t easily be used for apples-to-apples comparisons. Some of the investments are planned over Trump’s four-year term, others over five years or a decade. In one case – ADQ and Energy Capital Partners’ planned $25bn investment — it isn’t limited to US-based projects. The White House declined to detail additional investments. A spokesperson pointed to federal Bureau of Economic Analysis data that shows a 22 percent increase in business investment in the first quarter of 2025, calling it a historic increase. However, experts cautioned this increase was shaped bybusinessesstocking up on inventory beforeTrump’s tariffstake effect and said the increase is unlikely to be sustained. Experts told PolitiFact that each of the five biggest investments on Trump’s list warrants some caution, because they might not reach Trump’s cited dollar amounts or were not solely prompted by Trump’s policies. “Many of these announcements, particularly those in the AI and semiconductor sectors, appear to be, at least in part, aspirational in nature,” Yampolskiy said. “They serve a signalling function: to attract investor attention, shape policy discourse, and secure favourable regulatory or funding environments.” The five largest company investments collectively account for 82 percent of the dollar value on the White House’s corporate list. The Stargate Project is an artificial intelligence collaboration among OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, announced during a January 21 White House event. The White House values the investment at $500bn. The company’sofficial announcementsays $100bn will be invested “immediately” and that it “intends to invest” a total of $500bn over the next four years, a goal repeated by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son at the White House event. “Whether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen,” wrote John Higgins, chief economist at Capital Economics, an international consulting firm. Enrique Dans, who studies technology and policy at Madrid’s IE Business School, said the $500bn figure is “astronomical – roughly 2 percent of US gross domestic product – and lacks clear documentation”. At the White House event, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, “We wouldn’t be able to do this without you, Mr President.” But Altman had been discussing plans for a $100bn investment 10 months before Trump won his second term, The Washington Post reported, including an Abilene, Texas, data centre that began construction in summer 2024. “AI investmentshave been on a global trajectory driven by technological maturity and competitive pressure, especially from China,” Dans said. “Any US president would have seen a surge.” Nvidia Corp, another AI company, said itplansto invest up to $500bn in US infrastructure over the next four years. Previously, Nvidiamanufacturedmost of its chips in Taiwan. “It is unlikely Nvidia would have moved any production to the US if it was not for pressure from the Trump administration,” Gil Luria, an analyst with the financial services firm D.A. Davidson, told Reuters. However, Luria added, “The half a trillion number is likely hyperbole.” Dans said that although tax cuts from Trump’s first term have benefited the company’s focus on US-based efforts, “the core growth likely would have occurred anyway”, regardless of the president. On February 24, days after Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, met with Trump, the consumer electronics giantannouncedit plans to spend “more than $500bn in the US over the next four years.” Analysts have expressed scepticism that this represents new investment. Dans called the investment “simply more of what [Apple] already does,” from “day-to-day activities with thousands of suppliers in all 50 states to the operation of its domestic data centres, as well as its investments in Apple TV+ and other projects already manufactured in the country.” In a note to investors, David Vogt, an analyst with the Swiss-based bank UBS, wrote, “Call us a sceptic. … We believe [the figure] lacks substance.” IBM announced April 28 plans to invest $150bn in the US, including more than $30bn in research and development on US-based manufacturing of mainframe and quantum computers. This is “not clearly Trump-related,” Dans said. “IBM’s strategy pivots have been under way since the 2010s.” Luria said, “While we believe IBM will continue to invest in the emerging area of quantum technology, the bombastic figure is more likely a gesture towards the US administration,” Reuters reported. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which makes semiconductors for computing and electronics, haspledged to spend $100bnin the US. Analysts said this number is the most well-supported among the investments that Trump cites. Although bringing semiconductor production back to the US began during Trump’s first term, it was “greatly accelerated by” Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act, which prompted years of investment before Trump’s second term, Dans said. Over the past five years, the company has spent at least $65bn on fabrication facilities near Phoenix, Arizona, funded in part by $6.6bn from the CHIPS and Science Act. Overall, Dans said, “Trump might deserve some partial credit for setting a more aggressive tone on economic nationalism and supply chain reshoring, and for lowering the corporate tax reform, which did affect repatriation and some investment decisions. But most of these trends — the AI boom, the semiconductor reshoring, the cloud computing infrastructure — are long-term structural shifts that predate Trump and will continue regardless of who is in office.” Trump said, “We have now close to $10 trillion, think of that, $10 trillion” in investments. “We’re talking about essentially two months.” The White House has pointed to investment announcements totalling $5.1 trillion, including $2.1 trillion from companies and the rest from countries. That’s at least $4.9 trillion short of Trump’s figure, and these announcements representfuture spending, some of which is planned over four years, five years or a decade. Experts said many of the dollar amounts are aspirational and that the investments announced might never be fully reached. They also said some of this investment would have occurred regardless of who was president. We rate the statement false.",

    "title": "More than 100 dead after flooding in eastern DR Congo, officials say",
    "article_text": "Heavy overnight floods have washed away several villages in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, killing more than 100 people, according to local officials, in a nation suffering war and mass displacement. The floods were triggered by torrential rains and surged through the Kasaba village, in South Kivu province, during the night of Thursday into Friday, regional official Bernard Akili told news agency AFP on Saturday. Torrential rains caused the Kasaba River to burst its banks overnight, with the rushing waters “carrying everything in their path, large stones, large trees and mud, before razing the houses on the edge of the lake”, he said. “The victims who died are mainly children and elderly,” he said, adding that 28 people were injured and some 150 homes were destroyed. Sammy Kalonji, the regional administrator, said the torrent killed at least 104 people and caused “enormous material damage.” South Kivu’s provincial health minister, Theophile Walulika Muzaliwa, told the Associated Press news agency that rescue operations were hampered by a lack of services and a shutdown of telephone lines due to the flooding. “Sector chiefs, village chiefs and locality chiefs, who are also members of the local government, are on site. The only humanitarian organisation currently present is the Red Cross,” he said. A local resident told AFP that some 119 bodies had been found by Saturday. Such natural disasters are frequent in DR Congo, particularly on the shores of the Great Lakes in the east of the country, as the surrounding hills are weakened by deforestation. In 2023, floods killed 400 people in several communities located on the shores of Lake Kivu, in South Kivu province, while last month, 33 people were killed inflooding in the capital, Kinshasa. DR Congo has also been subject to decades of fighting between government troops and rebels in the eastern part of the country, which escalated in late January when the Rwandan-backedM23 rebel group captured Goma, the capital of North Kivu state, in a rapid and surprise offensive. Nearly 3,000 people were killed and 2,880 injured in the Goma offensive, worsening what is already considered one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with more than seven million people remaining displaced.",

    "title": "Barcelona beat Real Madrid despite Mbappe hat-trick as LaLiga title nears",
    "article_text": "Barcelona have overcome a two-goal deficit and a Kylian Mbappe hat-trick for Real Madrid to claima 4-3 win in El Clasico, edging them closer to the LaLiga title. Brazilian forward Raphinha scored twice for Barca on Sunday in response to a flying start by the visitors – which saw them storm to a two-goal lead after 14 minutes – at the Catalan club’s temporary home at the Lluis Companys Olympic Stadium. The victory extends Barcelona’s lead at the top of the standings to seven points over second-placed Real – the defending champions – and with three matches remaining, one more victory will clinch a 28th Spanish league title for the Catalans. Barca earned a fourth consecutive victory over Real in all competitions this season and their second in less than a month in a chaotic match in which both sides showed their usual defensive weaknesses. However, Barca seemed a much stronger and well organised team overall, dominating possession and creating several chances that were denied by inspired goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who prevented Real’s loss from being by a larger margin. Barcelona could secure the LaLiga title as early as Wednesday should Real Madrid fail to win at Mallorca. Regardless of Real’s result, a Barcelona victory in their city derby against Espanyol on Thursday would guarantee the championship for the Catalans. Mbappe opened the scoring from the penalty spot after he was fouled inside the box by keeper Wojciech Szczesny in the fifth minute, and he extended their lead with a quick counter nine minutes later from an assist by Vinicius Jr. However, Barcelona responded swiftly with Eric Garcia, Lamine Yamal and Raphinha all finding the net within 15 minutes to overturn the deficit. Garcia headed home from a corner in the 19th minute while Yamal scored the equaliser in the 32nd with another brilliant display of technique as he curled a superb shot from the right corner of the box just outside Courtois’s reach and inside the far post. Two minutes later, a mistake by Mbappe in the midfield gifted Barca the ball, and Raphinha launched a quick counter, giving his side the lead with a tidy finish past a helpless Courtois. Real thought they had earned a second penalty in the 43rd minute, but it was overturned due to an offside in the build-up. And one minute later, a costly error by captain Lucas Vazquez gifted Raphinha the goal that extended Barca’s lead. Barcelona came back strongly in the second half and had several chances denied by a string of stunning saves by Courtois. They were shocked, however, when Mbappe reduced the deficit in the 70th minute after a quick counterattack by Vinicius, who ran up the right side and put it on a plate for the France forward to complete his hat-trick. Yet last year’s champions could not recover, leaving them on the brink of a season without silverware. “It was obviously very important to win today. It’s great to have this game after the Champions League. I think it’s already forgotten,” Yamal told Movistar Plus after Barca were knocked out of the European club competition in the semifinals in a heartbreaking midweek loss to Inter Milan. “Suffering is what makes you strong and what teaches you to correct the mistakes you make. They didn’t create any clear-cut chances other than the goals. “It was very important to win today to get closer to the league title. We are delighted.” Real manager Carlo Ancelotti, meanwhile, is set to come under increased pressure with rumours the former Real midfielder Xabi Alonso will replace him at the end of the season. The Italian-born coach was in a pragmatic mood, however, about the result and his side’s performance. “It was an evenly played match, competitive and fought until the last second,” he told reporters. “We could have scored the equaliser, but it is what it is. It was a great game between two great teams, so I have nothing to reproach my team for in terms of attitude and commitment. It didn’t go well, but we competed.” Alonso told reporters on Friday that he would be leaving his role as Bayer Leverkusen coach at the end of the season while Ancelotti complimented the former Spanish international, saying the“the doors are open”for him to now move to a big club.",

    "title": "Merino scores then sees red as Arsenal come back to draw 2-2 at Liverpool",
    "article_text": "Arsenal gave champions Liverpool a reminder of why they were the only team to challenge them in their romp to English football’s Premier League title as they hit back from two goals down todraw 2-2at Anfield. Liverpool were dominant in the first half on Sunday, with a header by Cody Gakpo and Luis Diaz’s tap-in in the space of 90 seconds putting them 2-0 ahead. Arsenal looked deflated after being knocked out of the Champions League semifinals in midweek, but mustered an admirable response after the break, with Gabriel Martinelli’s header reducing the arrears just after half-time. Mikel Merino then headed in a rebound to make it 2-2 in the 70th minute after Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard’s piledriver was pushed against the woodwork by goalkeeper Alisson. Merino was sent off nine minutes later for a lunging tackle on Dominik Szoboszlai, but the 10-man visitors clung on for a point and almost won it as Odegaard sent a shot just wide of the post deep in stoppage time. Liverpool also thought they had won it at the death when Andy Robertson fired in from close range, but the goal was disallowed for a foul in the build-up. Arne Slot’s side, whowrapped uptheir record-equalling 20th English title two weeks ago, have 83 points from 36 games, with Arsenal second on 68 and still not guaranteed a top-five finish that would ensure Champions League football next season. Apart from Arsenal’s comeback, the other main talking point from an entertaining tussle was a decidedly mixed reaction to Trent Alexander-Arnold when he came off the bench. Liverpool’s right back, who announced this week that he wouldleave at the end of the season, was booed by a large number of fans angry at his decision to leave on a free transfer. While that put something of a dampener on the day, Liverpool had been buoyant in the first half as they looked determined to lay down a marker for next season. Arsenal were caught napping in the 20th minute when Robertson was given far too much space to measure his cross, and the unmarked Gakpo headed past David Raya. Soon afterwards, it was 2-0 as Szoboszlai raced on to a through ball and calmly set up Diaz to score. Diaz had earlier been denied by a great save from Raya and also failed to make contact with another good effort while Raya also tipped a Curtis Jones effort around the post. Arsenal were not about to roll over, though, and Martinelli glanced in Leandro Trossard’s cross as the visitors turned the tables after half-time with Liverpool switching off. While Mikel Arteta’s league campaign has tailed off badly, allowing Liverpool to ease to the title, they showed spirit and were rewarded as Merino earned them a deserved point. Elsewhere in the Premier League on Sunday, a 2-0 win for Newcastle United over top-five rivals Chelsea moved the Magpies closer to a return to the Champions League next season. With just two rounds of the season to go, Eddie Howe’s team leapfrogged Manchester City and are up to third in the standings. But Nottingham Forest’s Champions League chances were hit by a 2-2 draw against relegated Leicester that appeared to spark an angry reaction from owner Evangelos Marinakis towards manager Nuno Espirito Santo in an on-field exchange after the match. Europa League finalists Manchester United and Tottenham maintained their woeful domestic form – both losing 2-0 at home, to West Ham and Crystal Palace, respectively.",

    "title": "Fragile truce holds between India, Pakistan after days of fierce exchanges",
    "article_text": "Aceasefirebetween India and Pakistan appears to be holding, after both sidesaccusedeach other of initial violations, as anuneasy calmhas taken hold following days of the worst eruption of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in decades. The Indian military sent a “hotline message” to Pakistan on Sunday about violations of an agreed-upon ceasefire, informing it of New Delhi’s intent to respond if this was repeated, a top Indian army officer said. India’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) was speaking on Sunday as a fragile 24-hour-old ceasefire appeared to be holding after both sides blamed the other for initial violations on Saturday night. The truce announced on Saturday halted several days of missiles and drones being fired at each country across their shared border, killing almost 70 people. Diplomacy and pressure from the United States helped secure the ceasefire deal when it seemed that the conflict was spiralling towards a full-scale war. Within hours of its coming into force, there were explosions in Indian-administered Kashmir, the centre of much of last week’s fighting. Blasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities near the border under a blackout, similar to those heard during the previous two evenings, according to local authorities, residents and witnesses. “Sometimes, these understandings take time to fructify, manifest on the ground,” Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai, the Indian DGMO, told a media briefing, referring to the truce. “The [Indian] armed forces were on a very, very high alert [yesterday] and continue to be in that state.” The Indian army chief had given a mandate to its commanders to deal with “violations of any kind” from across the borders in the best way they deem fit, Ghai added. He said his Pakistani counterpart called him on Saturday afternoon and proposed the two countries “cease hostilities” and urgently requested a ceasefire. There was no immediate response to the Indian comments from Pakistan. Early on Sunday, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry had said that it was committed to the truce agreement and blamed India for the violations. US President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire on Saturday, saying it was reached after talks mediated by Washington. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said India and Pakistan had also agreed to start talks on “a broad set of issues at a neutral site”. While Islamabad has thanked Washington for facilitating the ceasefire and welcomed Trump’s offer to mediate on the Kashmir dispute with India, New Delhi has not commented on US involvement in the truce or talks at a neutral site. India maintains that disputes with Pakistan have to be resolved directly by the two countries and rejects any third-party involvement. On Sunday, Trump praised the leaders of both countries for agreeing to halt the aggression and said he would “substantially” increase trade with them. Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan each rule a part of disputed Kashmir but claim it in full, and have twice gone to war over the Himalayan region. India blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of the territory, but Pakistan says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists. Among those most affected by the fighting were residents on either side of the border, many of whom fled their homes when the fighting began on Wednesday, two weeks after a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Pahalgam that India said was backed by Islamabad. Pakistan denied the accusation. Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Lahore, Pakistan, said it was “a tough night for a lot of people in the border areas”. “People said there was shelling in the early hours of the morning and throughout the evening, even after the announcement of ceasefire,” Bin Javaid said. Although people are cautious, they’re “not coming back yet to their homes because they believe that this is not over yet”, he said, adding that there has been damage in several villages across the Line of Control. Overall, however, “there’s jubilation and celebration,” Bin Javaid added. In the Indian border city of Amritsar, home to the Golden Temple revered by Sikhs, people returned to the streets on Sunday morning after a siren sounded to signal the resumption of normal activities following the tension of recent days. “Ever since the terrorists attacked people in Pahalgam, we have been shutting our shops very early and there was an uncertainty. I am happy that at least there will be no bloodshed on both sides,” said Satvir Singh Alhuwalia, 48, a shopkeeper in the city. Another local resident noted the “calm” and “happiness” throughout the Kashmir Valley since the ceasefire announcement. “You can feel it in the air … but there seems to be a bit of fear, as well. Will it hold, given the past history of both these nations?” asked Muteeb Banday. “[Kashmiris] want … long-lasting peace, so that we can go and live our lives, think about our future, make our lives better.” In some border areas, however, people were asked not to return home just yet. In the Indian-administered Kashmir city of Baramulla, authorities warned residents to stay away due to the threat posed by unexploded munitions. “People here are hosting us well, but just as a bird feels at peace in its own nest, we also feel comfortable only in our own homes, even if they have been damaged,” said Azam Chaudhry, 55, who fled his home in the Pakistani town of Khuiratta and has now been told to wait until Monday before returning. In Indian-administered Kashmir’s Uri, a key power plant that was damaged in a Pakistani drone attack is still under repair. “The project has suffered minor damage … We have stopped generation as the transmission line has been damaged,” said an official from state-run NHPC, India’s biggest hydropower company, who did not want to be identified.",

    "title": "Sudan’s army and RSF paramilitary launch attacks across war-ravaged nation",
    "article_text": "Multiple attacks by Sudan’s armed forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have struck various locations across the country now in its third year of acivil war. At least nine civilians, including four children, were killed and seven injured in attacks on Sunday by the RSF in el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state in western Sudan, according to the Sudanese army. During a sweep of the city, the SAF killed six RSF members and destroyed three combat vehicles, according to the statement. There was no immediate comment from the RSF on the army report. El-Fasher is the last major city held by SAF in Darfur. For over a year, the RSF has sought to wrest control it, located more than 800km (500 miles) southwest of the capital, Khartoum, from the SAF, launching regular attacks on the city and two major famine-hit camps for displaced people on its outskirts. In the meantime, Sudan’s civil defence forces announced on Sunday that they have full control over fires that erupted at the main fuel depot and other strategic sites in Port Sudan, the seat of the army-backed government, which has come under daily drone attacks blamed on the RSF over the past week. The fires caused by adrone strike on the fuel depoton Monday had spread across “warehouses filled with fuel”, the Sudanese army-aligned authorities said, warning of a “potential disaster in the area”. The Red Sea port city had been seen as a safe haven from the devastating two-year conflict between the SAF and RSF before the drone strikes began on May 4. The attacks have damaged several key facilities, including the country’s sole international civilian airport, its largest working fuel depot and the city’s main power station. On Tuesday, Sudanese authorities accused the RSF of being behind the drone strikes. The RSF has not commented on the allegations. Port Sudan is the main entry point for humanitarian aid into Sudan. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the attacks “threaten to increase humanitarian needs and further complicate aid operations in the country”, his spokesman said. Sudan’s army launched air strikes on the RSF in el-Khuwei in West Kordofan state and the state of West Darfur late on Saturday. El-Khuwei was captured by the RSF last week. Activists and Sudanese accounts shared a video clip on social media showing the Sudanese army and their allied forces announcing that they had regained control over el-Khuwei after battles with the RSF on Sunday, according to Al Jazeera’s Sanad fact-checking agency. Witnesses also reported drone strikes on Sunday, targeting the airport in Atbara, a city in the northern state of River Nile. The RSF has been battling the SAF for control of Sudan since April 2023. The civil war has killed more than 20,000 people, uprooted 15 million and created what the UN considers the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.",

    "title": "Is due process different for undocumented immigrants as Trump claims?",
    "article_text": "In a recent TV interview, United States President Donald Trump said he did not know whether he needed to uphold the US Constitution. Trump was answering a question on NBC News last week about whether undocumented immigrants in the US areentitled to due process. “They talk about due process, but do you get due process when you’re here illegally,” Trump asked the interviewer, Kristen Welker, NBC’s Meet the Press moderator. “The Constitution says every person, citizens and noncitizens, deserves due process,” Welker responded. She then asked Trump whether he agreed with US Secretary of StateMarco Rubio, who said noncitizens are entitled to due process. Trump:“I don’t know. I’m not a lawyer. I don’t know.” Welker:“Well, the Fifth Amendment says as much.” Trump:“I don’t know. It might say that, but if you’re talking about that, then we’d have to have a million or two million or three million trials.” Welker:“But even given those numbers that you’re talking about, don’t you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president?” Trump:“I don’t know. I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. What you said is not what I heard the Supreme Court said. They have a different interpretation.” That was not the first time Trump had brushed aside immigrants’ due process rights. In an ABC News interview marking Trump’sfirst 100 days in office, correspondent Terry Moran asked Trump, “But in our country, even bad guys get due process, right?” Trump answered, “If people come into our country illegally, there’s a different standard.” During a May 1 speech at the University of Alabama’s commencement ceremony, Trump said, “Judges are interfering supposedly based on due process, but how can you give due process to people who came into our country illegally? They want to give them due process. I don’t know.” Days later, while announcing that the 2027 NFL (National Football League) draft will be in Washington, DC, Trump said, “The courts have, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, they said, maybe you have to have trials. Trials. We’re gonna have five million trials? Doesn’t work … Past presidents took out hundreds of thousands of people when needed … They didn’t go through any of this.” Despite Trump’s dismissal of and questions about due process for immigrants, the US Constitution, legal experts and decades of court decisions agree: immigrants, regardless of how they entered the US, legally or illegally, have due process rights. What those rights look like varies depending on how long a person has been in the US and what their legal status is. Due process generally refers to the government’s requirement to follow fair procedures and laws. The Constitution’s Fifth andFourteenthAmendments protect “any person” against being deprived by the US government of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law”. “People have a right to be heard, and there are certain steps that need to be taken before someone can, say, be jailed,” Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a lawyer and policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, said. Several court rulings have determined that due process rights are extended to all people in the US, not just US citizens or immigrants in the country legally. The US Constitution and the Immigration and Nationality Act dictate the process the government must use to afford immigrants due process rights. In immigration, due process generally refers to “appropriate notice [of government action], the opportunity to have a hearing or some sort of screening interview to figure out, are you actually a person who falls within the law that says that you can be deported”, Katherine Yon Ebright, a lawyer at the Brennan Centre for Justice’s Liberty and National Security programme, said. For example, if the government seeks to deport people who are undocumented, the government generally must give them a charging document known as a “notice to appear”. Eventually, immigrants go before an immigration judge to present evidence and make a case that they qualify for some form of relief against deportation, such as asylum. Without due process, legal experts say, US citizens could also be deported. “The whole point of due process is to determine whether you’re the kind of person who can be subject to deportation,” Ilya Somin, a George Mason University constitutional law professor, said. “If there is no due process, then the government can simply deport people or punish them at will … Because how can you show that you’re actually a US citizen if you’re not getting any due process?” Even though all people in the US have due process rights, for noncitizens, the specifics of the process and the extent of protections vary. The term noncitizen applies to people with legal documents as well as those without any documents, including people here on visas, with lawful permanent status or without a legal immigration status. There is a “sliding scale of different protections that people can have depending on what their [immigration] status is”, Yon Ebright said. Noncitizens are not entitled to government-appointed lawyers during immigration proceedings, for example. And some immigrants who recently entered the US without a legal document do not have to appear before a judge before being deported; these cases are subject to what is called the expedited removal process. Under expedited removal, certain people can be quickly deported without a court case. However, people who express fear of persecution if they return to their home countries are referred to immigration officers, who determine whether the immigrant is eligible for asylum or other deportation protections. Immigrants who pass the “credible fear” screening are referred to an immigration court where they can present their case. In the past, people were placed in expedited removal if they were within 100 miles (about 161km) of the border and within two weeks of their entry. In January, Trump expanded expedited removal for anyone who cannot prove they have been in the US for more than two years. TheAlien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime power that Trumpinvokedin March, allows the government to deport “alien enemies”. He has used that law to deport people his administration says are members of the Venezuelan prison gangTren de Aragua, without immigration court hearings. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of people under the law. However, the US Supreme Courtruledagainst the administration on April 7, saying it must give immigrants notice that they will be deported under the Alien Enemies Act, and give them “reasonable time” to challenge the deportation in court. Although expedited removal and the Alien Enemies Act limit people’s due process protections, they do not eliminate them. “There are no exceptions to due process,” Bush-Joseph said. Additionally, noncitizens who are charged with crimes receive the same due process protections as US citizens in criminal court, Somin said. “All of the protections of the Bill of Rights apply [in criminal court],” Somin said. “There has to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt. He or she is entitled to a jury trial, rights against self-incrimination, right to counsel and so on.” The Trump administration faces several court cases dealing with deportations and immigrants’ due process rights. They include challenges over Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act and the government’smistaken deportationof a Salvadoran man. Administration officials have criticised judges and rejected immigrants’ due process protections. “Due process guarantees the rights of a criminal defendant facing prosecution, not an illegal alien facing deportation,” White House adviser Stephen Miller posted on X on May 5. The Trump administration’s comments about due process are centred on his promise to carry out the largest deportation operation in US history. The administration’s current deportation pace is below its goal of one million people each year, the Migration Policy Institute said in an April 24 analysis. Nayna Gupta, policy director of the immigrant rights advocacy group American Immigration Council, said the Trump administration is attempting to “get around those obstacles and those requirements” of due process “just to meet some target [deportation] number”. To reach Trump’s goal of one million deportations annually, the administration would need todeport peoplewho have lived in the US  for years and have no criminal convictions (whom past administrations have not prioritised for deportation). Past presidents were also required to uphold noncitizens’ due process rights, but deportation processes moved more quickly under administrations that focused on people who had recently crossed the border illegally, Bush-Joseph said. That option is more limited for the Trump administration because undocumented immigration has reached historic lows under Trump. Trump is correct that deporting millions of people living in the US without legal documents would require millions of court cases, Tara Watson, director of the Centre for Economic Security and Opportunity at the Brookings Institution, said. That has long been the case. Millions of immigration court cases are backlogged. And the Trump administration hasfiredseveral immigration judges who would hear these cases. The administration’s goal for mass deportation does not change due process rules and standards. “It is true that due process slows down the machinery of deportation, but due process is also what separates democracies from dictatorships,” Watson said. Trump said, “If people come into our country without documents, there’s a different standard [for due process].” All people in the US, regardless of their immigration status, have due process rights, based on the US Constitution and decades of court decisions. That applies whether they entered the US legally or without any documents. For noncitizens, people’s due process protections vary based on their legal status or how long they have been in the US. Legal experts say, despite due process variations, there are no exceptions to due process requirements for immigrants. We rate Trump’s statementFalse.",

    "title": "Israel kills 13, including children, amid dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza",
    "article_text": "The Israeli military has killed at least 13 Palestinians, including several children and women, in Gaza as it continues tostarve the besieged enclave. Among the victims since dawn on Sunday were three Palestinians killed in a drone strike on a vehicle and two killed in a bombing near residential towers located west of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Another two people were killed in artillery shelling of a home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City in the north while the body of a man was recovered near the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza after Israeli warplanes bombed the area a day earlier. The Israeli military also attacked the Islamic University building in Khan Younis. فيديو يوثق لحظة قصف الاحتلال الجامعة الإسلامية في منطقة معن شرقي خانيونس جنوبي قطاع غزة.pic.twitter.com/1G8rFhF7Ch — شبكة قدس الإخبارية (@qudsn)May 11, 2025 The latest killings in the daily Israeli bombardment of Gaza came as the enclave has seen no food, water, medicine or fuel enter the territory for 70 days due to Israel’s blockade. The 2.3 million residents of Gaza are surviving on fast-dwindling supplies and charity kitchens, which have been gradually forced to shut down as they run out of food and hunger spreads. The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) warned on Sunday that the longer the blockade continues, the more irreversible harm is being done to Palestinians. “UNRWA has thousands of trucks ready to enter and our teams in Gaza are ready to scale up the delivery,” the organisation said. Hamas said in a statement on Sunday that Israel is committing a “complex crime”. Israel’s security cabinet this month approved a plan tofully occupy the Gaza Stripand force another mass displacement of Palestinians. Israel has also proposed taking over any future humanitarian aid distribution, which would, it said, involve creating designated military zones. The Humanitarian Country Team, a forum that includes UN agencies, warned that the plan is dangerous and would “contravene fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic – as part of a military strategy”. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Sunday that the country would accept a new US mechanism that would start delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza. A group of American security contractors, former military officers and humanitarian aid officials is proposing to take over the distribution of food and other supplies in Gaza based on plans similar to those designed by Israel. The plan has been criticised for bypassing the UN and aid groups with expertise in aid delivery and creating only four distribution points that would force a large number of Palestinians to travel to southern Gaza. According to the latest figures by Gaza’s Ministry of Health on Sunday, at least 52,829 Palestinians have been confirmed killed and 119,554 wounded by Israeli military attacks since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, which killed an estimated 1,139 people and resulted in more than 200 people taken captive into Gaza. Pope Leo XIV called foran immediate ceasefire, entry of humanitarian aid and release of all those held in Gaza during his first Sunday blessing since his election as pontiff. The Israeli military planned to intensify its ground occupation of Gaza on Sunday, pulling the Paratroopers Brigade back from its incursions into Syria to be redeployed to Gaza. The paratroopers have been operating in the occupied Golan Heights and inside Syria since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad in December. Israel withdrew the Nahal Brigade from the occupied West Bank – which has also been under assault for months – in its intended and self-proclaimed push to “conquer” Gaza. But thousands of Israeli reservists and other members of the Israeli military and security agencies, along with thousands of Israelisdemonstrating in the streets, have been calling for an end to the war to bring back all captives. To address the growing dissatisfaction among soldiers, the Israeli government on Sunday approved a “comprehensive benefit plan” for reservists worth about 3 billion shekels ($838m) that is slated to include a series of economic and social benefits. The army welcomed the plan approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying in a statement that it is a reflection of soldiers’ “exceptional contribution” to Israeli society. This comes as United States President Donald Trump, who has reportedly had some differences with Netanyahu in recent weeks over the Gaza war and how to engage with Iran, willlaunch a tour of the Middle Eastthis week.",

    "title": "Is Pope Leo XIV, the first US-born pontiff, a registered Republican?",
    "article_text": "Hours after Robert Prevost became the first United States-born pontiff on May 8, social media discussions in the US speculated whether Pope Leo XIV, as he is known after the election, was a “registered Republican”. “SCOOP: Our Turning Point Action team pulled the voting history forPope Leo XIV,” conservative influencer Charlie Kirk wrote on social media platform X on May 8. “He’s a registered Republican who has voted in Republican primaries when not living abroad. Our data shows he’s a strong Republican, and he’s pro-life.” Many other X posts called Prevost a “registered Republican”. Prevost, 69, is a registered voter in Will County, Illinois, and has cast ballots there over the past 13 years. In Illinois, voters do not register by party affiliation. But they declare a party when voting in a primary, according to an Aprilvideoby the Illinois State Board of Elections. “However, you are not tied down or formally registered to this party and are free to vote for another party at a subsequent election,” the video says. The Illinois voter registration application does not ask people to provide a party affiliation. The Will County clerk’s office sent PolitiFact Prevost’s voter information, which lists his party affiliation as “undeclared”. It shows that he voted in the 2012, 2014 and 2016 Republican primaries. He voted absentee in the 2024 general election, with an undeclared party affiliation. The viral screenshots Kirk and others shared on X are from L2, a paywalled database that aggregates consumer and voter data. L2’s profile of Prevost lists “Republican” in its “party” field. 🚨 🚨 🚨 New Pope is a registered REPUBLICAN!pic.twitter.com/bj8MH8H2Qs — Jared Small 💁🏼‍♀️ (@jaredsmall)May 8, 2025 It is unclear how L2 determines a party affiliation for people who live in states such as Illinois, where this information is not included in voter registration. L2 did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. Born in 1955, Prevost grew up in Dolton, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. He was ordained as a priest in 1982, then moved to Peru, where he lived from 1988 through 1998. In 1999, he returned to Chicago to serve as the prior provincial of the Augustinian province of “Mother of Good Counsel”, which covers the Midwest and Canada. Prevost’s voter file lists his address to a house owned by his brother, John Prevost. We were unable to determine Robert Prevost’s address or where he was registered to vote before 2012. In 2014, he returned to Peru and served as the bishop of Chiclayo from 2015 to 2023. He then moved to Rome, where he has lived since. US citizens who live overseas and meet certain criteria can vote absentee while abroad. We contacted the clerk’s office in Cook County, Illinois, where Chicago is located, to ask whether Prevost has a voter file in the county. The clerk’s office directed us to submit a Freedom of Information Act request for that information; we did so, but did not receive an immediate response. Elizabeth Shakman Hurd, chair of religious studies and political science professor at Northwestern University in the Chicago suburbs, said Prevost’s voting history does not tell the public “much about his views or positions other than that in that particular primary he was inclined toward one or more of the Republican candidates”. X posts said Prevost is a “registered Republican”. Prevost is registered to vote in Illinois, where voters do not register with a party affiliation. However, they declare a party affiliation when voting in a primary. County records show Prevost voted in three Republican primaries from 2012 through 2016, the most recent records we obtained. Still, the Illinois State Board of Elections says when voters participate in primaries, they are not formally registered to a party.

    "title": "What percentage of US toys and Christmas goods are imported from China?",
    "article_text": "Whether you are gift-wrapping a toy car or hanging Christmas ornaments, there is a strong chance you are handling products made in a Chinese factory. The day after President Donald Trump spoke in an interview about his tariff policies that girls in the United States do not need to “have 30 dolls”, some political commentators discussed China’s influence over the US toy market. The US currently has a 145 percent tariff on goods from China. “China makes 80 percent of all toys sold in this country and 90 percent of all Christmas goods sold in this country,” former New York Times columnist Charles Blow said during a May 5 appearance on CNN’s News Night with Abby Phillip. “We have a lot of leverage with China. The Christmas and the doll industry is not one of them.” Blow told PolitiFact his source was an April 29 report in The New York Times. It said, “Factories in China produce nearly 80 percent of all toys and 90 percent of Christmas goods sold in America.” Data shows those figures are rounded up, but not far off. Blow’s statement is “directionally accurate but slightly overstated on toys”, said Gilberto Garcia-Vazquez, chief economist at Datawheel, which operates an online economic data platform called the Observatory of Economic Complexity. He said out of $41bn worth ofimports in toys, games and sports equipment in 2024 by the US, $30bn, or about 73 percent, was manufactured in China. “If you include domestic production – small but non-negligible – China likely supplies closer to 72 percent of toys actually sold in the US, not 80 percent,” Garcia-Vazquez said. The Observatory of Economic Complexity uses data sources from “statistical offices, open data portals or custom union websites”. Claire Huber, spokesperson for the US International Trade Commission (USITC), provided PolitiFact with an analysis of 2024 data that showed 78.3 percent of toy imports and 85 percent of Christmas-related imports, such as lights, trees and decorations, are manufactured in China. The toy category includes dolls, wheeled toys and scale models. The data was compiled using the USITC’s DataWeb, which cites statistics published by the US Department of Commerce’s Census Bureau, accessed on May 9. Garcia-Vazquez also analysed 2024 data for Christmas goods and said 90 percent of US imports in that category came from China. He said Christmas lights are an exception because “Cambodia has recently overtaken China as the top source”. The New York Times published an April 27 report that showed 76 percent of “toys and puzzles” and 87 percent of “Christmas decorations” come from China. Bloomberg, citing the trade organisation Toy Association, said “roughly 80 percent of toys sold in the US are made in China”. Data shows73 to 78percent of toy imports and85 to 90percent of Christmas-related imports in 2024 came from China, supporting Blow’s point that the vast majority of these goods come from China. We rate his statement True.",

    "title": "India tried to project strength but ended up showing weakness",
    "article_text": "On May 10, United States President Donald Trump announced a “full and immediate” ceasefire between India and Pakistan brokered by his administration. US media reported that, alarmed by intelligence signalling further escalation, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles drove urgent mediation. Vance warned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of catastrophic risks and encouraged direct talks between India and Pakistan. The announcement of the ceasefire was received across the world with a sigh of relief. The spectre of a nuclear exchange, which according to one 2019 study could kill up to 125 million people in less than a week, had fuelled regional anxiety and spurred the US diplomatic frenzy. In India, however, Trump’s announcement was seen differently in some quarters. Former Indian army chief Ved Prakash Malikpostedon X: “Ceasefire 10 May 25: We have left India’s future history to ask what politico-strategic advantages, if any, were gained after its kinetic and non-kinetic actions.” MP Asaduddin Owaisiwroteon the same platform: “I wish our PM @narendramodi had announced the ceasefire rather than the President of a foreign country. We have always been opposed to third party intervention since Simla (1972). Why have we now accepted it? I hope the Kashmir issue will not be internationalised, as it is our internal matter.” The latter comment likely refers to Trump’s statement that he is willing to work with India and Pakistan “to see if, after a ‘thousand years,’ a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir”. The ceasefire announcement by the US president appears to have been perceived by some in India as a sign of the Modi government’s retreat under US pressure while his offer to mediate on Kashmir is being seen as an indication that India’s longstanding rejection of third-party intervention is being undermined. In South Asian geopolitics, perception often outpaces reality – until reality bites. India has long projected regional dominance, bolstered by economic growth and nuclear might. Yet its actions in the aftermath of theApril 22 massacrecarried out by the Resistance Front (TRF) in Kashmir exposed its vulnerabilities. Intended to assert strength, India’s response faltered, boosting Pakistan’s regional standing and leaving Modi’s government diplomatically weakened. On May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle terrorist bases linked to groups like the TRF, which, it claims, is supported by Pakistan. Backed by French-made Rafale jets, the operation sought to project Modi’s strongman image amid domestic outrage. Yet its success was contested. Pakistan reported civilian casualties, including children, while India insisted only terrorist sites were hit. Pakistan’s air force scrambled its own jets to deflect the attack and claimed it downed five Indian jets, including three Rafales.Two US officialsconfirmed to the Reuters news agency that a Chinese-made J-10 jet shot down at least two Indian planes, aided by Chinese intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) support. India has not acknowledged any losses. Indian media initially claimed devastating strikes on Pakistani cities, including Karachi’s seaport, but these reports, which were clearly part of propaganda efforts, were proven false. On May 9, India launched missile attacks on Pakistani bases, including one near Islamabad, Pakistan claimed. The Pakistani army retaliated with short-range missile and drone strikes targeting Indian airbases at Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur and Bhuj. Indian air force officer Vyomika Singh reported Pakistani drones and munitions hit civilian and military targets. India’s image as a regional hegemon frayed. The Indian government clearly overestimated its Rafale jets and underestimated Pakistan’s Chinese-backed ISR systems, which enhanced battlefield precision. China’s military support for Pakistan has increased significantly in recent years. Since 2020, it has accounted for 81 percent of Islamabad’s military imports. For years, some Indian defence analysts warned that India’s military was unprepared for a China-supported Pakistan, given its limited US or Russian backing for its high-risk Kashmir gamble. Others criticised the government’s foreign policy for encouraging China-Pakistan rapprochement. Their warnings remained unheeded in New Delhi. The events of the past few days exposed India’s strategic limits, replacing ambiguity with global scrutiny. The kneejerk reaction in New Delhi may be to increase the defence budget and deepen even further the militarisation of Kashmir. As the Indian government plans its next steps, it should do well to consider that the status quo of shadow war and the cycle of covert aggression fuelling unrest is untenable. Both nations’ intelligence agencies have long backed proxies, driving instability from Kashmir to Afghanistan. The path forward rests on New Delhi and Islamabad making wise choices. Restraint, not rhetoric, should shape policies moving forward. Failure to do so risks geopolitical turmoil, economic stagnation and hardship for millions. Home to a quarter of the world’s poorest people and more than 350 million illiterate adults, India and Pakistan cannot afford prolonged strife. Continued tensions could derail India’s growth and cripple Pakistan’s fragile economy, dwarfing any tactical gains.

    "title": "Pope Leo XIV calls for Gaza ceasefire in first Sunday message",
    "article_text": "Pope Leo XIV has called for genuine peace in Ukraine and an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip in his first Sunday noon blessing as pontiff. “No more war,” Leo said on Sunday, adding, “the dramatic scenario of a third world war being fought piecemeal.” “I too address the world’s great powers by repeating the ever-present call ‘never again war’,” he said from the loggia of Saint Peter’s Basilica to an estimated 100,000 people below. The new pope, who was elected on May 8 after the death of Pope Francis, evoked some of his predecessor’s favoured phrases that called for peace. Pope Leo said he carries in his heart the “suffering of the beloved people of Ukraine” and appealed for negotiations to reach an “authentic, just and lasting peace”. The call came hours after Russian President Vladimir Putinproposed direct negotiations with Ukraineto achieve “lasting peace” amid stalled attempts by the administration of United States President Donald Trump to mediate an agreement. Leo also called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and said he was “profoundly saddened” by the war in the Israeli-besieged enclave. He said humanitarian relief must be provided to the “exhausted civilian population”, adding that “all hostages” held by the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza must be freed. Pope Franciscalled Gaza’s Christians on a near-daily basisduring Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians and wounded 120,000 others, many of them children and women. The Israeli military continues to maintain a total blockade on water, food and all other humanitarian aid to Gaza despite international calls tostop its starvation policy. Leo said he was glad to hear of the ceasefire reached on Saturdaybetween nuclear neighbours India and Pakistan, and hoped negotiations would lead to a lasting accord. “But there are so many other conflicts in the world,” he added. This marked the first time that Leo addressed crowds from the loggia since he was elected as the first pope from the US on Thursday evening. Italian authorities estimated that more than 100,000 people were in the square. The crowds were entertained by marching bands from Italy, Mexico and other parts of Latin America who came to Rome for the ongoing Catholic Holy Year. Leo on Saturday prayed before the tomb of Pope Francis, who died on April 21, across town at the St Mary Major Basilica.",

    "title": "What the Christians of the Holy Land expect from Pope Leo XIV",
    "article_text": "Many Christians of the Holy Land rejoiced at the election of Pope Leo XIV as the successor to Saint Peter. Many of us hope that the new pope will follow the legacy of his predecessor, Pope Francis, particularly with regard to issues of justice and peace. The Holy See has historically played an important role in supporting the Christian presence in the Holy Land, whether through church activities, engagement with influential parties in and around the region, or through material and moral support. This has been reflected in the establishment of institutions such as the Pontifical Mission in Jerusalem, Bethlehem University, the Benedictus Center in Nazareth, and most recently, the donation by Pope Francis of the Popemobile to serve as a mobile clinic for children in Gaza. Some of the most impactful moments in our recent history have been papal visits to our land — starting with Pope Paul VI in 1964, followed by Pope John Paul II in 2000, Pope Benedict XVI in 2009, and concluding with Pope Francis in 2014. We, Christians in the Holy Land, hope that Pope Leo XIV will not only come to visit us but also help address some of the challenges we face today in the birthplace of Christianity. As a community of 230,000 people, we are working to strengthen the Christian presence as an active component of the local society, in collaboration with its other components. However, we do need help. One of the main issues affecting Christian lives in Israel and Palestine is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is a persistent source of regional instability that fuels violence in various forms, which kills many, including Christians. Rising religious and political extremism makes many of us feel like strangers in our own homeland. Economic deterioration and the declining number of people coming for pilgrimage in the Holy Land due to the conflict are leading to a loss of livelihood and worsening socioeconomic conditions. Widespread despair is driving many to emigrate or plan to leave in the near future, dwindling the numbers of our community. Many local Christians want the Holy See to engage with key global and regional players to achieve a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In his last sermon, Pope Francis spoke about the urgent need for peace in Gaza. In his first sermon, Pope Leo XIV called for an immediate ceasefire and delivery of humanitarian aid to the Strip. We welcome these statements and hope he will continue to do his utmost to promote peace in the Holy Land. In Palestine, the situation remains unclear due to the Israeli occupation of all territories meant to form a Palestinian state, the ongoing war in Gaza, and the limited authority of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank — not to mention Israel’s full annexation of East Jerusalem. This reality calls for thoughtful action by the Church, both at the level of the Holy See and locally, to provide people with hope in these dark times. In Israel, there is a pressing need for cooperation between the Holy See and the local church — bishops, priests, and believers — to resolve many issues that affect the Christian and non-Christian communities. It is crucial to work with all segments of the local society to pressure the state to treat all its citizens equally and preserve their dignity. Christians hope that the Holy See can collaborate with us in our efforts to achieve equality. We, as a community, face Israeli laws that discriminate against us based on ethnicity and religion; we need support in our efforts to have such laws repealed. It is also essential to work towards resolving painful issues that have negatively impacted the Christian presence, such as the case of the villages of Iqrit and Biram, whose Catholic Christian residents were expelled before their homes were destroyed by the Israeli authorities in 1951. Since then, the residents and their descendants have been demanding to return to their ancestral lands, but are being denied this right. There is also a need for stronger intervention by the Holy See to support Christian institutions operating under Israeli control, which face growing challenges, such as attempts by some municipalities to impose heavy taxes in violation of past agreements, the clear discriminatory underfunding of Christian schools by Israeli authorities, and threats against church property. Many Christians of the Holy Land also hope that Pope Leo XIV will work to enhance unity among them, including efforts to reach a unified date for major religious holidays, especially Christmas and Easter. They also call for increased joint efforts among churches to organise pilgrimages to the Holy Land that include not only visits to religious sites but also interactions with the faithful who live there. This is important because it would help us raise global awareness about the challenges we face and feel an integral part of the universal Church. As a whole, Christians in the Holy Land, like their fellow Christians around the world, desire to see a father in Pope Leo XIV — a father who visits them and welcomes their visits, consults with them and listens to their concerns, protects them from harm, stands with them when they are attacked or oppressed, and follows in the footsteps of the Church’s founder, who never hesitated to defend the oppressed regardless of how powerful the oppressor might be. Pope Leo XIV should know that he has many children in the Holy Land who love him and understand how busy he and the Holy See are with so many issues around the world. In the Holy Land, Christians have prayed — and continue to pray — for his success in his mission, fully aware of how complex it is. But above all, the children need their father — and that is what they expect the most: that he will always stand by their side, despite how busy he might be.

    "title": "Iran says fourth round of ‘difficult’ nuclear talks with US ends in Oman",
    "article_text": "Tehran, Iran –A fourth round of indirect nuclear talks between Iran and the United States has concluded in the Omani capital, Muscat, with Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs describing them as “difficult but useful”. After about three hours of negotiations on Sunday, spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei described the talks as “difficult but useful talks to better understand each other’s positions and to find reasonable and realistic ways to address the differences”. “Next round will be coordinated and announced by Oman,” he said in a post on X. Before the talks started, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state media that Iran has a legal right to civilian enrichment of uranium that cannot be subjected to any deal. A landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, from which US President Donald Trump withdrew during his first term, allowed Iran to pursue its civilian nuclear activity but put restrictions on uranium enrichment to prevent Tehran from making a nuclear bomb. “Enrichment is one of the achievements and honours of the Iranian nation.We have paid a heavy price for enrichment. The blood of our nuclear scientists has been spilled for this achievement,” he said in reference toscientists assassinated by Israelover the years. But Araghchi said Tehran remains committed to providing verifiable assurances that it will not be able to develop a nuclear bomb, which has been Trump’s main demand. Araghchivisited Saudi Arabia and Qatarand met with senior officials to coordinate in the run-up to the latest nuclear talks. In the Omani capital on Sunday, Iran’s top diplomat was accompanied by his deputies and other members of the team tasked with technical talks that Iran still emphasises are held “indirectly” through Omani mediation. Tehran has also repeatedly expressed concern over “contradictory” remarks made to the media by US negotiators, who are led by Trump’s longtime friend and envoy Steve Witkoff. In the lead-up to the Muscat talks, Witkoff again called for the complete “dismantlement” of Iran’s nuclear programme, including key sites in Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other top officials have suggested Iran must import enriched uranium. The fourth round of the talks was scheduled for early May but was postponed as Oman cited “logistical reasons”. The delay came after the US did not confirm its participation and amid a string of major fires in several Iranian cities, including one caused by anexplosion in the port city of Bandar Abbasthat killed dozens of people and injured more than 1,200. Trump sacked National Security AdviserMike Waltz, an Iran hawk, this month after Waltz reportedly coordinated with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and advocated for war with Iran. Trump, his team and Israel have repeatedly threatened to launch devastating military strikes on Iran and its infrastructure if the talks fail to produce results soon. Meanwhile, the US has continued to pile sanctions on Iran with the Treasury Department blacklisting a Chinese chemical group and three port terminal operators on Thursday in an attempt to target Iranian oil exports. Amid its“maximum pressure” push against Iran, the US has also promised to drive Iranian oil exports to “zero” as Tehran has continued to ship its oil – mainly to China – despite the sanctions. Trump started the sanctions campaign in 2018 after unilaterally reneging on the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that put verifiable and stringent limits on Iran’s nuclear capabilities in exchange for lifting sanctions on the country. The accord restricted Iran’s enrichment of uranium to 3.67 percent using first-generation centrifuges at limited sites, but it had time limits and sunset clauses that Trump claimed made it the “worst deal ever”. Iran is currently enriching up to 60 percent, which is close to the more than 90 percent required to make a nuclear bomb, but the International Atomic Energy Agency said Tehran has made no effort to produce a weapon.",

    "article_text": "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says Trump’s name change order only applies to parts of the Gulf under US control. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says Trump’s name change order only applies to parts of the Gulf under US control. byWes Davis Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaumannounced Fridaythat her government is suing Google for relabeling the Gulf of Mexico as “Gulf of America” for US users,CBS Newsreports. The company had done so in Google Maps after President Trump ordered the name change at the beginning of his Presidential term. The lawsuit makes good on Sheinbaum’sFebruary threatthat Mexico would “proceed to court” if the company didn’t change the name, which it kept as Gulf of Mexico for users in Mexico, but switched to “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)” in regions outside of the two countries. According to a machine-translated transcript of Sheinbaum’s Friday press briefing, she says “the only thing we want is compliance with the decree issued by the United States government,” which, she adds, “wouldn’t have the authority to name the entire Gulf, because that is an international attribution.” President Sheinbaum continues: We couldn’t say anything about changing the name of a state, a mountain, or a lake. So, the part of their territory that corresponds to them can be called whatever they decide. The part that corresponds to Mexico can’t be renamed. The part that corresponds to Cuba can’t be renamed, either. So, what we’re saying is, “Google, stick to what the United States government approved.” Prior to her briefing, Mexico sent letters to Google asking it not to label its territorial waters as Gulf of America, and Sheinbaumshared a replyfrom Google VP of government affairs and public policy Cris Turner stating the company had no plans to change its policy.CBS Newsnotes that the US House passed a bill on Thursday that would codify the name change. The Trump administration has been insistent that non-government entities honor the Gulf of America moniker, evenbarringThe Associated Pressfrom Oval Office press briefings when the outlet refused to use the new name in initial reporting — a ban that afederal judge ordered last monthbe dropped. Among tech companies, Google was one of the first tech to comply with Trump’s wishes,altering the Gulf of Mexico’s name to Gulf of Americain app and browser versions of Google Maps by February 10th. Applesoon followed suit. MapQuest, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to have given in, andhas a sitespecifically making light of the name change.

    "title": "Apple may release a ‘mostly glass, curved iPhone’ in 2027",
    "article_text": "Glassier iPhones have been rumored for years. Glassier iPhones have been rumored for years. byWes Davis This morning, while summarizing an Apple “product blitz” he expects for 2027,Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman writesin hisPower Onnewsletter that Apple is planning a “mostly glass, curved iPhone” with no display cutouts for that year, which happens to be the iPhone’s 20th anniversary. That follows a report last weekendfromThe Information, which said that “at least one 2027 iPhone model that will place the front-facing camera underneath the screen to enable a truly edge-to-edge display.” Late last year, a report fromThe ElecsaidApple is working with its display partners to create a bezel-less iPhone, but not one that curves the display down the side of the phone — a trick companieslike SamsungandVivo have employedin the past. But the “mostly glass, curved” part of Gurman’s prediction is more interesting to me, because what the heck does that mean? After all, I’d describe the iPhone 15 Pro sitting on my desk right now as “mostly glass,” with the only exterior metal being around the camera lenses and in its titanium edge, which the front and back curve down to. Assuming he’s not describing a banana-shaped iPhone, the closest hints are probably in Apple patents revealed over the years, likeone from 2019that describes a phone encased in glass that “forms a continuous loop” around the device. Apart from a changing iPhone, Gurman describes what sounds like a big year for Apple. He reiterates past reports that the first foldable iPhone should beout by 2027, and that the company’sfirst smart glasses competitor to Meta Ray-Banswill be along that year. So will those rumoredcamera-equipped AirPodsand Apple Watches, he says. Gurman also suggests thatApple’s home robot— a tabletop robot that features “an AI assistant with its own personality” — will come in 2027. On that “personality” mention, it’s hard not to think about the adorable robotic lamp Apple’sinternal researchers have been tinkering with. Finally, Gurman writes that by 2027 Apple couldfinally ship an LLM-powered Siriand may have created new chips for its server-side AI processing. A December reportfromThe Informationcovered such a development and suggested that the team handling Apple’s new AI chips is the same Israel-based silicon design group that was “instrumental in designing” the Apple silicon chips that let the company ditch Intel chips for its Macs in 2020.

    "title": "Trump fires head of Copyright Office two days following report that AI training may not be fair use",
    "article_text": "The report suggests it might not be okay to use copyrighted data for AI training. The report suggests it might not be okay to use copyrighted data for AI training. byWes Davis The Trump administration has reportedly fired Register of Copyrights Shira Perlmutter, who leads the US Copyright Office, following theoffice’s choiceto release apre-publication versionof its opinion on the fair use status of AI training data that’s made up of copyrighted information. Representative Joe Morelle, the ranking Democrat of the Committee on House Administration,called her firingan “unprecedented power grab with no legal basis,” linking the firing directly to her report, which he says amounted to her refusing “to rubber-stamp Elon Musk’s efforts to mine troves of copyrighted works to train AI models.” Among the report’s conclusions is that while the fair use status of AI training “will depend on what works were used, from what source, for what purpose, and with what controls on the outputs—all of which can affect the market.” The report says research and scholarship might be fair use but says many other AI tools might not be: But making commercial use of vast troves of copyrighted works to produce expressive content that competes with them in existing markets, especially where this is accomplished through illegal access, goes beyond established fair use boundaries. University of Colorado law professor Blake Reid called the report a “straight-ticket loss for the AI companies”in a postprior to reports emerged that Perlmutter had been fired, writing that he wondered “if a purge at the Copyright Office is incoming and they felt the need to rush this out.”Reid wrotethat although the Copyright Office generally can’t “issue binding interpretations of copyright law,” courts turn to its expertise when drafting their opinions. Whether the Copyright Office’s release of its findings is the reason Perlmutter was cut loose or is just very curious timing isn’t clear, as the White House doesn’t seem to have commented on it. Copyright law expert Meredith Rosequestioned the link, calling the report “113 pages of ‘well, it depends!’” and adding that “people who find that offensive enough to call for her ouster would have to be utter lunatics—on EITHER side of this fight.” Confusing the issue further, President Trump reposted (orReTruthed, if you like)commentary on news of Perlmutter’s firingby a Truth Social account attributed to Mike Davis, a former legal clerk for Neil Gorsuch who wasrumored last yearfor Trump’s Attorney General pick. “Now tech bros are going to attempt to steal creators’ copyrights for AI profits,” Davis wrote while linking to aCBS Newsstory, “This is 100% unacceptable.” The day the Copyright Office’s report was released, President Trump also fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, whose department the Copyright Office is part of. AsNPRreports, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed, without specifics, that Hayden had done “concerning things … in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.” Every book published in the United States goes into the Library of Congress.

    "title": "What lies beneath: filming gators in Florida springs",
    "article_text": "This wildlife filmmaker documents the unseen beauty of freshwater ecosystems byCath Virginia If you’re like me, you’ve been anxiously searching for any relief from the Bad News™ and endless stream of AI slop plaguing your feed. Joseph Ricketts’ breathtaking wildlife videos could be the antidote. An alligator taking a nap on the floor of a crystal clear spring. Schools of fish glittering in the darkness. A cosmic cloud of burnt orange tannic river swirling into clear blue water. A giant salamander battle on an Appalachian riverbed. Joseph is an ecologist, underwater videographer, and alligator researcher based in Florida. He brings a calming and curious gaze to some of the more obscure underwater vistas through his work as a scientist and wildlife researcher, with his photography and videography skills. With his undersea strobes, he casts light on the mesmerizing behavior of some of the more obscure creatures that lurk below the water’s surface, creating beautiful videos while educating his audience on the vulnerable wildlife he finds there. Documenting Florida’s natural springs and America’s freshwater ecosystems has become a passion project.The Vergecaught up with him to learn about his fascinating YouTube content. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Science or photography first? It would probably be photography first. Actually, I got into wildlife and animals as a kid. There was a creek in a park near our house and we found bullfrog tadpoles in there and they were really big. That just blew my mind and set me on the path of being interested in wildlife. My dad got a camera at some point and on some family trips I would use it and got really interested in it. All of that together led to me getting interested in science and then conservation, storytelling, and wildlife filmmaking. How did you get involved with ecology? I was in Boy Scouts as a kid and there was another kid in our group who was really into snakes. I also grew up watching Steve Irwin, who was a huge hero of mine. Growing up in the Southeast, people have very strong feelings about snakes. They do not like them — especially the venomous ones. It was neat to watch Steve Irwin and the way that he approached all sorts of animals, no matter how dangerous they were, with immense joy and curiosity. To see someone in my own community also be interested in that, it was like, “I can do this too.” And then, learning to love these animals but still seeing a lot of people who just wanted all of them eliminated from the environment. Even when I was young, I was thinking: what does it mean to protect these animals and what does it mean to encourage other people to change their mindset? How do you justify protecting and conserving an animal that might be potentially dangerous? What about the environmental importance of predators? I was so interested and passionate, I ended up studying conservation science in undergraduate and grad school. Andyou now specialize in alligators? A lot of my professional work has been with reptiles and amphibians. Currently I am studying alligators and crocodiles. What specifically are you researching? We monitor alligator populations. I’ve helped out with some projects on American crocodiles, which are a native threatened species in Florida. One project I helped with was putting satellite transmitters on crocodiles we captured and monitoring their movements through urban areas in South Florida. The goal of that project was to get a better idea of their behavior in those highly urban environments because they move quite a bit. They have very variable home ranges. Some can be in a really small area, but then sometimes they’ll just up and go for a 20-mile swim to somewhere else entirely. The goal is to learn how to better cultivate safe coexistence with these animals in such a dense and highly populated area such as South Florida. How did you start getting into underwater filming? I first started out with a GoPro, because it’s a very accessible and not too expensive way to get a camera underwater. In college, my roommates and friends always tried to go on some kind of adventure during spring break. We were super fascinated with the idea of snorkeling in clear water, because that wasn’t something that was around us where we grew up. So every spring break we drove down to Florida. We snorkeled in the Keys and discovered Florida’s springs along some of those trips. I would take photos with the GoPro, even though it’s not really meant for that. But underwater photography equipment is really expensive and I just thought, “There’s no way, I don’t know how I’ll ever be able to afford that.” But then after my wife and I graduated, we got married, lived in North Carolina for a little while, and then, because she’s originally from Pensacola, Florida, we moved back. I got a job doing some ecology work here in Gainesville. One day I was just cruising around Facebook Marketplace and I saw a camera housing made to fit a 20-year-old camera that was within millimeters of the size of my camera. It was a tenth of the price of what an average full kit cost. So I got it. I had to make some modifications and I actually used Lego pieces to make some of the controls fit my camera. I had pretty limited control underwater, but I could do auto ISO, and then control the aperture and the shutter speed, and pull the trigger to get a shot. When I did video, I had to start recording, put the camera in the housing, close it, and then I couldn’t do anything else. It would just be one single shot the whole time. So it wasn’t great for video, but that’s how I got started. And then I realized I was a pretty decent wildlife photographer. I took some photos and I got shortlisted in some pretty major international competitions. I didn’t push through to be a finalist, but it was enough to be, “I actually have some skill in this and it’s worth pursuing.” It just kind of kept building up from there. Eventually I got another used housing that was designed for my camera. By that point, I was selling prints and doing some other things, so I was able to finally fully upgrade my kit to where I’m at now. What kind of tech is in your diving kit? I’m using the Canon R5 with a Canon EF-RF adapter and a Canon EF 8-15mm f/4 L fish-eye lens. It’s a super wide-angle lens that people tend to use either for underwater or for skateboard photography. It’s a little weird because everything’s a little distorted and kind of rounded, but when you’re underwater, it’s really great for taking photos that just kind of immerse you in that system. You can focus extremely close to your subject. You can be an inch away and still focus on it. Since the angle is so wide, you can lock in on the eye of the wildlife and kind of capture their face, but also the rest of the scene and their entire body, even if it’s a bigger animal. I use an Ikelite 200DL Dive Housing, and I’ve got two Sea & Sea YS-90DX strobes and two 2900 VTL BigBlue Dive Lights. The strobes connect to the camera so that when you pull the trigger, it lets off some light, because the deeper you go underwater, light tends to fade pretty quickly and that little flash of white light just kind of restores color to the scene. I also have an Ikelite 8-inch Dome Port with an extension that is wide enough so that the super-wide fish-eye lens doesn’t get cut off by the design of the dive housing. If you hold it right on the surface it can create a water line so you can get split shots. I use Lightroom and Photoshop for editing photos and making prints. I use Premiere Pro for editing videos. How do you decide what you’re going to film? I have to find an idea that is interesting to me. Sometimes it’s a story that I think needs to be told, and that I feel qualified with the knowledge to do it. I need to know the location and be confident that I can get the shots I need safely. I also want to feel capable of telling the story in a meaningful way. Science and wildlife are such huge subjects. It’s hard. There’s a lot of people that tend to tout themselves as wildlife experts, but unless they’re very, very experienced, that raises a red flag. I wouldn’t describe myself as that. I have to do a lot of research myself and I learn things along the way too. I’m really passionate about anything aquatic because I love doing underwater photography and videography. That’s the main part of mysocial mediaandYouTube channel. I especially love showing people unique environments where you wouldn’t tend to think about what life looks like underwater. I think about what wildlife I might encounter there, and what conservation story I can weave through that. Also, is there enough visibility in the water for me to get my camera in and actually get usable shots that people can connect with? There’s a disconnect that exists between people and wildlife in the natural world that we have to actively combat, like climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction. There’s another disconnect between us and what lies beneath the surface, and I really want to do what I can to bridge that gap. It’s important that people put faces to the creatures that live in these places, no matter how big or how small they are. They’re all important, wonderful, worth learning and worth caring about. Aquatic ecosystems are very sensitive environments. It’s important to know what’s there, to know what we might stand to lose. Do you have a story in mind before you dive, or do you usually piece things together after? I love photography and being able to tell a story through a single image, but I also love longer forms, using video to tell stories as well. My creative process is definitely evolving. I’ll have the beginnings of an idea while I’m trying to work out the storytelling and trying to find ways to help people connect to it. Typically I’ll have an idea of the area I want to cover for the shot and what I’m going to focus on. One example was trying to find a veryspecific species of very tiny fishthat lives in springs. That Gulf Coast pygmy sunfish is a beautiful fish. They’re so cool. So my idea was that it’s going to be about finding that fish, filming it, hopefully getting some behavior. That was about what I had to work with, and I was lucky enough to see quite a bit of behavior. After I get the footage all edited down to the best clips and have a general concept of a story, that’s when I’ll write the script. Writing the script last is not normal for most creators, but I want the adventure and the action of going out and snorkeling, exploring these places, to be the heart of the channel. Sometimes I might have a little bit more script on certain parts, but normally I don’t have any control over what I’m going to see. So I have to go out and shoot, and then come back and do the story from that. What are thebiggest challenges that you’re trying to work through? A big challenge is sustainability and how I can be consistent and not burn out, because it is alotof work, going out to explore and dive, sometimes not having a lot of success and other times having success. How do I pace myself? I think I’ve kind of settled on a pretty decent schedule. Another challenge is that a lot of YouTube is shock value and clickbait. I want to use my channel to push back against that. The algorithm seems to be changing to entertain longer attention spans and boost authentic and real content. But I want to be able to use my channel to help people appreciate even little details and small things. Like if you go snorkeling and you’re in the ocean or on a reef, obviously the really big things like the sharks and huge rays are going to be what stand out to you. But if you’re in a tiny pond and there’s nothing around, and then you find one living thing, suddenly that thing becomes really interesting. I want to be able to tell stories about some of the less exciting things and make those interesting. Such as the video you made aboutAppalachian Hellbenders. I never imagined salamanders would duke it out like that.Do you like being based in Florida? It’s great, but in a lot of ways it’s hard and frustrating, too. Florida has some absolutely amazing wildlife and amazing ecosystems, and as an underwater photographer, it’s a great place to be. There’s the coasts, the Keys, freshwater springs, rivers and streams as well. There are a lot of places that are within reasonable driving distance to find underwater adventures and stories to tell. It’s frustrating because there’s so much to lose and Florida is also developing at a very unsustainable rate. There are new developments going up everywhere. A lot of spots I love are degrading. I’ve been going to the springs since college and some of them are almost unrecognizable from when I first visited them 10 years ago. It’s an issue globally and definitely around the US, but I think Florida is experiencing that at an accelerated rate. It’s a good place to be as a conservationist because there’s lots of work to be done, messages to get out there, but it can be draining and exhausting. Sometimes [you] feel like you’re fighting an uphill battle with no breaks or rest. Sounds likepolitics combined with being a tourist and retirement destination. A huge problem is that people are moving here and not taking the time to learn about the natural community that exists prior to their arrival. So people move here and are surprised to see an alligator in their backyard. Or other really wealthy people move to South Florida and have crocodiles around, and they freak out because that’s totally new to them. But this is Florida. We have venomous snakes, we have alligators, we have crocodiles. They belong here. They’re important for this ecosystem. If you can’t embrace that, then I don’t know what you’re expecting. There are plenty of ways to learn to safely live alongside these creatures. There’s just a huge need to meet the influx of new people with education and reminding people that we want Florida to remain wild. So much of the appeal of Florida is its natural environment and so there’s plenty of reasons why it needs to be protected, but it is kind of a constant battle. I love Florida so much. It’s such a beautiful place, an important place to protect, but it has a ton of challenges facing it. Are there any spots that you really want to dive into that you haven’t had the chance to yet? Because a lot of my stuff is Florida-based, I would really love to do a series of diving in every single state in the US. Some of that would be more predictable, like diving off the coast of Maine. That’d be cool. But though you never hear of anyone going to Nebraska or Oklahoma to snorkel, there’s underwater stories to be told there and I would love the chance to do that. So I’m hoping if the channel grows enough, there’ll be interest enough from the audience to support something like that. Of course I would absolutely love to travel internationally to do some videos as well. I think that’s something I would need to earn, because there are definitely other people who might be more qualified to tell some of those stories. But I think if my channel [followers] were interested and wanted me to, I would absolutely love the chance to do that. There are a lot of freshwater springs around the world. Any closing thoughts? I just hope that I can continue to inspire people to be kind and curious about the world around them and pay attention to the little things. It’s important to be mindful of our individual impacts on the world around us, but also to hold ourselves as a community and as a country to a higher standard as far as protecting our natural resources and our wildlife, because we don’t get a second chance at this. It’s important that we take it seriously and we get it right. I think it’s hard to learn to love something if you don’t know that that thing exists or haven’t been able to see it in its home. So I hope that my underwater videos can help people to get a glimpse into those underwater worlds to see that they’re places that are really special, worth protecting, and worth keeping wild.

    "title": "Expedition 33’s big twist was designed to &#8216;inflict the pain on the player&#8217;",
    "article_text": "﻿Warning: major spoilers ahead. byJay Peters ﻿Warning: major spoilers ahead. byJay Peters Clair Obscur: Expedition 33is my favorite game of the year so far, with an exhilarating battle system, excellent exploration, and a haunting soundtrack. But I’m not the only one who loves it: the game has become a huge hit, with more than 2 million copies sold just 12 days afterits late April release. “It feels very surreal,” says Guillaume Broche, Sandfall Interactive’s CEO and creative director. According to Broche, the game is performing “far beyond expectations” and that the team was not expecting it to “blow up” as fast as it did. “We are still in denial, basically” he says. Lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen adds, “I’m going to wake up tomorrow and this is all a joke, right?” A major part ofExpedition 33’s success is its gripping story. It kept me coming back to the game every moment I could just to see what happened next. The opening hits you with a gutpunch. Playing as Gustave, voiced byDaredevil’s Charlie Cox, you learn about the tragic circumstances of the world, its characters, and the annual “Gommage” that makes everyone of a certain age disappear in a flurry of petals when a giant being called the Paintress paints a new, lower number on a giant monolith. Gustave is one of the next Expeditioners that will strike out and attempt to take down the Paintress, and that team also includes Maelle, a teenager who he is responsible for. But he also loses an ex, Sophie, to the Gommage after the Paintress paints a 33. It’s a powerful, emotional opening, and it got me interested inExpedition 33right away. But there was a key scene later on that shifted the game’s story from good to great for me — and I got to talk to Brocke and Svedberg-Yen all about it. Spoilers ahead. Don’t scroll past this picture unless you want to read about a major plot development. If you chose to keep scrolling, the moment I’m talking about is at the end of Act 1. The mysterious white-haired man who massacred much of Expedition 33 earlier in the story appears after an intense boss fight. Without warning, the man stabs Gustave with a gigantic sword, and after a brief battle, stabs him again, killing him — and all right in front of Maelle, who is trapped in a dome of magical energy that renders her helpless. When it happened in my playthrough, my jaw was on the floor.Expedition 33had so far portrayed Gustave as the protagonist, and I figured he had the plot armor to make it all the way to the end so that he could get closure on losing Sophie. (Heck, they cast Charlie Cox, who also plays a Marvel superhero, to voice him!) But within hours of the game’s opening, Gustave was gone. “It’s where the story needed to go,” Svedberg-Yen says. For the narrative and themes that the team was going for, “it’s what was most organic.” “One of the main themes of the story is very obviously grief,” Broche says. In order to make a game about grief feel true, the team wanted players to “go through the horror that the characters are going through,” he adds. “It just made sense to inflict the pain on the player as strongly as the characters receive.” Broche says that actually playing as the character creates a deep link and attachment. “Losing that is the hole that the characters in the game experience basically every year with the Gommage, and it’s something here that just felt true to the game and the narrative.” The scene is brilliantly crafted to make the death feel impactful. After the boss fight and before the white-haired man’s appearance, I had relaxed — I figured I would get a nice, post-fight cutscene of celebration before moving on to the next thing. But the surprise of what happened next and the powerful performances from the motion capture actors and the voice actors made the scene memorable and powerful. I was particularly struck by the killing blow: after the white-haired man stabs Gustave, the game goes into slow motion to pause on that moment, on Maelle’s horror, and on Gustave’s armband emblazoned with “33,” which Sophie put on him shortly before she Gommaged. To me, it felt reminiscent of Aerith’s death inFinal Fantasy VII, but Broche and Svedberg-Yen say that wasn’t intentional. “If people find some similarities, it’s not actually conscious from us,” Broche says. (Svedberg-Yen said she hasn’t actually playedFF7, so I apologized for spoiling Aerith’s death.) Gustave’s final words are powerful, too: “For those who come after, right?” It’s a motto used by the Expeditioners to acknowledge the purpose and futility of their mission, and throughout act one, it becomes something of a catchphrase for Gustave. But in the moments before the killing blow, he seems to know what’s coming, and he says it as he gives a heartbreaking look to Maelle — who will have to grapple on her own with whatever comes after — before making his final attack. “That’s his whole character,” Broche says of the line. The motto itself has broader meaning, too. “We really wanted to hone in on the idea that they are part of a larger tradition, that they are one expedition in a chain,” Svedberg-Yen says. “So we really wanted to figure out a way to encapsulate that.” Like the rest ofExpedition 33’s most impactful moments, what makes the scene work is a combination of elements — writing, performance, music, and more — that merge together to create moments I can’t stop thinking about, even when they don’t feature a dramatic and unexpected death. “When we think about the storytelling, it’s all the teams together — that whole package — that really made it come alive,” Svedberg-Yen says.

    "article_text": "Whoop now says it will give free upgrades to users with more than 12 months left on their subscription. Whoop now says it will give free upgrades to users with more than 12 months left on their subscription. byWes Davis Whoop is in damage control mode. After debuting itsWhoop 5.0 fitness tracker, users were angered to find it had reneged on a promise of free hardware upgrades. In anew Reddit post, the company now says users who have more than 12 months left on their subscription can get the Whoop 5.0 for free. Part of the outrage was prompted by Whoop’s confusing messaging. Early yesterday morning, my colleagueVictoria Song reportedthat to get a Whoop 5.0 band, users would need to extend their existing membership by an additional 12 months or pay a one-time upgrade fee. However, until at least March 28th of this year, Whoop’s websitehad a blog postthat said users would only need to have been a member for at least six months to get a free upgrade to next-gen hardware. After the backlash, Whoop is now changing its tune — somewhat. Those with “more than 12 months remaining” are “eligible for a free upgrade to WHOOP 5.0 on Peak,” one of its new subscription offerings. Those with less than 12 months left still have to either extend their membership another 12 months or pay a one-time upgrade fee, the company says. The same information is reflected in anupdate on its membership pricing page. The company addresses the earlier blog post, writing that “a previous blog article incorrectly stated that anyone who had been a member for just 6 months would receive a free upgrade. This was never our policy and should never have been posted.” Whoop goes on: As noted above, our policy for upgrades from WHOOP 3.0 to WHOOP 4.0 was that members with 6 months or more remaining on their membership were eligible for a free upgrade to WHOOP 4.0. We removed that blog article when it came to our attention and updated WHOOP Coach with the proper information. We’re sorry for any confusion this may have caused. That seems to line up with aForbesinterviewthata Reddit user found, in which Whoop CEO Will Ahmed told the outlet that members with a Whoop 3.0 band could upgrade to the 4.0 model, so long as they had “at least 6 months of membership left on their account.” The company used similar language in a2021 blog postabout the Whoop 4.0 band. Still, Redditors aren’t responding well to the company’s response, with some complaining about the need to extend their subscriptioneven if they have 11 months left, orthreatening to cancel their subscription. Even some who are more accepting of the change have criticisms.One person writesthat while they’re “pleased with the change,” they don’t buy that the blog post was made in error. “They should just own that they changed their mind/policy rather than claim it was a false posting to begin with.” Correction, May 11th:This article initially misstated Whoop’s new terms in one instance. Members must have 12 months left on their subscription; they do not need to have been a member for 12 months..

    "title": "United’s Starlink-powered Wi-Fi is the end of airplane mode",
    "article_text": "The new gate-to-gate experience offers blistering fast Wi-Fi speeds, slower upload speeds, and low enough latency to make video calls possible (but not encouraged). byAndrew J. Hawkins The new gate-to-gate experience offers blistering fast Wi-Fi speeds, slower upload speeds, and low enough latency to make video calls possible (but not encouraged). byAndrew J. Hawkins Last Thursday, I boarded one of the first United Airlines planes to beequipped with Starlink’s satellite Wi-Fi. As expected, the Wi-Fi was very fast and left me wondering whether this will herald the end of spotty in-flight Wi-Fi, expensive connectivity fees, or even the quaint notion that we can avoid work altogether while cruising at 30,000 feet in the air. The test plane was an Embraer E-175, a narrow-body aircraft for regional flights that can fit up to 88 passengers. The flight was short, only about 90 minutes, taking off and landing from the same gate at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport. Still, the mood was festive, with several of United’s top executives donning aprons to serve the passengers first-class snack boxes and plastic cups of Champagne. It used to be that airlines would tell passengers to switch their phones to airplane mode before taking off for “safety reasons.” Now, United is encouraging its customers to browse, stream, and game to their heart’s content thanks to a new partnership with SpaceX’s Starlink. Last year,United became the first of the big three domestic airlines to announceits plan to add Starlink-powered Wi-Fi to its fleet, with the first commercial flights expected to start at the end of 2025. That plan was recently accelerated, and now United says its first flights with Starlink will officially begin May 15th, starting with the short hop between Chicago and Detroit. The round-trip flight in Chicago was just a test flight, and a chance for United to show off just how fast its new Wi-Fi provider was. The round-trip flight in Chicago was just a test flight, and a chance for United to show off just how fast its new Wi-Fi provider was. United assembled an interesting group of passengers for the test flight. In addition to me and a couple other journalists, I saw a few online influencers, a Twitch streamer, and someone from video game publisher Blizzard. The service works gate-to-gate, as opposed to only working above 10,000 feet, which is a restriction some other systems operate under. As soon as I sat down, I was instructed to connect to the Wi-Fi using United’s mobile app. But first, I needed to sign up for the airline’s loyalty program, MileagePlus, in order to gain access. To log on, you need to agree to a few rules, such as no voice and video calls, headphones for audio, and no viewing content that others might find offensive. Once you agree to these terms, you can sign into your MileagePlus account to access the Wi-Fi. Fortunately, MileagePlus is free to sign up, and United says it has no immediate plans to charge extra for Starlink Wi-Fi. Already, this sets the airline apart. Most carriers charge for Wi-Fi, with rates varying from $8 for a domestic flight to $600 for annual connectivity plans. Before Starlink, United’s Wi-Fi was powered by a variety of suppliers, with regional jets utilizing Intelsat (formerly Gogo) and most wide-body jets using Panasonic Wi-Fi. Now, the company says it plans on installing Starlink modems on all 1,026 planes in its fleet, starting with its two-cabin regional jets before moving up to the mainline aircraft. “We’re bringing Wi-Fi from just like your living room to the skies — whether you’re streaming, gaming, shopping, or working,” says David Kinzelman, chief customer officer at United. As soon as I was able to connect, I started checking the Wi-Fi speeds.Using Speedtest, I checked the speed multiple times throughout the flight: at the gate, while taxiing, during takeoff, ascending, at cruising altitude, descending, and during landing. I found the download speeds to be very impressive, averaging at 128 megabits-per-second (Mbps), while upload speeds were coming in a little slower at an average of 23.9 Mbps. The picture quality was crystal clear, the latency was low, and everything seemed to work quite smoothly. (And just now, I checked the speed of my home Wi-Fi, and yep, Kinzelman’s quote rings true.) I surfed the web, scrolled Instagram and TikTok, watched a few minutes of the latest episode of Disney Plus’Andor, streamed a live soccer game, checked in on CNN’s coverage of the new pope, and even had a video call withVergesupervising producer Vjeran Pavic. But if the prospect of hundreds of people making overlapping video calls on a single flight terrifies you, don’t worry — United said it would discourage its passengers from video conferencing or doing anything without headphones on its Starlink-powered commercial flights. I found the download speeds to be very impressive, averaging at 128 Mbps The only time I ran into some hiccups was when I tried uploading a few video clips to my Google Drive. What normally would take just under a minute on terrestrial Wi-Fi took almost seven minutes when connected to Starlink’s signal. This isn’t too surprising, given thatStarlink itself is less eager about advertisingits upload speeds compared to its download rate. The plane started its descent before I could test out the online play inMario Kart 8 Deluxeon the Nintendo Switch. But given the speeds I was seeing, I would expect that the chaos and gravity defying tracks would be just as enjoyable as if I was playing in my living room. United says you can connect as many devices as you want with no degradation in speed. I didn’t bring as many gadgets asWall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern did last year, but three devices seems like the sweet spot for most people. Starlink’s Wi-Fi works better than most other providers because of the sheer breadth of the number of satellites it has in low-earth orbit, which currently stands at over 7,000. While this certainly raises concerns aboutspace debris and over-crowding, it also allows the company to offer Wi-Fi with much lower latency thanks to the shorter distance the signal has to travel as compared to satellites in geostationary orbit. United isn’t the first airline to integrate Starlink; that distinction goes to Hawaiian Airlines and JSX. But as North America’s largest carrier, the selection of Elon Musk’s satellite internet service is certainly a harbinger of things to come. No word yet on when the airline plans on bringing the technology to its international flights, or how it will factor into the Star Alliance, but United MileagePlus CEO Richard Nunn said there would be more to announce in the near future. But in case this was all sounding a bit too altruistic on United’s part — blistering fast Wi-Fi speeds, and free? — don’t worry, because the airline is already thinking about how it’s going to monetize all this connectivity. “What the Starlink connectivity allows us to do in real time, because of the latency and the low earth orbit satellite technology… means that we can make some real-time, less than 100 millisecond ad decisions to serve up in a hyper-personalized world,” Nunn says. But I’m less concerned about United blasting me with personalized ads as I am about how Starlink’s in-flight Wi-Fi could open up yet another space to remote work. It used to be that I could enjoy a few blissful hours free from constant Slack pings and email notifications while up in the air. This was my time to watch horrible movies that I would never pay to see in the theater or even crack a book for a few hours. But once terrestrial Wi-Fi speeds while cruising 30,000 feet in the air becomes the norm, we won’t be able to rely on those old excuses anymore. Good luck trying toraw-dog that next flight. Update May 11th:A previous version of this story cited Wi-Fi speeds at megabytes-per-second. The correct measure is megabits-per-second.

And if you know someone else who might enjoyInstaller, forward it to them and tell them tosubscribe here.) I’ve mentioned this before here, but I have a real weakness for notebooks. On some level this makes no sense: I type all day, I write by hand hardly ever, and my handwriting is horrific. And yet there’s nothing I love more than the look and feel of a really nice notebook. I’ve been a fan of theSidekick Notepadfrom Cortex for a while, and wasveryexcited to see the launch of theSidekick Pocketthis week. There are three flavors of the new mini notebook: one with lined paper, one with a dot grid, and one just for writing checklists. The correct answer is all three. One half of the Cortex team isMyke Hurley, who you might also know as the cofounder of the Relay podcast network and the host of tech-focused shows likeConnectedandUpgrade. I’ve been a fan of Myke for a long time, and wanted to see how a guy who makes lovely notebooks thinks about his phone. Here’s Myke’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why: The phone:iPhone 16 Pro in Desert Titanium. I am in the No Case Club with my iPhone (although I love my MagSafe Popsocket to help with grip), so I like to have a phone with as much color as Apple will give me. The wallpaper:This is a photo of the wallpaper in The Beverly Hills Hotel, which I took while on holiday in LA last year. This wallpaper gives me joy, even though my friends REPEATEDLY tell me that it makes my homescreen too busy. But it’s my phone! The apps:Apple Notes, ChatGPT, Citymapper, Mango Baby, Photos, Instagram, Messages, Readwise Reader, Todoist, Notion, Safari, Overcast, GameTrack, Owlet Dream, Kindle. As you can see, I love widgets on my homescreen, and I use stacks quite a bit. So you see Carrot and Due there, for instance, but they are hiding widgets for Fantastical and Reminders, respectively. I find myself usingChatGPTmore and more to replace Google Search. Being able to ask follow-up questions about what I’m searching for is very powerful, and often helps me find what I want. My wife and I recently had our first child, and we have been usingMango Babyto track all the important things you need to track for baby health. It’s made by a single developer, it looks great, and it supports all the new Apple technologies like interactive widgets and live activities. I have recently taken all text-based social media off my phone, and am trying to do these things on work devices only, in an effort to be less distracted. So I have started saving articles toReadwise Reader. I really like the way the app looks and works — but I especially like its highlighting features. I really loveWidgetsmith’sphoto widgets. The built-in widget from Apple is good, but you never know what it’s going to show you. I also asked Myke to share a few things he’s into right now.

Also, people really likeKOReader.

    "title": "Bessent says \"substantial progress\" made in China tariff talks",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 11, 2025 / 7:44 PM EDT/ CBS/AP \"Substantial progress\" was made in sensitivetalks between the U.S. and Chinese delegationsthis weekend over tariffs that threaten to upend the global economy, the U.S. treasury secretary said on Sunday. Scott Bessent, along with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland over two days. In his statement Sunday, he offered scant information on exactly what negotiations entailed, but said more details would come at a briefing Monday. Meanwhile, Greer suggested that an agreement had been reached but provided no details. He and Bessent briefly addressed reporters once talks had wrapped at the stately villa that serves as the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, but did not take questions. \"It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as far as maybe thought,\" Greer said. But he also stressed that a top Trump administration priority means closing the U.S.trade deficitwith China, which came to a record $263 billion last year. The talks, which could help stabilize world markets roiled by the U.S.-China standoff, have been shrouded in secrecy and were taking place in the sumptuous 18th-century \"Villa Saladin\" overlooking Lake Geneva. The former estate was bequeathed to the Swiss state in 1973, according to the Geneva government. The hope is that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes — tariffs — they've slapped on each other's goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade. President Trumpposted on his social mediaSaturday evening after the first day of meetings concluded, saying \"great progress\" was made. \"A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner. We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business.\" In an interview withNBC Newslast week, Mr. Trump claimed Chinese officials \"want to make a deal very badly. We'll see how that all turns out, but it's got to be a fair deal.\" The president also said he expected to lower tariffs on China \"at some point.\" Meanwhile, Chinese officials have said they are open to negotiating with the U.S. on trade, butpushed theTrump administrationto drop its \"unilateral\" tariffs first. Mr. Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on Chinato a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries' boycotting each other's products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion. Even before the talks began, Mr. Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \"80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.″ Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results. \"The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\" she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \"It cannot just be words.\" Since returning to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has aggressively used tariffs ashis favorite economic weapon. He has, for example,imposed a 10% tax on importsfrom almost every country in the world. But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%. During Mr. Trump's first term, the U.S. alleged that claimed China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These The allegations include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies. Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues — such as China's subsidies — were left for future negotiations. But China didn't come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced. The fight over China's tech policy now resumes. Mr. Trump is also agitated by America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year. In Switzerland on Friday, Bessent and Greer also met with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter. Mr. Trump last monthsuspended plansto slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he's reduced those taxes to 10% but warned he could raise them again. The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate. \"An increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland's interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\" the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \"is therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\" On Saturday, Bessent said trade talks with Switzerland were \"very productive,\" and he was \"optimistic about the speed of these negotiations,\" citing Mr. Trump'strade deal with the U.K.that's still being finalized. \"I am glad that we have agreed on accelerated trade talks, and we expect that a detailed Swiss proposal will be submitted to Ambassador Greer by next week,\" Bessent wrote on social media. \"Swiss companies have indicated their interest in investing CHF 150-200 billion in new U.S. investments thanks to President Trump's policies, and we look forward to our continued talks.\" The U.S. is Switzerland's second-biggest trading partner after the European Union – the 27-member country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said. The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 11, 2025 / 7:38 PM EDT/ CBS/AP The United States will suspend imports of live cattle through ports along the southern border withMexicofor at least two weeks to review the joint strategy in the fight against the screwworm, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Sunday. Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement that thescrewworm, which is parasite that could be fatal, was recently detected in remote farms as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz, about 700 miles away from the U.S. border. \"The protection of our animals and safety of our nation's food supply is a national security issue of the utmost importance,\" she said in a statement. \"Once we see increased surveillance and eradication efforts, and the positive results of those actions, we remain committed to opening the border for livestock trade. This is not about politics or punishment of Mexico, rather it is about food and animal safety.\" Mexico's Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué said on social media that he had spoken with Rollins, who had informed of the decision. \"We don't agree with this measure, but we're confident we'll reach an agreement sooner rather than later,\" Berdegué said. The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals' skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal. Mexico's Health Ministry issued an epidemiological alert this month after the first human case of screwworm myiasis was confirmed on April 17 in a 77-year-old woman living in the southern state of Chiapas. Also this year, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department issued a warning in January about animals that may been impacted by the dangerous\"maneater\" parasites. The U.S. restricted Mexican cattle shipments in late November following the detection of the pest but lifted the ban in February after protocols were put in place to evaluate the animals prior to entry into the country. But there has been an \"unacceptable northward advancement\" of the screwworm, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a statement Sunday. \"Additional action must be taken to slow the northern progression of this deadly parasitic fly,\" the statement added. Over the last two years, screwworm has spread north throughout Panama and into Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize, and now Mexico, the department said. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 11, 2025 / 7:11 PM EDT/ CBS News Edan Alexander, the last living U.S. citizen kidnapped by Hamas terrorists and held hostage for more than 19 months, will be released from captivity, Hamas said in a statement Sunday. The Hamas statement Sunday night said the release was part of ongoing mediation efforts to establish a ceasefire, reopen crossings into the Israeli-blockaded territory and resume the delivery of aid. It does not say when the release will happen. Two Hamas officials told The Associated Press they expect the release in the next 48 hours. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it was aware of Hamas' plans to release Alexander \"as a gesture to the Americans\" in a statement to CBS News on Sunday. \"The United States has informed Israel that this move is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of the hostages under the original Witkoff outline — which Israel has already accepted,\" the office said, referencing terms negotiated by Steve Witkoff, U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East. \"Israel is preparing for the possibility that this move will materialize,\" the statement continued. \"According to Israeli policy, the negotiations will take place under fire with a commitment to achieving all war goals.\" Witkoff confirmed late Sunday in a message to CBS News that Hamas had agreed to release Alexander. Alexander isa 20-year-old Israeli-American soldierwho grew up in New Jersey and was a soldier in the Israeli military when Hamas attacked on Oct. 7, 2023. He was abducted from the military base where he was stationed near the Gaza border, along with 250 people taken hostage that day from southern Israel, while 1,200 more were killed. President Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Sunday that he is \"grateful to all those involved in making this monumental news happen.\" \"This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,\" he wrote. \"Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict. I look very much forward to that day of celebration!\" Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters also reacted to the news, saying they are \"embracing and supporting the Alexander family.\" \"Should this release be confirmed, the release of Edan Alexander must mark the beginning of a comprehensive agreement that will secure the freedom of all remaining hostages,\" it said in a statement. The group established by the families of the abductees urged Mr. Trump and Netanyahu to bring everyone back. \"You've given the families of all the hostages hope,\" the statement said. \"Please, complete your mission and bring them all home.\" As fighting escalated at the base that morning, Alexander sent a message to his mother, telling her that he had shrapnel caught in his helmet from surrounding explosions but found a protected area. His family lost contact with him after 7 a.m., the Associated Press reported. \"He told me even though things were already getting dangerous around him. That was the last time I heard my son's voice. I cannot describe the pain of not knowing where your child is or how is he,\" Alexander's mother, Yael Alexander, toldCBS New Yorkin October. She and his father, Adi Alexander, met with former President Joe Biden and President Trump late last year to push for a deal that would free all of the hostages still being held in Gaza. Mr. Trump said earlier this month thatfewer than two dozen hostageswere believed to be alive. Alexander was thought to be among them. As attempts to reach a permanent ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas have drawn on, militants have periodically freed hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. About 100 hostages were returned to Israel during a brief pause in fighting in November 2023, just over a month after the Oct. 7, 2023 attack prompted Israel to declare war on Hamas and begin bombarding Gaza. Some of the people freed in that first exchange said they had seen Alexander in captivity. His grandmother, Varda Ben Baruch, told the Associated Press at the time that hostages had said her grandson kept his cool and encouraged them that everyone would be released soon. Fewer than 50 living people have been released from Hamas captivity since the temporary ceasefire in November 2023. Militants released 30 of the people between January and March of this year, as part of another exchange agreement with Israel that took place in several stages. Although family members of those in ongoing captivity have repeatedly pleaded with American and Israeli leaders to solidify a deal prioritizing the hostages' safe return, Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas in March and renewed its offensive in Gaza, where Palestinian officials said the death toll has risen to at least 52,000.

    "title": "Jamie Lee Curtis revisits \"Halloween,\" \"Psycho,\" and \"True Lies\" artifacts",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 11, 2025 / 7:01 PM EDT/ CBS News On a Thursday afternoon in Los Angeles, California, actorJamie Lee Curtisstood over two leather-bound books. Costumes and props provided by the The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Academy Collection surrounded the actress and 60 Minutes correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi. Curtis saw her donated copy of the script for \"Halloween,\" the 1978 horror cult classic directed by John Carpenter that made Curtis the \"scream queen\" of her generation. Right beside it was the script for Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" once owned by her mother Janet Leigh, the actress who starred in the groundbreaking 1960 horror film. \"This is beautiful,\" Curtis said, admiring them both side-by-side. \"I haven't seen this since my mom died,\" she said, touching the \"Psycho\" script. They revisited cinema history as they examined each object, signposts of Curtis' acting career that's still going strong more than 40 years later. Curtis turned the worn pages of the \"Psycho\" script to page 52, the iconic scene that shocked audiences around the world. In the scene, Leigh's character, Marion Crane, removes her robe and steps into a shower, oblivious to the shadowy figure who then enters the bathroom and brutally murders her. Curtis told Alfonsi the film left a lasting impression on her mother. \"She never took a shower again. She only took baths,\" she told Alfonsi. \"Psycho\" was infamous for its radical subversion of what audiences expected from Hollywood at the time: the star was killed less than halfway through the film. \"What was shocking about it was that they killed the movie star on page 52... not even halfway through the movie,\" Curtis explained. \"She was top billing because she was the movie star. And that was the whole conceit of [Hitchcock] hiring her.\" Also on the table was a clapboard from \"Halloween.\" The film's title was written on a piece of white tape. Curtis was just 19 years old when she played the starring role. She waited until the last shot of the film to ask for the clapboard, and she kept it as a memento. Alfonsi asked Curtis if she had a favorite scene from the 1978 film. \"I remember John Carpenter saying to me, 'I want you to be vulnerable'… And I wasn't smart enough at 19 to understand what that meant. And I kind of thought it meant weak,\" the actress said. But watching the film in front of an audience on opening weekend cleared up that confusion. In the film, Curtis' character, Laurie Strode, is babysitting across the street from a house where her friend P.J. is also babysitting. Laurie is talking to P.J. on the phone when they're suddenly cut off. The audience can see that the killer, Michael Myers, is strangling P.J. Laurie thinks it's a prank, but walks across the street to investigate after putting the kids to bed. \"And it's inter-cut, back and forth…[me] walking toward the house, and then the house,\" Curtis told Alfonsi. \"When I saw the movie in Hollywood on the opening weekend…a woman stood up in the middle of the theater during that moment and screamed out loud in the theatre, 'Don't go in there! There's a killer in the house!' Curtis said, imitating the woman's screams. \"I understood in that second that that's what John [Carpenter] was talking about… they cared about this girl, and she was about to walk into mayhem.\" In 1994, Curtis starred opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in the action-comedy blockbuster \"True Lies,\" directed by James Cameron. On display in front of Alfonsi and Curtis were two mannequins wearing similar dresses: one black dress with frills, another without them. In the film, Curtis' character, Helen Tasker, is duped into a phony spy mission: pose as an escort and plant a listening device on a client who, unbeknownst to her character, is her husband. Later, Tasker performs a striptease. Cameron's original vision was that Curtis would be completely nude in the striptease scene. But in a meeting with the director, Curtis suggested a different approach. \"I kind of said to him, 'You know, Jim, you're gonna lose all the comedy because you're just going to be looking at my bits,'\" the actress told Alfonsi. She stepped into the director's bathroom, put on a black dress, and stuffed some black tulle she purchased at a fabric store in the neck, arms, and hem of the dress. Curtis pitched a gradual wardrobe change for her character to Cameron that would take place in three steps. She would first wear the dress with tulle added. After seeing herself in the mirror and realizing it wasn't going to work for her mission, she would rip the tulle off of her dress. \"'And then I unzip my dress and let it fall to the floor,'\" she told the director. \"I was wearing a pair of black panties and a bra. And I said, 'And then I'll be wearing this.'\" Cameron was convinced. A costume designer made multiple dresses for the film based on Curtis' concept, which are now part of the Academy Collection. And in the film, Tasker catches herself in the mirror before her encounter with the mysterious target and rips the tulle off the dress. Curtis wore the dress without the tulle for most of the film, including action scenes where she had to run barefoot and dangle off the side of a helicopter. But the transformation that earned Curtis her first Academy Award came from her incredible performance as Deirdre Beaubeirdre, the auditor from hell in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\" \"Jamie Lee Curtis is completely unrecognizable as this character,\" Alfonsi told 60 Minutes Overtime. \"I remember watching it the first time being like, 'Is that Jamie Lee Curtis?'\" For the role, Curtis relaxed all of her muscles, which exaggerated the size of her stomach, creating the silhouette of a sedentary bureaucrat. She told 60 Minutes no prosthetics were used: what you see on the screen is all her. \"I'm unbridled and I'm ungirdled… and I'm unclenched,\" she told Alfonsi. \"Everything you see in that movie is me. There is no padding… that is just me releasing all of the things that we've spent our entire lives holding in. Every muscle in my body just relaxed.\" \"She said she loves those roles where she's, you know, unclenched,\" Alfonsi told Overtime. \"She talked about the freedom of being able to do that where maybe in the past in Hollywood, particularly with her mother, they were expected to be perfect all the time. Jamie Lee Curtis has really embraced imperfection.\" \"The loss of vanity means freedom,\" the Hollywood star told Alfonsi standing in front of her wardrobe for Deirdre Beaubeirdre. \"I want the freedom to be whoever it is [I'm playing]… I'm just trying to be honest and not fake.\" The video above was produced by Will Croxton.

    "title": "Crime rings using stolen identities to steal money from U.S. government",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 11, 2025 / 7:00 PM EDT/ CBS News The Trump administration has madefrauda buzzword in Washington and tasked the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, with eliminating it from the federal government. But the government's fraud problem is much more complex and costly than most realize, according to Linda Miller, who spent a decade at the Government Accountability Office and wrote the rulebook on preventing fraud in federal programs. Fraud is a crime, and Miller believes the cost to taxpayers is coming close to $1 trillion each year. She said the biggest perpetrators aren't individuals lying about their eligibility for programs like unemployment insurance – they are sophisticated criminals, often overseas, who are draining public assistance programs intended for Americans in need. \"What we're really talking about is nation-state actors,\" Miller said. \"We're talking about organized crime rings. We're talking about using vast amounts of stolen Americans' identities to monetize them for criminal activity.\" The problem exploded during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the government rushed trillions of dollars into the economy to help struggling Americans. Applications for relief programs moved online, making it easier for people to access aid but with few safeguards, scammers, hackers and organized crime rings also cashed in. Miller, who in 2020 was appointed to an independent watchdog committee that tracked how COVID relief money was spent, said she saw the theft coming. \"It was like they threw money in the air and just let people run around and grab it,\" Miller said. There is no official tally of how much pandemic relief money was lost to fraud, but Miller estimates it's more than $1 trillion – or one in five dollars – making it the largest fraud loss in U.S. history. For Miller, the most egregious part was that a lot of the money stolen in the pandemic went to foreign adversarial nation states, including China and Russia. Often, the fraud rings are impersonating Americans using their stolen personal data. Last year, the FBI cracked one of the largest digital fraud cases in U.S. history, which involved cyber criminals from around the world using stolen identities to pocket$6 billion in pandemic unemployment funds. According to Bryan Vorndran, head of the FBI's cyber division, the government is a target for this type of fraud because of the massive amount of money it holds. He said practically every Americans' personally identifiable information — name, date of birth, former addresses, Social Security number — is available on the darknet for purchase. In some cases, the criminals are on the payroll of foreign governments. Vorndran called the fraud rings \"digital gangs of the 21st century,\" operating with knowledge that their governments won't interrupt their activity, even if it's illegal. China, for instance, employs a group the FBI calls APT41 — APT for Advanced Persistent Threat. In 2021, APT41 carried out a highly sophisticated and unusual hack of at least six state governments,according to cybersecurity group Mandiant, although researchers noted at least 18 states were potentially vulnerable to the attack. According to Vorndran, APT41 used this access to commit financial crime for personal gain by defrauding unemployment insurance programs across multiple states. \"They used stolen personally identifiable information…and essentially created fraudulent unemployment claims, then those proceeds were laundered through shell companies, and that money was sent back to these individuals in China,\" Vorndran said. The FBI's best estimate is that $60 million was taken over about two years. Very little has been recovered, Vorndran said. Multiple law enforcement and national security officials told 60 Minutes that China is a top destination for stolen taxpayer dollars but that the schemes are so complex and difficult to unravel that the true losses are unknown. Fraudsters targeting the U.S. government from foreign countries can be caught, Vorndran said. But there is a perception that some of the criminals are untouchable and that the U.S. government is outnumbered. \"In the U.S. government, we're all outnumbered,\" Vorndran said. Today, transnational cybercriminal rings continue to target government programs with tools such asAI deepfakes,synthetic identitiesandnetworks of stolen identities tied to fake emails and phones, according to documents and data provided by anti-fraud companies, including ID.me, Sentilink and Socure. \"It's whack-a-mole,\" Miller said. \"And these guys are paying close attention. They're seeing where better controls are being put in place. And then, they're going to where the controls still haven't been improved.\" The fraudsters often target disaster funding, Miller said. They look at zip codes where a disaster happens, then start buying up stolen identities so they can apply for disaster loans and disaster grants. Rich and Deann Wilken, who survived the Los Angeles wildfires in January, are among those who are victims of suspected identity fraud. They documented the destruction to their home of nearly five decades and applied for disaster assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Wilkens never heard back, so they followed up with a FEMA representative at a disaster center and learned the personal information they'd used to set up their FEMA account had been changed. \"By that time, too, we had already had some of our other friends whose accounts were the same way,\" Deann Wilken said. \"And we just go, 'Oh not us too.'\" The Wilkens were told their account was locked due to suspected identity fraud. They've spent months waiting for FEMA to resolve their case and it's unclear whether they will ever get any money. It's not just one program: where there's money, there's fraud — in unemployment, food stamps, disability, tax refunds — leaving Americans struggling to access what they're owed. When President Trump returned to the White House in January, he launched DOGE to identify and deal with waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government. Miller welcomed the formation of DOGE but she worries that it's conflating fraud with wasteful spending. \"You may not agree with what USAID does, you may not want to be investing American dollars in, you know, foreign fertilizer, for example, you may think that's the wrong thing to be spending money on, but that's not fraud,\" she said. Last year, the GAO released a report estimating that the federal government loses as much as $521 billion a year to fraud. But Miller and other fraud experts believe the number is higher. Miller puts the number between $550-$750 billion a year. Miller said there are a lot of opportunities for DOGE to save significant money, if they focus on real fraud – which she defines as willful deception that can be proved in a court of law. \"This is mom and apple pie stuff. We all agree that bad actors should not be stealing American taxpayer dollars.\" DOGE claims it has saved taxpayers more than $150 billion so far, sometimes citing examples of cost cuts that are inaccurate and later walked back. A White House spokesman told 60 Minutes that DOGE has been working on improving data sharing between agencies and that departments are collaborating to identify fraud and prevent criminals from exploiting taxpayers, saying, \"fraudsters will be held accountable.\" Miller said she sees \"some hints\" that DOGE is addressing the right issues. \"But right now, I think the jury is still out on whether or not we're gonna get that kind of progress,\" she said.

    "title": "The fraud costing the federal government hundreds of billions a year",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 11, 2025 / 7:00 PM EDT/ CBS News It's the most popular f-word in Washington: fraud. And DOGE — the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency — has been tearing through federal agencies on the hunt for it. But is DOGE looking in the right places? The fraud we'll tell you about tonight is complex, pervasive and being carried out by transnational criminal organizations often using stolen identities to target U.S. taxpayers – costing the government hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Linda Miller: To be honest, Elon Musk coming out and saying, \"There is a huge amount of fraud,\" I welcome that message completely because finally, someone is actually saying this. No one knows the ins and outs of government fraud better than Linda Miller. She spent a decade at the Government Accountability Office, tracking how taxpayer money is spent and misspent, and even wrote the rulebook on preventing fraud in federal programs. Linda Miller: Fraud is willful deception. It involves willful deception. And-- and it has to be proven in a court of law Cecilia Vega: Is DOGE conflating fraud with wasteful spending? Linda Miller: Yes, often. You may not agree with what USAID does, you may not want to be investing American dollars in, you know, foreign fertilizer, for example, you may think that's the wrong thing to be spending money on, but that's not fraud. Last year, the Government Accountability Office released a report estimating the federal government loses as much as $521 billion a year to fraud. But Miller and other fraud experts believe the number is higher. Linda Miller: I believe the government is losing between $550 billion and about $750 billion a year. We're coming up close to the $1 trillion amount-- is lost, every year, to fraud. Cecilia Vega: When most people think of government fraud, I imagine they're thinking somebody is claiming disability benefits when they're not actually eligible, somebody collecting food stamps when they're not actually eligible. Are those the biggest offenders? Linda Miller: Not at all, not by a long shot. What we're really talking about is nation-state actors. We're talking about organized crime rings. We're talking about using vast amounts of stolen Americans' identities to monetize them for, you know, criminal activity. The problem exploded during the pandemic – when the government rushed trillions of dollars into the economy to help struggling Americans. Applications for relief programs moved online, making it easier for people to access aid, but with few safeguards, scammers, hackers and organized crime rings also cashed in. In 2020, Miller was appointed to an independent watchdog committee that tracked how COVID relief money was spent. Linda Miller: We could tell, right away, it was like, \"Oh. Well, that's all gonna get stolen.\" Cecilia Vega: You saw it coming? Linda Miller: Oh, yeah. I mean, It was like they threw money in the air and just let people run around and grab it. The most egregious part is that a lot of the people who stole that money were foreign adversarial nation states. Cecilia Vega: So who are they? Who are you talking about? Linda Miller: We're talking about China. We're talking about Russia. Cecilia Vega: Impersonating Americans, in a lot of cases? Linda Miller: Yes. Right. Bryan Vorndran: These are arguably digital gangs in the 21st century that are built off of having safe haven status meaning their governments are not gonna interrupt their activity even if it's illegal. Bryan Vorndran is head of the FBI's Cyber Division – he says these digital gangs are armed with a very important weapon. Cecilia Vega: Is it true that the Social Security number of just about every single American is available for sale on the dark web? Bryan Vorndran: That is a true statement. All of our personally identifiable information – name, date of birth, former addresses, social security number-- is available on the dark net and can likely be purchased. Cecilia Vega: That's chilling. Bryan Vorndran: Yeah. It's very much a way of our lives, though, right now. Cecilia Vega: And purchased, I hear, for a little as two bucks apiece? Bryan Vorndran: Yep. Very affordable. Last year, the FBI unraveled one of the largest digital fraud cases in U.S. history, in which cyber criminals from around the world used stolen identities to pocket $6 billion in pandemic unemployment funds. Bryan Vorndran: $6 billion is an enormous, enormous amount of money. Cecilia Vega: Why is the government a target for this type of fraud? Bryan Vorndran: Because of the massive amount of money that exists in the federal government and in the state government. There is no official tally of how much COVID relief money was lost to fraud, but Miller estimates it's more than a trillion dollars —that's 1 in 5 dollars – making it the largest fraud loss in U.S. history. Linda Miller: One of the things I found really disheartening is since then, I have-- I have talked to some folks who said, \"Well, that was just the pandemic. We don't have to worry about it anymore.\" Cecilia Vega: Was it? Linda Miller: No. I mean, it's whack-a-mole. And they-- these guys are-- are paying close attention.They're seeing where better controls are being put in place. And then, they're going to where the controls still haven't been improved. Cecilia Vega: What are the hot spots for fraud, right now? Linda Miller: Disaster funding-- is a really big issue. When a disaster happens in the country, the fraud actors see where it's coming. They look at the zip codes. And they begin buying stolen identities, so that they can begin applying for disaster loans, disaster grants, on behalf of stolen identities. The real Americans behind those identities? People like Rich and Deann Wilken – who survived the Los Angeles wildfires that tore through their Palisades neighborhood in January. Deann Wilken: Everything on this side burned and the school on the other side also burned. They documented the devastation, showing the home they lived in for nearly 50 years, gone. All they have left are the few carloads of belongings they managed to take with them. The Wilkens applied for disaster assistance from FEMA, carefully keeping a file and notebook with important information they'd need throughout the process. Cecilia Vega: So as far as you know-- Rich Wilken: I was-- Cecilia Vega: --you've done everything you need to do. Help is on the way. Rich Wilken: Help is on the way. But help never came, so the Wilkens followed up with a FEMA representative at a disaster center and learned the personal information they'd used to set up their FEMA account had been changed. Rich Wilken: She says, what's your Social Security number? OK. What's your date of birth? OK. And, uh, your address is such and such. And I said, no. Is your phone number start with area code such and such? And I said, no. Cecilia Vega: What's going through your mind? Deann Wilken: Yikes. Rich Wilken: Yeah, W-T-F. Deann Wilken: Well, and by that time, too, we had already had some of our other friends whose accounts were the same way. And we just go, \"Oh not us too.\" The Wilkens were told their account was locked due to suspected identity fraud. They've spent months waiting for FEMA to resolve their case, and it's unclear whether they will ever get any money. Cecilia Vega: Where will you be in six months? Rich Wilken: Here. Cecilia Vega: Will you still have this folder in front of you? Deann Wilken: Hopefully, it's been put way in the back of the filing cabinet. It's not just one program. Where there's money, there's fraud — in unemployment, food stamps, disability, tax refunds— leaving Americans struggling to access what they're owed. All the while, criminals are one step ahead, using AI tools like deepfakes – often of innocent people – to cover their tracks. The man you see here is attempting to pass an identity check through the company ID.me to obtain a tax refund from the IRS. Or so it appears. Watch closely as he holds up a driver's license: there's a glitch, and you see a sliver of a different man's face. You can hear someone speaking Mandarin in the background. In some cases, suspected criminals are on the payroll of foreign governments…like China which employs a group the BI calls APT41 – APT for Advanced Persistent Threat. In 202, APT41 carried out a highly sophisticated and unusual hack of at least six state governments. Cecilia Vega: What would they want, hacking into state government programs? Bryan Vorndran: They just wanna make money for themselves. Cecilia Vega: Through the U.S. government? Bryan Vorndran: Correct. Cecilia Vega: Via American taxpayer dollars? Bryan Vorndran: Correct. They s-- used stolen personally identifiable information and essentially created fraudulent unemployment claims, and then those proceeds were laundered through shell companies, and that money was sent back to these individuals in China. Cecilia Vega: How much did they get? Bryan Vorndran: Our best estimate is $60 million. Cecilia Vega: $60 million over the course of how long? Bryan Vorndran: Over the course of about two years. Cecilia Vega: Wow. How much of that has been recovered? Bryan Vorndran: Very little. Very little. Cecilia Vega: And I assume never will be? Bryan Vorndran: That's-- that's a likely outcome. Cecilia Vega: And to be clear, this was money that was supposed to go to Americans in need, in a crime being carried out that has been linked to the Chinese government. Bryan Vorndran: Correct. Multiple law enforcement and national security officials told us China is a top destination for stolen taxpayer dollars but the schemes are so complex and difficult to investigate, the true losses are unknown. Cecilia Vega: We've heard that attacks like this are continuing to this day. And it's not just APT41. There are hundreds of people involved. Do you believe that to be true? Bryan Vorndran: I believe that there are sustained campaigns across this globe that are very well-resourced, with a goal of causing damage to the United States. Cecilia Vega: Can you really catch a criminal in this arena that is operating in a place like China, Russia, North Korea, Eastern Europe? Bryan Vorndran: We have plenty of examples-- where we have caught people from some of the countries that you mentioned Cecilia Vega: I do think there's a perception though that some of these criminals are untouchable. They're impossible to get to. Bryan Vorndran: Sure. I would agree with that. Cecilia Vega: It also, respectfully, sounds like you're outnumbered. Bryan Vorndran: In the U.S. government we're all outnumbered. Cecilia Vega: Do you ever s-- feel like you're sort of screaming until you're blue in the face on this and no one is listening to you? Linda Miller: Yes. Yes. I have worked with agencies, where when I sit down and talk to them, they say, \"I'm gonna stop you, right there, because you keep saying, 'Fraud.' And that's-- that sounds so insidious. Is there another word we could use?\" And I-- Cecilia Vega: Is there? Linda Miller: Well, I say, \"Well, what-- what's the word you'd prefer?\" And they say, \"Maybe, misappropriation.\" Cecilia Vega: Does that make it better? Linda Miller: Yeah. It sounds better. And-- you know, and what I usually say is, \"It is insidious.\" DOGE claims it has saved taxpayers more than $160 billion so far, sometimes citing examples of cost cuts that are inaccurate and later walked back. A White House spokesman told us DOGE has been working on improving data sharing between agencies and that departments are collaborating to identify fraud and prevent criminals from exploiting taxpayers, saying, quote, \"fraudsters will be held accountable.\" Cecilia Vega: Watching DOGE, are you optimistic that real fraud reform will actually come? Linda Miller: I — when I watch DOGE today, I do see some hints that they are addressing the right issues. But right now, I think the jury is still out on whether or not we're gonna get that kind of-- progress. Cecilia Vega: Do you feel like you have to choose your words carefully, when you're talking about DOGE and Elon Musk? Linda Miller: Yeah. Cecilia Vega: Why? Linda Miller: Um, because I really think fraud is not a political issue. This is mom and apple pie stuff. We all agree that bad actors should not be stealing American taxpayer dollars. But now, it's become political. People like me, and people in the law enforcement community, we see the adversary, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as foreign adversarial nation-states and organized crime rings. And I believe that there's opportunities for DOGE to save a lot of significant money, if they focus on the right things, if they focus on real fraud. Produced by Ayesha Siddiqi and Kit Ramgopal.

    "title": "Jamie Lee Curtis on the roles that launched her decades-long career",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 11, 2025 / 7:00 PM EDT/ CBS News In Hollywood, it's not unusual for actors to try and fit the industry standard of beauty and marketability, plotting every outfit and career move with the prowess of a chessmaster. But Jamie Lee Curtis is not one of them. Candid and spontaneous, she fearlessly calls it as she sees it, even when it comes to herself. We met Jamie Lee Curtis in Los Angeles, where at 66 years old, she is savoring a new wave of award-winning performances. We asked her about her decades-long career. She told us it was anything but planned. Jamie Lee Curtis: My life hinged on a couple seconds I never saw coming. I never thought I'd be an actor in my life. My teeth were the color of concrete. They were gray. I was cute but not pretty. And so, I never saw that coming. She probably should have. Jamie Lee Curtis was born into Hollywood royalty, the daughter of screen-idols Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, two of the biggest stars during the golden age of cinema. But Jamie Lee says she wanted to be a cop. She was home from college, when a friend convinced her to audition for Universal Studios. Jamie Lee Curtis: I did the scene. And she said, \"That was very good,\" whatever. And I was like, \"Oh, OK. Great. Thanks.\" I said, \"Listen, if this is gonna work out I need to know, because I'm going back to college in, like, two days.\" Sharyn Alfonsi: Very practical. Jamie Lee Curtis: So like, she laughed or whatever. And they called me the next day and they gave me a seven-year contract at Universal, and I quit college. Almost immediately, she booked the 1978 horror film \"Halloween.\" Curtis was cast as the bookish babysitter, Laurie Strode, terrorized by an unrelenting killer. It was her first movie. She was 19 years old playing the lead. Sharyn Alfonsi: Were people saying, \"Oh, she got the job because of who her parents are, because of the pedigree?\" Jamie Lee Curtis: I know. I guarantee you the fact that my mother was in 'Psycho' was a determining factor that maybe that will get them a little extra publicity. Now, did it get me to that final two? No, my auditions got me to the final two. Jamie Lee Curtis: This was a $300,000 horror movie. This was not a job that a lot of people wanted. \"Halloween\" ended up grossing more than $70 million and became a cult classic. But it didn't exactly launch Jamie Lee Curtis' career. Jamie Lee Curtis: My big break after \"Halloween\" was, I was on \"Love Boat\"with Janet Leigh. Beautiful Janet Leigh playing my mother. And then I was in a \"Charlie's Angels\" episode where I am Cheryl Ladd's best friend, pro golfer. So those are the two jobs I get post \"Halloween.\" Sharyn Alfonsi: Were you thinking at this point, like, \"People aren't hiring me, they just want my mom around, or the name?\" Jamie Lee Curtis: You know what? Sure. Sharyn Alfonsi: But didn't that bother you? Jamie Lee Curtis: No. Because-- because I was doin' my thing. Curtis' \"thing\" was transforming into a \"scream queen\" for a new generation with a string of horror movies. Sharyn Alfonsi: I read that you didn't even like scary movies. Jamie Lee Curtis: I don't like scary movies. Sharyn Alfonsi: Still? Jamie Lee Curtis: Still. Oh, please. Awful. Sharyn Alfonsi: Why? Jamie Lee Curtis: Awful. The smart aleck answer is because life is scary. It's a surprising thing to hear from an actress who's known for being fearless. Before that spin around the bedpost, opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in \"True Lies.\" Curtis held her own next to Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, in her first comedy feature, \"Trading Places,\" directed by John Landis. She says her role as Ophelia, a wise, kind-hearted, street-walker is what really launched her career. Sharyn Alfonsi: That part, I mean, she's gritty, and the gum, and the whole thing. How much of that did you bring to her? Jamie Lee Curtis: John stuck gum in my mouth every day. Literally I would stand there and he'd walk up, I'd go, \"OK.\" I mean, it's-- you know, it's just a great part. But here's the other thing, and-- this is crucial, and this will make the piece. If I'm not in \"Trading Places,\" John Cleese does not write \"A Fish Called Wanda\" for me. If I'm not in \"A Fish Called Wanda,\" Jim Cameron does not write the part in \"True Lies\" for me. And that grouping of films gave me my career, for sure. If it all sounds like fairytale, it wasn't. By the mid-80s, Jamie Lee Curtis was a well-established actor when she made a movie with John Travolta called \"Perfect.\" By all accounts, and from every angle, she was. Jamie Lee Curtis: I took it very seriously as an actor and of course, I look really good in a leotard. And believe me, I've seen enough pictures of me in that leotard where even I go, like, \"Really? Come on.\" But she says a cinematographer working on the film criticized the way she looked. Jamie Lee Curtis: He was like, \"Yeah, I'm not shooting her today. Her eyes are baggy.\" And I was 25? So, for him to say that was very embarrassing. So as soon as the movie finished, I ended up having some plastic surgery. Sharyn Alfonsi: And how did that go? Jamie Lee Curtis: Not well. That's just not what you wanna do when you're 25 or 26. And I regretted it immediately and have kind of sort of regretted it since. Sharyn Alfonsi: Even now? Jamie Lee Curtis: Way so now because I've become a really public advocate to say to women, \"You're gorgeous and you're perfect the way you are.\" So oh, yeah I, I, I, it was not a good thing for me to do. Sharyn Alfonsi: That's when you started taking...You've been public about this-- you started taking pain-- pain killers. Jamie Lee Curtis: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean--Well they give them to you. I became very enamored with the warm bath of an opiate. You know, drank a little bit…never to excess, never any big public demonstrations, I was very quiet, very private about it but it became a dependency for sure. Curtis says she's been sober for 26 years. Sharyn Alfonsi: Did you worry when you shared your story of how you got sober that it would impact your career? Jamie Lee Curtis: I think I worried more that selling yogurt that makes you sh** was gonna impact my career than for me to acknowledge that I had an addiction. Um I make the joke. It's a funny joke but it's true. Ahh that yogurt commercial…famously parodied by \"Saturday Night Live.\" Curtis, one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, suddenly began selling pantyhose and hawking rental cars. Sharyn Alfonsi: 'True Lies' had made $400 million. You coulda done anything you wanted to do but you were taking those spokesperson jobs. Why? Jamie Lee Curtis: For the most part because they allowed me to stay home with my kids. So, I am-- I am an imperfect, you know, working mom because no working moms are perfect. Sharyn Alfonsi: It's all scotch-taped together. Jamie Lee Curtis: I'm looking at one. You're speaking to one. We make it look good. We think we've done it. But the truth is, we feel badly. But I know how much time away from them I spent in pursuit of my own creativity. Curtis has two children with Christopher Guest, the actor and director best known for \"This is Spinal Tap\" and taking aim at dog shows and even filmmaking in a series of mockumentaries. They've been married for more than 40 years. Jamie Lee Curtis: My mother was married four times. My father was married five times. That's nine. My stepfather was married three, so I come from an immediate family of 12 marriages. So my joke, \"I'm still married to my first husband,\" um you know, it was important to me that I stay married to my husband, that he's my husband. Sharyn Alfonsi: Did you ever pass up a role that you wish you had taken? Jamie Lee Curtis: No. Once their kids were grown, Curtis traded in carpool duty for unapologetically driving her own career. Jamie Lee Curtis: We're going this way.… She runs her own production company, which has a TV-series in the works, starring Nicole Kidman, and a feature film about the catastrophic Paradise wildfires in 2018. She's also running her own charity. Curtis has raised over a million dollars for Children's Hospital Los Angeles and donated another million to victims of the recentwildfires, which destroyed much of Altadena and the Pacific Palisades, including this home where she filmed the millennial hit \"Freaky Friday and the upcoming sequel, \"Freakier Friday.\" And four decades after the first \"Halloween,\" she finally put that franchise to rest. But it is a string of raw, vulnerable characters that came to Curtis in her 60's that led to a comeback, even she never imagined: playing the aging waitress in \"The Last Showgirl,\" or sucking the oxygen out of the kitchen as the combustible matriarch Donna Berzatto in Hulu's TV-series \"The Bear.\" Sharyn Alfonsi: Donna, the images in my mind of her, buttering the bread, with the nails, and the eyelash on the cheek. Jamie Lee Curtis: The eyelash. That single eyelash I think won me an Emmy. I swear to God. Jamie Lee Curtis: I've waited my whole life for Donna, patiently, quietly cooking. 13:07:39;24 My own creative mental life, my own-- you know, my own alcoholism. It's just so beautifully written that you don't have to do anything. But it was 2022's mystical, somewhat, mind-bending \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" that pushed Jamie Lee Curtis out of her comfort zone. Sharyn Alfonsi: Did you understand that role? Jamie Lee Curtis: Of course not-- Sharyn Alfonsi: When you got it? Jamie Lee Curtis: Not one second of it. Did I understand that script? No. Curtis says she did understand Deirdre Beaudbeirdre, the hardboiled bureaucrat from hell. Jamie Lee Curtis: We all know Deidre. She's a woman who's not loved. She's a woman who uses her power in her job to control people because she has no love in her life. Curtis was unrecognizable but her performance did not go unnoticed. Sharyn Alfonsi: Before the moment, though, first, when they call your name. Jamie Lee Curtis: Yes Sharyn Alfonsi: You say, I think? \"Shut up.\" Jamie Lee Curtis: \"Shut up.\" Totally, because that wasn't supposed to happen. Sharyn Alfonsi: Your mom never won an Oscar. Dad never won an Oscar. Jamie Lee Curtis: No, they didn't. They were both nominated. Sharyn Alfonsi: Does this make you feel like you're on even footing with your parents, who were these gigantic stars? Jamie Lee Curtis: You know, I think about surpassing my parents, which I have, emotionally. I have surpassed my parents with sobriety. My mother was restricted by what the industry wanted from her, and expected from her, and would allow from her. My mother would have hated \"The Last Showgirl\" because I showed what I really looked like. And so I have, I don't wanna say, surpassed them, but I,Ihave freedom. The morning after her Oscar win, a photographer asked Curtis to recreate a photo of actress Faye Dunaway and her statue from nearly 50 years ago. She agreed, with one condition. Jamie Lee Curtis: And I said to him, \"Yeah, but I won't do it seriously. We have to make it funny.\" Jamie Lee Curtis hasn't just embraced imperfection, she's made it an art.

    "title": "Jamie Lee Curtis never thought she'd be an actor",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 11, 2025 / 7:00 PM EDT/ CBS News Jamie Lee Curtis was raised in the bosom of cinema royalty, her father was screen idol Tony Curtis and her mother, actress Janet Leigh, famously starred in Alfred Hitchcock's classic \"Psycho.\" Despite that, she says she never thought she'd be an actor. \"My life hinged on a couple seconds I never saw coming,\" Curtis, now 66, said. Curtisplanned on being a cop. But, while home from college, a friend convinced Curtis to audition for Universal Studios. \"I did the scene. And she said, 'That was very good' whatever,\" Curtis said. \"And I was like, 'Oh, OK. Great. Thanks.' I said, 'Listen, if this is gonna work out I need to know, because I'm going back to college in, like, two days.'\" She got a seven-year contract the next day and quit college. Almost immediately, Curtis booked the 1978 horror film \"Halloween.\" She was cast as Laurie Strode, a bookish babysitter terrorized by an unrelenting killer named Michael Myers. Curtis acknowledges that her mother's role in \"Psycho\" probably played a role in the casting decision, but said it was her auditions that landed her the lead in her first ever feature film. \"This was a $300,000 horror movie. This was not a job that a lot of people wanted,\" she said. \"Halloween\" ended up grossing more than $70 million and became a cult classic, but it didn't exactly launch Curtis' career. After booking \"Halloween,\" Curtis was on \"Love Boat\" with her mother, who played her mother. Curtis went on to star in \"Halloween II\" and other horror films, including \"The Fog,\" \"Terror Train\" and \"Prom Night.\" She became the scream queen of the generation, but it was her first comedy feature, \"Trading Places,\" directed by John Landis, that Curtis said really launched her career. In it, she held her own next to Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, playing Ophelia, the wise, kind-hearted street walker. \"This is crucial, and this will make the piece,\" Curtis said. \"If I'm not in 'Trading Places,' John Cleese does not write 'A Fish Called Wanda' for me. If I'm not in 'A Fish Called Wanda,' Jim Cameron does not write the part in 'True Lies' for me. And that grouping of films gave me my career, for sure. For sure,\" she said. By the mid-80s, Curtis was a well-established actor when she made a movie with John Travolta called \"Perfect.\" By all accounts, and from every angle, she was. Curtis played an aerobics instructor. \"And of course I look really good in a leotard,\" she said. \"And believe me, I've seen enough pictures of me in that leotard where even I go, like, 'Really? Come on.'\" But she says a cinematographer working on the film criticized the way she looked. She was 25 and he called her out for baggy eyes, refusing to shoot her. \"For him to say that was very embarrassing. So as soon as the movie finished I ended up having some plastic surgery,\" she said. Curtis started taking pain killers afterwards. \"I became very enamored with the warm bath of an opiate, drank a little bit — never to excess, never any big public demonstrations, very quiet, very private about it but it became a dependency for sure,\" she said. Curtis said she's been sober for 26 years. 60 Minutes correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi asked Curtis if she was worried sharing the story of her addiction would impact her career. \"I think I worried more that selling yogurt that makes you sh** was gonna impact my career than for me to acknowledge that I had an addiction,\" Curtis said. \"I make the joke. It's a funny joke. But it's true.\" That yogurt commercial, which was laterparodied by \"Saturday Night Live,\" wasn't her only commercial. Curtis, one of the biggest stars in Hollywood after \"True Lies\" made roughly $400 million, also did commercials for pantyhose and rental cars. \"For the most part because they allowed me to stay home with my kids,\" Curtis said. \"I am an imperfect, you know, working mom. Because no working moms are perfect.\" Curtis has two children with Christopher Guest, the actor and director best known for the  \"This is Spinal Tap.\" They've been married for more than 40 years. \"My mother was married four times. My father was married five times. That's nine,\" Curtis said. \"My stepfather was married three. So I come from an immediate family of 12 marriages. So my joke, 'I'm still married to my first husband,' you know, it was important to me that I stay married to my husband, that he's my husband.\" Once their kids were grown up, Curtis traded in carpool duty for unapologetically driving her own career. Curtis now runs her own production company, Comet Pictures, which has a TV series in the works starring Nicole Kidman, called \"Scarpetta,\" and a feature film coming up about the catastrophic Paradise wildfires in 2018, called \"The Lost Bus.\" She's written more than a dozen best-selling children's books, including some best sellers, and also runs her own charity, called My Hand in Yours, which has raised over $1 million for Children's Hospital Los Angeles. Curtis donated another million to victims of the recentwildfires, which destroyed much of Altadena and the Pacific Palisades, including the home where she filmed the millennial hit \"Freaky Friday\" and the upcoming sequel, \"Freakier Friday.\" And four decades after the first \"Halloween,\" she finally put that franchise to rest with \"Halloween Ends.\" But it was a string of raw, vulnerable characters that came to Curtis in her 60s that's led to a comeback even she never imagined, playing the aging waitress in \"The Last Showgirl,\" or sucking the oxygen out of the kitchen as the combustible matriarch Donna Berzatto in Hulu's TV series \"The Bear.\" \"I've waited my whole life for Donna, patiently, quietly cooking. My own creative mental life, my own, you know, my own alcoholism,\" Curtis said. \"It's just so beautifully written that you don't have to do anything.\" In 2022's mystical, somewhat, mind-bending \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" Curtis was unrecognizable as hardboiled bureaucrat Deirdre Beaubeirdre. The performancewon her an Oscar—  neither of her parents ever won, though they were both nominated for the award. \"You know, I think about surpassing my parents, which I have, emotionally. I have surpassed my parents with sobriety. My mother was restricted by what the industry wanted from her, and expected from her, and would allow from her. My mother would have hated 'The Last Showgirl' because I showed what I really looked like,\" Curtis said. \"And so I have, I don't wanna say, surpassed them, but I have freedom.\" That freedom was on display the morning after her Oscar win. A photographer asked Curtis to recreate a photo of actress Faye Dunaway and her statue from nearly 50 years ago. Curtis agreed, with one condition. \"I said to him, 'Yeah, but I won't do it seriously. We have to make it funny.'\" Sharyn Alfonsi is an award-winning correspondent for 60 Minutes. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. Copyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego says Democrats \"did this to ourselves\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 10, 2025 / 10:21 PM EDT/ CBS News Levittown, Pennsylvania— At a town hall Saturday in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona encouraged the Democratic party to return to its roots as the \"big tent\" party. \"What happened the last election is that we got so pure, and we kept so pure that we started kicking people out of the tent,\" Gallego said. \"It ends up there aren't enough people in the tent to win elections.\" Gallego cited podcast host Joe Rogan as an example of someone \"kicked out\" of the tent because his message did not completely align with the party's. \"I'm sure you guys heard like, 'Oh, well, the Democrats need to have their own Joe Rogan,'\" Gallego said. \"We had Joe Rogan. We canceled Joe Rogan years ago. Democrats don't want to admit this. We did, and then it was, became questionable whether we should go on Joe Rogan or not. We did this to ourselves.\" The first-term Democratic senator from Arizona touted his own success in a battleground state as an example of how Democratic candidates can win moving forward. Gallegodefeated Republican Kari Lake in the Arizona Senate racelast year by two points. \"I represent a state that has 330,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats,\" Gallego said. \"You have to get a lot of votes, and that means we're going to have to have alliances with people that we may not agree with 100% of the time, right?\" This success has fueled speculation that Gallego is considering running for president in 2028. He's one of a handful of Democrats making stops across the country, talking to voters, similar to Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. \"Of course, I've thought of it, but I'm also, you know, about to… have my third kid coming June 12, and I don't want to get divorced, and I just became a US senator,\" Gallego told CBS News. \"I love my job, and I need to make sure I do both jobs well. That's not what I'm thinking about right now. When asked if he thinks it will take a moderate like him to win Pennsylvania in 2028, Gallego said it will take someone who is able to empathize with voters on issues impacting them. \"I think it's going to take someone that really understands what's going on. People were hurting in the last election. I think the Democrats messed up by not really focusing on that,\" Gallego said. \"This person is gonna be able to communicate that like, yeah, things are bad. The economy hurts. You're hurting, and I'm here to help you out.\" Gallego spoke in Bucks County, a key battleground area north of Philadelphia that President Trump flipped by a few hundred votes in 2024. Distrust and anger toward the Democratic party were palpable at the town hall when one participant asked Gallego how Democrats should change their messaging moving forward. \"People don't vote for a party, right? It's us that run as Democrats. We need to be the face of the party, and we need to be out there,\" Gallego said. \"The problem is that we are too effing safe all the time.\" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "title": "Elon Musk's regulatory troubles have begun to melt away in Trump's second term",
    "article_text": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk’s regulatory problems have started to fade into the past. Since the start of the second Trump administration, federal agencies thathad scrutinized Muskand his business empire in recent years have begun to look a lot different. At the Department of Agriculture, for example, President Donald Trumpfired the personwho had been investigating the Musk company Neuralink. At other agencies including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Trump and Musk have tried toslash the number of employees— potentially hobbling those regulators’ ability to enforce the law against companies including Musk’s Tesla and X. In the past few months, Trump’s Justice Department hasdropped a caseagainst Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, and his Labor Department has canceled aplanned civil rights reviewof his automaker, Tesla. Another regulatory matter against SpaceX hasentered settlement talkswith the National Labor Relations Board. And in more than 40 other federal agency matters, regulators have taken no public action on their investigations for several months or more — raising questions about whether those cases may have become dormant, according to an NBC News review of regulatory matters involving Musk’s companies. Those matters range widely, from safety investigations into Tesla’s “self-driving” features to alleged workplace safety violations at SpaceX. Jon Michaels, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an expert on administrative law, said he wouldn’t be surprised if federal agencies are slow-walking the 40-plus ongoing matters involving Musk’s companies. “You’re not just going against Elon Musk. You’re going against Elon Musk who’s puppeteering large swaths of the federal government,” he said, referring to Musk’s sweeping role as a White House adviser for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He added that some individual federal workers may fear for their safety due to Musk’sdocumented patternofsingling outpeople for criticism on his massive social media platform even if they’re largely unknown. And while other Republican presidents have also loosened environmental rules or labor law enforcement, Michaels said this time is different because of Musk’s personal involvement in taking a chainsaw to the federal government. “The administrative state as we traditionally understand it will be incapacitated,” he said. The moves may help Musk’s companies avoid potential fines for alleged violations of federal law. At stake is more than $2 billion in potential liability, plus workplace changes that Musk could have to make if he loses those regulatory fights, according to arecent report by Senate Democrats. Some agencies have also helped Musk’s businesses by relaxing written regulations. Last month, the Transportation Departmentlowered the thresholdfor self-driving car companies including Tesla to report safety incidents, and this week, the Federal Aviation Administration granted permission for SpaceX to perform 25 launches per year of its massive Starship,a fivefold increase, despite impacts on the environment andair travel. Regulators’ new hands-off approach is one of the most tangible rewards for Musk and potentially other business executives after many of them threw their support behind Trump’s campaign last year to regain the White House. Musk, the world’s wealthiest person, spent around$290 millionto help Trump and fellow Republicans and has served as a White House adviser to Trump since January. Musk has said he plans to largely return to the tech world over the next few weeks. Musk isn’t the only beneficiary of Trump’s actions. The Trump administration has also dropped regulatory matters against other corporations, including a Clean Air Act case against aLouisiana rubber factory, consumer protection actions againstfinancial services companiesand lawsuits againstcryptocurrency firms. Trump has also moved forward with action that Musk has directly lobbied against, like tariffs, which would have potentially negative impacts on his businesses. Asked for comment about the Trump administration’s handling of Musk-related regulatory matters, White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement: “All administration officials will comply with conflict of interest requirements.” Musk and Musk’s companies did not respond to requests for comment on the handling of regulatory matters involving his business empire. Musk’s allies have argued since 2023 or earlier that he had beenunfairly targetedfor regulatory actions by the Biden administration, even though Musk’s companies maintained and won large government contracts under President Joe Biden. The changing regulatory environment comes as Musk stands to benefit in other ways from the new administration, including potentially new or expanded contracts forhis satellite internet service Starlinkand forhis rocket service SpaceX. Reuters reported last month that SpaceX is a front-runner to help buildTrump’s “Golden Dome”missile defense shield, a systemto stop hostile missilesaimed at the country. One regulatory matter involving Tesla ended on Trump’s first full day back in office. Trump signedan executive order Jan. 21halting the operations of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, an agency within the Labor Department that reviewed government contractors to ensure they followed civil rights laws. Tesla wasamong 2,000 contractorson a listfor scheduled audits. (The audits are not entirely random; the office said it chose contractorsbased on several criteriaincluding employee head count.) Without mentioning Tesla in particular, Trump said such audits diminished the importance of individual merit in hiring. The new head of the office, named on March 24, is a lawyerwho previously represented SpaceXin a labor dispute. On Feb. 24, an administrative complaint filed against SpaceX in 2023, during the Biden administration, was dismissed by the Department of Justice, according to afiling in federal courtshortly after the dismissal. The complaint alleged that SpaceX discriminated against refugees in hiring, a claim thatSpaceX denied. SpaceX had countersued, saying the DOJ’s system of administrative law judges violated the Constitution. SpaceX agreed to drop its countersuit Feb. 28. In a statement to NBC News, Harmeet Dhillon, Trump’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, said the DOJ dismissed the case due to multiple factors including the SpaceX countersuit. “The Biden Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division initiated this action and SpaceX won an injunction to stop the ongoing proceeding. Based on a review of all of the factors, including the pending injunction and constitutional challenge to the original proceeding, the Civil Rights Division made the decision that the most appropriate course of action was to dismiss the complaint,” Dhillon said. Musk had long called the DOJ’s case political, and he said SpaceX hadreceived conflicting guidancefrom other federal regulators about hiring nonpermanent residents. A third case involves the National Labor Relations Board and has been pending since 2022, when SpaceX says it fired several employees for sending an open letter to co-workers about working conditions. The NLRB, newly under Trump’s control, said ina court filingon April 23 that it was interested in “potentially settling the legal disputes currently pending between the NLRB and SpaceX” and it asked a federal appeals court to pause its proceedings entirely while discussions continue. On Monday,the appeals court agreed. The NLRB did not respond to a request for comment on why it changed course. SpaceX hasdefended firing the employees, saying they caused a disruption and violated several corporate policies. Tom Moline, one of the fired SpaceX employees, said in an interview that he is concerned about new conflicts of interest at the NLRB. “They’re meant to be independent from both workers and employers,” he said. “Anyone could see that there’s conflicts of interest there, in my opinion,” he added. “We’ve seen DOGE employees planting themselves at all these federal agencies.” The NLRB is one of the many offices where DOGE has been active. A security specialist has alleged that DOGEcaused a data breach there, a claim the labor board has denied. The decisions to drop the regulatory actionsfulfill the predictionsof experts last year who said Musk’s companies would likely benefit under Trump’s regulators, and the changed landscape means that when Musk turns his attention back to his tech companies, he’ll operate with fewer constraints than before. Musk saidon a Tesla earnings callon April 22 that his time commitment to DOGE would “drop significantly” starting in May as he allocated more of his time to Tesla. Cary Coglianese, a law professor and the director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Program on Regulation, said Musk is not alone among business executives who are benefiting from Trump’s regulators. “This is an administration that’s slowing down enforcement processes across the board. So, is he getting special treatment? Or is he getting just the kind of relaxed regulatory scrutiny that any business might enjoy under the Trump administration? That’s a hard question to answer,” he said. But he added that the pattern is suspicious if it holds, and he said Musk hasn’t navigated ethical questions the way past White House advisers have. Musk has kept his private sector roles, including as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, while serving as a “special government employee.” That’s a category of temporary federal worker that includes many more people than just Musk, although unlike with others, there’s no evidence that Muskhas filed paperworkoutlining the steps he’s taken to avoid conflicts of interest. “As a citizen, I have to say it looks like there might be some special treatment, and as a citizen, I should probably be worried about even the appearance of special treatment,” Coglianese said. “We should hold those who are having influence over government policy to very high standards, and as long as he has ownership stake and managerial control of companies that are being investigated by or benefiting from the work of government agencies, it certainly is, if nothing else, the appearance of illegitimacy,” he said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in aprevious statement to NBC News: “For concerns regarding conflicts of interest between Elon Musk and DOGE, President Trump has stated he will not allow conflicts, and Elon himself has committed to recusing himself from potential conflicts.” Beyond those three cases, there are more lawsuits and investigations where the Trump administration has neither dismissed the matter nor taken recent action on it, andSenate Democratssay they fear those matters will go dormant even while not technically closed. And there are dozens of lawsuits and investigations where Trump has fired the people who were running them, making it more likely those probes will go into hibernation. Musk and his companies faced dozens of investigations and lawsuits by federal agencies as of January, according to research by Democrats on theSenate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. In a report last month, they estimated that Musk and his companies faced at least $2.37 billion in potential liability if all the investigations and lawsuits resulted in enforcement, not including intangible costs such as being forced to change labor practices. “The truth is that the breathtaking scope and scale of benefits Mr. Musk is gaining from his present position may never be known, and that is by design,” the Democratic researchers said in their report. Many of the cases “could quietly disappear,” the report said, with investigations potentially “dismissed without explanation, deferred indefinitely, or resolved in any number of ways that prioritize Mr. Musk’s private interests over that of public accountability.” Of the 11 federal agencies that Senate Democratic researchers identified as investigating Musk’s companies as of January, most of themsuch as the Federal Aviation Administrationhave suffered cutbacks from Musk’s DOGE. Trump’s budget blueprint released earlier this month couldportend further cuts. In January, Trumpfired the inspector generalof the Agriculture Department, Phyllis Fong. One of the investigations her office had been working on was a probe of Neuralink, Musk’s brain science startup, for carrying out experiments in ways that allegedly caused suffering and unnecessary death for animals,according to Reuters. It’s unclear if that investigation is ongoing, and the USDA IG’s office did not respond to a request for comment. A lawyer for Fong also did not respond to a request for comment. Neuralinkhas said thatit’s “committed to working with animals in the most humane and ethical way possible.” The startup did not respond to a request for comment on Fong’s firing. Trump and Musk’s DOGE have attemptedto drastically downsizethe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is charged with protecting Americans from financial fraud. The bureau has received more than 100 complaints about Tesla over the past year, mostly related to vehicle leases or loans offered or issued by Tesla, and it still had about 30 open or unresolved complaints about Tesla as of last week, according tothe CFPB website. The CFPB did not respond to a request for comment on what happens to those complaints now. A federal appeals courthas pausedTrump’s CFPB mass firings for now. Musk has called for ending the CFPB entirely,posting in Februaryon X: “CFPB RIP” with a gravestone emoji. Trump has attempted to remove two Democratic members of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which polices discrimination in hiring. It’s unclear whether those moves could disrupt a lawsuit filed by the EEOC in 2023 against Tesla over alleged racial harassment at a factory in Fremont, California. A hearing in that lawsuit is scheduled for June, and Trump’s authority to fire EEOC commissioners without cause is alsobeing challenged in court. An EEOC spokesperson declined to comment on whether there were any settlement talks. Trump has appointed new leadership to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and it’s unclear what changes they may make to matters involving Musk’s companies. The SECsued Musk personallyin January, six days before Biden left office, alleging that he failed to disclose in 2022 that he had bought up more than 5% of Twitter stock and therefore kept prices “artificially low,” according to the SEC. Musk isscheduled to filea response to the lawsuit in court in June. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment on whether there were any settlement talks.",

    "title": "Here's the biggest news you missed this weekend",
    "article_text": "The White House on Sundaytouted a “China trade deal”— without providing details — after two top U.S. officials alluded to a potential agreement with China following talks between the two countries in Switzerland over the weekend. “U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva,” read theWhite House’s headlinefor a transcript of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer’s remarks to reporters. Bessent and Greer had struck an optimistic tone regarding the state of a potential trade agreement with China, noting that the administration would provide additional details on Monday. While Greer referred to an “agreement” and “deal,” neither official provided details. China has not yet publicly weighed in on whether the two countries have struck a deal. “I’m happy to report that we made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks,” Bessent told reporters, adding that “the talks were productive.” Hamasagreed to release Edan Alexander, a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen believed to be the last living U.S. citizen who remains captive in Gaza, weeks after saying it had lost contact with the group holding him hostage. His release is part of “the steps being taken to achieve a ceasefire, open the crossings, and allow aid,” Khalil al-Hayya, head of Hamas’ negotiating team, said in a statement. Al-Hayya did not provide information on Alexander’s condition. Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, confirmed the agreement to NBC News and said he is traveling to Israel to secure Alexander’s release. The news comes as disagreements on how to approach the situation in Gaza, as well as on Iran, have ledto tension between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to two U.S. officials, two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge. While Netanyahu wants to continue a military approach, Trump sees an opportunity to make a deal with a now-weakened Iran, the sources told NBC News. Top Trump adviser Stephen Miller on Friday said the administration is “looking at” ways to end due process protections for unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. When asked whether he would supportsuspending habeas corpus for undocumented immigrants, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., dodged the questions, ultimately telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press” he did not think the issue would come before Congress. Meanwhile, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., spoke aboutthe state of the Democratic Partyfollowing the 2024 election. Klobuchar reflected on Joe Biden suspending his re-election campaign last year and endorsing Kamala Harris just months before the election. “Yes, we would have been served better by a primary. But we are where we are,” Klobuchar said. “I’m not interested in going backwards in time. I’m interested in going forward.” Once the Sistine Chapel’s doors are sealed, cardinals attending the conclave swear an oath of “absolute and perpetual secrecy,” as do all Vatican staff assisting them, including cooks, cleaners and drivers. But therehave since been some clues from insidersas to how a relatively obscure American Augustinian, who was not widely discussed ahead of the event, moved minds and ended up as pope. Cardinal Wilton Gregory said that “a lot of dialogue occurred at mealtime, coffee breaks, those moments when you can engage in smaller groups,” hinting that it was in these moments that Cardinal Robert Prevost, soon to become Leo, thrived. “It wasn’t that he stood up and made this overwhelmingly convincing speech that just wowed,” said Gregory. “I don’t remember any particular intervention, but I do believe he engaged quite effectively in the smaller group conversations.” This wasn’t our first rodeo. We’ve been through this 268 times. The conclavethat saw Pope Leo XIV unexpectedly emergeas the new leader of the Catholic Church ended after just 33 hours of deliberation. Egg prices are stabilizingafter asharp run-up earlier this year, but grocery shoppers are already getting used to shelling out more for those and other pantry staples. After peaking at $6.55 in mid-March, a dozen eggs sold for an average of $5.45 nationwide as of the week ending April 19, according to the latest data available from the market research firm NIQ. Theongoing declineis welcome news for consumers, but it comes amid higher prices for a number of pantry staples even as inflation overall has cooled. And it isn’t just eggs: Many shoppers are bracing to pay more for groceries overall as they shift focus toward covering essentials. Many are now planning to trim their spending this summer on everything from clothing and furniture to travel, according to a survey the consulting firm KPMG released in late April. Groceries were one of just two categories where shoppers said they expect to spend more.",

    "title": "Black college seniors graduating into soft labor market and reduced DEI practices",
    "article_text": "Howard University senior Dezmond Rosier had his sights set on the federal government to begin his career. The 22-year-old, who graduated this month with a bachelor’s degree in political science and an economics minor, planned to apply to the Department of Education, butcuts to the department’s workforceand the Trump administration’s efforts to ditch anything related to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives prompted him to change course. Rosier, a first-generation college student, said President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to dismantle the Department of Education and his moves to put the plan in motion once he entered the White House left him feeling “discouraged.” Rosier is one of four Black students who spoke with NBC News about graduating into a job market that has seen DEI rollbacks, less outward enthusiasm for recruiting Black workers and signs of a cooldown in hiring for everyone. New college graduates’ unemployment rate was 5.8% as of March, up from 4.6% a year earlier, the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorkreported last week. Walter Pearson, the CEO of College Bound Parenting, an organization that helps Black college students prepare for jobs, said most years he is able to help 90% of the small group of students he works with land their first job. This year, it’s just 50%. Meanwhile, most of the students who spoke to NBC News said they are graduating without job offers and feel uncertain about a future in which they may be overlooked for jobs without specific guardrails in place. “I can’t really be a part of something that I don’t feel that I’m wanted in,” Rosier said. “So I definitely want to be in a position in which I’m wanted, not where I’m tolerated.” He plans to leverage his experiences in local and state government by working in grassroots politics in his home state of Maryland. This includes his role as a member of theMaryland Democratic Central Committee, where he will focus on next year’s gubernatorial election. New grads are entering atougher job market than those who graduated last year, but even those who did secure internships or jobs told NBC News that DEI rollbacks still weigh on them. “DEI has been politicized in a way to mean if you’re Black, you don’t deserve a job,” said a Syracuse University student who asked not to be named for fear of professional repercussions. The student said he secured a summer internship, but is assessing job opportunities for afterward. While his internship’s company has stated commitments to diversity and inclusion in the job listing, he said he wouldn’t be surprised if these sorts of explicit statements disappeared, followed by actual support for Black workers. Beyond post-college jobs, funding cuts have made potential research projects for new grads slim. Grey Snyder, 26, a senior at the University of Missouri at Columbia studying psychology, witnessed these impacts firsthand. Snyder, who uses they/them pronouns, said they tried to secure a lab position for their gap year, but was told that grant funding was so “up in the air” due to Trump’s executive order on DEI that the position was not guaranteed. Across social media and among the students who spoke to NBC News, several said they had peers and friends who lost out on internships or research opportunities because of cuts like these. “It’s really affecting psychological sciences specifically, though, and any research about minorities or underprivileged populations,” Snyder said. “It’s really hard to study the people who need the most studying right now.” If Snyder does not land a research coordinator role at a cognitive neuroscience lab they applied to, they plan to return to a paraprofessional job at an elementary school similar to one they previously had. For academics and professionals alike, Daniel Catalan, a professional résumé writer, said he’d advise students to consider avoidingcertain words that may be red flagsunder Trump’s DEI directives, including “Black,” “BIPOC” and “DEI.” Victoria Pearson, a senior at Howard University studying media, journalism and film communications, laughed at the idea of omitting her school from her résumé just because it’s a historically Black university. Pearson, 22, said she had a conversation with a friend who said they would decline to answer certain questions on an application to avoid being characterized. She disagreed with the move. “I’m not going to change anything,” Pearson said. “I want to be where I’m wanted.” The senior at Syracuse said he will also keep all of his accomplishments on his résumé, including his membership with the National Association of Black Journalists. “I think it should be valued,” he said. “Don’t think it’s not valued just because it has the word Black in front of it.” Louise Ross is a director of internships, scholarships and mentorships with college prep community and coaching platformCollege Bound Parenting. Having worked as a chief of human resources for 30 years, she advises students to be innovative in their job search. Ross urges students to tap into entrepreneurial skill sets, partner with community organizations, contact alumni and leverage connections to the Divine Nine network of Black fraternities and sororities. “We’ve survived worse things,” Ross said. “These kids survived Covid. They certainly can survive D, E and I.”",

    "title": "Zepbound beats Wegovy for weight loss in first head-to-head trial of blockbuster drugs",
    "article_text": "People taking Eli Lilly’s obesity drug,Zepbound,lost nearly 50% more weight than those using rival Novo Nordisk’sWegovyin the first head-to-head study of the blockbuster medications. Clinical trial participants who took tirzepatide, the drug sold as Zepbound, lost an average of 50 pounds (22.8 kilograms) over 72 weeks, while those who took semaglutide, or Wegovy, lost about 33 pounds (15 kilograms). That’s according to the study funded by Lilly, which waspublished Sundayin the New England Journal of Medicine. Both drugs are part of a new class of medications that work by mimicking hormones in the gut and brain thatregulate appetite and feelings of fullness.But tirzepatide targets two such hormones, known as GLP-1 and GIP, while semaglutide targets GLP-1 alone, said Dr. Louis Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine. “Two drugs together can produce better weight loss,” said Aronne, who led the study and presented the findings Sunday at the European Congress on Obesity in Spain. While tirzepatide won out in what Aronne said many view as “a drag race of efficacy,” both are important tools for treating obesity, which affects about40% of American adults. “The point of these medications is to improve health,” he said. “The majority of people won’t need the most effective medication.” The trial included 751 people from across the U.S. who were overweight or had obesity and at least one other weight-related health problem, but not diabetes. Participants received weekly injections of the highest tolerated doses of Zepbound, either 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, or Wegovy, 1.7 milligrams or 2.4 milligrams. By the end of the trial, those who took Zepbound lost about 20% of their body weight on average, compared with a nearly 14% loss for those who took Wegovy. The tirzepatide group trimmed about 7 inches (17.8 centimeters) from their waist circumference, compared to about 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) with semaglutide. In addition, nearly 32% of people taking Zepbound lost at least a quarter of their body weight, compared to about 16% of those taking Wegovy, the study found. Weight loss was about 6% lower in men than in women in both groups, the authors noted. As participants in both groups lost more weight, they saw improvements in health markers such as blood pressure, blood fat and blood sugar levels. More than three-quarters of patients taking both drugs reported at least one side effect, mostly mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, constipation, diarrhea and vomiting. About 6% of participants taking Zepbound left the trial because of adverse events, compared with 8% of those taking semaglutide. The GLP-1 drugs have become increasingly popular, with at least 1 in 8 U.S. adults reporting their use, according to a 2024 survey by KFF, a independent health policy research organization. Zepbound generated $4.9 billion in global sales last year. Wegovy brought in nearly $8.8 billion (58.2 billlion Danish kroner). Access and affordability have limited wider use of the drugs. Tirzepatide and semaglutide were removed recently from a list of drug shortages by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Both manufacturers recently released programs that cut costs to about $500 per month or less, depending on the dose. Other factors can affect access. This week, CVS Health saidWegovy will become the preferred optionon its standard formulary, orlist of covered drugs, as of July 1. Zepbound will be excluded. It’s important to have a range of drugs to treat a disease as widespread as obesity in the U.S., said Dr. Angela Fitch, chief medical officer of knownwell, an obesity care company. Wegovy has been found to cut the risk of serious heart problems by 20%, she noted. A drug may work well for one patient, but not for others. “We’re going to need to use them all just because we have so many patients who need treatment,” she added.",

    "article_text": "At least 10 people have been hospitalized in California and Nevada following alisteriaoutbreak under investigation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FDA said in areleaseSaturday. Ready-to-eat foods produced by Fresh & Ready Foods LLC of San Fernando, California, are being voluntarily recalled, according to thecompany. More than 80products are included in the recall, ranging from snack boxes to sandwiches and pastas. The recalled products have best-by dates between April 22 and May 19 and brand names Fresh & Ready Foods, City Point Market Fresh Food to Go and Fresh Take Crave Away. The recalled products were distributed throughout Arizona, California, Nevada and Washington at various locations including hospitals, hotels, corporate offices, convenience stores, airports and airlines. “FDA and CDC began investigating this cluster in 2024, however, there was not enough evidence in the previous investigation to identify a source for the outbreak,” the FDA said. “The investigation was reopened in April 2025 after FDA investigators found listeria in environmental samples collected from Fresh & Ready Foods, LLC during a routine surveillance inspection.” The agencies used whole genome sequencing to match the strain of listeria found at Fresh & Ready Foods with the outbreak causing illnesses. “Fresh & Ready Foods has taken immediate corrective actions including removing equipment to address this issue to ensure ongoing food safety and compliance with FDA guidance,” the company said in a release. Of the 10 known illnesses, eight of the hospitalizations occurred in California and two in Nevada. Symptoms of listeriosis, or a listeria infection, typically begin within two weeks of eating contaminated food, but can start anywhere from the day of consumption to 10 weeks later, the FDA said. Retailers and consumers who purchased or received the recalled products are advised by the FDA to clean and sanitize any areas they may have touched, as listeria can spread easily to other foods and surfaces. At-risk groups, including pregnant women and newborns, people age 65 or over and those with weakened immune systems, are encouraged by the FDA to contact a health care professional if symptoms begin, such as fever, nausea, muscle aches, vomiting or diarrhea.",

    "title": "Hamas says it will release hostage Edan Alexander in agreement with U.S.",
    "article_text": "Hamas agreed to releaseEdan Alexander, a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen believed to be the last living U.S. citizen who remains captive in Gaza,weeks after saying it had lost contactwith the group holding him hostage. His release is part of “the steps being taken to achieve a ceasefire, open the crossings, and allow aid,” Khalil al-Hayya, head of Hamas’ negotiating team, said in a statement Sunday. Al-Hayya did not provide information on Alexander’s condition. Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, confirmed the agreement to NBC News and said he is traveling to Israel to secure Alexander’s release. “We are picking him up probably tomorrow,” Witkoff said. “There was a long negotiation with lots of people to thank.” He went on to describe this as a gesture of goodwill toward President Donald Trump, adding that it is a big moment “in large part” because of Trump. “The family is ecstatic,” Witkoff said. In a post to his Truth Social account, the president said he hopes Alexander's release signifies a step toward ending the war between Israel and Hamas. \"I am grateful to all those involved in making this monumental news happen,\" Trumpwrote. \"This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.\" The Hostage Family Forum released a statement on behalf of Alexander's family confirming that they were informed of the agreement. They are \"in ongoing contact with the U.S. administration\" regarding his potential release in the coming days.​ Alexander was serving in the Israel Defense Forces when he was taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023, along with roughly 250 others. Hamaspreviously agreed to release Alexander in Marchalong with the bodies of four other dual nationals. But weeks later the militant group said it lost contact with group holding him. At the time, Hamas blamed the issue on Israeli strikes that hit the area where Alexander was allegedly being held. Hamas and Israel agreed to a temporary ceasefire in January, which led to the release of hostages in exchange for freeing Palestinians in Israeli custody. It also saw an influx of aid for Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip. But the fragile ceasefire fell apart inMarch after negotiations stalled on how to expand the pausein hostilities into a sustainable end to the war. Al-Hayya added on Sunday that Hamas was ready to negotiate \"and exert serious efforts to reach a final agreement to end the war.\" Gaza's future is unclear afterIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced last weekthat the country's security Cabinet approved a plan to capture the entire enclave. Under this plan, more than 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza would be \"moved\" out of the strip as Israel's military launched operations to defeat Hamas. This plan was made public after a full-blown blockade on aid into the strip by Israel reached its third month. Representatives for the United Nations and Palestinians accused Israel of usingaid as a \"weapon of war\" at the International Court of Justicelast month. Disagreements on how to approach the situation in Gaza as well as Iran has ledto tension between Trump and Netanyahu, according to two U.S. officials, two Middle Eastern diplomats and two other people with knowledge. While Netanyahu wants to continue a military approach, Trump sees an opportunity to make a deal with a now-weakened Iran, the sources told NBC News. Netanyahudenied the reports on Sunday, insisting in a video on X that his relationship with Trump was \"excellent.\" He added that the two allies see \"eye-to-eye on almost everything.\"",

    "title": "How to navigate Newark airport amid delays and outages",
    "article_text": "Anotherground stop at Newark Liberty Internationalleft travelers facing a new wave of cancellations and hourslong delays at the New Jersey airport on Sunday. This disruption follows weeks of chaos marked byair traffic communication issuesandstaffing shortages. While waiting areas, makeshift chairs and benches were emptier this weekend compared to the crowds of stranded passengers last week, outages on bothFridayand Sunday left travelers grappling with the lingering effects. Akash Gupta had his travel plans completely upended on Saturday when his flight to Indianapolis was delayed six hours. He passed the time chatting with his wife over a video call and doodling on some paper. “I’m comfortable with flying, but I’m experiencing this kind of delay for the first time,” Gupta told NBC News. The first action delayed passengers should take is to look for alternative flights, advises Sean Cudahy, a senior aviation reporter for travel website The Points Guy. When checking for alternatives, he recommends not to wait for the perfect solution. “If you see even a halfway decent option, grab it, book it, and a lot of time the airline will let you keep making changes,” Cudahy said. To contact an airline for rebooking or to explore more options, airline apps or live chat functions are often more efficient than waiting in long customer service lines. NBC News aviation analyst John Cox recommends the flight-tracking appFlightyfor real-time updates. Cox recommends taking advantage of frequent flyer perks. Many airlines have agents dedicated to rebooking frequent flyers, making them easier to reach. “From a passenger standpoint, it’s understand what you want,” Cox said. “Be polite, be nice, but understand that you need to get your business taken care of and let the agent move on to somebody to help somebody else.” The Department of Transportationruled last yearthat airlines are required to quickly give cash refunds to passengers with canceled or severely delayed flights. The refunds, however, only apply to passengers who book with a different airline or opt for another mode of travel, not to those who accept a rebooking with the original airline. Travelers should also review the airline’s rebooking and refund policies in advance, said a spokesperson for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the Newark airport. “We originally were supposed to come here on United today, but it was canceled about five or six days ago, and they did refund our money,” said Judy Davenport, who was traveling through Newark this weekend. She and her husband ended up booking a separate Delta flight to make their connection to Paris. While waiting out a delay at Newark, travelers have several options for passing time or grabbing a bite to eat before the security lines. Each terminal at the airport offers seating for passengers before and after their TSA screening. “Go early and get your seat, get food, but then move on,” Cox tells delayed travelers, encouraging them to let others have access to the amenities as well. He also advises to be cautious of alcohol consumption in a high-stress environment. Travelers scheduled to fly into or out of Newark in the coming weeks can take proactive steps to manage their flight plans. United Airlines, one of the most affected carriers at Newark with hundreds of canceled flights, is offering waivers for change fees or fare differences through May 23, with the option to fly through LaGuardia Airport in New York City or Philadelphia instead. Cudahy warns that other airports will offer fewer flight options than United’s Newark hub. Alaska Airlineshas flexible travel policies covering original travel dates through Sunday, andJetBlueis offering waivers through the end of May. To prepare for a delay, Cox advises packing necessary medication, one night’s worth of clothes and toiletries in a carry-on bag in case luggage is disrupted and checked bags end up in another location. Cudahy also suggests bringing extra batteries and chargers, an empty reusable water bottle to minimize food court costs and games or entertainment if traveling with young children. The experts also remind travelers to follow the 3-1-1 rule for easier passage through security: 3.4-ounce liquid containers in one clear quart-sized bag, with one bag per passenger. Having proper documentation ready to present, especially with newREALIDrequirements, will help streamline the process, Cox said. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” Sunday that while Newark is facing telecom issues and experiencing glitches in the software, it will be “up and running in short order.” Duffy said Newark will experience “reduced capacity” in the coming weeks, a move that United CEO Scott Kirby hasopenly calledfor. For those planning to book travel out of Newark soon, Cudahy advises looking for direct flights. “If you’re nonstop, you are going to get there eventually, as long as your flight doesn’t get canceled,” Cudahy said. Cudahy recommends using a credit card thatincludes travel insuranceto purchase plane tickets. If travelers face delays or cancellations, they can get reimbursed for expenses like meals or hotel rooms caused by travel disruptions. While many airlines offer their own insurance, it typically does not cover circumstances outside of the airline’s control, such as weather or air traffic control-related issues. Cudahy suggests looking at the airline’s insurance policy to see what is covered, and then shopping around with third-party travel insurers to compare costs. Duffy reassured travelers that flying out of Newark — and in American airspace in general — remains safe. There are policies and procedures in place for dealing with such incidents. But he does have concerns about the antiquated technology and systems used. The recent aviation troubles have prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to release athree-year planto modernize the system. “We’re seeing stress on an old network, and it’s time to fix it,” Duffy said.",

    "article_text": "Houston Astros pitcher Lance McCullers Jr. said he’s been receiving death threats directed at both himself and his children after Saturday’s loss against the Cincinnati Reds. McCullers, who says he became a target of harassment from baseball fans after he allowed seven runs during a 10-run first inning,told reportersafter the game that people have been sending threats to him about his performance, with some implying that they would seek to harm his two young daughters. “I understand people are very passionate and people love the Astros and love sports, but threatening to find my kids and murder them is a little bit tough to deal with just as a father, I think,” McCullers said. McCullers, 31, had recently returned to the field for his second major league start after missing the last two MLB seasons to recover from injuries in his pitching arm. Saturday’s 13-9 loss at Houston’s Daikin Park was his second MLB game and first home game of 2025, marking his return after last pitching in Game 3 of the 2022 World Series. “There have been many, many threats over the years aimed at me, mostly,” McCullers said. “But I think bringing kids into the equation — threatening to find them, or next time they see us in public they’re gonna stab my kids to death, things like that — is tough to hear as a dad.” At a postgame press conference Saturday night, Astros manager Joe Espada expressed his frustration over the death threats, saying he was “really upset” to hear about them. “It is very unfortunate that we have to deal with this,” Espada said. “After all he’s done for this city, for this team, the fact that we have to talk about that in my office — I got kids too, and it really drives me nuts that we have to deal with this. Very sad. Very, very sad.” Espada added that McCullers hadn’t pitched in two and a half years, and that fans should remember he may need some time to adjust. “Come on, we are better than that,” he said. “We are better than this.”",

    "title": "Pope Leo XIV says advancement of AI played a factor in his papal name selection",
    "article_text": "Pope Leo XIV revealed that his papal name was partially inspired by the looming challenges of a world increasingly influenced by artificial intelligence. In his first formal address as theVatican’s newly elected popeon Saturday, Leo told the College of Cardinals that he chose to name himself after Pope Leo XIII, who led the Catholic Church from his election in 1878 to his death in 1903. During his papacy, Leo XIII maintained a dedication to social issues and workers rights after much of the world had just been reshaped by the Industrial Revolution. Though he said there are various reasons for the name he chose, Leo XIV primarily pointed to Leo XIII’s historic encyclical “Rerum Novarum,” also known as “Rights and Duties of Capital and Labor,” which laid a foundation for modern Catholic social teachings. Issued in 1891, the open letter emphasized that “some opportune remedy must be found quickly for the misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class.” “In our own day, the Church offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice and labour,” Leo XIV, previously known as Cardinal Robert Prevost, said inhis addresson Saturday, according to a transcript. Much like the Industrial Revolution, the acceleration of generative AI in recent years has already transformed the world and raised a flurry of concerns over how these new technologies will impact human labor. AI, still unregulated in much of the world, has given rise tomisinformation(including by usingstolen human likenesses) as well as conflicts overintellectual propertyandjob displacement. Francis himself was the subject of AI disinformation in 2023 when an AI-generated image depicting him wearing a trendy puffer jacketwent viral online— one of the first widespread incidents showcasing the potential of AI to mislead and misinform. In a warningissued by Francisearly last year, the pope addressed the potential of AI to push out “partially or completely false narratives,” further cement “echo chambers” and create “new castes based on access to information and thus giving rise to new forms of exploitation and inequality.” Leo, the first pontiff born in the U.S., indicated in his Saturday address that he aims to continue furthering the work of Francis, who was known for his commitment to social justice. “It has been clearly seen in the example of so many of my Predecessors, and most recently by Pope Francis himself, with his example of complete dedication to service and to sober simplicity of life, his abandonment to God throughout his ministry and his serene trust at the moment of his return to the Father’s house,” the transcript said. “Let us take up this precious legacy and continue on the journey, inspired by the same hope that is born of faith.”",

    "title": "Trump administration will accept a luxury jet from Qatar to use as Air Force One",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration is preparing to accept a superluxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar as a gift to be used by President Donald Trump as the new Air Force One for presidential travel until shortly before Trump leaves office, according to four sources familiar with the planning. Two of the sources also confirm that ownership of the plane will be transferred to the Trump presidential library foundation once the president ends his second term. According to one of the sources, the arrangement will be done according to U.S. and international laws, in observance of ethics rules. That official said it will take some time for the plane to be delivered but that the president will discuss the arrangement during his visit to Qatar this week. Another one of the sources said the idea of gifting Trump this specific plane has been under discussion for “quite some time” and that when the formal offer was made more recently, the president “happily accepted.” ABC Newsfirst reportedthe gift. In response to questions about Qatar giving the plane to Trump, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said gifts from foreign governments are accepted following the law. “Any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws,” Leavitt said. “President Trump’s Administration is committed to full transparency.” A White House official tells NBC News that it is true Qatar has offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense, but the gift will not be presented nor accepted this week while Trump is in Qatar. Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar’s media attaché to the U.S., added in a statement, \"The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is currently under consideration between Qatar’s Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense, but the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made.\" Democrats have criticized the Trump administration amid reports about their plans to accept a plane, saying that a gift of this magnitude would need congressional approval. \"Trump must seek Congress’ consent to take this $300 million gift from Qatar. The Constitution is perfectly clear: no present “of any kind whatever” from a foreign state without Congressional permission. A gift you use for four years and then deposit in your library is still a gift (and a grift),\" Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee,wrote in a poston X. Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., called for an investigation into the administration's plans to accept the plane, characterizing it as a \"flying grift\" that is \"the most valuable gift ever conferred on a President by a foreign government.\" \"Rather than enforcing ethics, the Attorney General has affixed the Department of Justice’s seal of approval to a transaction that flagrantly violates both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause,\" Torres wrote in a letter to the head of the Government Accountability Office, the acting Inspector General of the Defense Department and the acting director of the Office of Government Ethics. Axios was thefirst to report on Torres' letter. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer similarly blasted Trump, calling the plane an example of \"foreign influence.\" \"Nothing says 'America First' like Air Force One, brought to you by Qatar. It’s not just bribery, it’s premium foreign influence with extra legroom,\" Schumer, D-N.Y.wrotein a post on X. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., went even further, calling the move \"corrupt\" and \"unconstitutional.\" \"I don’t know who needs to hear this, but NO, Donald Trump cannot accept a $400 million flying palace from the royal family of Qatar. Not only is this farcically corrupt, it is blatantly unconstitutional,\" Sanderswrote. Justice Department officials did not respond to a question from NBC News whether Trump’s acceptance of the plane could violate federal anti-bribery laws or the Constitution’semoluments clausewhich bars the president and other federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign powers without the approval of Congress. ABC News reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi and other DOJ lawyers had determined that the acceptance of the plane was legally permissible if the Qatari government gifts it to the Defense Department and it is later turned over to the Trump Library Foundation. A former senior DOJ official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that for the jet gift to violate federal laws barring the payment of bribes or gratuities to officials, the gift would have to be motivated by corrupt intent. “Bribery requires a corrupt intent to influence an official act, i.e., a quid pro quo,” said the former official. Norm Eisen, who served as special assistant to the president for ethics in the Obama administration, said that the gift violated the emoluments clause. Eisen, a longtime critic of Trump’s ethics in office, and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that he is considering whether to challenge the transfer of the 747 in court. “Suffice it to say that I and many others are looking,” said Eisen, who referred to the plane as “emoluments force one.” Eisen said that he believed the plane could not be accepted without the approval of Congress. “I do think there is a violation here. The problem is that you have what is functionally a direct gift to the president,” Eisen added. News of the plane comes ahead of the president’sfirst foreign tripof his second term, in which he will travel to Saudi Arabia this week and also make stops in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. While in Qatar, Trump is expected to deliver a speech and then talk with American troops at the Al Udeid Air Base, according to two U.S. officials. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to accompany Trump during his stop at the base. This is the second time Trump has decided to visit Saudi Arabia for his first foreign trip. He chose the same nation as his first stop in 2017, during his first term.",

    "title": "White House touts 'China trade deal,' but offers no details",
    "article_text": "The White House touted a \"China trade deal\" on Sunday — without providing details — after two top U.S. officials alluded to a potential agreement with China following talks between thetwo countries in Switzerlandover the weekend. \"U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva,\" read theWhite House's headlinefor a transcript of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer's remarks to reporters. Bessent and Greer had struck an optimistic tone regarding the state of a potential trade agreement with China, noting that the administration would provide additional details on Monday. While Greer referred to an \"agreement\" and \"deal,\" neither official provided details. China has not yet publicly weighed in on whether the two countries have struck a deal. “I’m happy to report that we made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks,” Bessent told reporters, adding that “the talks were productive.” During Bessent and Greer's brief remarks — which lasted just over two minutes — Greer appeared to reference an agreement between the two sides as he touted the talks as constructive. “This was, as the secretary pointed out, a very constructive two days,” Greer said. “It’s important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought. That being said, there was a lot of groundwork that went into these two days.” Greer continued, referencing a trade deficit with China and saying that “we’re confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners” would help the U.S. “work toward resolving that national emergency.” In April, Trump declared that “foreign trade and economic practices have created a national emergency.” Vice Premier He Lifeng, who led the delegation of Chinese officials, told reporters on Sunday that \"the meeting achieved substantial progress and reached important consensus.\" The U.S. and China \"agreed on establishing a consultation mechanism for trade and economic issues, identify the lead persons on each side and will carry on further consultations relating to trade and economic issues of their respective concerns,\" he said. \"The two sides will finalize relevant details as soon as possible.\" He said that the two sides would issue a joint statement on Monday. When reached for further details, a White House trade representative referred NBC News to Greer’s comments about being confident in the deal. Bessent said he and Greer spoke with Trump on Saturday and that the president was “fully informed of what is going on.” Heading into the weekend, White House officials indicated they were eager to negotiate, even as they insisted the U.S. would not unilaterally lower the duties without concessions from the Chinese. “I think we’re going to have a good weekend with China,” Trump said during Thursday’s presentation of a preliminary U.K. trade agreement. “De-escalating, bringing those rates down to where they could, where they should be, I think it’s Scott Bessent’s goal,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnicktold CNBC on Friday. “And that’s what the president hopes is a good outcome; it’s a de-escalating world where we go back to each other and then we work on a big deal together.” While Trump has attempted to soften the aggressive posture he demonstrated during his “Liberation Day” speech last month, critics say the new approach has instead been marked by uncertainty and half-measures. Analysts with the Capital Economics consultancy pointed to the preliminary agreement announced by the U.S. and the U.K. on Thursday as evidence of “Trump’s desperation to show progress on trade.” “The ‘full and comprehensive’ trade deal between the US and the UK announced in a rush today by President Donald Trump and PM Keir Starmer is no such thing,” the analysts wrote in a note to clients shortly after the agreement was announced. “As Trump admitted in his press conference, the ‘final details’ still need to be ‘written up in the coming weeks.’” The dizzying trend continued Friday, when Trump posted on social media that reducing tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 80% “seems right,” only to have White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt say later in the day that the figure was simply one the president “threw out there.” Bessent has previously characterized Trump’s approach as “strategic uncertainty.” And in a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump called the agreement with the U.K. “AMAZING for both Countries,” saying the parent of British Airways had ordered $10 billion worth of new Boeing planes, though officials with the airline’s parent company, IAG,have saidthe order did not come about as a result of the trade negotiations. “We’re going to make a fortune with Tariffs, only smart people understand that,” Trump wrote. The U.S. tariff rate on China climbed to 145% last month, after the president signed an executive order imposing 125% duties on all imports from that nation on top of 20% duties imposed at the outset of his second term in response to China’s alleged inaction on fentanyl flows. China, in turn,responded with 125% duties on imports from the U.S.while sharply condemning the Trump administration’s tariff actions and saying it would no longer engage in retaliatory increases. China may have already found a way to get around the 145% duties. On Friday, it released data that showed its exports had climbed 8.1% year over year in April amid a surge in shipments to other Southeast Asian nations. That’s an indication that China may simply be using a trans-shipment strategy to circumvent the duties,experts told CNBC. It is too soon to say whether fears of shortages on U.S. shelves will come to fruition, but the logistics group Flexportreportedlast week that Pacific Ocean carriers were withdrawing capacity “at faster rates than COVID” in anticipation of reduced demand.",

    "title": "Here's what U.S. Catholics are saying about the election of Pope Leo XIV",
    "article_text": "By Joe Hernandez Parishioners pray during a mass at Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago on Sunday.Nam Y. Huh/APhide caption When Catholics across the U.S. attended Sunday services this weekend, it was the first time in history they had done so with an American pope sitting in the Vatican. On Thursday, the College of Cardinals selectedChicago-bornRobert Prevost to lead the church of some 1.4 billion adherents worldwide. He took thename Pope Leo XIV. Some U.S. Catholics took particular pride in the election of the first American pontiff, who has familial ties to multiple places across the country. On Sunday, New Orleans resident Meaghan Gibson said Pope Leo seems \"very down to Earth\" and that she was excited by his election — even more because members of his family once lived in the city. \"The fact that his family comes from New Orleans is amazing,\" Gibson, 37, told NPR member station WWNO's Rosemary Westwood. \"Hopefully he will grace us with his presence sometime during his papacy.\" Leo's grandparents Joseph and Louise Martinez lived in New Orleans before moving to Chicago sometime between 1910 and 1912,according to the Historic New Orleans Collection. Their home sat on a plot of land that was later taken to build a highway, the museum and research center discovered. \"So possibly if that had not been built, the family might've still been here,\" Gibson said. \"It's very amazing to see that happen and know his grandparents got married just down the street from our home church.\" Angie Spencer, who was attending services at St. Mary of the Purification Catholic Church in Houston on Sunday, told The Texas Newsroom's Lucio Vasquez that there's a lot of enthusiasm surrounding the election of the first American pontiff. \"I have a little grandson. He just told me in church today, 'You know what, grandma? I'm going to be a priest and then I'm going to be a bishop and then I'm going to be a pope,'\" Spencer said. \"Even he's catching onto it.\" She said she hoped Leo would continue some of the work of his predecessor, Pope Francis, such as reaching out to the poor and trying to unify people across the world. Spencer, who is 74, said with a laugh that she's \"seen a lot of popes!\" She added: \"Pope Francis I loved, and Pope Leo will follow right along in his footsteps and do even greater things.\" At Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago on Sunday, people took selfies in front of a billboard congratulating Pope Leo — a city native — on his papal election,according to Chicago Public Media's Jake Wittich. Chicago resident Sara Schroeder said it was a historic moment for the country and for the city. \"Mass was beautiful,\" Schroeder said. \"The priest was very happy about Pope Leo. People were cheering that he's from Chicago, and people would clap anytime that was mentioned.\" Schroeder's daughter, Caitlin Thigpen, added: \"It's like he's the hometown hero.\" On Thursday, the evening mass at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, D.C., turned into a thanksgiving for the new pope, WAMU's Jackson Sinnenberg reported. \"As he begins his pontificate,\" said Father Isaac Sagastume, \"may the universal church receive its new pastor with joy and a renewed sense of missionary zeal.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "The U.S. has a plan for getting food into Gaza. Top aid groups object to the idea",
    "article_text": "Daniel Estrin Palestinians wait for donated food at a distribution center in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza Strip, Sunday, March 16, 2025.Abdel Kareem Hana/APhide caption TEL AVIV, Israel — On the eve of President Trump's visit to Arab allies in the Gulf, the U.S. and Israel have announced a plan to allow food and essential supplies back into Gaza after a ten-week Israeli ban that aid workers say is driving rampant hunger in the territory. It is the result of pressure by the Trump administration on Israel to allow aid back into Gaza, according to a person familiar with the details who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal diplomacy. The proposed solution would only provide food and aid to around 60 percent of Gaza's civilians initially, according to a copy of the proposal reviewed by NPR. Key details remain unresolved, like who would run it or pay for it. The program is an about-face from Israel's earlier policy to withhold aid to pressure Hamas to free Israeli hostages. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee says Israel is fully on board with the new proposal. \"President Trump has made very clear that one of the most urgent things that needs to happen is humanitarian aid into Gaza, and he has tasked all of his team to do everything possible to accelerate that and to as expeditiously as possible get humanitarian aid in, to the people,\" said Huckabee in a press conference Friday. Palestinians walk next to the closed humanitarian aid distribution center of UNRWA, the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees in Jabaliya, Gaza Strip on Tuesday, April 29, 2025.Jehad Alshrafi/APhide caption Gaza's population would be forced to move south in order to receive aid in a new zone cordoned off by Israel's military, to prevent Hamas members from access, an Israeli defense official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity to divulge details. According to a 14-page proposal reviewed by NPR, a private charity recently registered in Switzerland called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation would establish four aid distribution sites and hand out pre-packaged food, hygiene kits and medical supplies. Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Saar, publicly endorsed the U.S. plan Sunday and called on countries and aid groups to cooperate. \"It will enable aid to go directly to the people. Hamas must not be allowed to get their hands on it,\" Saar said. Israeli soldiers \"will not allocate aid. They will secure the perimeter.\" Israel says Hamas has taken advantage of aid deliveries, seizing supplies, profiting from black market sales, and using aid distribution to assert its control of Gaza. U.N. officials say there is no large-scale diversion of aid in Gaza. \"The aid we coordinate goes to the people for whom it's intended,\" said Olga Cherevko of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \"We have mechanisms in place that help mitigate this, including monitoring during and after distribution, hotlines to report incidents and our accountability to donors.\" Israel says it will first wait for Trump to finish his trip this week to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, to allow the chance for a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas. If no deal emerges by then, Israel vows to begin to roll out this plan, combined with intensified military ground operations and the seizure of more territory in Gaza. Palestinians receive humanitarian aid distributed by UNRWA, the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees in Jabaliya, Gaza Strip on Wednesday, April 9, 2025.Jehad Alshrafi/APhide caption According to the written proposal, the four initial aid distribution sites would serve a combined total of 1.2 million Palestinians. That is only about 60 percent of the estimated 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza. Huckabee said the aid distribution would be scaled up to serve larger populations. The main aid organizations working in Gaza are refusing to cooperate with the proposal, as presented by Israeli officials to the U.N. and its aid partners. Humanitarian groups say they cannot work with a program that refuses aid to anyone seeking it, even belligerents. \"It contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic — as part of a military strategy,\" the United Nations and its aid partners in Gaza said in ajoint statement. \"We will not participate in any scheme that does not adhere to the global humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality.\" The U.S. says it is still in talks with aid professionals to finalize who would run the program. Huckabee said he did not have the details on who would fund the program, but cited some contributors who wish to remain unnamed. Palestinians receive bags of flour and other humanitarian aid distributed by UNRWA, the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees in Jabaliya, Gaza Strip on Tuesday, April 1, 2025.Jehad Alshrafi/APhide caption The proposed U.S. aid program for Gaza would be a significant departure from the established U.N.-led system that has long been the cornerstone of humanitarian response in conflict zones, aid experts say. It would skirt the already-existing system for aid delivery, replacing around 400 U.N. distribution points across Gaza with just around four distribution points, which experts say would overwhelm the system and make it hard to ensure fair distribution to hundreds of thousands of people. It would advance Israel's plans to coerce Palestinians to move from north to south Gaza on Egypt's border, with eventual plans for the migration of Palestinians out of Gaza. Those are Israeli military strategies that humanitarian organizations do not want to endorse. In the Iraq war, private security groups provided aid to civilians within the parameters of the Iraqi military, leading to ethical concerns, aid experts say. \"The idea of getting aid is very important, but how aid is delivered is equally important. And there are massive red flags all over the place for this plan,\" said Paul Spiegel, director of the center for humanitarian health at Johns Hopkins University.

He spoke from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica. \"I am deeply pained by what is happening,\" said Leo, referring to the war in Gaza. \"Let the fighting cease immediately, let humanitarian aid be provided to the exhausted civilian population, and may all hostages be released.\" Leo also talked about the war in Ukraine, saying, \"I carry in my heart the suffering of the beloved Ukrainian people.\" He urged that, \"every effort be made to reach a true, just and lasting peace as soon as possible.\" And he quoted Pope Francis saying that the global conflicts affecting so many people around the world equate to a \"third world war in pieces.\" \"In today's dramatic context of a third world war fought piecemeal … I too appeal to the powerful of the world by repeating these ever-relevant words: never again war!\" he said. Leo welcomed the announcement of the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, and said he hopes there can be a lasting agreement. These words came as many across the world are just getting to know the new pontiff, and are eager to see what issues will be at the forefront of his papacy. On Thursday, Leo was elected 267th pope, following the death of Francis last month. The 69-year-old Chicago-born missionary, who attended Villanova University in Pennsylvania, is the first pope from the United States. He previously spent many years as a missionary, pastor bishop and archbishop in Peru. The new pope's remarks came after the Regina Caeli (Queen of Heaven) prayer. It is typically recited by popes, but was sung by Pope Leo. Wearing the simple white cassock of the papacy and his silver pectoral cross, Pope Leo also noted that this Sunday is Mother's Day in many countries, and wished all mothers, \"including those in heaven\" a Happy Mother's Day. He ended with a \"heartfelt appeal\" to Mary Queen of Peace, \"so that she may present it to the Lord Jesus and obtain for us the miracle of peace.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "By Tommy Trenchard A Dashchund reclines on a miniature custom-made dog sun lounger beside the pool at Vienna's Village luxury dog hotel and daycare in Cape Town, South Africa. In a country with widespread poverty, numerous chronic social issues and one of the world's highest murder rates, the city is home to a booming luxury pet hotel industry.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption On the skydeck of the Superwoof Dog Hotel in Cape Town, South Africa, the guests are having a blast. Some splash about in a shallow plunge pool, while others chase after balls thrown by the hotel staff. From their vantage point, the dogs have expansive views over the dramatic, flat-topped mass of Table Mountain in the distance. And in the foreground, a night shelter for the homeless. Now common in the U.S. and other parts of the Global North, luxury pet hotels have arrived in South Africa. And they're thriving. But in what remains the world's most unequal country, according to theWorld Bank, with millions living below the poverty line and decades-long wait times for public housing, not everyone is happy about it. Dogs play in a splash pool on the skydeck of the Superwoof Dog Hotel and Daycare in Cape Town, South Africa.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Asanda Ncanda, 35, has been living on the streets outside the Superwoof building for the past four years. \"That's where I sleep, under that bridge,\" he says, pointing to a nearby cluster of tents beneath a highway overpass. \"And the dogs are up there with their own private pool. They probably eat more in a day than we do in a month.\" On the morning of NPR's visit to Superwoof, a bulldog named Archie is celebrating his birthday and has just finished devouring a tennis ball-themed cupcake presented to him by the hotel staff. If his owners are happy to put up the extra expense, he has the option of enjoying a bottle of Champaws — a non-alcoholic drinkfor dogs — from the onsite \"Woofbar.\" Superwoof's managing director, Bianca Couch, admits that in the socioeconomic context of Cape Town, the idea of luxury dog hotels can be \"jarring.\" Decades of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination under apartheid in the second half of the 20th century left South Africa's cities among the world's most rigidly divided and unequal. In Cape Town, the contrasts are particularly stark. In the wealthier parts of town, affluent South Africans enjoy a better standard of living than in much of Europe or the U.S. This year, Time Out, a British media and hospitality company,ranked it the best cityin the world, beating the likes of New York, Bangkok and London for the top spot. At the same time, more than half of the population lives below the government's \"upper bound poverty line\" — the level at which people can afford adequate food, clothing and other basic necessities. And huge parts of the city struggle with high unemployment, rampant violent crime and a lack of adequate housing and reliable services. Makeshift tents occupied by homeless people are seen in front of the atFrits Dog Hotel and Daycare, a luxury pet accommodation, in Cape Town, South Africa.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption \"We try to stay positive and just to provide the best service we can,\" says Couch, adding that the hotel supports an adoption program for shelter dogs as well as being a significant local employer. \"If we didn't exist, that would be 25 people who didn't have a job anymore.\" Couch says the rates are designed to be \"relatively affordable,\" with prices ranging from 210 rand ($11.45) for a day care pass up to 410 rand ($22.30) for an overnight stay in a private room. For context, agovernment reportpublished in 2024 found that half of all employed South Africans were earning less than R5,200 ($283.26) per month. \"Most of our clients are young working professionals,\" she says. \"People care about their dogs' mental health and well-being more than ever before. They don't want to leave their dogs at home alone anymore.\" Among the recreation options for Superwoof's canine guests are long walks in the park and weekend getaways among the vineyards of the Franschhoek Valley. The hotel also hosts weddings, \"tailored for dogs in love,\" featuring confetti, a red carpet, a customized veil for the bride and bow tie for the groom. For an extra fee, the couple can get a themed wedding cake or enjoy a night in a private honeymoonsuite. \"We want to make sure the dogs have an amazing experience,\" says Couch. \"There's a lot of attention to detail.\" Dog weddings might not be for everyone, but Couch says demand for Superwoof's services is booming, and they've received several requests from people around the country looking to replicate the model under a franchise agreement. \"It's a growing industry and I don't think that'll change,\" says Couch. \"Pet hotels are popping up everywhere and they're thriving. There's just such demand for it.\" The industry is highly competitive, and rivalries between the dog hotel owners can be intense. \"It would make a great TV show,\" says Couch. \"LikeDesperate Housewivesbut with dog hotel owners,fighting over a cosmoon a Friday night.\" Superwoof's main rival in the city center is the atFrits Dog Hotel and Daycare, which opened its doors back in 2015, billing itself at the time as the continent's first luxury dog hotel. AtFrits boasts some particularly extravagant luxury flourishes. In the presidential suite, dogs can watch cartoons on a private TV from the comfort of a human-style bed complete with carved wooden headboard. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling and ornate, gilt-framed dog portraits adorn the walls. Tommy, a French bulldog and regular guest of the atFrits Dog Hotel and Daycare, leans against the glass front wall of his usual posh suite, which comes with a TV, faux leather sofa and chandelier.hide caption The dogs can enjoy a wide range of health and wellness treatments, designed to help them \"find balance and harmony in their life,\" according to the website. These include everything from a basic wash, brush and blow-dry at the spa to hydrotherapy and evenreiki, a form of Japanese energy-based alternative healing. A private outdoor dog park provides space for play and exercise. And for nervous owners, cameras provide a round-the-clock livestream so they check in on their dogs. \"People are always saying, how can you set up a dog hotel in a third world country?\" says atFrits' founder, Yanic Klue. \"But they don't realize small and medium businesses like this are what will make our country move forward. They're keeping the economy alive.\" AtFrits employs 38 people, supports various charities and runs a program that trains and equips women from marginalized communities to make pet clothing, which is then sold in the hotel gift shop. For every doggy bow tie or jacket you buy, that puts bread and butter on a family's table, says Klue. Yanic Klue, the founder of the atFrits Dog Hotel and Daycare, catches a break with some of the hotel guests.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption She says it's a misconception that most of those who use the hotel are ultrawealthy. Many, she says, are young people living in flats without gardens who don't have anywhere to leave their dogs while they're at work. One regular client is a waiter from a nearby restaurant. \"At first the idea of dog hotels didn't make any sense to me,\" says the hotel's former longtime manager, Sailas Mapahlala, who worked in a Cape Town pet shop before being recruited by atFrits in 2015. \"But then I realized it's actually a service people really need. Within a month of opening I could see that we were in for a busy ride. Within a year people were trying to copy our business.\" A dog enjoys a grooming session in the spa of Vienna's Village luxury dog hotel and daycare in Cape Town, South Africa.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption In the leafy suburb of Noordhoek, on the city's southern edge, Jayne Le Roux, the owner of Vienna's Village luxury dog hotel and day care, says she's having to turn away clients, \"left, right and center.\" She says the hotel is already fully booked for December 2025. When NPR visited on the morning of the 14th of February, preparations were underway for a doggy Valentine's Day party. Le Roux had ordered a batch of Valentine's Day themed dog treats and pink, heart-shaped cookies, which she planned to serve to the hotel guests with cubes of watermelon. Staff create pictures to send to dog owners during a Valentine's Day dog party at Vienna's Village Luxury dog hotel and daycare in Cape Town, South Africa.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Ahead of the event, the dogs roamed the spacious gardens, digging in the sand pit or exploring the play castle and model Cape Dutch-style dog cottage. Others played by the pool area, where murals of seaside scenes form the backdrop for a range of custom-built miniature dog sun loungers, cabanas and hanging basket chairs. The hotel also features an immaculate spa, decorated with fake pink roses and acid green tiling beneath the vanity mirror. Soothing meditation music plays in the background while the guests get their treatments. Among the health and beauty products on offer are \"wild cherry puppy spritz,\" all-natural \"heavenly hemp body spray\" and \"tropical mango pet perfume.\" Hotel guests sit outside a model of a Cape Dutch style cottage — a common architectural style in the region — on the grounds of Vienna's Village luxury dog hotel and daycare in Cape Town, South Africa. The house serves as a hangout for canine guests.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption \"I wanted to open a place for spoiled, pampered little dogs who are used to sleeping inside with lots of cuddles,\" says Le Roux, who launched the business in 2018. \"But I never expected it to take off like this.\" Vienna's Village lies barely a mile from an informal settlement on the edge of the township of Masiphumelele, where poverty and unemployment are rife, and residents live in ramshackle structures of sheet metal and timber packed so tightly together there's barely space to walk between them. Asked whether running a luxury dog hotel in such an environment ever gave rise to moments of cognitive dissonance, Le Roux appeared surprised. \"I guess you just don't see it,\" she said, of the poverty in the city, before adding, after a pause, \"I suppose we're in a bit of a bubble.\" Gilt-framed dog portraits adorn the walls of a suite at the atFrits Dog Hotel and Daycare in Cape Town, South Africa. Over the last decade, luxury pet hotels have been springing up across the city.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption For some dog owners, the emergence of the dog hotels has been life changing.\"If atFrits didn't exist, I wouldn't be able to keep her,\" said one client, a children's rights lawyer, as she arrived one morning to pick up her lurcher. \"She comes here whenever I'm in court or in chambers. She just loves it here.\"The lawyer asked not to be identified because as a condition of her employment, she cannot be quoted by name. To others, however, the increasing presence of luxury dog hotels in a city where over 300,000 households are languishing on the government's waitlist for adequate housing, is hard to stomach. An aerial view of the township of Masiphumelele (foreground) and the Lake Michelle gated estate (rear), in Cape Town, South Africa. Thirty years after the end of apartheid, the country remains highly segregated and, according to the World Bank, has the highest income inequality in the world.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption \"We can't be prioritizing the 5% over the 95%,\" says Luyanda Mtamzeli, of the legal non-profitNdifuna Ukwazi, which campaigns against inequality and the lack of affordable housing in Cape Town. \"You've got a huge number of people who need accommodation in the city, and then you've got the 5% of the population who need luxury hotels for their dogs. This whole situation underscores the lack of genuine political will to tackle the structural and deep-seated inequality that persists in Cape Town.\" From a street corner near his tent outside the Superwoof building, Asanda Ncanda says he bears no ill will toward the hotel or its owners, but that it's existence is nevertheless a constant reminder of the unfulfilled promises of post-apartheid South Africa. \"I love animals, and I would never say they shouldn't be running their business,\" he says, as the sounds of excited barking float down from the skydeck. \"But what does it say about our society in South Africa? It hurts.\" Tommy Trenchard is anindependent photojournalistbased in Cape Town, South Africa.

    "title": "I wanted to know why my mom was so hard on us kids growing up. So I finally asked",
    "article_text": "By Esther Ndumi Ngumbi Mother knows best: Bertha Ngumbi with her daughter, Esther, who says, \"My dear mother is one of the most hardworking women I can think of.\" But when she was growing up and her mother told her she should work hard — that wasn't what a playful kid wanted to hear.Family photohide caption \"I want you to study hard so that you can rescue our family from poverty. Your father and I are poor and the only gift we can give you is an education. You are intelligent. Rise up and make your lives meaningful. I gave birth to you and I know you have what it takes to make it in life. Work hard my children.\" When I was a little girl in Kenya, hardly a day would pass without my mother repeating those words to my four siblings and me. Because I was a child all I wanted to do was play hide and seek and netball. So her words fell on deaf ears. When she told us to work hard, we played harder. But my mother meant what she said. Anytime we were caught playing and not working hard at homework or chores like washing clothes and fetching firewood, she would punish us. I wish she did it differently. I still remember one day, when I was about 10, going to the river crying and wishing that she would get sick and lack the strength to punish me. I was very mad at her. As we children grew up, we slowly grasped the wisdom in her words mostly because she led by example and lived by her words every day. Bertha Ngumbi, my dear mother, is one of the most hardworking women I can think of. She and my dad, Harrison, were both teachers and managed to raise us on their combined salary of $200 a month. And because their teacher's salary was not enough we had to farm. So before going to school, my mother would wake up all of us at 5 a.m. to do farm chores. Come evening, we'd help my mother by going to the river about 15 minutes away to fetch water for drinking and bathing and by cooking dinner. After dinner, she would do her teaching preparation while we did our homework and reviewed our school notes. My mother wasn't just tough. She was selfless. She sacrificed life's little pleasures so we could go to school and get an education. I still remember vividly how she and my dad would go to collect their paychecks but eat nothing before coming back in the evening, hungry and tired. I wondered at her ability to be in town, in the midst of all the best foods but choosing not to buy anything so she had enough money for our school fees. That determination and selflessness had a powerful effect on my siblings and me. Even though we grumbled, it inspired us to work hard and pursue our life's goal no matter the challenges, hurdles and circumstances. Now that I am grown, I appreciate the values and standards my mother instilled in us. If it were not for her words and tough stance, I would never have graduated from Auburn University with a Ph.D. in entomology — the first girl from our community of Mabafweni in Kwale County to get a doctoral degree. When I think back to my childhood, I can understand why she was so hard on us. But I've always wondered how she felt? Did she know we were mad at her for being so tough? Mama, why did you set the bar for us up so high? Why did you punish us so much? Why were you so insistent on us working hard in our early years? Why did you never give up on us? So I had a conversation with my mother. Here's what I asked — and here's what she said. Why were you so hard on us? My children thought I was mad when I told them what I wanted them to become. They could not believe they possessed the capacity to achieve the standards I had set. But because I was their mother, I could see their potential. I pushed them hard so that they would make it in life. I watched them closely and monitored their performances in school and had the time to discuss their progress with their teachers. As they grew up and started to understand, I became their friend and this helped because they were free to discuss their problems with me. Did you know your children were mad at you for setting high standards? No, I did not know they were mad. Deep down I knew everything I was doing was best for them in the long run. Were you ever tempted to give in and be a \"fun\" mom? I stuck to my standards because I saw the potential in each of my children and I had to exploit that. What was the biggest sacrifice you made? I sacrificed my social life, money and time. But I would do it all over again. What advice do you have for moms today who are in the position you were in — facing poverty, trying to make sure their kids have enough to eat and can get an education and have a better life? Let their children be their biggest priority. Young mothers should focus on their children. How could you collect a paycheck and come home, tired and hungry, without stopping to get something to eat? Did you ever just want to go buy some food you loved and sneak eat it? No. I did not want to sneak eat because I had a mission to accomplish. Was there any role model or any wise advice or saying that helped you? My mother was my role model. I had seen my mother struggle. I therefore wanted to set the bar up high for my children. I wanted them to accomplish their life goals. What's the toughest thing about being a mom? The toughest thing was make my children understand that whatever I was doing was for them and was out of a mother's wish for her children to succeed in life. I didn't have to ask my mother if she is happy with how all her children turned out. I know she is very happy. Her eldest son, Kennedy, is a businessman, farmer and entrepreneur. I'm her second born and I'm a scientist. Her third born, Faith, is a counselor. Her fourth born, Kalekye, is a manager and consultant in a health-care NGO. And her last born, Kavuu, is a nurse. All her efforts, sacrifices and selflessness paid off. Today, my mother and I continue to share a beautiful relationship. Week after week, in our phone conversations, she urges me to work hard just as she did when I was a child. I am forever grateful to my mother, and I love her from the bottom of my heart.

    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Local residents depart a passenger bus upon their arrival at a bus terminal, day after the ceasefire between Indian and Pakistan was announced, in Chakothi, near Line of Control, some 61 kilometres (38 miles) from Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan controlled Kashmir, Sunday, May 11, 2025.Roshan Mughal/APhide caption ISLAMABAD — A ceasefire to end the conflict between India and Pakistan was shaken by overnight border fighting in the disputed Kashmir region. People on both sides of the Line of Control, which divides the territory, reported heavy exchanges of fire between Indian and Pakistani troops. The fighting subsided by Sunday morning. The two countries agreed to a truce a day earlier after talks to defuse the most serious military confrontation between them in decades following a gun massacre of tourists that India blames on Pakistan, which denies the charge. As part of the ceasefire, the nuclear-armed neighbors agreed to immediately stop all firing and military action on land, in the air and at sea. They accused each other of repeatedly violating the deal just hours later. Drones were spotted Saturday night over Indian-controlled Kashmir and the western state of Gujarat according to Indian officials. In the Poonch area of Indian-controlled Kashmir, people said the intense shelling from the past few days had traumatized them. \"Most people ran as shells were being fired,\" said college student Sosan Zehra who returned home Sunday. \"It was completely chaotic.\" In Pakistan-controlled Kashmir's Neelum Valley, which is three kilometers from the Line of Control, people said there were exchanges of fire and heavy shelling after the ceasefire began. Resident Mohammad Zahid said: \"We were happy about the announcement but, once again, the situation feels uncertain.\" U.S. President Donald Trump was the first to post about the deal, announcing it on his Truth Social platform. Indian and Pakistani officials confirmed the news shortly after. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a high-level meeting on Sunday with top government and military officials. India, unlike Pakistan, has not said anything about Trump or the U.S. since the deal was announced. Nor has India acknowledged anyone beyond its military contact with the Pakistanis. Both armies have engaged in daily fighting since Wednesday along the rugged and mountainous Line of Control, which is marked by razor wire coils, watchtowers and bunkers that snake across foothills populated by villages, tangled bushes and forests. They have routinely blamed the other for starting the skirmishes while insisting they were only retaliating. India and Pakistan's two top military officials are due to speak again on Monday.

    "title": "The Justice League is not impressed in Peacemaker S2 teaser",
    "article_text": "\"We haven't always been great people, but we are the 11th Street kids and no one will ever break us apart.\" What's a reformed villain gotta do to impress the Justice League? That's the dilemma faced by John Cena's titular antihero in the first teaser for S2 ofPeacemaker, James Gunn's Emmy-nominated series spun off from his  2021 film,The Suicide Squad. We've got the same colorful cast of characters, but the new season will serve as something of a \"soft reboot\" as part of the new DC Universe (DCU) franchise. (Spoilers for S1 andThe Suicide Squadbelow.) The eight-episode first season was set five months after the events ofThe Suicide Squad.Having survived a near-fatal shooting, Peacemaker—aka Christopher Smith—is recruited by the US government for a new mission: the mysterious Project Butterfly, led by a mercenary named Clemson Murn (Chukwudi Iwuji). The team also included A.R.G.U.S. agent John Economos (Steve Agee) of the Belle Reve Penitentiary, National Security Agency agent and former Waller aide Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland), and new team member Leota Adebayo (Danielle Brooks). Project Butterly turned out to be a mission to save Earth from an alien species of parasitic butterfly-like creatures who took over human bodies. The misfit members of the project eventually succeeded in defeating the Butterflies in a showdown at a ranch, and even survived the carnage despite some severe injuries. Creating a spinoff series around the villain who killed Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman) inThe Suicide Squadwas a bold move but my initial doubts proved unfounded. As I wrote inmy 2022 review, \"Gunn has successfully taken a seemingly irredeemable character and sent him on an emotional journey that made us love him—all framed in a blood-soaked, action-packed, cheekily irreverent main story that makes for top-notch entertainment.\" I wasn't alone in my assessment. So it wasn't surprising when HBO Max reviewed the show for a second season just before the S1 finale was set to air, even though it was originally conceived as a limited series. Gunn and Peter Safran have since become co-CEOs of DC Studios and are developing a ten-year plan for the DC Universe, starting with this year'sSuperman.PeacemakerS2 will build on the events of that film. As for the killerS1 opening title sequence—featuring cast members dancing to Norwegian metal band Wig Wam's \"Do You Wanna Taste It?\"—Gunnhas saidthat we're getting a new title sequence for S2 set to a new tune. Cena, Brooks, Holland, Agee, and Stroma are all back for S2, along with Nhut Lee as Judomaster and Eagly, of course. Robert Patrick is also listed in the S2 cast, reprising his role as Chris's father Auggie; since Chris killed him in S1, one assumes Auggie will appear in flashbacks, hallucinations, or perhaps an alternate universe. (This is a soft reboot, after all.) New cast members include Frank Grillo as Rick Flagg Sr. (Grillo voiced the role in the animated Creature Commandos), now head of A.R.G.U.S. and out to revenge his son's death; Tim Meadows as A.R.G.U.S. agent Langston Fleury; and Sol Rodriguez as Sasha Bordeaux. Set to \"Oh Lord\" by Foxy Shazam, the teaser opens with Leota driving Chris to a job interview, assuring him, \"They're gonna be doing backflips to get you to join.\" It turns out to be an interview with Justice League members Green Lantern/Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), Hawkgirl/Kendra Saunders (Isabel Merced), and Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn), but they are not really into the interviewing process or taking note of Chris's marksmanship and combat skills. They even diss poor Chris while accidentally keeping the microphone turned on: \"This guy sucks.\" (All three reprise their roles fromSupermanand are listed as S2 cast members, but it's unclear how frequently they will appear.) The other team members aren't faring much better. They saved the world from the Butterflies, you'd think people would treat them with a bit more respect, if not as outright heroes. Leota is \"living in the worst level ofGrand Theft Auto,\" per John Economos; Emilia Harcourt has anger management issues and is diagnosed with \"a particularly severe form of toxic masculinity\"; and Vigilante is working in the food service industry;. There's not much detail as to the plot, apart from Chris going on the run from A.R.G.U.S., but the final scene shows Chris walking through a door and encountering another version of himself. So things are definitely about to get interesting.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Apple’s AirPods Pro 2 are considered as the best of the wireless earbuds on the market, and offer an experience that’s hard to beatin terms of sound quality and active noise cancellation. Right now,Amazon is selling them for just $169, which is an incredible 32% below their usual $249 price. Apple is famous for rarely ever slashing prices on their hardware, thus, when the opportunity of this sort arises, it’s the real deal for anyone looking to upgrade their sound gear. Make sure you get yours before it runs out of stock (already 10k+ units sold on Amazon). See at Amazon How the AirPods Pro 2 are unique is through the ability of uniting premium sound. The powerful Apple H2 chip inside earbuds provides richly detailed sound with crisp highs, deep bass and clarity. Custom-designed drivers and amplifier team up with advanced algorithms to tailor the sound to the shape of your ear, so every note and nuance rings out true.Personalized Spatial Audio improves the listening experience by providing a 360-degree soundstagethat puts you in the middle of what you are experiencing. Active Noise Cancellationon the AirPods Pro 2 is nothing less than amazing, and probably the best on the market right now. Apple claims that it’s twice as good as the previous generation and outside tests confirm it (you can check out our review here): the earbuds block out everything from the low rumble of a train to the din of a busy cafÃ© very well. When you need to stay aware of what’s around you,Transparency mode lets in the perfect level of ambient noiseÂ and adaptive audio features blend both modes smoothly for the best balance in any environment.Conversation Awareness even mutes your audio automatically when you start talkingwith someone nearby. Aside from their basic audio functionality, the AirPods Pro 2 are packed with features fit for everyday use: The silicone tips which can be adjusted for size create a tight, comfortable fit in your ears that enables all-day wear and the IP54 rating means they are dust-, sweat-, and water-resistant-perfect for gyms or commutes. Battery life is also fantastic:six hours from a single charge, and total 30 hours with the charging caseemploying the MagSafe and USB-C case. The AirPods Pro 2 also perform well when it comes to making calls: With the help of advanced microphones and voice isolation technology, your voice sounds crisp and clear even in loud spaces. Touch controls on the stem make it easy to control playback, change volume, and trigger Siri, and new features such as head gestures enable even more natural interactions. Itâs rare to see Appleâs latest and greatest at such a low price, and with deals like this, stock tends to move quickly.

    "title": "The Revenge of the Sith Game Writer Still Thinks About Its Wild Alternate Ending",
    "article_text": "Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sithturns 20 years old later in May, and for many, the film will bring to mind its tie-in game. One reason it holds a special place in fans’ hearts is its two endings: the canonical one whereObi-Wan defeats Anakinto begin the Original Trilogy, and an alternate one where Anakin kills his former master, then Palpatine, and becomes the new Emperor. Talking toInverse, game writer Jeremy Barlow revealed the ending partially came from an idea pitched by LucasArts. When developer The Collective scaled back its ambitions for separate Anakin and Obi-Wan campaigns into a single one with alternating perspectives, it opted to stick with that different take, and Barlow got to handle the specifics. To him, Anakin killing Obi-Wan was a “no-brainer,” since it’d prove he was the strongest Force user in the galaxy and give him the confidence to betray his childhood confidant. “It totally fit in with the whole Sith ideal of the apprentice growing and killing the master, and we all went nuts for it,” said Barlow of the idea. TheÂRevenge of the SithÂgame had a shaky developmentâThe Collective replaced an entirely different studio and restarted development less than a year before its scheduled releaseâand Barlow said they had to “get the point as fast and seamlessly as possible. We only had like a [90-second] cutscene.” Despite the brief ending, he called it “rewarding [to see] it’s still in people’s minds and hearts. Itâs not a reflection on me, but a reflection on just how powerful that idea was and what Star Wars means to people.” If Barlow had his way, he’d explore the fallout of the Emperor Anakin ending. Under Anakin’s rule, he thinks the galaxy would be much worse off, since Palpatine at least “followed the rules in a weird way.” But the new paradigm shift would lead to some interesting family drama: how does Padme raise the twins while married to the most powerful man in the galaxy (who she’s already admitted to being terrified of), and how do Luke and Leia survive “being raised by these parents who have a public face together, but behind closed doors are obviously opposed?” Lucasfilm may not provide the answers, but that’s what fanfiction’s for.

    "title": "Amazon Restocks the Seagate 22TB External Hard Drive, Now 60% Off Original Price",
    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. This Sunday afternoon,Seagate has just re-stocked its popular 22TB external hard drive on Amazon. The 20TB variant had been sold out for the past a few days, and the 22TB variant was nowhere to be found. Good news is that Seagate has replenished its stock and the timing could not be more opportune: the 22TB drive is now available for arecord low price tag of just $249, which is a massive discount from its usual $599 retail price. See at Amazon This is a record-low for an external drive of this enormous size, but it also trumps most other players and even used internal drives on sale. For comparison, the next step-up inSeagate’s line after this one is currently on sale for $329 as the 24TB HDD. It might at first glance seem reasonable to splurge on the larger-capacity one, but if you break down the price by the number of terabytes, the 22TB one gives you far more bang for your buck. You can get it for $249.99, and you’re only paying approximately$11.36 per terabyte, while the 24TB comes out to approximately $13.75 per terabyte. This Seagate external hard drive featuresUSB 3.0 connectivity for fast data transferand comes loaded with Seagate’s Rescue Data Recovery Services which offers peace of mind should there be involuntary loss of data. Over2,000 have been sold in one month alone, and it has a rating of 4.5/5 on over 200,000 reviews. Putting this offer into context withcloud storage servicessheds its price into even sharper perspective: Professional cloud storage services generally charge monthly or yearly fees which can mount in no time. To put it in perspective, maintaining 22TB or more in the cloud often costs hundreds of dollars a year, and that’s just for standard access. Within two years, the total cost of cloud storage far surpasses the initial price of a high-capacity external hard drive. Furthermore,with physical storage like the Seagate HDD, your data is entirely in your control, with no concern over account hacks, service outages, or terms-of-service changes. It’s also worth noting that, while the 24TB model is tempting at $329, the price jump simply doesn’t have the relatively minor increase in capacity to offer most customers. Unless you have a specific need for each and every terabyte,the 22TB drive is the more cost-effective option. The reality that the 20TB and 22TB models haven’t been available for days is evidence of how rapidly smart buyers are snapping up these deals. Whatever the reason of this external hard drive discounts, consumers stand to benefit: If youâve been waiting for the right moment to expand your local storage whether for backups, media libraries or professional archives, this is a rare opportunity that Amazon offers you.

It is, of course, doing that in a way that presents its own concernsâclaiming that it will structure its new human-powered customer service cohort will be fully remote and with a âUber type of setupâ that seems like it will rely on contract work and will reportedly tap into an employee pool of students and people in rural populations. But if the best we can do is exploitative work or out of work entirely, I guess the former at least represents the slightest of improvements. âFrom a brand perspective, a company perspective…I just think itâs so critical that you are clear to your customer that there will be always a human if you want,” Siemiatkowski said,per Bloomberg. It is a starkly different position than the company took just two years ago. Back in 2023, Siemiatkowski basically threw himself at AI, saying that he wanted his company to be OpenAI’s âfavorite guinea pig.â The company instituted ahiring freezeand set out to replace as many humans on its payroll as possible with AI. By 2024, the CEO was bragging aboutcutting the company’s workforce nearly in half, dropping from a headcount of 3,800 to 2,000 by shifting to AI alternatives. He called the cutbacks “natural attritionâ rather than the result of layoffs. Klarna claimed that AI chatbots were handling two-thirds of customer service conversations within their first month of deployment and went on to claim that AI was doing the work of 700 customer service agents. The problem is that it’s really doing the work of 700 really bad agents, and that quality took a toll.Â  âAs cost unfortunately seems to have been a too predominant evaluation factor when organizing this, what you end up having is lower quality,â Siemiatkowski said. âReally investing in the quality of the human support is the way of the future for us.â One response to this may be: no shit. People do not like talking to chatbots, no matter how advanced they may have become in recent years. Astudy conducted last yearfound that more than four in five people would choose waiting to talk to a human over getting immediately served by a bot. AGartner surveyfound about two-thirds of customers prefer that companies don’t use AI for customer service, and there is research to indicate that people havelower trust inandsatisfaction rates fromAI agents. Frankly, this is something that Klarna knew two years ago when it went the AI route, because it had humans in place for those exact roles. It seems the company opted to create a worse experience for its customers because it wanted to come across as forward-thinking and innovative and wanted to save money, until that worse experience actually proved more costly than paying people.

    "title": "X-Men Writer Jonathan Hickman Laments His Unfinished Krakoa Saga",
    "article_text": "The X-Men have been through plenty of shakeups, and theKrakoan Agefelt like a breath of fresh air when it started in 2019. Beginning with writer Jonathan Hickman and artists Pepe Larraz and R.B. Silva’sHouse of XÂandÂPowers of X,Âthe mutants established their newest unified society that promised to better things for their people after years of being beaten down. But Hickman, whose previous Marvel tenure established him as a long-term writer, exited with theInfernominiseries in 2022, and Krakoa’s story continued without him. In a recent episode of theOff-Panel podcast, Hickman looked back on his time leading the charge at the X-books. By now, he considers it “the most disappointing creative experience” of his comics career, largely owing to him not getting to finish his intended story. Back when he first pitched his plans to Marvel, heâd unveiled the entire three-story arc. As he tells it, he was “very clear” about the overall point he wanted to make, and teased those who heard the full pitch knew it was a “real bummer” things didn’t pan out. Hickman claimed his departure wasn’t so much one thing as it was several factors, ranging from COVID to business and publishing-related issues. Had he stayed, he’s certain he would’ve made an X-Men saga for the ages, but he also stressed he’s got no issue with the creative teams who stepped up after his leaving, or Marvel itself. “It’s on me to tell the story that I’m supposed to tell, period,” he continued. “I don’t have any negative feelings about any other stuff outside of me not bringing it home, and I don’t think I’ll ever talk about it, because it’s shitty.” The Krakoan Age officially ended in 2024, and the X-Men have since gone back to the “hated and feared” ways of the past across their various books. But the impact of the island-nation still hovers over the current mutant crop, and the run is getting one last farewell with a newHellfire Gala one-shotin July. As for Hickman, he remains at Marvel, mainly as a key architect for the revamped Ultimate Universeâa duty he took over fromThorwriterDonny Catesfollowing his car accident in 2023âand writingÂUltimate Spider-Man. He’s also got an upcoming cosmic event in the primary Marvel universe,Imperial,Âwhich is set to begin in June. [viaThe Popverse] Want more io9 news?

    "article_text": "The 15-year anniversary ofÂTucker & Dale vs. EvilÂwas earlier in January, and if you’ve been holding out hope for a follow up, director/co-writerEli Craigrevealed itÂalmostÂhappened. During an interview withSlashfilmabout his new horror flickÂClown in a Cornfield,ÂCraig noted the would-be sequel “has died more deaths than the college kids [in the first movie]. It’s always been a struggle, and then when we do set it up and get all the pieces together, it gets killed somehow.” One such version was a TV continuation on TNT/TBS (not unlike what happened withChucky), but that ran into its own roadblock: namely, currentWarner Bros. Discovery head David Zaslav. “Zaslav, the slayer of all cinema, came in and put the final nail in the coffin forÂTucker & DaleÂas we were about to go to series, and just canceled all production, ” said Craig. That, in and of itself doesn’t sound too surprising: presumably, this would’ve taken place sometime in 2022, shortly after WB and Discovery merged and the company went about laying off staff and junkingvarious projectsin the name of tax write offs. (Despite this,someprojects havesurvived.) As for what the proposed show would’ve been, Craig said the titular hillbillies, played again by Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine, would’ve been detectives “stupidly trying to figure out what’s happening in a world where they’re always getting it wrong and people are dying around them.” While that idea may be done for, Craig said he’ll always want to make a sequel to his feature film debut. “It’s set up for it, and when I wrote it, there were these elements I wanted to follow,” he said. “Hollywood is a slayer of great ideas, but stay alive, fans!

    "title": "Trump Reportedly Fires Head of US Copyright Office",
    "article_text": "Earlier this week, the US Copyright Officeissued a massive reportin part expressing support for content creators and raising concerns about how artificial intelligence systems utilize copyrighted material in training. On Saturday, the head of that office, Shira Perlmutter, was fired by Donald Trump,according to CBS News. The firing also followed Trump’s axing of Carla Hayden, the head of the Library of Congress, of which the US Copyright Office is one department. Perlmutter had served as the Register of Copyrights since October, 2020, during the first Trump administration. She had been appointed to the role by Hayden, who was appointed librarian of Congress during Barack Obama’s first term and served through the first Trump presidency without disruption. Hayden, who made significant efforts to modernize and optimize the library’s systems during her tenure, wasfired without explanationearlier this week. Hayden’s firing came shortly after theAmerican Accountability Foundation, a right-wing “government oversight” organization,took aimat Hayden for denouncing efforts to remove books about sexual identity from libraries and for inviting Lizzo to play former President James Madison’s crystal flute at a concert in 2022. Perlmutter also faced scrutiny from this group, taking issue with the fact that she had made donations to Democratic political campaigns. The AAF also apparently took issue with the fact that she supported a“three strikes” rulefor individuals downloading copyrighted material on the Internet. It’s hard to see any other inciting incident other than the AAF’s recent campaign against Hayden and Perlmutter as the impetus for Trump taking action, but the timing is certainly open to question given the Copyright Office’srecent reportexamining how generative AI models utilize copyrighted works within their training data and the potential harms that may cause to artists, creators, and copyright holders. To that end, Democratic Congressperson Joe Morelle of New York, the ranking member of the Committee on House Administration, took issue with Perlmutter’s firing and called into question the motivations behind it. “Donald Trumpâs termination of Register of Copyrights, Shira Perlmutter, is a brazen, unprecedented power grab with no legal basis,” he said in a statement. “It’s surely no coincidence he acted less than a day after she refused to rubber-stamp Elon Muskâs efforts to mine troves of copyrighted works to train AI models.” Musk recentlyendorsed the ideaof removing all intellectual property laws, an idea that hasgrowing support among tech CEOswho would like to mine and utilize as much data as humanly possible in order to train their AI models. Deleting those laws off the books seems like the quickest way for these companies to access the data they want, as it seems the “fair use” argument for using copyrighted material as training data may fall flat. Fittingly, one of the major conclusions of the report from Perlmutter’s office was that the use of copyrighted works to train commercial services “goes beyond established fair use boundaries.” Artificial intelligenceCopyrightDonald TrumpLLMsTrump administration Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Godzilla x Kong is Going Supernova, What Could It Mean?",
    "article_text": "Almost afull yearafter it was teased, we recently learned thethirdGodzilla x KongÂmovieis subtitledSupernova,Âand it’s coming March 2027. As fans wonder what’ll bring the two Titans together once more, some think the title could be mean theMonsterVerseis introducing interstellar threats. After all, bothGodzilla vs. KongÂandÂGodzilla x Kong: The New EmpireÂtook the characters underground to the Hollow Earth, so the next place left to go, in theory, would be up into the stars. One of the first candidates that comes to mind isSpaceGodzilla. Like the name implies, it’s an evil clone of the King of the Monsters who first appeared in 1994’sGodzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla. Created by Godzilla’s genetic material merging with a crystalline organism in space, then absorbed by a black hole and subsequently spat out by a white hole, the cosmic-themed variant attacked Godzilla and Little Godzilla using its power to create and control crystals. The monster was subsequently defeated by Godzilla’s red heat ray attack, and since then, it’s mostly appeared in non-movie media more than the films themselves. On screen, it last showed up as a toy in 2004’sGodzilla: Final Wars,Âbut its most recent overall appearance was in the 2021 gacha gameÂGodzilla Battle Lineandanniversary toysfor the franchise’s 40th birthday. Suffice to say, it’s not an A-tier baddie, but the potentialGodzilla x KongÂconnection comes from the name of its special attack,Corona Beamâor Void Invader, the retitled name bestowed upon it from a 2020Magic: The Gatheringexpansion. The Beam has been likened to the cosmic explosion, andÂ theSupernovalogo seems to support this theory. Alternatively, there’s Gigan, first introduced in 1972’sÂGodzilla vs. Gigan. This monster is an alien converted into a cyborg by the Nebulans, aliens looking to use it to decimate Earth and prepare the planet for their eventual subjugation. Godzilla and Anguirus defeated Gigan, who came back in 1973’sGodzilla vs. Megalonas a support monster to that film’s titular villain, then inÂ 2004’sÂGodzilla: Final Wars,where he was awakened by the alien Xiliens and upgraded to help destroy the Earth. It lost in both returning appearances, and inFinal Wars’case, it decapitated itself with its own weapon before a flaming Mothra finished it off for good. Unlike SpaceGodzilla, it’s had a more consistent multimedia appearance: along with being playable inÂGigaBash,Âit’s shown up in theGodzilla vs. MegalonÂweb video from 2023 and the short anime seriesÂChibi Godzilla Raids Again. IfSupernova’sactually introducing another Godzilla-related enemy, it’d continue a trend first established withMechaGodzilla invs. Kong. Despite the King’s mechanical nemesis being that film’s final baddie, both it andNew Empirehave largely focused on Kong to flesh out his corner of the world, and Godzilla’s been more of a special guest star stomping around during the first and last acts. Now that Kong has an ape tribe, a surrogate son, and a new weapon to his name, he’s well established enough to cede ground over to Godzilla, whose last substantial mythology and character development was back in 2019’sKing of the Monsters. If these two are a package deal now, the MonsterVerse writers will have to give them both material to work with, and any fans watching would tell you it’s only fair Godzilla get the spotlight now. Whichever evil monster ends up being the primary baddie, we’ll be there forGodzilla x Kong: SupernovaÂon March 26, 2027, and we’ll have more news on it as information comes out. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "FDA Approves First At-Home Test for Cervical Cancer Screenings",
    "article_text": "Pap smears are a vital tool for preventing cervical cancer because they can detect cell abnormalities before they become cancerous. Unfortunately, systematic barriers or a lack of comfort with the procedure means many people aren’t receiving it. But on Friday,the FDA approved the first at-home test for cervical cancer screeningsthat is a less invasive and potentially more accessible alternative to pap smears. The newly FDA-approved test was developed by San Francisco-based startup Teal Health. Like traditional pap smears, Teal Health tests for the human papillomavirus or HPV, which causes virtually all cervical cancers. However, it’s test, the Teal Wand, only requires a vaginal swab with a spongelike tool instead of inserting a speculum to scrape cells from the cervix. In a statement, Kara Egan, CEO and co-founder of Teal Health,saidthat the approval isn’t “just about an innovative product â it’s about finally giving women an option that makes sense for their lives â something that can be done quickly and comfortably at home.” “Because when we make care easier to get, we help women stay healthy, for themselves and for the people who rely on them every day,” Egan continued. In the United States, about11,500 new casesof cervical cancer are diagnosed each year, and 4,000 people will die of it. However, cervical cancer could be “eradicate[d] in our lifetime,” Dr. Alexi Wright, the director of gynecologic oncology outcomes research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, told the New York Times. “We have the tools to do it. We just don’t have comprehensive HPV vaccination or cervical cancer screening, and often can’t reach the people who are at highest risk.” According to the American Cancer Society,cervical cancer deathsin the U.S. have dropped by over half since the mid-1970s, although it has leveled off recently. One 2022studyfound that 23% of people were behind on their screenings in 2019 compared to 14% in 2005.Â Although reasons vary, onestudyfound that lack of insurance and cost were common factors. In addition, cervical cancer rates are25% higherin rural areas, and the death rate is 42% higher, likely due to a lack of resources and health care providers. For some, discomfort is also a big barrier. In 2023, many participants in a Michigan Medicine studysaidthat at-home kits “provide a comfortable, convenient, and flexible choice without trauma.” At-home screenings are effective alternatives for closing the screening gap. Onestudyfound that mailing kits to people overdue for cervical cancer screenings saw a 50% increase compared to offering usual care alone. In addition, they arejust as accurateas clinical tests. (Teal Health also has aSELF-CERVstudy.) Teal Health plans to make kits available next month, starting in California. The company is also coordinating with major insurance providers in the hope of covering costs. In addition to requesting tests through Teal Health’s platform, people can coordinate follow-up care through it if necessary. cervical cancermedicalpap smear Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Controversial and infamous as it’s been to have theBlack and Yellow Rangersplayed respectively by Black actor Walter Jones III and the late Asian actor Thuy Trang, their roles as Zack andTriniproved foundational for a lot of viewers. Trini officially died prior to the 2023 specialOnce and Always,but the character is returning again as the lead in an upcoming novel. Written by Diana Ma (Heiress Apparently),ÂPower Rangers: Force of ChaosÂexplores Trini’s POV during the Mighty Morphin team’s early days. As the team works through their initial feelings about one another, including Trini’s own “complicated history” with Zack, the book will delve into her Chinese heritage and being a martial artist superhero. Ma, in a statement toPolygon(which also has an excerpt), teased the book would “bring Chinese mythology” and let her show her love for the character she grew up watching. “Trini was important to me because she was one of the first Asian-American superheroes I saw on TV,” said Ma. “As a Chinese American superhero-loving fangirl, it was powerful for me to see this representation in a kidsâ TV show.

    "title": "Moderna’s Super-Vaccine for Flu and Covid Works—Now Politics Could Sink It",
    "article_text": "Moderna’s mRNA-based flu and covid-19 vaccine could provide the best of both worldsâif it’s actually ever approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This week, scientists at Modernapublisheddata from a Phase III trial testing the company’s combination vaccine, codenamed mRNA-1083. Individuals given mRNA-1083 appeared to generate the same or even greater immune response compared to those given separate vaccines, the researchers found. But the FDA’s recent policy change on vaccine approvals, orchestrated by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, could imperil the development of this and other future vaccines. RFK Jr. Spews Even More Nonsense on Autism, Covid in Latest Interview The trial involved 8,000 people split into two age groups: those between the ages of 50 and 64, and those over 65. People were randomly given mRNA-1083 (plus a placebo) or two already approved flu and covid-19 vaccines. The vaccine seemed effective across both age groups, with mRNA-1083 participants showing at least the same level of humoral immune response (antibody-based) to circulating flu and covid-19 strains as participants who were given the separate vaccines. On average, this response was actually higher to the flu strains in particular among those given mRNA-1083. The experimental vaccine also appeared to be safe and well-tolerated, as the authorsexplainedin their paper, published Wednesday in JAMA. The study results are certainly encouraging, and typically they would pave the way toward a surefire FDA approval. But the political situation has changed for the worse. The Department of Health and Human Servicesrecently mandatedan overhaul of the vaccine approval process, one that will require all new vaccines to undergo placebo-controlled trials to receive approval. While many experimental vaccines today are placebo-tested (including the original covid-19 vaccines), it’s unclear whether this order will also apply to vaccines that can be compared to existing vaccines, like the combination mRNA-1083 vaccine, or to vaccines that have to be regularly updated to match fast-evolving viruses like the flu and covid-19. Some vaccine experts have said that these changesare unnecessary and potentially unethical, since it could leave some people vulnerable to an infection that already has a vaccine. The new rule also might delay the availability of upcoming seasonal vaccines, particularly thecurrent covid-19 shots. RFK Jr. Goes Full Tinfoil, Pledges to Stop Chemtrails in Latest Dr. Phil Interview A potentially important wrinkle for the mRNA-1083 vaccine is that no mRNA-based vaccine for the flu is currently approved. That reality could very well be all that the FDA needs to demand further placebo-controlled trials. RFK Jr. and other recent Trump appointees have also been highly skeptical of mRNA-based vaccines in general, despite no strong evidence that these vaccines are significantly less safe than other types. Kennedy, who has along history of supportingthe anti-vaccination movement, has evenwrongly declaredÂ that the mRNA covid-19 vaccine was the “deadliest vaccine ever made.” ModernastatedlastÂ week it doesnât expect its mRNA-1083 vaccine to be approved before 2026, following the FDAâs request for late-stage data showing the vaccineâs effectiveness against flu specifically. But it’s worth wondering if even that timeline is now in jeopardy under the current public health regime.

Roughly 200 more employees at the National Institutes of Health will be laid off, reportedly to balance out recent rehires. A new study has found that shingle vaccination is associated with a lower risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular disease. If passed, the White House's budget will slow down medical research and worsen public health problems like the drug overdose crisis. The Integrated Research Facility is one of the few labs in North America where scientists can safely study BSL-4 pathogens like the Ebola virus. The Secretary of Health and Human Services appeared to blame the existence of chemtrails on DARPA, saying he would do everything in his power to stop the emissions. Even if measles vaccination rates stay the same, there could still be over 850,000 cases according to new research.

    "title": "A Rogue Black Hole of Unusual Size Is Devouring Stars in a Distant Galaxy",
    "article_text": "Astronomers have spotted an apparent supermassive black hole snacking on a star 600 million light-years away, wandering through a galaxy with an even larger black hole at its core. The event, dubbed AT2024tvd, was first spotted by the Palomar Observatoryâs Zwicky Transient Facility and later confirmed by powerhouse space telescopes including Hubble and Chandra, which helped zero in on the cosmic crime scene. To the researchers’ surprise, the responsible black hole was not at the center of its host galaxy, as supermassive black holes tend to be. Rather, this one was 2,600 light-years from the galactic centerâa huge distance on paper, but really just one-tenth the distance between our Sun and Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) like this one occur when a black holeâs gravity pulls on a star so violently that the less massive ball of gas is stretched, shredded, and swirled around the black hole, in a process delightfully called spaghettification. The fleeting burst of energy from the event is gargantuan, even rivaling a supernovaâthe explosive death of a massive starâin brightness. The burst of light is also visible across the electromagnetic spectrum, making TDEs an invaluable resource for spotting black holes that might otherwise be too quiet or hidden to detect, such as the recent rogue object. What makes AT2024tvd special is that itâs the first offset TDE discovered by optical surveys, according to a forthcoming paper in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, which is alsopostedon the preprint server arXiv. The achievement demonstrates how rogue black holesâwarping spacetime and shrouded in darkness as they move through the cosmosâcan be spotted, as long as an unfortunate object sacrifices itself for the massive object to reveal itself. âTidal disruption events hold great promise for illuminating the presence of massive black holes that we would otherwise not be able to detect,â said study co-author Ryan Chornock, a researcher at the University of California – Berkeley and a member of the ZTF team, in a NASArelease. âTheorists have predicted that a population of massive black holes located away from the centers of galaxies must exist, but now we can use TDEs to find them.â The team has a couple of ideas about how the rogue black hole ended up offset in the galaxy, and so close to the supermassive black hole at its core. (The rogue black hole’s mass is estimated to be roughly one million solar masses, at least ten times smaller than the black hole at the galactic center.) One option is that the black hole was at the center of a smaller galaxy that was subsumed by the larger galaxy, and now the black hole is simply drifting through the larger galaxy. Another possibility is that the black hole was the weakest link in what was once a three-body system, and was pushed out by the bigger objects; in other words, two larger black holes may lurk at the galaxy’s core, and the rogue black hole was ejected thousands of light-years out. âIf the black hole went through a triple interaction with two other black holes in the galaxyâs core, it can still remain bound to the galaxy, orbiting around the central region,â said Yuhan Yao, also a researcher at UC Berkeley and the lead author of the study, in the same release. But at the present moment, the team isn’t sure if the black hole was pushed out or is being dragged in by the larger black hole. With future instruments like the Vera Rubin Observatory and the Roman Space Telescope coming online, astronomers are hopeful this is just the beginning of an entirely new class of discoveries. Because if thereâs anything more unsettling than a black hole swallowing a star, itâs the idea that the hungry, hungry objects are just drifting through space in unexpected locations.

By mapping the brightest explosions in the universe, scientists may have uncovered a megastructure that defies our understanding of how the cosmos is built. The fast-moving gas cloud could help explain the so-called missing satellite problem, if the object is what scientists think it is. New findings flip a previous theory of a planet's end on its head. The Webb Space Telescope captured a chance alignment of a protostellar outflow and a spiral galaxy in a dazzling example of the cosmos' weirdness.

    "article_text": "Anoxia Station is a harrowing indie game with a distinct aesthetic. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In an alternate 1988 where a supervolcanic eruption has devastated Earth's surface, brave and desperate Terranaut expeditions carve out a path to a supposedly massive crude oil deposit vital to fueling the salvation of humanity's remaining civilizations. To get that oil they'll have to survive underground terrain, bizarre creatures of the deep earth, and each other, to the point where lack of oxygen underground may be their smallest problem. Anoxia Station is a weird little \"horror-strategy\" game set in that world where you take charge of one of these expeditions in a turn-based format, trying to deep-earth strip mine your way to humanity's future. It's a strange and unique-looking game that builds an aesthetic comparable to HR Giger's—a blend of industrial mechanics, natural features, and bizarre creatures. Anoxia Station is deliberately playing with the legacy of Frostpunk, though it's turn-based and not explicitly a city builder, and has more than a little resemblance to cult strategy titleThe Banished Vaultin its emphasis on managing harsh resources under intense pressure. In addition to its base management gameplay, Anoxia Station has an element on discovering the mystery behind what happened to the prior inhabitants of the mining station and to the world at large, as well as a cool social aspect: Your crew are an international one from a politically fractured, Cold War world, and they have their own missions. Which means that, yeah, one of your vital specialists might be a traitor. They might also just be an asshole, and that means you have to try and keep up morale while not eliminating someone whose specialty you need to keep up resource deliveries. You can findAnoxia Station on Steamfor $15, though it's 10% off until May 23. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "A year after the rather disastrous last one, now fixed. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At its PAX East panel last week, Gearbox announced the third expansion forRisk of Rain 2. Alloyed Collective will bring new things to almost every element of the game, and the trailer shows off lots of action with survivors fighting the Solus, those weird orb-shaped robots that have been present throughout the game since launch. Apparently the Solus want to go home, and they're going to go through you to get there. To survive, characters will need to take down Solus Wing, which sounds to me like a new final boss, by delving into new areas of the wilds of Petrichor V. In a press release, Gearbox said there would be six all-new stages, two new survivors to play as, seven new drone types to bring along, a new drone station to modify them at, seven new enemy types among the Solus, 15 new items, a \"brutal new Teleporter encounter\", and \"a final boss that reshapes the endgame.\" From what we can see in the trailer, and from Gearbox saying that one of the new survivors is a returner, we may well be getting robotic janitor HAN-D as a returning character from Risk of Rain. Those clunky three digits that make a grab at the drone near the end sure do look familiar to me—and HAN-D does love its drones. Risk of Rain 2 has had a troubled year after the full acquisition by Gearbox, which involveda pretty disastrous expansion. That said, since Gearboxannounced a plan, and has now followed through on it, some people seem pretty happy with the results.

    "title": "FTC delays enforcing 'click to cancel' rule that would finally bring the hammer down on companies that make it as annoying as possible to cancel subscriptions",
    "article_text": "The Negative Option Rule is great for consumers, but the FTC isn't enforcing it When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you've ever found yourself stuck on the phone trying to cancel an unwanted subscription or end a \"free trial,\" you're in luck because the FTC has a new rule to fix that. The only problem? They're delaying actually enforcing it. The\"Rule Concerning Subscriptions and Other Negative Option Plans\", or more simply the \"Negative Option Rule\", is a regulation passed under the Biden administration late last year that's designed to crack down on companies using predatory tactics to try to prevent people from canceling their subscriptions. That includes any practice that makes it significantly harder to cancel a subscription than it was to sign up. The Negative Option Rule was set to go into effect on May 14, but on May 9,the FTC voted 3-0to delay enforcing compliance until July 14, 2025. TheFTC statementon the delay claims this was to \"ensure ample time for companies to conform their conduct to the Rule,\" meaning adjust their policies to make cancelling subscriptions easier like the Negative Option Rule requires. The reluctance to begin enforcing the law might also be due toongoing lawsuitsfrom the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Interactive Advertising Bureau, the Electronic Security Association, and the Internet and Television Association (NCTA), who are trying to block the Negative Option Rule. It probably shouldn't come as a surprise that cable companies and advertisers aren't fans of a law that would force them to make it easier for consumers to save money. Ironically, their pushback against the Negative Option Rule highlights why it's necessary. Business practices that make it unnecessarily difficult to cancel recurring charges can be the virtual equivalent of highway robbery, especially when companies are vague or deceptive about what you're signing up for—for instance, automatically charging customers for a full year's subscription without warning because they didn't cancel a \"free trial.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together That's not to say that free trials and subscriptions are always predatory. However, anyone who's found themself stuck on the phone or in an endless loop of customer service emails trying to get back money from a charge they didn't mean to pay knows how costly even one encounter with a shady subscription can be. That's what the Negative Option Rule is supposed to prevent. As theFTC summarystates, the rule was \"calculated to combat unfair or deceptive business practices, including recurring charges for products or services consumers do not want and cannot cancel without undue difficulty.\" Businesses can still offer free trials and as many subscription options as they want. They just can't make you jump through hoops and run a lap around Mordor to cancel. Being clear about what consumers are signing up for and respecting their freedom to cancel their subscriptions shouldn't be controversial. The FTC initially gave businesses 180 days already to prepare to comply with the Negative Option Rule. An additional 2 months is generous, but hopefully the FTC doesn't continue deferring enforcement. This law might not be popular with business titans, but it's the kind of protection consumers have needed for a long time.

    "title": "This Half-Life mod remakes Valve's classic shooter to be both longer and wider, and it has radically altered my perception of the original",
    "article_text": "Half-Life: Extended is a surprisingly effective reinterpretation of Black Mesa. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've always said that my favourite chapter in Half-Life is Office Complex. In a game all about recontextualising the FPS from abstract mazes into a realistic, coherent setting, to me Office Complex felt like the ultimate expression of that. It's the most mundane part of Black Mesa's clandestine research facility, swapping the hellscapes of Doom and the fantasy realms of Heretic for a cold and clinical administration centre. There are no fancy laboratories, rocket silos, or experimental weapons manufacture here, just dimly lit workspaces connected by chequerboard-tiled corridors. Its wildest indulgence is an implausibly large freezer, which given the number of people who need to be fed in Black Mesa, probably isn't all that implausible in any case. Unfortunately, time is a devious little rapscallion, and upon a recent return to Half-Life, I was shocked to discover that Office Complex is, in fact, quite boring, with little of the survival-horror-ish tension that I recall. There are hardly any offices, and it isn't very complex. Perhaps Valve should have called it Corridor Simple. Hence, the greatest compliment I can affordHalf-Life Extendedis that it gives Office Complex the level design such a name deserves. It transforms Valve's basic layout into the nightmare administrative warren that I (mis)remember from my childhood, generating those same feelings of tension and disorientation. LikeBlack Mesa, Half-Life Extended is yet another mod that aims to remake Valve's industry-reshaping 1998 shooter. But its goals are very different from the work of Crowbar Collective. Whereas Black Mesa was primarily designed as a visual upgrade (at least, until you get to Xen) Half-Life Extended targets theshapeof the FPS. It overhauls the game's levels, expanding them in both length and breadth while filling them in with significantly more detail. But it contains itself to the game's original engine and aesthetic—flappy-mouthed scientists and all. Currently, Half-Life Extended exists only in demo form, allowing you to play through four of the game's initial levels. If that seems like odd phrasing, it's because Extended lets you play through the Hazard Course tutorial, but skips the introductory tram ride, dropping you off directly outside Anomalous Materials. The changes are clear from the moment you step off the tram into Anomalous Materials' reception. This does not mean Half-Life: Extended is short on things to see. The changes are clear from the moment you step off the tram into Anomalous Materials' reception. This area has been given a much more elaborate desk setup a-la Black Mesa. But it's once you pass beyond this area where Half-Life: Extended sets itself apart. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The locker-room area has been completely reworked, now including shower cubicles and a much larger cafeteria. Entire new rooms have been added, such as a lab where hazmat-suit wearing scientists are handling radioactive material. Getting down to the test chamber requires you to pass through multiple new labs where unique experiments are being conducted. Even the test itself plays out differently, with you darting across gantries to trigger each new phase of the anti-mass spectrometer's activation before pushing that fateful sample into the beam. Running through these areas is a bizarre experience at times. Everything looks and sounds like Half-Life, and all the key plot points are present and correct, but everything is that much more filled in. I don't want to say \"It's like how you remember Half-Life\", partly because it's a hackneyed phrase, but also because it's not true. IknowAnomalous Materials didn't look like this, and yet everything in the mod's reimagining is so seamlessly integrated that it's hard to believe that. This continues through into Unforeseen Consequences, which intensifies that initial scramble for survival with new and expanded hazards. That bit where a computer rack nearly falls on you? Now there's a whole sequence where you dash through a cascade of exploding equipment. That radioactive substance you saw those hazmat fellas moving? Guess what's leaked all over the floor in that area. That bit where you jump across a bunch of dangling crates? Now you circle back to that area to rearrange the crates for a second crossing. There are also lots of little extra details that I appreciate. For example, when you drop deeper into the facility where the giant freight elevator is, the area you descend into is clearly a much older part of Black Mesa. The digital computers are replaced with tape-racks, and the health and HEV dispensers are of a different, more antiquated design. It is Office Complex, though, where the changes are most dramatic. It's much wider and more open-feeling than the original, with several elaborate new sequences to play through. Indeed, there's a whole side area you could easily miss, and doing so will mean you don't pick up the shotgun until much later in the level. It also feels more like a distinct part of the facility, with its own reception, admin wing, executive lounges, and security office. So does Half-Life: Extended make Valve's classic better? That feels like a dangerous assertion. There are things about Extended that I don't like. The mod adds a new enemy type that I didn't particularly enjoy fighting, while the freezer section at the end of Office Complex, which was never the best bit of Half-Life, is now even longer. Black Mesa's redux of the Interloper chapter demonstrated the perils of overegging a remake, and there are moments where Half-Life extended threatens to do the same. Regardless, I'm not really interested in which is better. What fascinates me, as I mentioned, is how naturally all this extra stuff folds into the vanilla experience. This is largely down to the careful work of the mod team. But I also think it has something to do with Half-Life itself. I've always been fascinated by how well Half-Life, and Black Mesa particularly suits supplementary storytelling. We've seen it from countless different perspectives both official and unofficial, and yet it never seems to lose its mystique or appeal. No matter how much you learn about it, there always feels like more to uncover. Its labs and corridors sprawling beneath the Arizona desert with endless, fathomless potential. In a way, it's comparable to collaborative internet fiction like SCP, with a structure and aesthetic that's specific enough to focus the imagination, but so long as you present it in the right way, anything could be going on down there. The expansions play a significant role in this. Because Opposing Force and Blue Shift show us the same story from new angles, they seeded this idea that Black Mesa stretches far deeper than what we see through Gordon Freeman's eyes. But this wouldn't have been possible if it were not for how Valve approached presenting the original, refusing to strictly codify Black Mesa as a space. While Half-Life is often heralded as the first step toward cinematic storytelling in games, its approach to telling that story is light and indirect, depicted visually with only a few spoken lines to contextualise what's happening. If Half-Life had been made today, every hazard sign and research device would have an attached lore codex explaining in detail why it was there and what its history was. Which is great for YouTube videos, but it makes it harder for players and, indeed, other developers to riff off a work in a way that feels true to the original. This is why I think modders are still obsessed with making new adventures within Black Mesa, nearly 30 years on from Half-Life's heyday. Half-Life changed the FPS with the story it told, but perhaps its bigger impact upon gaming was leaving the blast door open for other people to tell their version of it.

    "title": "14 years later, the best way to play Dark Souls is with the new Seamless co-op mod",
    "article_text": "FromSoftware’s legendary action RPG is better with friends. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Thanks to the efforts of one glorious modder, there’s a whole new reason to play Dark Souls again. TheSeamless co-op mod, released in April, lives up to its name just likeit did for Elden Ring. No longer do you have to sufferFromSoftware’s bizarre multiplayer functionality—you can finally take an uninterrupted road trip through Lordran with your friends like god intended, and I lost a whole weekend doing just that. Dark Souls deserved this all along. It’s a multiplayer game at heart: Playing solo you’ll run into the ghosts of other players sitting by bonfires or eating it to some nearby monster. There are factions dedicated to helping others out. Cooperation and community are embedded in its DNA, and it’s a shame that FromSoftware’s implementation of co-op is so damn fussy. NotYui’s Seamless co-op mod, however. It’s truly about as seamless as you can get for a mod: There are a set of files to drop into your Dark Souls: Remastered folder and a password to set, and then all you have to do is use an item to summon a friend and start playing. I played through the entirety ofElden Ringwith Seamless co-op, and the Dark Souls version feels identical. It can be hard to tell you’re playing with a mod at all. In an alternate universe this would’ve been the co-op mode that shipped with the game. Yui says she tried to “preserve the game’s challenge” by scaling up the difficulty of every enemy to make up for the fact that there’s more than one of you. It’s been a while since I’ve played vanilla Dark Souls, but the skeleton folk in Undead Burg were still slicing me apart like it was 2011. Thankfully, dying while someone else is still alive doesn’t cause enemies to respawn. You can just run back to where you were, minus a small chunk of your health bar. The mod is still considered to be in an alpha state, which means there are some bugs, like a dragon who refuses to stop torching a bridge you need to cross. A friend and I toppled the twin gargoyles and thegoat jerk with the two dogswithout running into anything game-breaking, though. In fact, the fussiest part of the experience wasn’t even the mod’s fault. Dark Souls is an extremely dense game compared to Elden Ring and is full of thin stairways and catwalks absolutely not up to code for more than a single person. We could play the game like speedrunners targeting specific items and locations out of the usual order people do them in. This proved to be a liability whenever enemies would ambush us in tight spaces. It was like being stuck in traffic with a mob of skeletons and dogs at our backs. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The rest of the game was essentially a revenge tour on all the enemies who made our first playthroughs a nightmare when we were still Dark Souls newbies. Those spear guys who hide behind their little shields? Try to block two of us, idiots. The gargoyle boss who calls for help on the rooftop? Dead before his buddy even showed up.Havel the Rock?We won’t talk about that. But for the most part, Lordran wasn’t ready for two people who have seen the future, know all its tricks. I was worried that it might be hard to go back to a FromSoft game without a dedicated jump button and a big open world to explore, but replaying Dark Souls in co-op reminded me of how close it is to what came later. Without the fear of getting annihilated by some random enemy and resetting all your progress as a solo player, the world feels infinite. We could play the game like speedrunners targeting specific items and locations out of the usual order people do them in. A detour into the forest for the anti-poison shield is much less daunting when you can tag team your way through its traps. And without the game kicking one of you out after every boss fight, you start to settle into roles. One of us would take the lead while the other would stay back and look for openings that would frequently save the other from getting crushed. It made me think about Dark Souls as if it were an open world game. Apart from not being able to freely teleport around, it was like playing a rudimentary Elden Ring. Peering over the stone walls of the Undead Burg and seeing the rest of the game below gives you the same rush that it does the first time you ascend Stormveil Castle. FromSoft has always been making open worlds that lure you to their farthest reaches, it just got more ambitious over time. Invasions are part of the package too. Having them enabled is a lot like playing on a harder difficulty where you pray you don’t get jumped by some other group on your way to a boss, just like the old days when Dark Souls PvP was still new. Unfortunately, you’re limited to people who are also using the mod, which means you can go a whole session without getting interrupted. Hopefully as the mod catches on, more people will show up. There’s nothing like seeing the invasion message on your screen while you’re on your last Estus flask and five steps away from a bonfire. The Seamless co-op mod keeps Dark Souls’ spirit alive without a ton of sacrifices. Playing as the invader has its own issues at this stage in the mod’s development. I warped into another person’s world and it seemingly caused them to spawn way below my location, leaving both of us in a kind of purgatory until I disconnected. I’m apparentlynot alone in this situation, and it’s possible it works fine further into the game. Given the volume of updates and work that went into the Elden Ring mod and the number of people posting their own PvP problems in the NexusMods comments, I don’t expect it’ll be long before invasions are restored to full working order. The Seamless co-op mod keeps Dark Souls’ spirit alive without a ton of sacrifices. It’s why I’d fully recommend it for anyone new to the series or not. It’s also why it continues to be tragic that FromSoft hasn’t figured this out on its own,despite not being opposed to the idea. I know so many people who would probably fall in love with its games if there was a way to hold a friend’s hand as they play without the frustration of the arcane summoning systems. Dark Souls may not be built to accommodate a whole group of players running around together (the mod supports up tosixplayers together at once), but nothing about a team of Chosen Undead goes against the themes of the game. You’re told over and over again by NPCs that you’ll go hollow if you give up on fighting for something. The fodder-like zombie enemies who sit with their head in their hands are a reminder of what that looks like. Playing Dark Souls alone can wear away your resolve, but having a friend to step in for you underlines what it’s always been about. There’s certainly a thrill to doing it all by yourself, especially when the alternative was such a pain. Braving the horrors with the Seamless co-op mod, however, convinced me that sharing the journey with a friend just as essential to the experience, if not more so all these years later.

    "title": "Black Mirror's interactive episode Bandersnatch is being removed from Netflix, as 'the technology has served its purpose'",
    "article_text": "Bandersnatch gets snatched from the service after the weekend. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, the anthology's interactive, choose-your-own (miserable) TV adventure, is being removed from Netflix on Monday, meaning you've got just a few more days to sample the series' most experimental episode. Set in 1984, Bandersnatch tells the story of Stefan, who makes a demo for a game called Bandersnatch based on a book once owned by his dead mother. The demo is picked up for a full release by game publisher Tuckersoft, bringing Stefan into the orbit of his personal hero, game designer Colin Ritman. Unlike most episodes of Black Mirror, how the story proceeds from there is up to you. At various interludes, you're able to make choices about how the narrative proceeds, leading to one of five endings with variations in between. True to both the series and the era of games the episode is inspired by, most of those decisions lead to horrible consequences. Bandersnatch was released in 2018, as part of a broader initiative within Netflix to create interactive, game-like experiences, with other branching narrative titles including Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend, andMinecraft: Story Mode, a Telltale game that was adapted to use Netflix's interactive streaming tech. Lately though, Netflix has pivoted toward folding in a more traditional gaming service into its subscription, offering an array of downloadable mobile games on the service such as theMonument Valleyseries and theThe Golden Idolgames. Last year, Netflix removed all but four of its interactive specials from the service, and Bandersnatch was one of those titles spared from the cull. Ahead of those specials being pulled, Netflix spokesperson Chrissy Kellehertold The Vergethat \"The technology served its purpose, but is now limiting as we focus on technological efforts in other areas.\" Keller didn't explain why the technology is \"limiting\", which is a shame as without that explanation, the removal is rather befuddling. Not only is Bandersnatch a unique entry in Black Mirror's anthology, it is as accomplished a Black Mirror episode as any of the others, well shot and directed, and just as darkly savage in its satire as the more conventional stories. Fortunately, Bandersnatch isn't the only Black Mirror episode to venture into the world of videogames. Prior to Bandersnatch, episodes like Playtest and USS Callister told gaming-adjacent stories. More recently,Playthingexplored the world of games journalism, revisiting creator Charlie Brooker's old writing haunt (and the first magazine I ever wrote for) PC Zone. That episode was also accompanied by a playable version of the game that features in the episode, a creature-rearing game calledThonglets. Black Mirror: Bandersnatch leaves Netflix on May 12.

    "title": "The best FPS of 2024 simply cannot stop adding new maps, introducing 37 new arenas, 4 new weapons, and a 'Horrible Smelly Head' in its latest update",
    "article_text": "Straftat keeps on giving. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Rarely have I been so instantly enamoured with a game asStraftat, a gleefully chaotic micro-FPS created by two brothers whocouldn't find a decent deathmatch shooter to play.Straftat pitches two players against each other in lightning-paced 1v1 duels. Less of a throwback and more of a distillation of the classic deathmatches of yore—particularly Half-Life with shades of Quake and Unreal in there too—it features dozens of weapons, 150 small yet wildly inventive maps, and a wonderful selection of hats, all for the low, low price of nothing. Straftat is quite possibly the best deal on Steam, the only paid element being an optional, $5/£4.29DLCthat almost doubles the map count and adds a bunch of other features. That deal got better in February when French developers Sirius and Léonard Lemaitre added a chunk of extra maps, and even better-er in April when they did the same again. Now, barely a month later, they've added another massive update to the game. The DLC & Maps update adds a total of 37 arenas, 4 new weapons, additional cosmetics, and a few quality of life features. Most of the new maps are for the free, base game. Themes include Valhalla—aerial maps with chequerboard floors and dusky illumination. There's also Stadium, where every layout is surrounded by stands and seating, and Cage Fight, which is exactly how it sounds. The most unusually named mas is \"Canliferous fluorspar\", which may sound like the Latin name for a Venus fly trap, but it is in fact a rather fetching night-time map with Mediterranean-ish architecture. Some of these maps are remixed versions of vanilla maps added with the update. But it still amounts to more than 20 entirely new arenas to explore. Indeed, only 4 of the 37 maps are reserved for the DLC, including a Pig farm and so called \"Surf Maps\". The four new weapons, meanwhile, are a stun mine, a stun grenade, a \"Bayshore\", and an Aboubi Head, which is a head of the sickly-green, chain-smoking humanoids you play as in Straftat. The addition of stun weapons is particularly enticing to me, as I can imagine how these might facilitate some fiendish ambush play in those Straftat maps with lots of blind corners. Alongside the maps and weapons are several more specific new features. All players get a new racing system in the training ground, letting them indulge in parkour challenges and time attack speedruns. More importantly, though, the map selection menufinallyhas a search bar, which will make creating a custom map playlist a whole lot easier. DLC owners, meanwhile, gain access to the map fromBabbdi—the Lemaitre Brothers' previous game—as a special training area, and also get an optional weapon randomiser for all maps, which is a pretty huge feature given how much replayability it adds. Oh, and there are also a bunch of DLC exclusive cosmetics, including six new jiggly hats and a \"Horrible Smelly Head\". Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. If that doesn't entice you to spend $5 on the DLC, I don't know what will. But even if it doesn't, there's still a huge amount of fun to be had with basic, free Straftat. The Lemaitre Brothers also casually dropped the news of more major updates coming soon, including a 4-player free-for-all mode and 2v2 Team Deathmatch. Some of the new maps already seem designed to accommodate four players, but I've no doubt these features will be bundled in with yet more arenas, too, as these geometry-brained kids simply cannot be stopped from mapping. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom.

    "article_text": "Ghost Bear: Flash Storm adds 12 missions, eight new mechs, and two new punctuation marks. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I love a clunky-ass videogame title. Some may argue that videogame names should be kept simple and punchy, likeDoomorQuakeorBioShock. I would counter that your videogame isn'ttrulya videogame unless the name has at least two punctuation marks in it. I'm talkingVampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines, or my personal favourite, The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners – Chapter 2: Retribution. If you don't have to pause for breath while saying it, it isn't a proper videogame. MechWarrior 5: Clansis relatively mundane as titles go, but the newly released expansion for Piranha Games' mech shooter elevates it to wondrous new levels of silliness. The DLC is calledMechWarrior 5: Clans – Ghost Bear: Flash Storm, which is objectively the greatest name for a game ever. What is a Ghost Bear? Why is there a Flash Storm? I must know the answer to these questions! In fairness, Ghost Bear: Flash Storm has considerably more to it than a silly name. This is a beefy expansion that adds a whole new campaign to MechWarrior 5, one that sees you piloting the mechs of Clan Ghost Bear's Silveroot Keshik (that's my first question answered) an elite squad of mech pilots dedicated to demonstrating the glory of their ursine spectre tribe. The new campaign features 12 missions that'll see you fight for control of the planet Alshain, a world heavily industrialised for mech production. You'll also take the fight beyond the planet's atmosphere, warring for dominance over orbital factories and fighting on the hull of the Ghost Bear's command ship, the grizzly. I love a game that lets me fight on theoutsideof a spaceship. It's whyCall of Duty: Infinite Warfareis my favourite CoD campaign since 4. The expansion also brings eight new pilotable mechs, four of these are OmniMechs — the Night Gyr, Ebon Jaguar, Fire Moth, and Huntsman. The other four are battlemechs—the 100-ton Kodiak assault mech, 35-ton scout Jenner IIC, 50-ton Hunchback IIC (for my money, one of the most iconic silhouettes in BattleTech), and 65-ton Rifleman IIC. You'll be able to customise these hulking war machines in an expanded mechlab, where you'll even be able to swap the engines of your colossal bipedal tanks. Ghost Bear: Flash Storm is available now for $20 (£16.75). If you've yet to sample the delights of vanilla MechWarrior 5: Clans, PC Gamer contributor Jonathan Bolding had a pretty great time with it when hereviewedit last year, judging its focussed narrative campaign to be worth the loss of more sandbox-oriented play. \"Though the lack of sandbox play is most felt when you're still itching for more at the end, I still loved the bombastic cinematics and intimate character moments that Clans chose over endless procedural content.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Timberborn's latest update adds ziplines and tubeways for rapid beaver deployment and stops your rodent residents from throwing down in sudden fits of breakdancing",
    "article_text": "Update 7 also overhauls terrain and adds tunnels. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Timberbornis yet another example of just how brilliant the city-building genre is right now. Mechanistry's beaver-themed management sim lets you construct a water-powered metropolis for the world's most engineeringly-minded rodent, constructing dams and aqueducts, powering your city with waterwheels. All that, and it's still in early access, with subsequent updates addingmechanised beaversand disgusting polluted water. Now, a whole new update has arrived, and it folds in some pretty dramatic features to the city builder. Update 7—Ziplines and Tubeways adds two whole new ways to move your beavers around your city, as well as making fundamental changes to how cities can be constructed, as well as a few other goodies. Let's address those new modes of conveyance first. The ziplines and tubeways are divided between the two beaver factions Timberborn lets you play as—the nature-loving Folktails and the industrially-focused Iron Teeth. The Folktails get access to ziplines, which function similarly to regular pathways, but move beavers 2.5 times faster than walking and are obviously elevated, letting them pass over structures. Ziplines begin at a zipline station, and are connected to tall zipline pylons, or smaller zipline beams designed for navigation through more densely built-up areas. Naturally, this means that the tubeways are reserved for the Iron Teeth. According to Mechanistry'sSteam postabout the update, tubeways require \"a little more careful setup than ziplines\", presumably because they can't pass over buildings in the same way (though it seems they can pass underground for short sections). Once built, however, tubeways will move beavers at four times normal speed. Tubeways likewise have their own stations, and are built from horizontal and vertical tubes. Alongside these new modes of transport, update 7 brings an overhaul to terrain, to make it truly 3D. \"While the in-game terrain has always been made of little 3D cubes, you could only place them one atop another,\" Mechanistry explains. \"With update 7, terrain blocks go on all Solid surfaces—roofs, platforms, and overhangs.\" This means you can do things like grow crops on top of buildings like lodges and warehouses, and construct buildings beneath overhangs and even inside caves. This new terrain system also brings several subsidiary features. Beavers can now build tunnels directly through terrain, so you no longer have to construct meandering pathways around or over mountains. In addition, Mechanistry has expanded the functionality of its layer tool, enabling you to scroll through terrain slices in sequence to peek inside caves, tunnels and so forth. Other improvements include \"adaptive\" power shafts that make it easier to rejig power grids, revised game maps designed to facilitate the 3D terrain and new transport buildings, and a substantial list of balance and bug fixes. I'm only going to highlight one of these here, but it's a doozy: \"Fixed units breakdancing when traversing and rotating multiple sets of stairs\". Bug or not, I cannot fathom why you wouldremovebreakdancing beavers from your game. I'm starting a petition. Mechanistry, let those beavers throw down! Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. All told, it's another impressive update for Mechanistry's beaver building sim. There's no word on what Update 7 represents in terms of pushing Timberborn toward completion. But if Mechanistry keep adding updates of this scope and quality, it can keep Timberborn in early access as long as it darn well pleases. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom.

    "title": "The Final Fantasy Magic set will have 15 different Cids, and you can have them all in your deck at once",
    "article_text": "It'll also have four different versions of Cloud's date. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In the same way that, no matter what their setting, many of the Final Fantasy games have a duo named Biggs and Wedge in them, most of them have a Cid. Final Fantasy 7's Cid Highwind is the pilot of your plane, while Final Fantasy 16's Cidolfus Telamon is the outlaw whose hideaway becomes your base. They might be inventors or scientists, and they're often responsible for getting you the airship you use to cross the map at speed, but they're always Cid. Magic: The Gathering's Final Fantasy set will represent many of the Cids of the series with a card called Cid, Timeless Artificer, which powers up artifact creatures and heroes you control. And, in defiance of the normal rule that limits you to four copies of the same card per deck—not counting basic land cards—you can have as many copies of Cid, Timeless Artificer in your deck as you want. And there are plenty to choose from, with 15 depictions of different Cids from across the games. If you want the OG from Final Fantasy 2 he's here in his shoulderpadded glory, as is Cid Del Norte Marguez from Final Fantasy 6 rocking the cloak that makes him look like a banana, and Cid Fabool IX from Final Fantasy 9 with his incredible moustache. Honestly, they're all fashion icons in their own way. Another card from the set that has multiple treatments is Secret Rendezvous, which represents Cloud's date at the Gold Saucer in Final Fantasy 7. While it's a straightforward card that lets you and an opponent both draw three cards, it comes in four different versions—one for each of Cloud's potential dates in that scene, whether he ends up enjoying a romantic moment with Aerith, Tifa, Yuffie, or Barret. Final Fantasy x Magic: The Gathering will be released on June 13, and will have four preconstructed commander decks, with Cloud, Terra, Tidus, and Y'shtola from Final Fantasy 14 as their commanders. It'll be the first of Magic's Universes Beyond crossover sets to be legal in the standard format, as will future crossovers like Spider-Man andAvatar: The Last Airbender.

    "article_text": "Help with solving Sunday's puzzle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Win your dailyWordlegame your way, with our help. Need tips? We've got a fantastic quick list to refresh your guessing techniques. Maybe you'd like to take a look at our May 11 (1422) clue instead? No problem, just scroll through and you'll see it. How about a peek at today's answer for a speedy win? We'll never tell a soul. Enjoy yourself.I always had just enough new information to be wrong in a new and exciting way on my next row today. It's a roundabout way of reaching the answer (averyroundabout way), but as it got me there in the end I can't really complain. Not too much, anyway. This tiny wooden peg is a staple of flat pack furniture kits, and used to join two different parts together. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. If you've decided to play Wordle but you're not sure where to start, I'll help set you on the path to your first winning streak. Make all your guesses count and become a Wordle winner with these quick tips: You're not racing against the clock so there's no reason to rush. In fact, it's not a bad idea to treat the game like a casual newspaper crossword and come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Sometimes stepping away for a while means you can come back with a fresh perspective. Looking for this? The answer to the May 11 (1422) Wordle isDOWEL. Previous Wordle solutions can help to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer isn't likely to be repeated. They can also give you some solid ideas for starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Here are some recent Wordle answers: There are six rows of five boxes presented to you by Wordle each day, and you'll need to work out which five-letter word is hiding among them to win the daily puzzle. Start with a strong wordlike ALIVE—or any other word with a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You should also avoid starting words with repeating letters, so you don't waste the chance to confirm or eliminate an extra letter. Once you've typed your guess and hit Enter, you'll see which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the first, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you might have missed on the first row—just don't forget to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the correct word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words and don't forget letters can repeat too (eg: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

In October of 2022, popular personality-led gaming site Giant Bomb was bought by Fandom, the multi-headed wiki-hosting hydra, at the same time as Fandom acquired GameSpot, Metacritic, and GameFAQs. Conflict between Fandom and the opiniated editors of Giant Bomb arose this year when the publication of new content was put on hold as part of a\"strategic reset and realignment\"of Fandom's brands. Subsequently, an episode of Giant Bomb's podcast in which the hosts made fun of Fandom's brand safety concerns was taken down, and several senior members of the site's staff announced they wouldn't be working for Giant Bomb any more. An unexpected reversal of fortunes was announced at PAX East, whereduring a Giant Bomb panelit was revealed that Fandom had sold Giant Bomb to two of its staff, Jeff Bakalar and Jeff Grubb, who will be running it as an independent operation from now on. As Bakalar and Grubb put it in ajoint statement, \"Giant Bomb is now owned by the people who make Giant Bomb, and it would not have been possible without the speedy efforts of Fandom and our mutual agreement on what's best for fans and creators.\" As Fandom's own statement explained, \"Fandom has made the strategic decision to transition Giant Bomb back to its independent roots and the brand has been acquired by longtime staff and content creators, Jeff Bakalar and Jeff Grubb, who will now own and operate the site independently.\" During the PAX East panel, it was made clear that Bakalar and Grubb will keep the site's archives and will run the site independently, with funding coming viasubscriptionsandmerch sales.

    "article_text": "The crossover vortex draws in new victims. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Asymmetric multiplayer horror game Dead by Daylight celebrated its ninth anniversary with a chonky livestream broadcast from PAX East where a screaming crowd of Dead-heads reacted to the announcements of upcoming additions and collaborations. Among them was a couple details about thepreviously announced Five Nights at Freddy's collaboration, which will bring the villain of those games, Springtrap, into Dead by Daylight as a new killer called the Animatronic. The crossover will also include a legendary skin for the Animatronic based on the Yellow Rabbit from the Five Nights at Freddy's movie, with voice lines provided by Matthew Lillard. A bunch of upcoming cosmetic collections were announced, but the most interesting one for us was the announcement of six Witcher-themed outfits. One's a Geralt of Rivia skin for Vittorio Toscano, complete with voice lines recorded by Doug Cockle, and there's also a Leshen skin for the Artist. Those are both legendary outfits, but there are also four very rare outfits adding Yennefer (for Kate Denson), Ciri (for Sable Ward), Triss (for Mikaela Reid), and Eredin (for the Knight). The Witcher collection will be available on June 3, but there will also be Witcher-themed rewards for an upcoming Chaos Shuffle event including a Tub Geralt player card. Other collabs coming up for Dead by Daylight include The Boulet Brothers' Dragula, returning the favor for its Dead by Daylight episode, and a couple more outfits for the Tomb Raider collection. Looking at the roadmap to year 10, you might spot some grayed-out letters that spell \"THE ONES WHO LIVE\", which is the name of The Walking Dead TV show's spin-off/continuation, so I guess we can expect a collection themed around that as well.

    "title": "Chinese researchers develop silicon-free transistor technology, claimed to be fastest and most efficient ever - here's what we know",
    "article_text": "New 2D chip breakthrough may crush silicon chips forever When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Chinese researchers at Peking University have announced what seems like a breakthrough in transistor design, which if commercialized, could dramatically shift the direction of microprocessor development. The team created a silicon-free transistor based on a two-dimensional material, bismuth oxyselenide. The innovation hinges on the gate-all-around (GAAFET) architecture, where the transistor’s gate wraps completely around the source. Traditional FinFET designs, which dominate current silicon-based processors, only allow partial gate coverage. This full-wrap structure enhances the contact area between the gate and the channel, improving performance by reducing energy leakage and enabling better current control. Published inNature Materials, the paper suggests that the new 2D GAAFET could rival or even surpass silicon transistors in both speed and energy efficiency. The researchers claim their 2D transistor achieves speeds 40% faster thanIntel’s latest 3nm chips while using 10% less power, performance which would place it ahead of current processors from TSMC andSamsung. The partial gate coverage in traditional designs limits current control and increases energy loss. The new full-gate structure addresses these issues, resulting in high voltage gain and ultra-low power usage. The team has already constructed small logic units using the new design. “It is the fastest, most efficient transistor ever,” said Peking University. These claims are supported by tests conducted under identical conditions to those used for leading commercial chips. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “If chip innovations based on existing materials are considered a ‘shortcut,’ then our development of 2D material-based transistors is akin to ‘changing lanes,’” said Professor Peng Hailin, the project’s lead scientist. Unlike the vertical structures of FinFETs, the new design resembles interwoven bridges. This architectural shift may overcome miniaturization limits faced by silicon technology, especially as the industry pushes below the 3nm threshold. It could also benefit thefastest laptopsthat require such compact chips. The team developed two new bismuth-based materials: Bi₂O₂Se as the semiconductor and Bi₂SeO₅ as the gate dielectric. These materials feature low interface energy, reducing defects and electron scattering. “This allows electrons to flow with almost no resistance, like water through a smooth pipe,” Peng explained. The performance results are backed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and validated through physical tests using a high-precision fabrication platform at PKU. The researchers claim the transistors can be manufactured using current semiconductor infrastructure, simplifying future integration.

    "article_text": "No, Zendaya, Elon Musk, and Cristiano Ronaldo are not trying to steal your crypto When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A new wave ofmalwareattacks is targeting Bitcoin and crypto owners through Facebook ads that mimic trusted names in the industry. Bitdefender says it has uncovered a multi-stage malvertising campaign that exploits the reputations of well-known platforms like Binance, TradingView, ByBit, and others. These malicious ads don’t just trick users, they also adapt in real time to avoid detection and deliver malware only when conditions are ideal for the attackers. The scheme begins when cybercriminals hijack or create Facebook accounts and use Meta’s ad network to run fraudulent promotions. These ads feature fake offers and use photos of celebrities - Zendaya, Elon Musk, and Cristiano Ronaldo are the usual suspects - to appear more convincing. Once clicked, users are redirected to lookalike websites that impersonate legitimate cryptocurrency services and prompt them to download what appears to be a desktop client. The malware delivery system is highly evasive. Bitdefender says the front-end of the fake site works with a local server quietly spun up by the initial install, allowing attackers to send payloads directly to the victim's system while dodging most security software. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Delivery only happens if the victim meets specific criteria, such as being logged into Facebook, using a preferred browser likeMicrosoftEdge, or matching a certain demographic profile. Some malware samples run lightweight .NET servers locally and communicate with the website using advanced scripts that execute encoded PowerShell commands. These can exfiltrate sensitive data like installed software, system and OS info, and even GPU details. Depending on the findings, the malware may download further payloads or simply go dormant if it suspects it's being analyzed in a sandbox. Bitdefender researchers found hundreds of Facebook accounts promoting these campaigns. One ran more than 100 ads in a single day. Many ads target men aged 18 and older, with examples found in Bulgaria and Slovakia. Scrutinize ads carefully: Be highly skeptical of ads offering free crypto tools or financial perks. Always verify links before clicking. Download from official sources only: Visit platforms like Binance or TradingView directly.Nevertrust redirects from ads. Use link-checking tools:Tools like Bitdefender Scamio or Link Checker can alert you to dangerous URLs before you engage. Keep your security software up to date:Use areputable antivirusthat gets regular updates to catch evolving threats. Watch for suspicious browser behavior:Pages that insist you use Edge or redirect erratically are massive red flags. Report shady ads:Flag suspicious content on Facebook to help others avoid falling into the same trap. Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

A pocket-sized Windows PC in a folding keyboard might sound like a concept device, but a new mini machine from China appears to be very real. Designed by a company calledLinglong, this foldable Ryzen-poweredmini PCfits in a jacket or (large) trouser pocket, unfolds into a full-sized keyboard, and runs a fullWindows 11Pro desktop. Weighing under 800g and roughly the size of a quarter-sheet of A4 paper when folded, the unit is aimed at anyone who wants portability without sacrificing functionality. Once opened, the PC reveals a full QWERTY keyboard with physical switches and a chassis made from CNC-machined aluminium. There’s no touchpad or ThinkPad-style pointing nub, so a separate mouse is required, but the mechanical travel and durability - rated to 100,000 keystrokes - suggest it’s built for serious use. At the heart of the system is anAMDRyzen 7 7840U processor, paired with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM and either 512GB or 1TB of storage. Graphics are handled by integrated RDNA3-based Radeon 780M, and a 16000mAh internal battery powers the device for up to 10 hours. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Despite its small form factor, the unit includes a respectable selection of ports: USB4, USB-C 3.2, and USB-A 3.2, along with Bluetooth 5.2, Wi-Fi 6, and an HDMI-compatible USB display option. The device supports multi-screen output and can be docked to serve as a travel workstation, game center, or media hub. A built-in monitoring utility displays CPU and GPU load, temperature, and other stats in real time. Only available in China for now (I share your disappointment), the Linglong mini PC reminds me of theOrange Pi 800keyboard computer. While it lacks global availability or official support for Western markets, it’s an ambitious reimagining of what portable computing can look like and I can only hope it gets a wider release soon or sparks similar designs elsewhere.

We're ready and waiting for theSamsung Galaxy S25 Edgeto finally get its full unveiling tomorrow, but ahead of the official event we've got another leak that points to how much this smartphone is going to cost. Well-known tipster@MysteryLupinhas posted a screengrab of a retailer listing for the phone, which gives us another look at the super-thin chassis that the Galaxy S25 Edge will sport – a design we got our first glimpse of back in January. The listing is for the model with 256GB of storage, which we presume is going to be the cheapest one available. Head over to ourSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra reviewand you'll see the storage options there start at 256GB. According to this leak, the price for a 256GB Galaxy S25 Edge phone is going to be £1,099 (about $1,465 / AU$2,275) – that's less than the Ultra model in the UK, but significantly more than you'll pay for the standardSamsung Galaxy S25, which costs $859 / £859 / AU$1,399 with 256GB of storage.

We're firmly in spoiler territory now, but read on if you want to know what the four theme answers are for today's NYT Connections puzzles… Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. What are the answers for today's NYT Connections groups? Right, the answers are below, so DO NOT SCROLL ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM. The answers to today's Connections, game #701, are… I solved today's NYT Connections in the hallowed 'reverse rainbow' order, but it was tough going. Those dastardly puzzle setters at the NYT threw in plenty of red herrings, with PLACES TO FIND PAPER MONEY a particular problem. It all looked so easy early on – I spotted ATM, CASH REGISTER, TIP JAR and WALLET right away. But I also had PURSE and BANK, and couldn't decide which four of those six went together. My idea was that they would be 'places you can keep money' – meaning BANK would be in there, but not TIP JAR or ATM – or 'places you can get money from', which would mean including BANK and PURSE, but not TIP JAR or CASH REGISTER (unless you are a store assistant, of course). After two mistakes on that yellow group I moved on, and solved the more difficult purple, blue and green groups, meaning I got the supposedly easiest one last by default. Maybe my brain was just working backwards today. How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers. It's playable for free via theNYT Games siteon desktop or mobile.

    "title": "I tested the LG C5 OLED TV - here are 3 upgrades I’d like to see in next year’s model",
    "article_text": "Better brightness, sound, and reflection handling When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. LG’s C-series OLEDs have been a popular TV range over the past few years, delivering brilliant picture quality, great gaming performance and features, and an intuitive smart TV platform, usually at the best price in the mid-rangeOLEDcategory. The new LG C5 continues this trend, and it’s among thebest TVsreleased this year. I gave the C5 five out of five stars in myLG C5 review, finding that it covered every base when it came to picture quality, gaming performance and smart TV features. As good as the LG C5 is, there is an elephant in the room that needs to be addressed: the C5 is notthatmuch of an upgrade over its predecessor, the LG C4. Certainly not compared to the leap between the LG C4 and its predecessor, the LG C3, which involved a complete performance and picture quality overhaul. As a result, the C4 remains in the top slot on many of our best-of TV lists, such as thebest OLED TVs, as there’s not enough of an upgrade with the C5 to justify the current price gap between the two. Looking ahead to next year’s C-series (most likely called the LG C6), here are three upgrades I think would enable it to make a bigger splash at launch than this year’s C5. Brightness has traditionally been a weak point for OLED TVs. You can expect around 1,000 nits peak brightness with most mid-range OLEDs, which is less than what you get with most mini-LED and even some LED TVs. Having that extra peak brightness can give a TV’s picture a niceHDRpunch with movies, while higher fullscreen brightness allows it to perform better with programs like sports and for general daytime viewing. When I tested the C5, I measured its peak brightness at 1,180 nits in Filmmaker Mode, a respectable result for a mid-range OLED, and a 10% increase over the C4. But its fullscreen brightness measured at 195 nits, alowerresult than the C4, which hit 199 nits. Recent flagship OLED TVs, such as the LG G5, hit over 300 nits fullscreen brightness, a marked improvement (although still less than most mini-LEDs). It would be nice to see results like this in more mid-range OLEDs such as the future LG C6. It’s no secret that many TVs have weak built-in sound that can be easily topped by one of thebest soundbars, even a budget one. For some, though, a soundbar isn’t an option, and they choose to rely on their TV’s built-in sound. LG’s C-series OLEDs typically have average built-in sound quality that doesn’t match up to the picture. Sadly, that continues with the LG C5. I found the C5’s sound to be better than previous C-series iterations when I tested it, but it certainly couldn’t take on some of thebest TVs for soundfrom the likes ofPanasonic,Sonyand Philips. Even a slight improvement over the C5’s 2.2-channel, 40W speaker array would be welcome. A stronger built-in subwoofer, perhaps, or the addition of up-firing or side-firing speakers for greater immersion would give a C6 a step-up over the C5. Screen glare is another challenge OLED TVs struggle with. Due to dimmer fullscreen brightness and a lack of anti-reflection measures, mirror-like reflections can be a real curse for OLEDs in brighter viewing environments. That situation changed somewhat in 2024 when theSamsung S95Dwith its OLED Glare Free anti-reflection tech was introduced. During my testing of the S95D, I found that dark movies such asThe Batmancould even be viewed in rooms with bright overhead lighting. Black levels were sacrificed in this scenario, butI’ve seen the new Samsung S95F with OLED Glare Free 2.0, and it looks to fix this issue. The S95F is a pricey flagship OLED TV, so I wouldn’t expect the same measures in a mid-range OLED like the LG C-series. Improved anti-reflection measures would be welcome in next year’s C6, however, since I found during testing that the C5 struggled with screen reflections. LG has already pulled this off with the flagship LG G5 OLED, which did a fantastic job of limiting reflections in our testing space. If the company can find a way to bring that benefit to the C6, it could be a game-changer. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "article_text": "Multiple-job juggling becomes easier with remote work tools When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Remote work has opened the door to a growing trend of employees secretly holding multiple full-time jobs, a practice known as polygamous working or being “overemployed.” While having multiple jobs isn't illegal, doing so without disclosure often breaches contracts, strains productivity, and can pose legal and ethical issues. HR Magazinenotes, “Moonlighting in this way can have serious consequences. It’s not just about reduced productivity; there’s a real risk of employee burnout, misuse of company resources, data security breaches and overall erosion of trust in the workplace.\" The rise of flexible and hybrid work models means many roles can now be done without ever stepping into an office. “The practice has boomed since the Covid pandemic triggered a rise in working from home, creating an opportunity for shrewd employees to take on multiple remote roles – sometimes as many as three or four at once,” reportsThe Telegraph. One woman, going by the name \"Nadia\", told the paper she earned £87,000 working two jobs simultaneously from her home office. On Reddit and TikTok, thousands share tips on managing multiple roles, with some workers boasting about using mouse jigglers and dual laptops to juggle overlapping meetings. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! One British influencer claimed: \"It worked for me, it was great. I was able to do really nice things and take care of myself, go to nice places, save up for property.\" But experts warn of the risks. “These issues can quickly escalate into legal and reputational disasters,”HR Magazinenoted, suggesting “ongoing or periodic rescreening” of employees can help manage risk and protect both workers and employers. In some cases, fraud charges have been brought -The i Paperclaims one man was sentenced to a year in prison after being paid for two full-time contracts over 10 months. Peter Boolkah, a business coach, toldThe Telegraphof the dangers of polygamous working. “It could mean small business-owners find their employees off work sick more because of burnout,\" he said. \"Those who stay working two jobs will be overstretched. Inevitably, this will lead to lower productivity for businesses, and those who are off sick will find themselves back where they started, with less money than before.” Whether a symptom of economic necessity or opportunism, polygamous working raises urgent questions about trust, governance, and the sustainability of remote-first work culture.

    "article_text": "Some backtracking When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Premium fitness company Whoop showed offsome shiny new wearablesthis week, and has now confirmed that existing users with more than 12 months left on their subscription can get hold of the new devices free of charge. As reported byBloomberg, the company was facing a backlash from users after initially charging a $49 upgrade fee – a fee that broke a promise made last year, in a now-deleted blog post, that subscribers would get new devices without paying extra There was plenty of vitriol directed towards Whoop overon Redditandsocial media, from users who expected to get the new bands for free within their current subscription. That's now the case again, after Whoopdecided to reverse course. \"Like any company, we from time to time update our commercial policies,\" a Whoop spokesperson toldBloomberg. The company emphasizes that there's also a newly introduced $199 / £169 / AU$299 per year plan, which is the least expensive yet. There are now three pricing tiers for Whoop: the one mentioned above, Whoop One, plus Whoop Peak ($239 / £229 / AU$419 per year) and Whoop Life ($359 / £349 / AU$629 per year. The most expensive option gets you a Whoop MG (Medical Grade) band, otherwise you get a Whoop 5.0, included in the subscription. Paying more gets you some additional features. If you're sticking with your Whoop 4.0 wearable, you miss out on a few of the features in the new subscriptions, including physiological age estimates and women's health tracking. There's lots that's new in the 2025 devices, including ECG readings and blood pressure estimates, and the screen-less wearables also offer 14-day battery life. However, existing users feel they're being pushed into an upgrade. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It's not been the most well communicated of u-turns from Whoop, and it's part of the growing trend for fitness companies toput features behind paywallsto get as much money as possible out of users.

    "title": "I'd jump at the chance to swap my 24-inch LCD monitor for this 25-inch color E Ink alternative – if only I could afford it",
    "article_text": "At least one of my three screens should be easy on the eyes, shouldn't it? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Boox, the maker of some of thebest ereadersand E Ink writing tablets, has just announced its first ever color PC monitor. Called the Boox Mira Pro, it uses a 25.3-inch E Ink Kaleido 3 display that emulates the look of paper – a screen technology that's already in use in several popular ereaders, including theKindle Colorsoftand theKobo Libra Colour. Like ereaders, the Mira Pro is front lit rather than having backlighting like on LCD screens, with the ability to adjust both brightness and the light temperature (warm or cold). There's also a dedicated refresh button to minimize ghosting which can be a major problem on e-paper displays. This paper-like panel will also reduce reflections and glare. To bolster its monitor credentials, the Mira Pro also features a pair of built-in speakers and five ports, including USB-C, HDMI, mini HDMI and DisplayPort. You can also get a Mira Pro version to support theoperating systemyou use, whether that's Windows, Mac or Linux. That's about it for the Mira Pro's main credentials, which is essentially a color version of the black-and-white Boox Mira that was launched in 2023. I'm a huge proponent of ereaders because of the E Ink screens they use, whether in grayscale or color. For avid readers like me, they're 'easy on the eyes', allowing you to read right until bedtime. So wouldn't it be nice if there was a capable E Ink PC monitor that didn't strain the eyes as much for the approximately eight hours I spend working? As a photographer, I wouldn't use an E Ink screen to edit my photos as the colors would be too soft and unsaturated, but I can absolutely see it fitting into my workflow in the office, which is predominantly as an editor of articles for TechRadar. It would replace the aging 24-inchDellmonitor I currently have set up in the vertical orientation specifically for editing articles because it has major viewing-angle issues. Checking drafts written in a Google Document by one of the writers on my team would be fantastic on an E Ink display. I've already tried doing so on an E Ink screen, albeit on the 10-inch one on theBoox Go 10.3as it allows me to log into my Google Drive account. However, it's not the easiest device to type on (and I can't write on Google Docs on it), so a dedicated monitor that seamlessly connects with my MacBook and other peripherals would be nice indeed. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It's the limited use of an E Ink display that has me questioning its launch price of $1,899.99 / AU$2, 499 (about £1,400). I'm also a little concerned with how well the E Ink Kaleido 3 display on the Mira Pro might have been optimized to display the 4,096 colors in its palette. While color Boox ereaders are good – and I've tested many of them – I think Kobo has done a better job of making full use of the Kaleido 3 tech. So while the Mira Pro might be just enough for my specific use case, I suspect other users would find it lacking. Moreover, based on my previous experience with Boox ereaders (color or monochrome), the company hasn't always been able to minimize ghosting – except on theBoox Palma– despite offering multiple refresh rates that can be applied on a per-application basis. Would the refresh button be any better? Well, I can't say for sure as I've not tried either the Mira or the Mira Pro. As high as the price might seem, particularly taking into consideration the limitations of such a screen, it does seem to be kinda, sorta on par with ereader prices. For example, 10-inch monochrome E Ink writing tablets like the2024 Kindle Scribeand thereMarkable 2sell for upwards of $400 / £370 / AU$600, while the colorreMarkable Paper Pro(which uses a custom version of the newer E Ink Gallery 3 technology) will set you back $579 / £559 / AU$929 with the basic Marker. Extrapolate these prices for a 25-inch display and throw in the cost of the stand and I can see why it's priced so high. And customers in the US will need to also take into consideration any potential tariffs, so expect to pay more than the listed launch price. Despite the high price, I'd be very excited to have something like that on my desk.

    "title": "Trump announces gesture of ‘good faith’ by Hamas",
    "article_text": "Hamas has agreed to release Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier and the last known living US hostage held in Gaza, following negotiations with the United States, President Donald Trump has announced. Alexander was abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in over 1,200 deaths and the capture of approximately 250 hostages. In a statement on Sunday, Hamas said that Alexander would be released“as part of efforts towards a ceasefire”and to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza. “I am happy to announce that Edan Alexander, an American citizen who has been held hostage since October 2023, is coming home to his family,”Trump wrote on Truth Social, expressing gratitude to“all those involved,”without mentioning Israel. “This was a step taken in good faith toward the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,”he added. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to arrive in Israel to oversee the release. “We are picking him up probably tomorrow,”Witkoff told NBC News on Sunday.“There was a long negotiation with lots of people to thank,”he said, noting that the gesture of goodwill became possible“in large part”because of Trump. The latest round of negotiations in Doha, conducted largely without Israel’s involvement, was facilitated through indirect talks between Hamas and the US, mediated by Egypt and Qatar. Both mediators praised the development as“a gesture of goodwill and a positive step toward resuming negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.” Israeli forces resumed their offensive in Gaza in March following the collapse of a previous ceasefire – which Trump also claimed credit for. Israel accused Hamas of refusing to release the remaining 24 hostages believed to be alive, while Hamas blamed West Jerusalem for stalling talks aimed at ending a war that has claimed more than 50,000 Palestinian lives, most of them civilians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently announced that the country’s security cabinet had approved a new“forceful”plan to destroy Hamas, adding that Gaza’s population“will be moved, to protect it.”According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Israeli forces have already restricted access to 70 percent of Gaza through no-go zones and forced displacement orders. In February, Trump advocated for the“voluntary”relocation of Palestinians from Gaza to countries such as Jordan and Egypt, arguing that it would enable the enclave’s transformation into a resort destination. Netanyahu called it a“remarkable idea”that should be“pursued.”",

    "title": "Trump to accept luxury ‘flying palace’ gift plane from Qatar – media",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump is poised to accept a super luxury Boeing 747-8 from the Qatari royal family, multiple American media outlets reported on Sunday. The aircraft is expected to be refurbished into the new Air Force One. The gift is expected to be announced next week, sources familiar with the arrangement told ABC News. Given that a new commercial Boeing 747-8 costs around $400 million, the aircraft is likely to become the most valuable gift ever extended to the US by a foreign government. Trump toured a luxury plane of the same model, reportedly formerly owned by the Qatari royal family, back in February, when it was parked at Palm Beach International Airport in Florida. The planned gift has reportedly been assessed by lawyers for the White House counsel’s office and the Department of Justice, who deemed it legal and not in violation of bribery laws or the Constitution’s prohibition on US government officials receiving gifts“from any King, Prince or foreign State.”Attorney General Pam Bondi and Trump’s top White House lawyer David Warrington concluded that receiving the aircraft would be admissible on the condition that it ends up being donated to Trump’s presidential library before the end of his tenure, sources told ABC. The plane, popularly known as the“flying palace”is expected to undergo a lengthy process of being checked for spy devices and being retrofitted into a proper Air Force One and is likely to only be commissioned shortly before the end of Trump’s presidential term. Texas-based defense contractor L3Harris has already been tapped to retrofit the plane, according to the Wall Street Journal. The White House currently has two aging Boeing 747-200 jumbo jets that were commissioned in the early 1990s. They have reportedly been plagued by assorted technical issues, and the White House has been seeking to replace them for some time already. A contract with Boeing to deliver two new Air Force One planes, however, has run into repeated delays and suffered from ballooning costs. The planes based on the 747-8 model were originally scheduled for delivery in 2024, but the deadline ended up pushed back to 2027 or even 2028. Trump lamented the situation with Air Force One shortly after his tour of the 747-8 plane, criticizing the aircraft-making giant for the delays.“No, I’m not happy with Boeing. It takes them a long time to do, you know, Air Force One, we gave that contract out a long time ago,”Trump said at the time, stating he might ultimately“buy a plane or get a plane, or something”to fill the niche.",

    "title": "Taliban bans chess",
    "article_text": "Afghanistan's Taliban government has banned the game of chess across the country, arguing that it is incompatible with Islamic Sharia laws. The decision was announced on Sunday. “There are religious considerations regarding the sport of chess,”the Taliban government’s sports directorate spokesman, Atal Mashwani, told AFP, adding that the game is“considered a means of gambling,”which was outlawed under the morality laws imposed by the Islamist group. The game will remain prohibited“until these considerations are addressed,”the spokesman stated. According to Mashwani, the national chess federation has not held any events for around two years anyway. The Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, capitalizing on the withdrawal of US forces after their two-decade presence in the Central Asian country. Upon taking power, it restricted a number of sports disciplines. Last year, it banned mixed martial arts (MMA) and other free fighting championships, declaring them too“violent”and“problematic with respect to Sharia.” The Taliban does not view all sports negatively, though. In January, a Taliban delegation led by acting Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi discussed sports cooperation with India during talks in Dubai. Cricket, which is very popular in both countries, featured in the negotiations, according to New Delhi. In February, the Washington Post reported that Afghanistan’s popular local sport of buzkashi was“thriving”under Taliban rule despite initial fears of a ban. The equestrian sport involving horse-mounted players trying to direct a goat or a calf carcass into a goal had been prohibited during the Islamist group’s first stint in power in the 1990s. Now, however, the game reportedly regularly draws audiences in the thousands, including Taliban members.",

    "title": "Here’s why no Western conservative can replicate Donald Trump",
    "article_text": "Australia’s Labor government was returned to office at last Saturday’s federal election in a landslide win. Labor now holds 90 seats in the House of Representatives to the opposition’s 40, inflicting a devastating defeat on the conservatives. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, a keen admirer of Donald Trump, lost his seat. The conservative opposition in Australia has now been reduced to political irrelevancy in its present form, and – consumed by bitter infighting and recriminations – is destined to disappear as a major political force in the next few years. Earlier last week the centrist Liberal party in Canada won a federal election, defeating the Conservative party, which had been 25 points ahead in the polls earlier in the year. The Canadian Conservative party leader, Pierre Poilievre – once touted as“Canada’s Donald Trump”– also lost his seat. Last Thursday, in UK local council elections, the British Conservative party suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of Nigel Farage’s populist Reform party – losing control of a raft of local councils and mayoralties. Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, is an enthusiastic fan of Donald Trump. She once praised him for being“a force for good in the world”and demanded that the Labour Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary apologise to Trump for daring to have criticised him. Badenoch is certain to face a leadership challenge in the near future and will be deposed as the conservative leader. The UK Conservative party, just like the conservative coalition in Australia, is destined for political oblivion. So dire is the party’s predicament that Robert Jenrick, Badenoch’s likely replacement as leader, recently called for it to form a coalition with the Reform party. These three election results make clear that conservative parties in the West that seek to imitate Trump derive no benefit from doing so – and that mimicking Trump only hastens their imminent political demise. It is true that Canada is a special case. Trump’s absurd threat to make Canada America’s“51st state”– a ham-fisted attack on Canadian sovereignty – together with his recent imposition of crippling tariffs made a Liberal election victory virtually inevitable. Canadians have always been particularly sensitive to threats of domination from America. It is also true that Trump’s misguided tariff policy – that threatened the globalist economic order, until the global financial system swiftly compelled him to reverse it – caused his popularity within almost all Western nations, such as it was, to decline overnight. Why then have conservative leaders in the West nevertheless continued to flirt with Trumpism despite the negative electoral consequences for them? Conservative leaders clearly believe that by imitating Trump they can duplicate his political“success.” That belief, however, is delusional in the extreme – because the circumstances that created a creature like Trump are qualitatively different from the situation in which conservative leaders in the West are constrained to function. No mainstream politician in the West could behave as Trump does and seriously expect to be elected prime minister. Nor could a prime minister who refused to accept the result of an election, fomented a violent attack on a sitting parliament, flagrantly disregarded the rule of law, or jailed judges that handed down decisions adverse to him hope to remain in office. Trump is not a politician at all – despite twice being elected president. Trump is a grotesque populist disrupter, a bizarre product of America’s unique political system and its debauched popular celebrity culture. Conservative leaders ignore the fact that Trump is a president – not a prime minister. Trump does not sit in Congress, and he is not accountable to parliament in the same way that a prime minister or leader of the opposition is. Furthermore, as president, Trump has executive powers far beyond those exercised by any prime minister. Since being elected last year, Trump has governed by means of executive orders – a quasi-dictatorial political device that has no counterpart in most Western democracies. Conservative leaders also fail to appreciate the fact that Trump has taken over the Republican party and purged it of ideological divisions. The Republican party – like all traditional conservative parties – had, prior to Trump’s capture of it, always been made up of ideologically opposed factions. When Trump took over the party in 2016 he drove out all the old Reagan and Bush conservatives and brutally imposed ideological unity on the party – hence the sad fate of Liz Cheney and other remnants of the older Republican elites. Trump has transformed the Republican party into his own personal fiefdom – and this allows him to behave in the disruptive and crude manner in which he has during both of his crisis-ridden presidencies. No other traditional conservative party in the West is as ideologically unified as Trump’s Republican party. In fact, they are all bitterly and deeply ideologically divided. That is why no conservative leader can adopt a fully-fledged Trump agenda – because it would alienate a significant portion of their own parties. Conservative leaders also fail to appreciate that Trump’s Republican party is no longer a conservative party at all – it is a populist party committed to a populist agenda. Conservative leaders, for all of the above reasons, are in a very different position from Trump. Nevertheless, they seek to emulate Trump because they are desperate to differentiate themselves from their social democratic political opponents with which – as many voters well know – they are actually in basic ideological and policy agreement. They also hope that flirting with Trump will help them to ward off the increasingly potent threat from emerging populist parties to their right and shore up their waning electoral support. This misguided gambit, however, has recently become a losing game for conservative leaders because disaffected voters in the West understandably now seek a genuine ideological alternative to both major parties. These voters – they make up 30% of the electorate and their numbers are increasing – don’t want Trump lite, they want the real thing. Peter Dutton, like Badenoch and Poilievre, has foolishly flirted with Trumpism since becoming the conservative opposition leader three years ago – and his demise neatly illustrates the futility of a conservative leader attempting to turn himself into a Trump clone. Dutton – urged on by right-wing commentators employed by the Murdoch press, Sky News and the Spectator, as well as his close friend and outspoken Trump enthusiast billionaire Gina Rinehart – eagerly welcomed Trump’s election as president last year. So deranged are Rinehart and segments of the Murdoch media that – even after Saturday’s catastrophic election loss – they are still urging what is left of the conservative coalition to become more Trump-like. Earlier this year, Dutton acquiesced to calls by Trump’s lickspittle supporters in his own party and the Murdoch media to recall Australia’s ambassador to the US, former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, because he had the audacity to criticise Trump during his first presidency. Dutton enthusiastically mimicked Trump’s“toughness”towards China and his support for the Netanyahu regime’s atrocities in Gaza. When Trump announced his ludicrous and inhumane plan to turn Gaza into a Middle Eastern version of the Riviera, Dutton sycophantically hailed him as“a big thinker”and“shrewd.” Then, just as the election campaign began, Trump imposed his draconian tariffs, thereby endangering the entire globalist economic order, and the Australian stock market crashed. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese rightly protested and criticised Trump for this – but all Dutton did was to suggest that Albanese’s attempt to protect Australia’s economic interests and was not“tough”enough. Interestingly, the populist Nigel Farage, who is a close personal friend of Trump and who has campaigned for him, was far more critical of Trump on the tariff issue than Dutton was. Farage even compared Trump to Liz Truss – surely the ultimate political insult. Farage, unlike Dutton, knows that the only way to deal effectively with Trump is to stand up to him. The newly elected Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, did precisely this at his meeting with Trump this week. Trump has never been popular with mainstream voters in Australia, and his popularity plummeted after the tariff debacle. Dutton, however, persisted with his ill-advised Trump flirtation, foolishly following the advice of conservative commentators who urged him to become even more Trump-like. One commentator penned an article early last week stating that Trump had not caused the Conservative party to lose the Canadian election. Perhaps Dutton believed such nonsense. Dutton staunchly defended one of his shadow cabinet – to whom he had allocated the DOGE-like task of weeding out public service inefficiency – when she was photographed wearing a MAGA cap during the final stages of the election campaign. And early last week Dutton urged voters to pay no attention to the ABC and The Guardian – which he described, in Trumpian terms, as“the hate media.” Then – just two days before election day – it was revealed that Trump’s campaign co-manager, Chris LaCivita, had made a secret trip to Australia two weeks previously to give Dutton election advice. This suggests that Dutton’s infatuation with Trump may have been much more intense than previously thought – and the fact that Dutton kept the visit secret speaks for itself. Dutton could mimic Trump all he liked, but the one thing that he could not do, as a conservative party leader, was adopt a fully-fledged Trumpian agenda that distinguished him from the Labor government. Thus he alienated mainstream voters – while at the same time being unable to attract the votes of those disaffected voters who were seeking a genuine populist alternative to both major parties. These voters reacted by overwhelmingly voting for the safe and unthreatening Albanese government – that had never cravenly ceded Australia’s autonomy to Trump as had Dutton – in unprecedented and unexpected numbers. And, on Monday, to add insult to injury, in an interview Donald Trump said“I am very friendly with Albanese. I have no idea who the other fellow who ran against him is.”In similar fashion, Trump treated Mark Carney with respect when he met with him this week at the White House. Trump may use sycophants, but he only respects winners. Dutton did not lose last week’s election just because of his imprudent mimicking of Donald Trump – but his aping of Trump was indicative of a fundamental lack of political judgment that led to his calamitous electoral defeat. Donald Trump has exerted a toxic influence on conservative politicians in the West for almost a decade, and will no doubt continue to do so – because conservatism’s pathetic and increasingly desperate embrace of Trump is a symptom of its political irrelevance and its ideological bankruptcy.",

    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin’s proposal to re-start peace talks with Ukraine without preconditions is timely and well thought out, the leader of France’s Patriots party, Florian Philippot, told RIA Novosti on Sunday. The initiative supports the building momentum toward finding a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine conflict and“strikes a blow to the warmongers in the EU”who want the hostilities to continue, he added. On Saturday, Putin proposed restarting direct negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul. Kiev unilaterally abandoned the talks in 2022. Moscow is ready to get back to the negotiating table without any preconditions, the Russian leader said. “I believe it is a very well thought out [initiative],”Philippot told RIA.“We will never find a solution [to the conflict] if we avoid fundamental issues that affected relations between Russia and Ukraine for many years and even decades before [the start of the Ukraine conflict escalation in] 2022.” The politician nevertheless warned that Kiev’s Western backers are likely to exert strong pressure on Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky to reject Russia’s proposal and make any talks“impossible.”According to Philippot, Moscow’s offer“strikes a blow”to all the“warmongers”in the EU, including French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron, as well as Germany’s new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are only“pretending to be the proponents of peace”while seeking to keep relations with Russia tense and“do everything”to rekindle the flames of war. Philippot also took to X and YouTube on Sunday to express his support for the Russian peace initiative and criticize Macron and other EU leaders.“Let the peace negotiations continue!”he wrote on the social media, calling on Macron, Merz, Starmer and EU Commission head Ursula von der Leyen to“be stopped.” Earlier on Sunday, Zelensky demanded that Russia agree to Kiev’s unconditional 30-day ceasefire demand before Ukraine agrees to any talks. He also put forward a similar demand on Saturday, following a meeting with European leaders, including Macron, Merz and Starmer, in Kiev. The Kremlin rejected what it described as external pressure surrounding the proposed truce.",

    "article_text": "Venezuela welcomes the proposal made by Russian President Vladimir Putin to resume direct peace talks with Ukraine, President Nicolas Maduro has said. Maduro made the remarks on Sunday during a meeting with St. Petersburg Governor Aleksandr Beglov. The Venezuelan president spoke highly of the speech delivered by Putin earlier in the day in which he put forward the proposal to resume talks with Kiev on May 15 in Istanbul, Türkiye. “I would like to express the joy of our government and the people of Venezuela regarding this announcement. This was a speech of a man who defends the interests of his homeland, yet at the same time has a very clear understanding of what the international environment must be to achieve peace on a global scale,”Maduro said. The sentiment is shared by the“majority of the governments and people of Latin America and the Caribbean,”Maduro added, expressing confidence that they support“President Putin’s efforts to resume negotiations and return to a path that should have never been abandoned – the path of direct dialogue and mutual understanding between Russia and Ukraine without any external interference.” Early on Sunday, Putin proposed that direct peace negotiations with Kiev be resumed without any preconditions. The president made the statement while addressing the media at the conclusion of celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, during which Moscow hosted numerous foreign dignitaries and leaders. “We propose that the Kiev authorities resume the negotiations they interrupted in 2022 – to resume direct negotiations, and I emphasize, without any preconditions. We propose to start without delay next Thursday, May 15, in Istanbul,”Putin said. The settlement process must begin with talks, which could ultimately lead to“some kind of new truce and a new ceasefire,”Putin added. “We are set on serious negotiations with Ukraine. Their aim is to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and to achieve a long-term lasting peace for a historical perspective,”the president stressed. The proposal received a cold reaction from Kiev and its Western backers, who insisted that any talks must be preceded by a 30-day truce. The Russian proposal comes after leaders from France, Germany, Poland, the UK, and the European Commission said they sought a“full and unconditional”30-day ceasefire, claiming that this would“create room for diplomacy,”while noting that the US supports such an initiative. US President Donald Trump, however, urged Kiev to“immediately”accept the Russian proposal. Shortly after Trump’s statement, Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky claimed he was ready to meet Putin in person in Istanbul, yet once again reiterated the demand that a truce be established beforehand.",

    "article_text": "Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) will be led by a woman for the first time since its creation in 1909, the Sunday Times has reported. The current MI6 chief, Richard Moore, will step down this autumn. The British newspaper reported on Sunday that interviews for the position were held last week, and all three shortlisted candidates are women. According to the publication, the UK’s ambassador to the UN and former envoy to China, Barbara Woodward, is among the contenders. The identities of the other two are being kept secret as they currently serve as MI6 officers. In contrast, Woodward lacks a background in intelligence. She taught English in China before joining the Foreign Office in 1994. The Sunday Times noted that critics of ‘Beijing Barbara’ have accused her of being reluctant to criticize the Chinese government while serving as ambassador to the country, and siding with Beijing over the issue of Taiwan independence later on. The newspaper quoted former Tory leader Duncan Smith, who was sanctioned by the Chinese authorities, suggesting that Woodward’s potential appointment as MI6 chief could“end in disaster for the UK,”as she“was less than robust about Chinese actions”in her previous role. The final decision on the appointment rests with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, based on recommendations from an expert panel comprising Foreign Secretary David Lammy, National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell, and other senior officials. In February, the US Senate confirmed the nomination of former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, giving her oversight over 18 US intelligence agencies, including the CIA and FBI. The Iraq War veteran lacked prior intelligence experience and has been an outspoken critic of the US intelligence community and the country’s foreign policy, including its support for Ukraine. Her positions led some detractors to question whether she is fit for such a sensitive post.",

    "title": "Western states want Ukraine conflict to continue – EU state’s leader",
    "article_text": "Many Western states want the Ukraine conflict to continue, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has said. This explains their lukewarm response to Moscow’s proposal for direct talks with Kiev, he has argued. Earlier on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered Ukraine the opportunity to restart negotiations to resolve the conflict next Thursday in Istanbul, Türkiye.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirmed that his country is prepared to host the talks. US President Donald Trump welcomed the proposal, writing on Truth Social that he expects“a BIG week upcoming.” French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, however, said Putin’s offer is“not enough”and called for a ceasefire first. ”I am shocked that there is a proposal that on May 15, Russians and Ukrainians can meet in Istanbul for direct talks where concrete results can be obtained, and I hear statements from Germany and France that they do not agree,” Fico told a press briefing on Sunday following his visit to Moscow for Victory Day.“What do they have to do with it all? Isn’t it a matter for Ukraine to decide?” Fico warned that the conflict will“last years more”if Kiev’s Western backers don’t stop interfering and start“respecting basic things,”including the right for Russian and Ukraine to work out a settlement one-on-one. The prime minister went on to say that Western interference was behind the failure of the previous Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul in 2022.“Everything was ready, Ukraine was ready to sign a peace agreement, but the big boys from the West came and said no, we have to use this war to beat the Russians.” “Many Western countries really want this war to continue,”Fico added. He expressed hope, however, that this will change once Russia and Ukraine sit down for talks.“This is a matter of Ukraine and Russia above all. If they are interested in working, they will be working.” Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky has called Putin’s proposal a“positive sign”and said he is“ready to meet”for talks. He insisted, however, that a ceasefire should come first, suggesting that it begin on May 12. Moscow has been wary of a prolonged pause in the fighting without a formal deal, warning it could allow Kiev to regroup and rearm. Ukraine rejected Russia’s 72-hour Victory Day ceasefire, and the Russian Defense Ministry said Ukrainian forces violated that short-term truce multiple times.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has urged Ukraine to“immediately”agree to the proposal of direct unconditional talks put forward by Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier on Sunday. Writing on Truth Social, Trump suggested the proposed direct negotiations would, at least, help to clarify the positions of the sides of the conflict and show“whether or not a deal is possible.” “President Putin of Russia doesn’t want to have a Cease Fire Agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH. Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY,”the US leader wrote. If it becomes clear that reaching a deal is not possible“European leaders, and the US, will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly,”Trump stated. “I’m starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin,”he added. Earlier in the day, the Russian president proposed that“the Kiev authorities resume the negotiations they interrupted in 2022”without any preconditions on May 15 in Istanbul.

The Russian offer has been criticized by Kiev and its Western backers, who demand the talks be preceded by the establishment of at least a 30-day truce. This stance was reiterated by Vladimir Zelensky minutes after Trump made his remarks. The Ukrainian leader demanded a truce be announced on Monday. “We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy. There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses,”Zelensky wrote on X. In 2022, Zelensky explicitly prohibited engaging in any negotiations with Russia as long as Putin is in power. While the ban remains in place, Zelensky has somewhat softened his position as of late, claiming it actually applied to everyone in Ukraine except himself.",

    "title": "UK sending ‘Ikea-style’ weapon decoys to Ukraine – Times",
    "article_text": "The British military is supplying Ukraine with flat-pack decoys designed to mimic real military hardware, The Times reported on Saturday, citing sources. The effort is aimed at deceiving Russian forces and exaggerating the amount of modern equipment on the front line. At the heart of the effort are so-called“Ikea-style”kits resembling British-supplied tanks, artillery, and air defense systems that are designed to stretch Russia’s surveillance and strike capacity.“We haven’t gifted a huge amount of these, so anything we can do to make the quantities look greater on the front line is advantageous to us,”RAF Squadron Leader Lowri Simner told the paper. The deception campaign is being managed by Taskforce Kindred, a 20-person team within the British Defense Ministry that works with industry specialists. They rely on digital images of equipment to create realistic replicas, which are then printed on flat materials, shipped to Kiev, and quickly assembled close to the combat zones. Some of the replicas are meant to resemble such equipment as Challenger 2 tanks and AS-90 self-propelled guns. The paper notes that decoys have come a long way from what was used during World War II. The impetus to improve the replicas has come from modern drones and satellites with formidable reconnaissance capabilities. For every five real vehicles sent to Ukraine Kiev also receives as many as 30 decoys, according to Colonel Olly Todd, a military lead with the Taskforce Kindred.“You could be quite easily fooled,”he noted, adding that decoys are a“fundamental”facet of modern warfare. Meanwhile, Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Katerina Chernohorenko said, as quoted by The Times, that Russia has also been actively using decoys, particularly during drone strikes. She said many of the UAVs sent by Moscow carry minimal explosives but are designed to bait Ukrainian air defenses and waste ammo, which is often in short supply. Despite its continued military support for Ukraine – which has reached £13 billion ($17 billion) – UK defense officials have sounded the alarm about the country not being ready for a full-scale war with a near-peer adversary due to years of underinvestment and procurement delays. Russia has condemned Western arms shipments to Ukraine, warning that they only prolong the conflict without changing its ultimate outcome.",

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hasconfirmedthat his country is ready to host the talks, telling Macron in a phone call that this could be“a historic turning point.” Macron, however, insisted that the process should start with a“full and unconditional”30-day ceasefire, referring to a proposal made by the leaders of Ukraine, the UK, and EU the day before, and which is reportedly supported by the US. “It is a first step, but it is not enough… It’s a way of not responding. We must not give up,”Macron stated, claiming that Putin’s offer is a delaying tactic.“It shows that he is looking for a way out, but he still wants to buy time.” Macron also claimed that“an unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations, by definition.” “We must stand firm with the Americans to say that the ceasefire is unconditional and then we can discuss the rest,”he said. US President Donald Trump has welcomed Putin’s proposal, writing on Truth Social hours after the announcement that this is“a potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine,”with“a BIG week upcoming!” Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said Putin’s proposal is a“positive sign”and that he is“ready to meet”for talks. He insisted, however, that the first step should be a ceasefire, which he suggested should begin on May 12. Moscow previously warned that Ukraine could use a prolonged pause in the fighting without a formal agreement to regroup and rearm. In his address, Putin said Kiev has violated three ceasefires proposed by Moscow: A 30-day US-brokered halt on strikes against energy infrastructure that expired last month, an unconditional Easter truce, and a 72-hour Victory Day ceasefire. Istanbul hosted the last direct Russia-Ukraine peace talks in 2022, shortly after the escalation of the conflict. Moscow said that while the sides were making progress at the time and had worked out a preliminary peace treaty, the process was derailed by Kiev’s Western backers. The agreement eventually fell through, and Zelensky later issued a decree banning peace talks with Putin.",

    "title": "Trump could recognize Palestine – media",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump could formally recognize the state of Palestine at the upcoming Gulf-US summit in Saudi Arabia, the news outlet Media Line has reported, citing unnamed diplomatic sources. Palestine is recognized as a sovereign nation by 147 countries, including Russia and most nations in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. However, most Western European countries, Israel, and the US do not officially consider it a sovereign state. Many nations have called for its recognition as the only way to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict, which escalated in 2023 when Israel launched a military operation in Gaza following a surprise Hamas attack that killed about 1,200 Israelis and saw 250 taken hostage. “President Donald Trump will issue a declaration regarding the State of Palestine and American recognition of it, and that there will be the establishment of a Palestinian state without the presence of Hamas,”a Gulf diplomatic source, who declined to be named or disclose his position, told the outlet. The source also added that the announcement“will be the most important declaration that will change the balance of power in the Middle East.” The report comes amid speculation over remarks Trump made earlier this month during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney when he repeatedly teased“a very, very big announcement about a certain subject”that he planned to make either before or during his upcoming trip to the Middle East. While he did not specify what the announcement would entail, he said it would be“very positive.”Some observers suggest it could refer to the Israel-Palestine conflict. US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has denied that the US has plans to recognize Palestine, chiding the Jerusalem Post, which picked up the Media Line report, for trusting unchecked sources.“Jerusalem Post needs better sources than this unidentified ‘source’… This report is nonsense.@Israeldoesn’t have a better friend than@POTUS!”he wrote on X on Saturday. Trump has not previously expressed any intention to recognize Palestine. During his first term in office, he recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, despite the Palestinians’ claim to East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state under the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords. During his current term, however, Trump has been involved in mediating efforts to reach a lasting resolution to the conflict. While the sides reached a ceasefire in January, Israel resumed its operation against Hamas earlier this spring. Earlier this week, he suggested there could soon be an announcement on a new Gaza ceasefire proposal, saying there was“a lot of talk going on about Gaza right now.”",

    "title": "Erdogan accepts Putin’s request to host Russia-Ukraine talks",
    "article_text": "Türkiye has accepted Russia’s request to mediate direct peace talks with Ukraine, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. The country previously hosted negotiations between Moscow and Kiev in 2022, which ultimately collapsed after Ukraine walked out. In a phone call on Sunday, Erdogan welcomed Putin’s recent statement suggesting that“talks between Russia and Ukraine would continue in Istanbul from where they left off,”adding that Ankara“was ready to host negotiations that would lead to a permanent solution.” The Kremlin has confirmed the call, stating that the two leaders“discussed in detail the Russian president’s initiative to resume direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations.” “The Turkish side will provide all possible assistance in organizing and conducting negotiations aimed at achieving a lasting peace.” On the same day, Erdogan told French President Emmanuel Macron that“a historic turning point”to end the conflict had been reached, and that this opportunity should be seized. This comes after Putin offered Kiev the opportunity to restart direct negotiations in Istanbul on May 15,“without preconditions.”Kiev ultimately walked away from reaching a settlement in 2022 under pressure from London, and Vladimir Zelensky later issued a decree banning himself from any negotiations with Putin. Zelensky and several of Kiev’s Western backers have been insisting that Russia agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire before direct talks. Putin noted that Kiev has not adhered to the three ceasefires offered by Moscow. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that while Moscow supports the idea of a ceasefire“in general,”“there are lots of questions”that remain unresolved. Moscow previously voiced concern that the halt in hostilities would allow Kiev to regroup its battered troops and has insisted that all Western arms shipments to Ukraine must be suspended for the duration of the ceasefire. Türkiye hosted several rounds of negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in the spring of 2022. Moscow later said the talks had yielded tangible progress, including a tentative draft agreement on Ukraine’s neutral status, security guarantees, and other core issues. However, Moscow accused then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson of derailing the peace process, claiming that he advised Kiev not to accept the terms and to“keep fighting.” While Johnson has denied the claim, David Arakhamia, head of the Ukrainian delegation at the time, acknowledged that he had played an influential role in the process.",

    "title": "Top Swedish official quits over gay dating app photo leak",
    "article_text": "A former Swedish ambassador to Ukraine was forced to resign a top security position hours after taking up the role following the publication of explicit photos taken from a gay dating app. Tobias Thyberg resigned from his post as Sweden’s national security adviser following the circulation of explicit images from the Grindr app to his political masters and the press. The scandal has sent shockwaves through the new NATO member’s political establishment, reportedly raising questions about the reliability of security vetting and possible foreign involvement. Thyberg, who served as Sweden’s ambassador to Ukraine from 2019 to 2023, was appointed national security adviser shortly before midday on Thursday, according to a timeline published by the newspaper Dagens Nyheter. About 30 minutes later, an anonymous email containing explicit photos, allegedly of Thyberg, was sent to Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson’s office. The images, reportedly taken from an old Grindr account, were later shared with media outlets, including the Dagens Nyheter. By midnight, Thyberg had informed the outlet that he would not assume the role, confirming the leak.“I should have informed about this but I didn’t,”he told the newspaper, referring to the pictures. The paper noted that the images were not public, but were shared on a private channel, and that many were six or seven years old. It is unclear who accessed and distributed the pictures, but the Dagens Nyheter said the sender had used a private email service with strong encryption protection. Kristersson has ordered an investigation into the scandal but refused to speculate about the potentially compromising materials. Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer confirmed that the sensitive images had not surfaced during the security check, noting that Thyberg should have disclosed them voluntarily. Peter Hultqvist, a former Swedish Defense Minister, suggested that the scandal could disrupt the country’s cooperation with its international partners. The outlet reported, citing sources, that there is speculation within the Swedish government that a foreign power may be behind the emergence of the images. Another source told the paper that it is“incomprehensible why this vulnerability was not discovered in the security clearance. The position is placed in the highest security class.” The role of national security adviser in Sweden, which was only created in 2022, is not as prominent as its US counterpart, but it still has significant influence. The advisor reports directly to the prime minister and handles classified information. The position has come under increased scrutiny recently following the January resignation of Henrik Landerholm, who was indicted after allegedly leaving classified documents in a hotel room – a charge he denies.",

    "title": "Why is Germany such a mess?",
    "article_text": "It seems long ago already, but politically speaking, it was really only yesterday that the last, deeply unpopular German government collapsed on November 6 of last year. Based on a fractious coalition and led by the hapless Olaf Scholz, it was a flop from almost the beginning to the bitter end. But what finally imploded Scholz’s cabinet was its finance minister’s refusal to hollow out Germany’s – back then – severe restrictions on public debt, specificallyto throw even more money at Ukraine. Exactly half a year after this fiasco, the next and current German government produced another one, even before it had really started: On 6 May,its designated leader Friedrich Merz from the mainstream conservatives (CDU) failed to get parliament to elect him as chancellor. This may look like a formality because, after complicated and humiliating maneuvering, Merz managed to find enough votes on a second try. Yet rest assured, no one in Germany thinks this was a minor glitch. For one thing, unlike a coalition breakdown, this was an entirely unprecedented failure: no post-World War II German chancellor has ever failed to be confirmed in the first round. That’s why, on the day of the disaster, some parliamentarians even spoke of a fundamental“crisis of the state.” No wonder really, because would-be-chancellors only ask parliament for this vote when they believe they have a majority of deputies securely on their side. So did Merz, too. And that is why his initial dud was so much worse than just a sad historic first: The only way he could fail was by quiet but deliberate mutiny from below and, clearly, arrogant negligence on his side. His coalition is made up of his own conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD). If every member of parliament from these two parties had supported him in the first round, a second one would not have been needed. Clearly, then, it was deputies from his own party or its coalition allies who refused to comply. We will never know who exactly because the vote was anonymous, but we do know that there wereat least 18 rebels. A major conservative commentator was right: This blow below the belt from Merz’s own rankswill hurt for a long time. This is an awful way to begin a chancellorship. And not only because from now on, right from the get-go, the“partners”– yes, those are scare quotes – now divvying up power and positions in Berlin will always have to wonder which one of them – SPD or CDU (or even both)? – is harboring snakes in the grass. And when might they strike again? Welcome to the all-new coalition: as backstabbing as the last one but faster off the mark. More fundamentally, if you can’t keep your troops together on confirming you as the boss, how do you expect to get your budgets and laws through? But things are even more foreboding in this case. For Merz could only even have a shot at high office because Germany is in such a comprehensive mess:demography, the economy, infrastructure, the party system, foreign policy, technology, and, last but not least, the public mood. You name it – nothing, really nothing, is okay. It is against this dark background that a major German economist serving on the government’s own council of experts isalready asking the inevitable question: How can this new coalition government fulfill Merz’s key promise to finally address this national misery, if it is so obviously bereft of unity? And, we may add, of discipline and foresight, too, because it takes astonishing sloppiness to prepare a chancellor vote so badly. Another economist notes that the debacle has also sent a“devastating signal”to the rest of the world. Indeed. And good luck for Merz when trying to tell Trump off for his team’s meddling in German politics: Whether Trump will say it or not, it is certain that he has already slotted Merz as a“loser.” And the American bruiser-in-chief has a point. Not only because of the embarrassing lack of professionalism that came to light in mismanaging this crucial vote, but also because Merz’s CDU and their SPD coalition partners under Lars Klingbeil richly deserved their come-uppance. Between the last elections and cobbling together their coalition, they engineered a crassly foul maneuver: Clearly against the spirit if not the letter of the constitution, they used the old parliament – de facto already voted out by Germany’s citizens – for perhaps the single greatest flipflop in German postwar history. Remember those strict limits for public debt over which the preceding coalition collapsed? Merz ran his electoral campaign promising that he would not abandon this so-called“debt brake.”As a dyed-in-the-wool conservative, he was in an excellent position to make that claim and get voters to believe it. And yet, it was his first action – even before entering office – to break that promise. And not in a small, corner-cutting way. Merz did not cut corners but razed the edifice to the ground. Having run and won (barely) as a fiscal hawk, he rapidly made a screeching U-turn to – in CNN’s words –“massively expand borrowing and super-charge military spending.”To the tune of a cool trillion or so over the next decade. Many voters and members of his own party were not only bewildered but aghast. We cannot know for sure, but I and many other Germans are probably right guessing thatthis massive breach of faithmotivated at least some of the rebels during the chancellor vote. What we do know for sure is that Merz’s personal ratings have crashed even before he almost failed to become chancellor. Never popular to begin with, he has reached a nadir: On the eve of the parliamentary vote,56% of Germans were against Merz becoming chancellor, only 38% welcomed that prospect. And Merz is not the only one who has emerged dented from this affair: For complicated procedural reasons, Merz needed the cooperation of the Die Linke party under its shooting star Heidi Reichinnek to get his second chance. For Die Linke, providing this help was probably a very bad move. Reichinnek is to Germany what Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is to the US: a social-media savvy lifestyle leftist with hubristic rhetoric (anyone for abolishing capitalism, all of it, right now and with tattoos, please?) and deeply tactical behavior in the real world. By helping out the unpopular arch-capitalist Merz, she may have overdone it even for some of her most devoted TikTok fans. But it’s not all bad news. At least not for everyone. The AfD – under pressure from Germany’s domestic intelligence service and the possible threat of a complete ban – is likely to profit. It may have missed a superb chance of embarrassing Merz by actually votingforhim. But there is another effect: The collaboration of the oh-so-terribly radical Reichinnek and her party, has already made some German observers ask a simple, plausible question: If both Die Linke and the AfD used to be treated as beyond the pale – or, in German parlance,“firewalled”– and yet Merz had no problem relying on Die Linke to get into office (no less!), then, clearly, that whole“firewall”thing is not all it’s cracked up to be. And if that is so, thenthe firewall against the AfD may well also crumble one day. In fact, as a matter of consistency and fairness, it should, whether you like the AfD or not. What an odd way of becoming the new leader of Germany’s political mainstream: Limping through the entry gate, badly bruised and humiliated as no chancellor before, while once again de facto strengthening the country’s largest and most threatening insurgent party. Merz’s predecessor Scholz started with much undeserved advance praise and ended abysmally. Merz has managed to start abysmally already.",

Singapore's LG Han faced off against Korea's Choi Hyun-seok on an episode of Chef & My Fridge. (Photo: Chef & My Fridge) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Singapore is represented for the first time on the popular Korean reality cooking competition series Chef & My Fridge by way of Restaurant Labyrinth’s chef Han Liguang, better known as LG Han. He competed in a special “50 Best” episode of the show that challenges chefs to cook a dish from ingredients in a celebrity’s fridge. Aired on Korea television on Sunday (May 11), the episode featured “Team Asia”–made up of Singapore’s Han, chef Yusuke Takada of La Cime in Japan and Antimo Maria Merone of Estro in Hong Kong–going up against “Team Korea”, which was represented by Son Jeong-won of Eatanic Garden as well as Culinary Class Wars alumni Choi Hyun-seok and Kwong Seong-jun (known as Napoli Matfia). Han was invited to participate because of Labyrinth’s standing at number 37 on the latest Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list, and he accepted because he wanted to “have fun, make friends and, most importantly, showcase what Singapore has,” even though his policy up until now has been not to compete in on-air competitions because “I don’t want to lose,” he quipped. Han flew to Seoul and filmed for the episode over 13 hours on Apr 26. For his opponent, he chose Culinary Class Wars' Choi, because the two have been longtime friends, having first met in Singapore eight years ago at an editorial shoot arranged by the Singapore Tourism Board and subsequently at global culinary events. “He’s the chef who has been on the show the longest and has the highest win rate,” Han said. “When they asked me, ‘Can you win against Choi? Why did you pick the oldest chef?’ I said, ‘He’s a legend, and I would love to try to defeat the legend.’” Whose fridge did he raid? The celebrity of the day was Kim Jae-joong, erstwhile member of popular south Korean boy band TVXQ. “My fridge had a lot of Korean ingredients: Ssamjang, perilla leaves, gochujang, squid. We have to cook according to the celebrities’ preference. Kim Jae-joong likes really spicy food, like, make you sweat kind of spicy.” In addition, there was a “Do you know makgeolli?” theme, as “Kim Jae-joong just launched his own makgeolli brand. So, we had to create a dish suited for makgeolli.” Han’s solution was to whip up a classic Singapore chilli crab from the Korean ingredients that would pair well with the Korean rice wine, “like drinking Tiger Beer to wash it down”. To make the dish, he used ssamjang, tomato sauce, oyster sauce, Korean fish sauce, Korean sesame sauce, hot sauce known as “Korean death sauce”, and egg whites, along with squid and a frozen leg of crab that were in the fridge. “I’ve been to Korea quite often and tasted ssamjang, so I kind of knew it should work, but I’d never put those things together, so it was really just pure instinct,” he recalled. “Ssamjang has garlic, shallots, chilli paste, fermented soy bean paste”, which was ideal since “there was no time to chop garlic and shallots”. To replace shaoxing wine, he used soju, and chose pickled perilla leaves to take the place of lime. And, “Instead of mantou, I used instant rice cakes boiled in makgeolli for a bit of sweetness and creaminess, then grilled.” He also made a side dish of julienned pear wrapped in kimchi. “Towards the end, my hands were shaking because I was running out of time.” The final dish tasted a lot like a classic chilli crab, he said, while still being “a bit different, like a Korean version.” He explained: “I didn't want to do a modern, Labyrinth-style dish, firstly because of the timing; and secondly, I wanted to do something that could showcase Singapore's traditional foods to the world. My point is that I think the knowledge of Singapore cuisine is still not there when it comes to the world stage. It’s not like Korean cuisine, Japanese cuisine, Thai cuisine or Filipino cuisine. What I do has always been about showcasing what Singapore is, whether traditional or modern.” During the competition, here were a few panic moments, he said, like chopping up mushrooms and then forgetting to use them, and the rice cakes cooking unevenly due to the shape of the pan. There was also the language barrier. “I had an ear piece with live translation,” he revealed, and “when I spoke in English, there was a loudspeaker in the studio translating it into Korean” for the others. Of course, with many people speaking simultaneously, the translation got a little confusing at times. It helped to have Choi there as a friend, he said, offering to show him how the equipment worked and being generally supportive. “To be honest, my strategy was just to complete my dish,” Han said. “I asked the producer beforehand, ‘Has anyone not completed their dish?’ And they said, ‘No, never’. I was a bit nervous, as well – it was a different world altogether, it was a 13-hour shoot, and I had to compete first because I was the youngest!” He did receive some sage advice, though. Prior to leaving on the trip, he shared, “my wife said to me, ‘It’s more important to be entertaining than to win or lose.’” As for whether he did anything to prepare for the competition, he said, “Nothing, I just tried to have an early night before the shoot.” An interesting behind-the-scenes tidbit is that “every time we took a break, we all had one-on-one assistance – they would talk to us about the script. They would say, ‘This is coming up, you must follow this instruction, you must say something about your dish,’ or, ‘Choi is going to poke fun at you – just react in good humour.’” Did he learn anything about himself through the experience? “That I still have it in me to cook a delicious Singaporean dish in 15 minutes,” he quipped. He mused: “I think chefs every day have to learn to live with pressure and be quick-thinking. If mistakes happen, or the quality of the ingredients is not good enough, what do we do? How do you change the dish? So, this show technically takes what we're doing in real life and compresses it into 15 minutes.” On his part, “I wanted to show Korea what we have. I would have loved to show them authentic Singapore food, but because of the rules of the show, I had to cook out of a Korean fridge, so, I did my best to show what Singapore flavours are, based on what we share in culture and ingredients – and that we are a lot closer than what we think we are when it comes to our flavours.” Meanwhile, Choi will be in Singapore in July and will be cooking together with Han at Labyrinth. In a special two-night collaboration planned for Jul 13 and 14, the two chefs will present the competition dishes they made on the show, paired with the same makgeolli; as well as other dishes like a samgyetang dish they worked on together.

    "title": "'Being underestimated fuels me': Meet the Singapore female race car driver with 30 races under her belt",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Dining Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Obsessions Living Singapore People Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Dining Experiences People Dining Singapore Travel Singapore Singapore Women Women Gladys Lam’s passion for cars started when she was a teen. Racing was never part of the plan but her love for driving naturally evolved into competitive motorsports. She is now Singapore’s only active female race car driver. Gladys Lam is Singapore’s only active female racer and she hopes to inspire more women to join the sport. (Photo: Gladys Lam) This audio is generated by an AI tool. If you spot Gladys Lam in her Suzuki Swift Sport on the roads, resist the urge to challenge her to a race. She will not take you on, not because she might lose, but on the contrary, she will outpace you. “I’ve no interest in illegal street races. Racing belongs on the track,” Lam asserted. However, she is happy to chat and take photos. Lam, 30, is a professional race car driver, and currently the only active female racer in Singapore. Former notable speed queens includeAnne Wong Holloway, the Singaporean driver who won the Macau Grand Prix in 1970, and British-born, Singapore-raised Claire Jedrek, who made history bybecoming the first woman to achieve podium finishes in the Malaysia Championship Series. “I do hope more Singaporean females pick up motorsports,” Lam told CNA Women. “It is a big commitment. But to me, it is a dream worth chasing.” Influenced by friends who were into cars, Lam’s passion for motorsports began when she was a teenager. She spent years doing simulator racing and go-karting before taking part in her first race in 2019 at the Malaysia Street Festival Series race at Sepang International Circuit. A last-minute spot to take part in the race, which fell on her 24th birthday, had opened up. “It felt like a sign for me to go big or go home,” Lam recalled. She came in first in the women’s category. “The feeling of standing on top of the podium after a race was addictive. It made me want to chase that high again and again.” The former events project manager entered full-time racing and content creation in 2024. “It was bittersweet letting go of a job that I enjoyed, but things got overwhelming with the increasing demands from racing and content projects,” said Lam. “But being a project manager taught me how to manage chaos, and that skill translated perfectly into managing racing schedules, sponsors, and content work.” Lam reckoned she has taken part in over 30 races across different countries, circuits and cars, since her debut in 2019, at times clocking in speeds of about 200 km/h. One of her recent races was in December 2024, where she took part in a 25-hour endurance race in Thailand with Team Supersonic, an all-Singaporean team. At endurance races, drivers take one-to-two-hour shifts. She stayed the full 25 hours on the track. Even when she was not driving, she was on standby with her phone switched on and ready to go. “Such long endurance races can mess with your body clock a bit, but you prepare for it. You rest when you can, hydrate, and stay sharp,” she said. The team came in sixth. Lam races in production cars such as the Suzuki Swift, Honda Jazz and Honda CR-Z. On the outside, they look similar to the ones on the roads, but the race cars have been stripped to their bare minimum and have only one race seat. Her daily car is a Suzuki Swift Sport which she has had for nine years. “Maintenance is simple and it drives great,” Lam said. Races in Singapore are mostly gymkhana, which historically used to be called “car park rallys”. In gymkhana, drivers complete a complex obstacle course in the shortest time. Lam has competed in a few gymkhana competitions in Singapore and in Southeast Asia and clinched some podium finishes along the way. “But it’s tough to get locations for gymkhana in Singapore so competitions don’t happen often,” she explained. Her main racing discipline is circuit racing. Singapore doesn’t have a permanent race circuit, so most of Lam’s races happen overseas, mainly in Malaysia and Thailand. On average, she travels for a race once every month or two depending on the season calendar, and on each race weekend there are usually at least two races. Lam’s upcoming races include the PT Maxnitron Racing Series in Thailand, in June, August and October. For non-racing fans, who may be more familiar withFormula 1, Lam said that “that is a different beast”. Formula cars are open-wheel, involve a huge budget, and are very technical. “What we do is production-based racing, but the competition, pressure, and intensity are just as real. It might be less glamorous, but the strategy and mental game are all universal,” she said. To prepare for her races, Lam does simulator training to improve her driving, reaction times and decision-making skills. “They are all important because during a race, you are constantly under pressure,” she said. Off-track training includes gym work for muscle endurance and heat resistance, and on-track training takes place during test days and practice sessions with the race car. At 1.52m tall and weighing 52 kg, the petite Lam says her biggest challenge is keeping up with the physical demands of her sport. “I’ve to train harder to keep up in endurance races,” she said. And then, there are also comments such as “girls can’t drive,” or “you sure you know what you’re doing?” that Lam gets. “Sometimes they don’t even say it aloud, it’s in the way they dismiss you, or talk over you, or people being surprised when I debate about something car-related that may be unpopular but right,” she said. “Being a woman in this space often means having to prove yourself twice as hard just to be seen as an equal. But I think that’s why I keep going. Being underestimated can either break or fuel you. I chose to let it fuel me.” Her parents were worried initially about her love for motorsports. “Racing isn’t the safest or most conventional path, but over time, they’ve seen how dedicated I am, and are now super supportive.” Racing is an expensive sport, and a race weekend in Southeast Asia can cost between S$3,000 and S$15,000, depending on the race car, location, tyres, fuel, transport and race team. And that’s not including training or repairs. “Compared to something like badminton, where you just need a racket, shoes, and a court, racing is on a whole other scale. To me, racing comes first. However, I definitely can’t afford it out of pocket,” said Lam. She realised early on that securing sponsors was key to her journey. “I started content creation out of necessity because it was the only way to really put myself out there. Content creation is just one way I fight for survival in this sport,” she said. Lam has over 18,000 followers onTikTokand more than 69,000 followers onInstagram, mostly males aged 25 to 44. Besides posting on her races, she also posts car reviews, and car factory visits. “I always prioritise creating content that I genuinely like or feel would be interesting or helpful for my audience. If it’s not fun or meaningful, I won’t take the job as I won’t post what I don’t believe in.” “Race suits, flags and apparel are walking billboards, and race cars are wrapped with sponsors’ logos. I usually joke that I’m a walking advertisement, with logos on the race suit, apparel, helmet, car, and all,” quipped Lam. Besides being a race driver and content creator, Lam is also vice-president of theHamster Society Singapore, a non-profit, volunteer group that rescues and rehabilitates abandoned and abused hamsters. “Watching these small animals heal, trust again, and slowly turn into their best selves after everything they’ve been through, gives me the most peace and happiness,” said Lam.

    "title": "Work It Podcast: Self-care tips when your job gets too stressful",
    "article_text": "Podcasts Podcasts Drowning in tedious tasks? Learn how to delegate or say no - without losing your job. Looking for a job or trying to nail it at your current one? Host Tiffany Ang and career counsellor Gerald Tan help navigate your important - and sometimes thorny - work life questions. This audio is generated by an AI tool. Tight schedules, endless tasks and demanding expectations – these are the daily realities for many working professionals. Emergency medicine physicians and authors Dr Adaira Landry and Dr Resa Lewiss share practical strategies on how to stay well despite busy lives. Here's an excerpt from the conversation: Gerald Tan, host:There's this one tip, one micro skill that's in the book about offloading routine tasks that bring you no joy or purpose. Many Singaporeans will want to rehearse that conversation because they can't wait to get things off their responsibility, but they don't know how. They don't know how to speak to their bosses about it, they would just suffer in silence. So tell us, how does that practically work out? Dr Adaira Landry, co-author and emergency medicine physician:It's very important for us to make it clear that we are not referring to the core roles of your job, I have given many lectures on this exact topic. We should have a sense of happiness, a sense of purpose, a sense of growth when we're doing work right, and if you're not having that, then perhaps the work you're doing is not right for you. And inevitably, every single time I give this lecture, someone more senior raises their hand and says: \"Are you telling people to quit their job? Because if I hired you for something and you tell me you're not going to do it because it doesn't bring you joy, I can't keep you there.\" And so I think that's a big, very important distinction ... What we're referring to is different. These are a lot of the more optional tasks that still fill our plate, that still cause mental overwhelm and burden. I have used ChatGPT as well for navigating conversations in anticipation for having it. And so there's all sorts of ways you can do it. And if that is the case, that's an important discussion for you to have with your personal \"board of directors\". So the way I do it typically is if there something I don't want to do, I think about the stakes of this. Like, is this something where if I say no or I quit, my supervisor would be upset or disappointed? It would impact my salary, my promotion? Dr Resa Lewiss,co-author and emergency medicine physician: There's a really good graphic in the book where we talk about automating, delegating, and there are a few others, and some things can just be taken off the plate. Let's say you want to train up someone who hasn't learned this skill that you no longer really are feeling it and you actually don't need it for doing the core roles and responsibilities of your job. By taking things off the plate that leaves opportunity for more things, or for you to actually do some more of that deliberate rest. Listen to more episodeshere.

    "title": "10 places to get your rice dumpling fix this year",
    "article_text": "Experiences Dining Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Experiences Experiences The Dragon Boat Festival falls on May 31, and from now till then, it is dumpling galore. (Photo: Feng Shui Inn) This audio is generated by an AI tool. There is so much to love about rice dumplings: The excitement of unwrapping the fragrant bamboo leaf package, that first bite of sticky glutinous rice, and the thrill of getting to the hearty filling with all those familiar and/or over-the-top ingredients. Now that the Dragon Boat Festival is near, there’s a whole world of rice dumpling,plump with all sorts of fillings designed to keep drawing you in while ignoring your burgeoning waistline — it’s a once-a-year indulgence, we tell ourselves as we take yet another bite. Amidst the glut of offerings, we picked out some that we think are worth a gander. For a decidedly unique option, check outFeng Shui Inn’sYunnan Wild Mushroom and Fish Maw Dumpling that comes as part of a six-piece dumpling gift set (S$128). Wild porcini and sarcodon imbricatus, said to be sourced from the mountains in Yunnan, are paired with fish maw and other premium ingredients like abalone, scallops and salted meat. The other rice dumplings in the set are Dried Seafood Steamed Dumplings and Trio Date Sweet Dumplings that feature honey dates, southern jujubes and red dates bound with red bean paste and stuffed within quinoa and pearl glutinous rice. The richness of glutinous rice tends to mute the flavours of its filings, so it stands to reason that stronger flavours make for tastier rice dumplings. In that vein,Hai Tien Lo’sSalted Fish and Preserved Meat Rice Dumpling (S$24) sounds like it’ll be a flavour-packed option enriched with Spanish pork and peanuts for a touch of nutty sweetness. If you like pulut hitam, consider the Black Glutinous Nonya Rice Dumpling (S$22) that harbours the classic flavours of Nonya dumpling against the earthiness of black glutinous rice. Kung Pao Chicken and Morel Mushroom Rice Dumpling (S$38) sounds like a great idea. It’s among the new offerings atLi Bai Cantonese Restaurant, along with a Teochew Beef Rice Dumpling ($48) and Lotus Paste Kansui Rice Dumpling ($38 for two). While the Kung Pao chicken rice dumpling is inspired by its namesake dish, it gets a jolt of umami from conpoy and dried shrimp. Cashew nuts and couscous impart a nice textural contrast. American Ginseng, Black Beans and Wolfberry (S$18) sound like a wholesome combination, especially if you’re a vegetarian looking to enjoy a plant-based rice dumpling. This is one of a few unique flavours from modern Cantonese restaurantMadame Fan,which also has a Singapore-style Chilli Crab Rice Dumpling ($22) if you prefer seafood over meat in your rice dumpling. Korean food fans will appreciateMan Fu Yuan’sKimchi with Kurobuta Cured Meat and Mushroom (S$23.80) dumpling, which gives us flashes of tteokbokki in dumpling form. If you happen to be a vegetarian that misses the Nonya version, check out the restaurant’s Nonya-style Dumpling with Plant-based Meat ($22.80). Maximalists will appreciatePeach Blossom’s Traditional Abalone, Preserved Vegetables and Pork Belly Rice Dumpling (S$38.80), a hefty 500g parcel that’ll make a satisfying meal for two. To feed up to four, try the Premium X.O. Cantonese Rice Dumpling filled with abalone, Hong Kong dried oyster, smoked duck, roasted pork, Kurobuta pork belly and other delicious things. Expect the heady aroma ofParadise Group’sBlack Truffle Honey BBQ Iberico Rice Dumpling to fill the room as soon as you begin unwrapping it. Although the pairing sounds like a stretch, the sweetness of the honey Iberico pork plays nicely against the musky black truffle. The popular restaurant chain also introduced a Braised Pork with Conpoy and Mushroom Rice Dumpling that’s only available as part of a gift set (S$72.80), which includes four other flavours like Abalone with Salted Pork Belly Brown Rice Dumpling and Osmanthus Gula Melaka Red Bean Paste. Shang Palace’selegant riff on classic Teochew-style dumpling pairs Red Fermented Bean Curd Pork Belly with Peanut Rice (S$29.20). The result is lush and earthy, with a distinct savoury depth from the fermented bean curd. Those who prefer the classics can revisit Shang Palace’s Signature Barbecued Pork Rice Dumpling with Yunnan Ham and Conpoy (S$32.90), shaped like a golden pillow and rich with roasted duck, pork belly, black mushrooms and mung bean. It was only a matter of time before someone translated our newfound love for Sichuan green peppercorns to a rice dumpling. Cantonese restaurant Wan Hao has done it with its new Pork Trotter and Peanut with Sichuan Green Peppercorn (S$25). According to the restaurant, the pork trotters are braised for about 90 minutes before it is marinated in the green peppercorn sauce to imbue it with numbing kick. The rice parcels are then stuffed with this filling and and poached for several hours to lock in all those robust flavours.

    "title": "'Deep sadness': Doctors, nurses recall intensity of treating victims from River Valley fire",
    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore Children and adults injured in the River Valley fire began arriving at hospitals in the morning of Apr 8, triggering a swift and coordinated emergency response. Bystanders climbed scaffolding to help rescue several people from the shophouse fire in River Valley on Apr 8, 2025. Some of these casualties were sent to the Singapore General Hospital's Emergency Department. (Photos: Chan Teck Hock, Lan Yu) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Just a few hours into her shift on the morning of Apr 8, nurse Lim Zi Ying at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) was pulled from her routine duties to respond to an emergency of unprecedented scale in her 21 years of service. A shophouse along River Valley Road, just 1.8km from the hospital,had caught fire. Inside, multiple people – including children – were trapped. Videos of the rescue, showing victims perched precariously on a narrow ledge on the second storey, quickly went viral and gripped the nation. By late morning, 22 people – 16 children and six adults – had been transported to hospitals. Among them was a 10-year-old Australian girl who laterdied from her injuries. KKH, located along Bukit Timah Road, and Singapore General Hospital (SGH) at Outram were among the hospitals that received casualties from the blaze. Ms Lim, a senior nurse clinician at KKH's Children's Emergency, steeled herself for what proved to be an intense few hours. She and her team raced to prepare the resuscitation room in the emergency department, activating equipment and laying out medication. Casualties from the blaze began arriving via ambulances at around 10.45am. The hospitals cannot reveal the number of casualties they received or the extent of their injuries, but Associate Professor Sashikumar Ganapathy, the head of KKH's emergency medicine department, told CNA that casualties arrived in batches until past noon. He described the logistical challenge of managing an unknown number of incoming casualties. \"But that is part of the training right? We are trained to be ready,\" said Assoc Prof Ganapathy, who is also deputy chairman of the hospital's medicine division. It was his first time receiving paediatric casualties from a fire of such a scale, he said. Over the next few hours, more than nine medical departments were activated, including ear, nose and throat specialists, paediatric anaesthetists and plastic surgeons. Fire-related injuries can lead to severe inhalation trauma in children, making airway management a top priority. For children, it falls to the paediatric anaesthesia team to ensure that the respiratory tract functions normally and the patient's breathing is not obstructed. Treatment included administering medication via face masks, inserting IV lines, managing pain and stabilising breathing. As the leading nurse, Ms Lim also coordinated with senior management to ensure sufficient manpower and resource allocation, while supporting both staff and patients on the ground. Despite it being her first time as the leading nurse in an incident of this scale, Ms Lim said she is grateful that everything went smoothly. \"My training in emergency nursing and also dealing with mass casualty incidents has allowed me to be able to stay calm and composed in this kind of situations,\" she added. Among those called into action was Dr Gale Lim, head of the department of plastic, reconstructive and aesthetic surgery, who had experience managing mass casualties from a coffee shop gas explosion a decade ago. When casualties from River Valley began arriving, the first thing she did was to organise and activate a team of about five doctors and up to eight nurses, who were split between the Children's Emergency and the ICU, where they saw to burn wounds. She knew exactly what they had to do – \"carefully and systematically assess\" every patient. Her team followed a careful process: removing temporary dressings, assessing and documenting each wound, before “scrubbing down” – where a layer of the patient's dead skin is removed and the area cleaned up before it is dressed. Doctors typically assess the percentage of total body surface area burns and the depth of burns, before coming up with a treatment plan. More serious wounds could require surgery such as skin grafting, where dead tissue is replaced with healthy skin from another part of the body. At SGH, the arrival of paediatric patients – uncommon at the adult-focused hospital – required rapid adaptation. Nurse clinician Muqtasidatum Mustaffa said the situation was complicated by not knowing how many patients to expect. \"There was a lot of uncertainty. We just had to prepare our resources, prepare our manpower,\" she said. Emergency medicine specialist Dr Fua Tzay-Ping added: \"It's always good to over-prepare ... from past experience, details may follow as the situation unfolds.\" The hospital converted areas within its critical care zone to make room for incoming casualties, moving existing patients elsewhere in the department. Staff prepped child-sized equipment and dosages and deployed airway teams, plastic surgeons and neonatology staff before the first ambulance arrived. It was the largest number of casualties from a fire that she had ever dealt with in her more than 20 years at SGH, Ms Muqtasidatum said. \"In the back of my mind, I knew that it was going to be a very stressful and challenging situation where we needed to get our resources correct,\" she said. \"We'd have to make quick decisions.\" To streamline care, a senior physician and senior nurse were assigned to specific cases, with an additional nurse circulating to assist. Once stabilised, paediatric patients were transferred to KKH for further treatment. While clinical focus remained the priority during the emergency, emotional tolls emerged later. \"Caring for the surge of critically ill paediatric patients was mentally challenging as many of the staff are parents of young children as well,\" said Dr Fua. The hospital conducted a debrief to help staff process the event. Dr Fua described a wave of sadness that came after her shift, once she watched the viral videos of the fire. \"When we are working ... you just think of it as a fire,\" she said. But the human cost became real later, and she \"felt very deep sadness for all those who were affected\". She is relieved that her team managed to do its best for every victim, and remains grateful to bystanders whohelped in the rescue. \"If not for the public and migrant workers, I think we would probably have more casualties.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "article_text": "Asia Asia Indonesia’s 961 local leaders are free to create their own programmes. But initiatives such as a militaristic boot camp for delinquents raise questions on whether greater coordination with the central government is needed, analysts say. Junior high school students undergoing a 14-day boot camp in Purwakarta, West Java on May 3, 2025. (Photo: West Java government) This audio is generated by an AI tool. JAKARTA: Wearing green uniforms and hats resembling those of the Indonesian army, dozens of teenage boys lined up neatly in the middle of a field in Purwakarta, West Java, shouting: “Ready, ready, ready! Awesome! Let’s keep up the spirit!” One could be forgiven for thinking they were soldiers-in-training but they were, in fact, Indonesian junior high school students who had been deemed delinquent undergoing a 14-day boot camp. West Java governor Dedi Mulyadi, who introduced the programme, believes it is the military who can discipline these students. He has allocated 6 billion rupiah (US$363,590) for it and aims for up to 2,000 students to take part.

This is to ensure they align with thetargets of Indonesian PresidentPrabowo Subianto. The programme, which makes use of regional military posts and involves the Indonesian military and national police, has prompted criticism from some lawmakers and rights groups, who question if this is the right way to educate children. But Dedi has brushed off the criticism. “If you are a leader, you must be as firm as a rock,” he told reporters on May 3 when asked about the controversy. “If you have thoughts and ideas, never give up,” he said while visiting the students in Purwakarta. Dedi is not the only local leader in Indonesia whose new programmes have been met with scepticism. Like him, several others have stoked debate since Indonesiaelected 961 governors, regents and mayors on Nov 27 last yearand swore them in on Feb 20. Besides his training programme for supposedly delinquent youths, Dedi has also made headlines for suggesting that husbands who want to receive social handouts undergo a vasectomy to ensure they do not have more children and increase poverty. It is also a way for men to participate in family planning as the “burden should not fall solely on women”, he said. With a population of about 50 million, West Java is Indonesia’s most populous province, and about 7.5 per cent of its inhabitants live in poverty. “If people cannot afford childbirth, pregnancy, and education expenses, then they should not yet pursue parenthood,” said Dedi. He offered 500,000 rupiah in cash incentives to those who agree to undergo vasectomy and said:\"This is not coercion, but an invitation for shared responsibility. We provide incentives, not just empty appeals.” His plan has drawn mixed reactions from the public, Islamic figures as well as ministers. Some have called it discriminatory, while others have said it is a violation of one’s autonomy. In neighbouring Jakarta, governorPramono Anunghas made it mandatory for civil servants to use public transport on Wednesdays since Apr 30 and to take a selfie as evidence. The programme aims to combat the capital’s notorious traffic congestion and air pollution. But so far, there has been no sanction against the 50,000 civil servants who have not obeyed the rule. Pramono also plans to dedicate an island in Jakarta’s Thousand Islands regency for cats to solve the capital’s ever-growing stray cat problem. According to Jakarta’s government, the city has about 860,000 stray cats, possibly even 1.5 million. Meanwhile, Jakarta’s population is about 11 million people. The government said an island of the Thousand Islands would be transformed into a tourist destination, creating local jobs. \"If we can make it happen, then it can also be a (source of) revenue for the Thousand Islands, for people to come and enjoy cat tourism,” Pramono told local media on Mar 13. Over in Sulawesi, the regent of Gorontalo, Sofyan Puhi, in April banned transgender women from singing on stage during events, sparking protests from some transgender groups. Gorontalo’s government said this is in response to public complaints that claim transgender performers violate Indonesia’s social norms. Indonesia’s regional autonomy law gives local leaders the authority to implement their own programmes. In the first 100 days of their term, it is not surprising that some leaders are trying to be innovative and introduce schemes that appear to be populist, said public policy expert Trubus Rahadiansyah of Jakarta’s Trisakti University. This is because they want to convince people that they are capable and increase their popularity, particularly if they wish to seek re-election in 2029. “Such programmes could significantly affect their popularity,” said Trubus. “And this must be done early, so the public is convinced they have a good leader who keeps his campaign promises. If the leaders introduce programmes later on, the public may not be bothered anymore (to learn about their programmes).” However, Trubus said leaders should remember Prabowo’s goals and, most importantly, develop comprehensive plans that are well thought-out and aligned with the president’s. Prabowo’s targets are summed up in his eight visions and missions, Asta Cita, which include strengthening democracy, the country’sPancasila ideologyand human rights, strengthening national defence and security, creating jobs, and developing human resources and gender equality. Asta Cita also includes a focus on downstreaming commodity supply chains so that Indonesia benefits more from its mineral resources, developing villages, political reforms and combating corruption, and creating a harmonious environment and religious tolerance. “There should be a direct correlation between the regional leaders’ plans and the central government’s, the Asta Cita,” said Trubus. To stay on the right track, leaders should actively consult relevant parties, said experts. Trubus said regional leaders should ideally consult the interior ministry, which oversees the regional leaders, before implementing new programmes. Ideally, regional leaders should also involve the public before introducing a new scheme to avoid controversy and appearing as though they are showing off regional superiority, he said. The interior ministry should also be more proactive in contacting regional leaders and supervising them so they stay on the right track with their missions, as well as Prabowo’s. “For example, the transgender ban (in Gorontalo) is against human rights. That is dangerous,” he added. Political psychology expert Hamdi Muluk from the University of Indonesia said regional leaders should create evidence-based policies. They can consult their subordinates who are experts on some issues, he said. Alternatively, they can reach out to universities to conduct research before coming up with a new programme. “For example, the boot camp military programme can be studied very carefully (with) a pedagogical, psychological approach, before being implemented,” said Hamdi. “It would be better if policy creation were on a meritocratic or technocratic basis.” Ultimately, economist Mohammad Faisal from think tank the Centre of Reform on Economics (CORE) Indonesia said there are many problems in the country, and Prabowo has many goals. Every region is also striving for economic growth. On Monday, the Indonesian statistics agency said the country’s economy grew4.87 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, its weakest growth rate in over three years. It was down from 5.02 per cent in the previous quarter, and a far cry from Prabowo’s target to achieve 8 per cent economic growth annually. “The main problem at the moment everywhere is economic problems, from lack of jobs to eradicating poverty – every region faces these problems,” said Faisal. \"The role of regional heads is not only to target short-term populist programmes or quick wins, but they should solve the root of the problems in their regions.” He added that with the uncertain global economic outlook,which would affect Indonesia’s economy, the pressure is greater for regional leaders to excel. There are also problems that are impossible for one region to tackle alone, he said. \"There must be synchronisation between regional policies and even collaboration between regions,” he said. Indonesians like Jakartan Fita Destriyana, 30, want the government to create policies that directly benefit ordinary people. “For example, if the government focuses on providing free and accessible education,” she said. “In my neighbourhood Tanah Abang, there are still many school dropouts – even though Tanah Abang is near the presidential palace.\" Subscribe to CNA’s Morning Brief An automated curation of our top stories to start your day.

Delhi now has the dubious honour of being the world’s most polluted capital or capital territory for six consecutive years, according to the annual World Air Quality Report by Swiss air quality monitoring firm IQAir. In November, the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) soared to 795, almost eight times the threshold value of 100, when air quality becomes unhealthy. In some areas, the AQI even reached 1,185. But the pollution is not confined to Delhi. Six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities last year — and 74 of the 100 most polluted cities — were in India, according to IQAir. A report released last year by the US-based Health Effects Institute, in partnership with UNICEF, also found that air pollution caused 2.1 million deaths in India in 2021. This included 169,400 children aged under five — the highest number globally. “Pollution and the health risk are now quite uniformly spread (across India),” said Anumita Roychowdhury, the executive director of research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment. WATCH: India has 8 out of 10 most polluted cities in the world. Why? Can it beat air pollution? (46:51) Yet, pollution is hardly a political issue in the country, and living with polluted air has become nothing more than the norm for many locals. “I’m not wearing a mask because I find it a little inconvenient, and I probably have got used to the pollution,” said New Delhi resident Meera Bhatia, when the AQI was between 200 and 400 (very unhealthy to hazardous). “Ignorance is bliss sometimes.” Even as the lack of a political push by the people is an obstacle to change, experts warn that the crisis can no longer be ignored as the deaths and economic toll mount. Theprogramme Insightexamines why India struggles with air pollution, why the smog is worse in Delhi and during winter and what it will take to combat the problem. Delhi, the world’s second-most populous capital territory, is at the heart of India’s air quality problem because of its countless sources of pollution: industrial activity, construction dust, waste burning and, above all, traffic. Nearly 656,700 new vehicles were sold in Delhi in 2023; in addition, around 1.1 million vehicles enter and exit the city daily. Car ownership is being driven by India’s growing middle class — and is oftenthe most practical choice in Delhi. “You’re making flyovers, widening roads that are impossible to cross,” said Roychowdhury. “The road design is telling us ... we’re designing the city for you to drive a car, but not to walk, not to cycle and (not to) use public transport.” While Delhi has imposed measures to cut emissions, such as stricter emission norms, clean fuel mandates and electric vehicle incentives, enforcement remains weak. Many of the city’s eight million registered vehicles (as at 2023) are old, with polluting models still plying the roads. Adding to its burden is pollution from areas outside the city. This accounts for more than half of Delhi’s smog, according to the Centre for Science and Environment, and includes crop burning. “Farmers find it easier to just burn (their crop residue),” said Roychowdhury. “It’s much more expensive to hire labourers to cut it from the roots.” Despite regulations and fines to discourage crop burning, and despite some incentives for farmers to harvest their crop residue to sell as straw instead, the practice continues. While the incidence of crop fires in states like Punjab and Haryana has largely fallen in recent years, some other states have seen more frequent incidents, and the smog wafting into Delhi remains significant. Delhi’s geographical location is also not in its favour. The landlocked city sits on the Indo-Gangetic Plain, a low-lying region stretching to the foothills of the Himalayas, which act as a wall, trapping polluted air. “(Delhi) can swallow everything but can’t (expel) anything,” said Gufran Beig, chair professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies. According to experts, geographical location and weather patterns play a big part in India’s seasonal spike in pollution. Hence coastal cities see relatively better air quality compared with inland areas in northern India, such as Delhi. In summer, warm air near the ground expands and rises, causing denser, cooler air from the Himalayas to rush into the space, creating wind that scatters the smog. But in winter, cold ground-level air does not rise and disperse pollutants. The result: a blanket of toxic air that lingers for days, even weeks. To be sure, air pollution remains a problem “throughout the year” and across India, said Zerin Osho, the director of the India programme at the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development. “The entire country is grappling with this,” she said. “It just becomes more prominent … during the winters.” When experts talk about poor air quality, they are most concerned about particulate matter 2.5, also known as PM2.5. These microscopic particles measure 2.5 microns or less in diameter — roughly 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair. They can be found in pollutants such as dust, smoke and soot, or black carbon, and have been linked to respiratory and heart diseases as well as cancer. “(They) will get deposited … (in) your lungs,” warned Beig. “They’re the most lethal particles.” The particles are so tiny they can stay in the air for long periods, according to IQAir. Once inhaled, they can lodge in the respiratory tract, irritate its lining and damage the lungs. “PM2.5 particulate material is so small that it can go through the blood from the mother to the foetus,” said Neelam Kler, adviser to the neonatology department at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi. Her team found that PM2.5 pollution can “significantly” affect foetal weight and may increase the risk of underdeveloped lungs, among other health issues. According to the State of Global Air 2020 report, more than 116,000 newborns in India died in 2019 within 27 days of birth as a result of air pollution exposure — again the highest number globally, averaging 318 deaths a day. “The cost of air pollution isn’t that it kills directly, but it worsens the underlying condition, tilts the balance towards more severe disease and causes death,” said Randeep Guleria, chairman of Medanta’s Institute of Internal Medicine, Respiratory and Sleep Medicine. Beyond the human cost, there are the economic drawbacks. Global consulting firm Dalberg concluded in 2021 that air pollution cost India US$95 billion annually from lower labour productivity and consumer footfall and premature death, which amounted to 3 per cent of the country’s 2019 gross domestic product. “If I’m a company investing in India, and I know that my labour isn’t going to be able to show up to work, it’s a net loss for me,” said Osho. Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive officer of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, added: “We want to be an open economy. We want to attract foreign investment. Clearly, we must be losing foreign investment with polluted cities. “The day we recognise that in the world’s fastest-growing major economy, air pollution is holding us back from growing faster, … we’ll realise that investing in clean air is one of the best investments we can make for our economic development.” India has been confronting its pollution problem for some time — since the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act was passed in 1981 — but results have been mixed. Experts have pointed out gaps between policy aims and implementation. In 2019, the government launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), for which more than US$2.3 billion has been earmarked until 2026, to cut air pollution levels in 131 cities across India. In Delhi, two smog towers were installed in 2021 to function as air purifiers, sucking in the surrounding air and filtering out particulates. The building cost was roughly 200 million rupees each (US$2.4 million), with monthly operational costs of 1.5 million rupees each by their second year. But with the data showing that the towers lowered pollution by only 17 per cent within a 100m radius, more than 47,000 towers would be needed to cover the whole city, which the Delhi Pollution Control Committee said was impractical. Even if at least 500 to 600 towers are needed, Osho cited conservatively, “when you do a cost-benefit analysis, it doesn’t make sense”. Another criticism from experts is that the government’s monitoring and clean-up efforts are targeting the wrong pollutants. For example, during months with the poorest air quality, sprinklers in Delhi are deployed to trap construction dust, which comprises mostly PM10 particles. “(The authorities) do really well on dust parameters but not necessarily on the lethal parameters. So they started focusing on dust,” said Osho, who cited data showing that 67 per cent of NCAP funding was spent on dust reduction. “But the one that gives you lung cancer, PM2.5, isn’t being looked at (enough).” According to her, India’s Central Pollution Control Board has the idea that “if you’re reducing PM10, which is a bigger molecule, you’re automatically reducing PM2.5” — which, she said, “doesn’t hold, mathematically”. “To explain this very simply, if you wear a cloth mask, you’ll be able to protect yourself from dust because it’s PM10. But PM2.5 … will pass through a cloth mask,” she continued. “If you’re only reducing PM10 and not PM2.5, you’re still going to die.” Besides a greater focus on tackling PM2.5 particles, experts are calling for a shift from a city-centric approach to an airshed-centric approach, as air pollutants are not confined by state or city boundaries. An airshed refers to a geographic area sharing the same air quality and movement conditions. In India, this area could span several states. So in 2021, the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas was set up to coordinate efforts across territories. But when the air quality worsened last September, the Supreme Court chastised the commission for failing to enforce its own directives and prosecute any stubble-burning violations. “It’s a multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder kind of an issue,” said the commission’s member-secretary, Arvind Nautiyal. “Getting all those people together will be an onerous task. It’s definitely a long journey.” While progress on the issue creeps along, locals in Delhi and the rest of India may have choices to make. Madhu, a writer who moved from Chennai for a job in Delhi in late 2023, found the capital territory’s air so debilitatingshe decided to leave last year. “I didn’t have an option to go out a lot without coming back with a cold or a cough or a dizzy head,” she said. “When my health just kept deteriorating, … I realised that it’s probably not (all) worth it.” While she had the means to move, millions of others do not. Some of Delhi’s poorest people, for example, live and work in or around the city’s three landfills, where waste picking is often their only source of income. These mountains of trash regularly catch fire, releasing plumes of noxious smoke. “There’s a lot of smoke in the summer,” said Muskan, whose family survives on picking and selling waste. “It even stings the eyes.” Even efforts to manage waste through incineration at waste-to-energy plants add to the pollution. With the landfill fires and winter smog, the urban poor in Delhi are left exposed to the elements. Back in Anvi’s ward, a toddler named Humaira lay limply in her mother’s arms. She had been admitted with a bad cough and cold and breathlessness. “We want to leave (Delhi), but we don’t have a job,” said her father, Arif. “There’s nothing.” There is no escape in many parts of the country. According to the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago’s latest Air Quality Life Index report, 42.6 per cent of India’s population in 2022 lived in areas that did not meet the national air quality standard for PM2.5. “Pollution is concerning,” remarked a Delhi University student who gave his name as Harshanshu. “(But) with problems like food, clothes and houses not being solved, the people of the country will think about pollution later.” This goes to the “core of the issue”, which citizens “haven’t internalised”, observed Ghosh. “We still need a democratic demand for clean air,” he said. “Bad air isn’t something that you become immune to — this isn’t a virus. … This is a toxin.” Watch this episode ofInsight here.

    "title": "Commentary: What happened to Singapore’s stock market?",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary More companies are heading for the exit than entering the Singapore stock market, says financial journalist Ven Sreenivasan. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Once regarded as a gateway to Asia, the Singapore market is indistress of sortsas an increasing number of listed companies head for the door. To date this year, eight companies have announced plans for delistings. With several more indicating buyout offers on the table, this could rise to a dozen within the next couple of months. Meanwhile there has only been one new initial public offering (IPO) on the local bourse, that of motoring group Vin Holdings. Another, candy maker YLF Group, has just called off plans to list here. This follows a dismal 2024, where the Singapore Exchange (SGX) saw only four IPOs but 20 delistings. Not exactly the kind of news the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS)Equities Market Review Group(EMRG) would welcome. Set up last year to devise measures which would inject life into SGX, the EMRG has already announced several measures, including aS$5 billion Equity Market Development Programme- an initiative designed to encourage more investment in Singapore-listed equities. Corporate tax incentives and rebates, streamlined listing processes and simplified prospectus disclosure requirements are part of the plan. While these steps are positive on paper at least, the events of the past five months suggest that investors are not exactly tripping over themselves to list on the local bourse. Volumes remain modest at best and prices are largely subdued (which some might say is a positive in a volatile and unpredictable world). But there is no denying that the Singapore equity market faces some serious underlying problems which prevent it from playing to its full potential. Chief amongst these is low valuations. About two-thirds of the over 600 listed companies on SGX are trading below their net tangible values. This undervaluation is particularly pronounced amongst small and mid-cap stocks, despite many of these companies being profitable and paying attractive dividends. As a result, their stocks are priced at a significant discount to valuations that they might otherwise fetch in private deals or even on other exchanges. This has prompted not only privatisations by controlling shareholders, but has also attracted offers by third parties, as were the cases for Ban Leong Technologies and Amara Holdings. The root cause of this undervaluation is low liquidity. Trading volumes on the SGX are not only significantly lower than those of larger markets like Hong Kong and the US, but generally also lag regional bourses such as Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Jakarta. While there are many reasons why this is so, one reality is that the Singapore market is dominated by sectors like property, conglomerates and banking stocks. Tech stocks barely feature here. This is unlike Wall Street, where tech stocks, led by the so-called Magnificent Seven, dominate. Even in Hong Kong, new economy plays like Tencent, Alibaba, Xiaomi and JD.com attract strong investor interest which often then filters through the entire market. Without a sufficiently large ecosystem of new economy growth plays, the Singapore market will continue to struggle to attract the next generation of inventors. Speaking to market insiders, one also comes away with the impression that the SGX’s regulatory regime, while acknowledged to be amongst the best in the world, is somewhat burdensome for smaller companies. Companies with thin or volatile margins will find it difficult to cope with the high compliance costs, and may ultimately head for the door. More so if their stocks attract scant interest in the market. So what is the solution? While the EMRG’s initiatives appear to be a step in the right direction, some industry observers argue that more could be done to support an illiquid bourse. While S$5 billion is a good start for injecting liquidity into the market, it is worth considering if government-backed funds likeGICshould also invest in SGX-listed stocks. As I have said before in my prior columns on this subject, if the SGX succeeds in attracting regional companies to list here, it makes sense for the GIC to invest in them, particularly when it does so on other exchanges like Hong Kong. Such an approach could further increase the appeal of the SGX as a listing destination. There have also been some suggestions that restrictions on short selling and margin trading be eased to support liquidity. Properly regulated and confined to “accredited investors” who have undergone some form of training or attended a requisite course, this could bring back the animal spirits necessary to fire up liquidity in the market. The Securities Investors Association (Singapore), or SIAS, could undertake such a programme and certification. There are many ways to skin the cat but there is no single solution to the problem. The issues of liquidity, delistings and the lack of new IPOs is a serious concern for a market situated at the heart of one of Asia’s premier financial and wealth management centres. But this is not an insurmountable problem. It just requires serious workable solutions which address core issues. Half-hearted and piecemeal measures may not be enough. The criticism now is that the EMRG’s initiatives are too few, too late and not comprehensive enough to provide a big bang solution for a very sickly market. More boldness is required.

    "title": "Iran says nuclear talks 'difficult but useful', US 'encouraged'",
    "article_text": "World World In this photo released by the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, center, is welcomed by an unidentified Omani official upon his arrival at Muscat, Oman, for negotiations with US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, as Iranian Ambassador to Oman Mousa Farhang stands at right, May 11, 2025. (Photo: Iranian Foreign Ministry via AP) MUSCAT, Oman: Iran and the United States wrapped upnuclear talksin Oman on Sunday (May 11) with no apparent breakthrough in a public standoff over enrichment, but with both sides confirming plans for future negotiations. This was the fourth round of talks that began nearly a month ago, marking the highest-level contact between the two foes since Washington withdrew in 2018 from a landmark nuclear deal, during President Donald Trump's first term. Both sides had reported progress in the previous three rounds, and on Sunday Iran said the meeting was \"difficult but useful\" while a senior US official said Washington was \"encouraged\". The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington was \"encouraged by today's outcome and look forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future\", without specifying when. In a post on X, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said that the \"next round will be coordinated and announced by Oman\", which in turn said \"the talks will take place once both parties... consult their leaderships\". According to the US official, the talks Sunday were \"both direct and indirect, and lasted over three hours\". \"Agreement was reached to move forward\" and \"continue working through technical elements\", the official added. Baqaei had earlier said negotiators would push for relief from US sanctions. Iran entered the talks saying that its right to maintain uranium enrichment was \"non-negotiable\", while Washington's chief negotiator Steve Witkoff has called it a \"red line\". Following the talks, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led Tehran's delegation, reiterated Iran's stance on enrichment, saying it \"must continue and there is no room for compromise on it\". He noted the latest meeting was \"more serious\" than previous rounds, telling Iranian state TV that Tehran may be open to limit the rate of enrichment \"to help build trust\". The talks come amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region, with US President Trump heading to the Gulf next week, and Araghchi just back from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, two stops on Trump's first major foreign tour. Iran's top diplomat is set to visit Monday the United Arab Emirates, another planned stop on Trump's tour, for talks with senior officials, the foreign ministry said. Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said the talks on Sunday \"included useful and original ideas reflecting a shared wish to reach an honourable agreement\". Western countries, including the United States, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, while Tehran insists that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 percent purity, far above the 3.67 percent limit set in the 2015 deal with Washington and other world powers, but below the 90 percent needed for weapons-grade material. Witkoff, Trump's Middle East envoy, said in a Friday interview that Iran's \"enrichment facilities have to be dismantled\". \"That's our red line. No enrichment,\" he told US right-wing outlet Breitbart News, after initially suggesting flexibility on Tehran maintaining low-level enrichment of uranium for civilian purposes. On Sunday, Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian said calls to dismantle Tehran's nuclear facilities were \"unacceptable\". \"Iran will not give up its peaceful nuclear rights under any circumstances and will not back down from its rights in the face of pressure,\" he said. Iran adhered to the 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers for a year after Washington's withdrawal, before beginning to roll back its compliance. Since returning to office in January, Trump has revived his \"maximum pressure\" approach against Tehran, while backing nuclear diplomacy but warning of potential military action if it fails. The talks are taking place amid renewed scrutiny of key aspects of Tehran's nuclear programme, particularly its stockpile of enriched uranium and the pace of its enrichment activities. European governments are weighing whether to trigger the \"snapback\" mechanism under the 2015 deal, which would reinstate UN sanctions in response to Iranian non-compliance, an option that expires in October. Araghchi, in an article published on Sunday by French weekly Le Point, warned against a \"strategy of confrontation\". Israel, which opposes the negotiations its close ally the United States has conducted with regional foe Iran, said Tehran must not be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons. \"Iran is the most dangerous state in the world\" and \"must not be allowed to obtain the world's most dangerous weapon,\" said Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. Israel is the Middle East's only, if undeclared, nuclear-armed state.

    "title": "2025's Summer Movies, Definitively Ranked",
    "article_text": "Summermoviesare officiallyback. When was the last time we had such a strong blockbuster season lineup going into the season? Yes, there was Barbenheimer back in 2023—but that was two films on the same day. In 2025, early signals suggest that the summer war for multiplex supremacy is going to rage on for months. For one, we've got two of the most hotly anticipatedcomic book moviessinceAvengers: EndgameinSupermanandThe Fantastic Four: First Steps. BetweenM3GAN 2.0,Weaponsand28 Years Later, genre thrills abound. And then there's Joseph Kosinski'sF1, the Brad Pitt racing thriller that looks to replicate the kinetic brilliance ofTop Gun: Maverick. These and a whole slate of other major new films suggest that we're going to be spending a lot of time hiding from the sun in air-conditioned cinema auditoriums this summer; our tans might suffer, but at least the movies will be great. Here are ten we're already seated for. Past Liveswriter-directorCeline Songis debuting her sophomore movie in August (though the Americans will get it in June), and it's a New York rom-com led by a love triangle of A-list talent:Pedro Pascal,Chris Evansand Dakota Johnson. By the looks of things it'll be a real throwback to those mid-budget studio films of the pre-Avengerspast where a bunch of great actors are assembled to cut it up on screen for 90 minutes — and what's not to love about that? Don't expectMaterialiststo blow away the box office, but we couldn't imagine a nicer awards-courting digestif to close out the summer season. Is it a fool's errand to look forward to aJurassicmovie in 2025, withRebirthset to be the seventh installment, when none of them havereallybeen good since the originalJurassic Park? Probably! But there are reasons to reckon thatRebirthwill save everyone's favourite dino franchise from extinction. Its assembled creative team is killer, led by dependableGodzilladirector Gareth Edwards and returningJPwriter David Koepp. Then there's the primo cast of Scarlett Johansson,Mahershala Aliand Jonathan Bailey, with the series seemingly moving on fromChris Prattand Co. Don't be overly surprised if it's a banger. How to Train Your Dragonisn't quite aMinionsor Pixar-sized franchise at the box office, but the original animated films have historically done good business at the multiplex, so there's little reason to think less of the upcoming live-action remake. The underwhelming performance of the live-actionSnow Whiteearlier this year might dampen expectations — have audiences become fatigued with live-action remakes, or is it just a Disney thing?—but it feels as though a big family-friendly fantasy blockbuster should sustain the shift to live-action better than the IRL version of a beloved classic no one asked for. The all-singing, all-dancing, all-slaying AI doll is back for an upgrade inM3GAN 2.0, the sequel to Gerard Johnstone's 2023 hit horror camp-a-thon. With a new villain on the horizon, it looks like2.0is taking theT-2route and making a hero out of M3GAN, which is totally to be expected after she went viral and became every gay guy's go-to drag Halloween costume. The main indicator that Universal is expecting great things here? While the first movie came out in January—typically a movie dead zone reserved for failed awards bait and C-tier studio efforts—2.0has been given a prime late June release amid the28 YearsandF1's of the world. Huge slay. With the recent critical andbox office successofThunderbolts*akaThe New Avengers,one has to wonder whether we'll look back on 2025 as the year that superhero movies reclaimed their supremacy over the box office. The first of two major test cases will be James Gunn's back-to-basics reboot ofSuperman,previously titledSuperman: Legacy, which recasts David Corenswet as the titular hero and resets the waning DC film universe. Fortunately, Gunn has an excellent track record insofar as comic book films go, having helmed both theGuardians of the Galaxytrilogy andThe Suicide Squad, all of which rank among the genre's top efforts. WillSupermanbe his crowning achievement, or will it prove his kryptonite? Oncurrent evidence, we're leaning towards the former. Expected to be Tom Cruise'sMission: Impossibleswansong,The Final Reckoningwill be the eighth instalment of the death-defying spy franchise—and by far the most expensive at an eye-watering $400 million. But hey, you spare no expense when it comes to the King of Hollywood, not least in a post-Top Gun: Maverickworld, and these films usually do pretty well regardless. The movie is set to pick up after the events ofDead Reckoning Part One, with Cruise's Ethan Hunt continuing his pursuit of the AI program known as “the Entity,” while at some point hanging from a biplane en route. The stunts will be crazy, we'll wonder how a now 62-year-old Cruise wasn't killed, and further, we'll be begging him to drop the skin care routine. It'll take a lot to claw back that mega-budget, but who cares? This is about as sure a bet for a good time at the movies as they come. Six years after Disney completed its acquisition of 20th Century Fox, reclaiming the rights to The X-Men and the Fantastic Four in the process, Marvel's first family are finally making their feature-length debut on the MCU stage. Excitement around superhero movies has waned, but there's a lot of reason to think that nüFantastic Fourwill represent a step back in the right direction: take its ‘60s retro-futuristic,Fallout-esque setting, with costumes and sets that are steeped in Googie imagination, or that stacked cast, led by Pedro “I’m literally in everything” Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. All in all, it's the first time we've actively looked forward to a comic book flick sinceSpider-Man: No Way Home, and may just be the shot in the arm that Marvel needs in the run-up toAvengers: Doomsday. On the back of its thus far flawless viral marketing campaign, followed by a spooky trailer steeped in dread,Barbariandirector Zach Cregger'sWeaponshas emerged as a major dark horse in the summer movie season. The logline is simple: 17 kids go missing at exactly the same time in the dead of night in the same small Pennsylvania town, leaving the locals to grapple with a terrifying mystery. Speaking to the huge amount of buzz Creggers' film has built in the movie world, theWeaponsscript was subject to a vicious bidding war before it went into production; soon after losing out,Get Outhorror mogul Jordan Peeleallegedly cut ties with his management staff. All in all, it's about as hot as horror properties get. Rumours of a sequel in the28series have circulated since the release of28 Weeks Later, which came out way-back-when in 2007. Now we finally have28 Years Later, which looks to pick up on events almost three decades after the escape of those rage-infected chimps saw the swift collapse of the still-quarantined UK. Plot details are very much under wraps, but we know it will at least in part concern a NATO squad that travel to Northern England for yet-to-be-disclosed reasons. Plus, Jack O'Connell will appear as a cult figure, while Ralph Fiennes is playing a post-apocalyptic doctor. The first trailer was one of the best we've seen in years, and the second has ramped up our anticipation tenfold. There are big plans for a trilogy, with sequelThe Bone Templealready in production for a January release. Look, you never know for sure, but we'd put a big bet onF1topping the podium come the end of the summer movie season. Two reasons: firstly, it's directed by Joseph Kosinski, who looks to replicate hisTop Gun: Mavericksuccess with another story about an aging anti-establishment hot shot going for one last dance; secondly, said hero is played byBrad Pitt, whose name remains synonymous with “box office” in the minds of most global movie goers. All told, it pretty much looks like theTop Gunsequel with race cars instead of jet planes. And that's one formula for sure-fire success we can get behind.

    "title": "Pope Leo Calls For Peace and Aid in Gaza As Trump Sets Off To the Middle East",
    "article_text": "“Never again war,”Pope Leo XIVexclaimedduring his first Sunday address to an estimated 100,000 people gathered in St. Peter’s Square. Thenew pontiffcalled for an “authentic, just and lasting peace” in Ukraine and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Leo, continuing in theadvocacyof hispredecessor, Pope Francis, advocated for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Palestine and delivered “to the exhausted civilian population,” adding that “all hostages” held by Hamas in Gaza must be freed. “In today’s dramatic scenario of a third world war being fought piecemeal, as Pope Francis said, I too turn to the world’s leaders with an ever timely appeal: never again war!” Leo—who in the past hascritiquedPresidentDonald Trumpand Vice PresidentJD Vanceon social media—told the crowd. A view of the people gathering to attend Pope Leo XIV appearing on the Central Loggia of the Vatican Basilica to recite for the first time the Regina Caeli prayer in St. Peter's Square on May 11, 2025 in Vatican City, Vatican. Leo’s message comes as Trump embarks this week on his first foreign trip of his second administration, with a tour of the Middle East. The president is expected to focus his trip to the region on business deals in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. While Trump isn’t currently expected to visit Israel, much of his trip is poised to be about Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu’s continued war in Palestine and the United States’involvement. Secretary of DefensePete Hegsethcanceledhis trip to Israel, slated for Monday, to join Trump on Air Force One, according to reporting from Axios based on three Israeli and US officials. A United Nations special committeeaccusedIsrael of “ethnic cleansing” on Friday and held that it was inflicting “unimaginable suffering” on Palestinians, and warned that the world could be witnessing “another Nakba,” or the expulsion of Palestinians from their land through violent means. Over a 24-hour period, at least 23 Palestinians were killed and 124 others injured in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip over the weekend, according toreportingfrom Al Jazeera based on numbers from the local Ministry of Health. Israel’s latest attacks on Gaza come as humanitarian aid and supplies have not entered the area for over nine weeks,perthe UN. “This is having a devastating impact on the population,” a UNRWA Situation Report reads, “particularly on vulnerable groups including children, women, and the elderly.” Over 60,000 people have been killed by the Israeli military operations in Palestine since October 2023, and more than 111,000 injured,accordingto Al Jazeera—though the total number of casualties is expected to be much larger. Palestinians, including children, who are struggling with hunger, wait in line to receive hot meals distributed by the charity organizations, while Israel's attacks on the Gaza Strip continue unabated. The humanitarian crisis in the region is increasing due to the embargo in Jabalia, Gaza on May 09, 2025. Earlier this month, Netanyahu announced anescalationplan to increase Israeli military presence in the already besieged Gaza Strip,furtheringan offensive that Amnesty International found to be a “genocide against Palestinians” in December of last year. In January, before his second inauguration, Trump lauded—and took credit for—the Gaza ceasefire deal reached with former presidentJoe Biden’s administration, which would beshort-lived. Then, in February, Trumppostedan AI-generated video of an imagined future Gaza—with skyscrapers, belly-dancers, Teslas driving through the streets, a child holding a gold Trump balloon, a golden Trump statue, and Trump and Netanyahu poolside and topless with cocktails. The president has alsoused“Palestinian” as an insultmultipletimes. In hisfirst term, Trump dropped the US commitment to a two-state solution, saying he would back a single-state solution, relocated the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, cut hundreds of millions of dollars in planned funding toward Palestinian aid programs, and closed the Palestinian Liberation Organization in Washington. A man holds up a phone for Father Gabriel Romanelli, Parish Priest of the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Family, to have a video conference call with Pope Francis as the latter blesses the congregation during Christmas Eve mass at the church in the Zaytoun neighbourhood of Gaza City on December 24, 2024, amid the ongoing war in the besieged Palestinian territory between Israel and Hamas. The Trump administration’s position on Gaza has faced stern backlash from the Vatican and the late Pope Francis, who, in his final year,calledthe Argentine parish priest at Holy Family Church in Gaza City almost every evening. In February, a top Vatican officialrejectedTrump’s proposal toremovePalestinians from their home, saying “the Palestinian population must remain on its land.” “This is one of the fundamental points of the Holy See: no deportations,” Secretary of StatePietro Parolinreportedly said on the sidelines of an Italy-Vatican meeting. The new pope followed in Francis’ footsteps on Sunday, telling the faithful that the war in Gaza leaves him “profoundly saddened.” How anOrgasmic Meditation GroupSparked a Troubled Federal Case Deconstructing Trump’s ElaborateOval Office Makeover Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act MeetCardinal Robert Francis Prevost, the First American Pope Revisit All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet The Dystopian Coming-of-Age StoryStephen KingConsidered Too “Merciless” to Film Wes Anderson’sNext Breakout StarJust So Happens to Be Kate Winslet’s Daughter All ofQuentin Tarantino’s Movies Ranked Elon Musk’s 14 Children and Their Mothers (That We Know Of) From the Archive:Princess Margaret’s Not So Happily-Ever-After",

    "title": "It's Saturday Night Live's Mother's Day Episode with Walton Goggins and the Return of Cecily Strong",
    "article_text": "The Moms are here! The Moms are here! There's no more sentimental show ofSaturday Night Live's season than the Mother's Day episode. The cold open kicked off withBowen Yang,Kenan Thompson, andMarcello Hernandezstanding proudly alongside their actual Moms. It was all good fun, untilDonald Trumphad to ruin everything.James Austin Johnsonmade a couple easy cracks about our newly electedPope Leo XIVandJD Vanceand tariffs, but really he was just a vehicle to get to the heart of the open. Trump's recent selection of Fox news hostJeanine Pirrofor Washington, DC's top prosecutor teed up the return ofCecily Strong, who clutched her bottle of merlot like it was a Mother's Day bouquet. Her appearance was extra sweet as Strong welcomed her first baby last month. For old time's sake, she spluttered booze all over the face ofColin Jost'sPete Hegseth. On her third spit take she shot it straight into his mouth. On to the main course.Walton Gogginstook the stage in a black outfit that somehow draped and clung to his now famously sinewy body at the same time. On the subject of suddenly finding himself a sex symbol at 53 years old, he took a closer look at some of the headlines: “His hair is greasy. His eyes are bulging. I think I'm in love.\" Sounds about right. Artfully, Goggins swung his monologue towards the sentimental. He shouted out his Atlanta upbringing, where he was raised by a single mother with the help of three aunts and his grandma. He invited his white-haired mother, who took him to honky tonks as a child, up on stage for an early Mother's Day dance. If the sight of them two-stepping and clogging didn't touch your heart, then you may be as dead inside asThe White Lotus' Rick Hatchett. The best and weirdest sketch of the night featuredJane Wicklinestumbling upon a baby's Converse sneaker outside the zoo. “Somewhere there is a tiny baby Cinderella,” she sang, as she searched for the baby of her dreams. “If you've got a Mom, well, now you've got two.” It was a great visual jump to see Goggins sitting in bow tie and suit, one naked baby foot sticking out of his pants leg. “I'm a fully grown ass man with tiny baby feet,” he sang. Goggins' buddySam Rockwell, who walked away withThe White Lotusin one unforgettable monologue, brought great theatrical oomph to his role of balloon man navigating the world on his own baby feet. Mothers, may your obligatory brunch today bring you your own personal Albie. Goggins' waiter went full skank for momsSarah ShermanandHeidi Gardner.“You're getting a big tip, mister,” they promised as he drip-flirted all over their Talbots ensembles. “No need, I already have one,” he promised. Down and down went the buttons of his shirt. If occasionally he bungled his lines, the sheer physicality of him—his alpha chuck of of ice back in Sherman's glass after he raked it over his bare chest, the way he tossed the menus so perfectly on the table—made up for it. Any sketch that stars animals is a win as far as I'm concerned. So happy Mother's day to me, because Service Dogs featured 20 inordinately handsome dogs forced to sit through Goggins and Gardner's awful play.Michael Longfellowand Wickline were winningly dry foils to their friendly retriever seat mates. “Please don't be offended,” Longfellow told Goggins' peckish actor when the dogs started leaving. “This is their first time at a bad play.” Dogs in glasses, dogs wearing watches, dogs unperturbed by puppet dog legs holding programs. In a perfect world, those dogs stayed up until sunrise at their own afterparty. As cheeky and fun as Goggins was as a host, it wasMikey Daywho delivered the best physical comedy of the evening. On Weekend Update, he  ostensibly appeared to comment on recent tarriff developments. Instead, he delivered a note perfect, sublimely ridiculous ode to the vulnerable, hysterical response to the fear of a rogue spider clinging to one's back. He flung himself out of his chair and onto the floor. He tore off his clothes, making peace with the one stubborn wrist cuff that just wouldn't tear. “I felt it on my skinnnn!” he cried to Jost. Sublime. Perhaps Goggins' mother would've preferred that her son's final sketch of the evening not entail him grimacing and sweating on the toilet, his pants pooled around his ankles while his feet bore down on his Squatty Potty. But she was beaming with pride on stage during the cast goodnights. Get that woman a mimosa.

    "title": "New Orleans Saints QB Derek Carr announces retirement after 11 seasons",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 10, 2025 / 9:25 PM EDT/ AP New Orleans Saintsveteran starting quarterback Derek Carr is retiring because of a labral tear in his right shoulder and \"significant degenerative changes\" to his rotator cuff, the team announced Saturday. Carr, 34, has played for 11 pro seasons since being selected out of Fresno State by the then-Oakland Raidersin the second round of the 2014 NFL draft. He was acquired by the Saints as a free agent in 2023 but had mixed results in New Orleans, going 14-13 as a starter while struggling through oblique, hand and head injuries that caused him to miss seven games last season. Carr, who was entering the third year of a four-year, $150 million contract, experienced unexpected pain in his throwing shoulder when he began to ramp up training on his own this offseason. That led to the diagnosis which now has cut short his career. \"Surgery was an option, jeopardizing the entire 2025 season, yet there was no guarantee Derek would return to the level of strength, function and performance of play to which he was accustomed,\" the Saints said in a written announcement. The Saints did not acknowledge Carr's injury until the day before this year's NFL draft in late April. Carr did not speak publicly about the injury until a few days later, when hedelivered a guest sermon at a Las Vegas church. In that sermon, Carr said his critics were \"lying\" about him when they questioned the unusual timing of the injury, as well as both the team's and Carr's initial reticence to address it openly or answer questions about it. Carr has career passing totals of 41,245 yards, 257 touchdowns and 112 interceptions. The four-time Pro Bowler retires with a 77-92 regular-season record as a starter, 0-1 in the playoffs. Carr said he made his decision in consultation with his wife, Heather, and \"upon reflection of prayer.\" \"For more than 11 years, we have been incredibly blessed, and we are forever grateful and humbled by this experience,\" Carr said. \"It's difficult to find the right words to express our thanks to all the teammates, coaches, management, ownership, team officials and especially the fans who made this journey so special.\" \"I sleep well knowing that I gave my teammates, my coaches, and my cities my all,\" Carr added. The decision also comes after New Orleans, heading into its first season with Kellen Moore as coach, used a highsecond-round draft choice to select Louisville's Tyler Shough. Now Shough, who learned of Carr's decision just before taking the field for a rookie camp practice on Saturday, will have a chance to compete for a starting job. \"All I want is an opportunity,\" said the 26-year-old Shough, who, in part because of injuries, spent seven years at the college level with three programs, starting with Oregon and Texas Tech. \"I've been at points in my career where I would just be dying to get on the field because I was injured. I was a backup before and I was a starter. So, I know a lot of those roles and what it looks like, and I think I can operate well in any of them.\" \"I'm just really excited for that opportunity to go out there and prove myself,\" he added. Other QBs on the Saints roster include second-year pro Spencer Rattler and third-year player Jake Haener, who did not post a victory between them in seven games last season, six of which Rattler started. Carr's retirement \"will provide some of those younger quarterbacks a chance to just get ready from a rep standpoint and opportunity standpoint,\" Moore said. \"Obviously, those guys will be ready and fired up for that.\" Moore was noncommittal about the possibility of bringing in an established veteran QB through free agency. \"We'll certainly have awareness of it,\" Moore said. \"We're ready if the opportunity presents itself.\" Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1966, just 12 quarterbacks who were not drafted in the first round have started season-openers as rookies. One of them was Carr. Another was the Cowboys' Dak Prescott in 2016, when Moore was a reserve QB in Dallas. Prescott \"was obviously a fourth-round pick and probably wasn't anticipating being a starter that year,\" noted Moore, who also coached Prescott as Dallas' QBs coach in 2018 and as offensive coordinator from 2019 to 2022. \"These guys all come from different paths.\" © 2025 The Associated Press.
