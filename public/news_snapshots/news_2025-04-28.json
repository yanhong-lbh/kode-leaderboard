    "article_text": "Super Bowl champion Saquon Barkley had a few things to say to those who criticized him for golfing with President Trump. Saquon Barkleywon a Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles, but his past with the New York Giants remains a talking point — even for the president of the United States. The Eagles were at the White House on Monday afternoon to visit PresidentDonald Trumpin celebration of their Super Bowl LIX victory. Barkley and Trump had hung out together before the ceremony, as they were spotted at Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, before flying back to Washington together on Air Force One.

EAGLES' SAQUON BARKLEY SLAMS CRITICS AFTER HANGING OUT WITH TRUMP \"That was not good. I called that one. That was an easy one to call because he played damn well for the Giants. I can tell you that. He made the right decision because it is a team sport, and there’s great people on this team.\" Throughout the 2024 season, Barkley and the Giants have been tied due to him leaving for their NFC East-rival Eagles in free agency. The organization had the control to extend him in the past, but they were never able to get the job done.

He ultimately won Offensive Player of the Year after breaking a league record with the most rushing yards in a single season, including the postseason with 2,504. Barkley appeared to react with a laugh directly behind Trump as he mentioned the Giants. \"He’s a handsome guy, but I wouldn’t want to tackle him,\" Trump said about Barkley. \"…He’s great. I got to know him a little bit. I offered him a ride on Air Force One because I was coming down, and usually, they say, ‘No, no. I don’t think so.’ He said, ‘I’ll take it, sir,’ and he loved it. We loved being together, and he’s a great, young guy and an incredible football player.\" Barkley had to defend his hanging out with Trump after he was ridiculed by many on social media.

    "title": "Democrats' boiling pot: A look at their 2026 game plan",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on talks among lawmakers on 'Special Report.' It sometimes takes a pot a while to boil. Democrats lost the presidency. Lost the Senate. Failed to flip control of the House. And now, more than six months after last year’s election, the Democrats’ pot is starting to gurgle. It was naturalthat Democratswould take some time to figure out what went wrong. Clang around some pots and pans. And finally pour some water into a pot and turn on the stove. DEMOCRATS' IDENTITY CRISIS: YOUTH REVOLT ROCKS PARTY AFTER TRUMP COMEBACK So Democrats are starting to get their pot to boil. How hot it gets – and whether the stew is anything to wow political culinary taste buds – is unclear. For starters, some Democrats are boiling at one another. The Democratic pot seems to be simmering – even if it's just internal turmoil. DNC Chair Ken Martin (right) recently gave vice chair David Hogg an ultimatum to stay out of primary politics or remain neutral.(Getty/AP) Democratic National Committee Chairman (DNC) Ken Martin handed down an ultimatum after DNC Vice ChairmanDavid Hoggaimed to spend millions of dollars mounting primary challenges to Democratic incumbents. \"Let me be unequivocal. No DNC officers should ever attempt to influence the outcome of a primary election, whether on behalf of an incumbent or a challenger,\" said Martin. Hogg defended his tactic to weed out Democrats who he believe lost a step, are older or just aren’t getting the job done. SENATE PUTS TRUMP TEAM IN PLACE, SETS UP AGENDA FIGHT AFTER 100-DAY SPRINT \"We want people to know they're being watched,\" said Hogg. \"It’s not to say it’s ‘out with the old in with the new.’ I would say it’s out with the ineffective and in with the effective.\" Democrats contend their neutrality pledge is about assuring party unity. \"The reforms that Chair Martin is rolling out, including the one that we're talking about today of increasing funding for state parties, is not a reaction to David Hogg,\" said Jane Kleeb of the Association of State Democratic Parties (ASDC). \"The reform package that Ken Martin is bringing forward, that he will be discussing over the next several months, that he ran on as chair, is not a reaction to David.\" \"We want people to know they're being watched,\" Hogg said, defending his unusually aggressive approach to party primaries.(GABY VELASQUEZ/ EL PASO TIMES / USA TODAY NETWORK) But Hogg is the elephant in the room to the party represented by the donkey. \"I have great respect for David Hogg,\" said Martin. \"I understand what he's trying to do. I've said to him, ‘If you want to challenge incumbents, you're more than free to do that.’ But just not as an officer of the DNC.\" And then there’s rage over age. DNC'S DAVID HOGG TAKING ON DEMOCRATS IS ‘THE BIGGEST GIFT TO REPUBLICANS EVER,’ SAYS STRATEGIST 80-year-old Senate Minority Whip and the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is the latest veteran Democrat to announce his retirement. \"I had to project forward. The campaign is going to last two years. And then you're going to serve six years. So are you ready to make an eight year commitment?\" asked Durbin. Durbin would be 87 when another term concluded in early 2033 – presuming he won and served the entire time. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is the latest member of his party's old guard to announce his retirement.(Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) \"A lot of this is the fallout from Biden,\" said Rutgers University political scientist Ross Baker. \"It sort of contaminated older Democrats.\" Age is just a number. But it’s a number with consequences. Five House Republicans over the age of 65 have died within the past year. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., says Democrats could have sidetracked parts ofPresident Trump’sagenda had the older members lived. 75-year-old Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., defeated 35-year-old Rep. Alexandria, Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., in November to become the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. The vote: 131-84. Connolly suffered from esophageal cancer – but pushed through. Democrats gave him a vote of confidence. However, Connolly just announced his cancer returned after treatment. He will give up his committee ranking post and retire at the end of this term. DICK DURBIN, NO. 2 SENATE DEMOCRAT, WON'T SEEK RE-ELECTION Durbin’s departure could intensify progressive pressure on Senate Minority LeaderChuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to quit, too. Liberals are fuming over Schumer intervening to side with President Trump and avoid a government shutdown in March. \"Sen. Schumer made the disastrous decision,\" said House Progressive Caucus Chairman Greg Casar, D-Tex. \"I think we have to get to a place where we're willing to disagree with even our leaders, like Sen. Schumer, when they make a disastrous decision. Thats how we get better.\" Schumer contends he isn’t going anywhere. \"No conversation about when you might step aside?\" asked MSNBC’s Chris Jansing. \"I'm focusing on the decision that the Republicans in Congress have to make to whether support Trump with these horrible economic policies or not,\" replied Schumer. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., seems to be showing no intention to step aside anytime soon.(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) TheNew YorkDemocrat further rejected any chatter that he might step down when appearing on CNN. \"I am staying put and I'm fighting the fight every day, as is our caucus, in a united and successful way,\" said Schumer. Democrats set out to hold town hall meetings over the recent Congressional recess in districts where they accused Republicans of ducking their constituents. But caveat emptor. In some instances, it was Democrats who got an earful. DEMOCRATS' VICE CHAIR GETS ULTIMATUM: STAY NEUTRAL IN PRIMARIES OR STEP DOWN FROM PARTY LEADERSHIP For instance, Casar conducted a town hall in the district of Rep. Gabe Evans, R-Colo. Evans just flipped his district from blue to red by 2,500 votes. \"What are we going to do about the DNC?\" asked one Colorado town hall attendee of Casar. \"They need to listen to you young people.\" \"Democrats didn’t really, as far as I can tell, really do anything,\" observed another. Rep. Greg Casar, D-Texas, who also chairs the House Progressive Caucus, recently got an earful from town hall attendees looking for answers on his party's direction.(Win McNamee/Getty Images) The pot really started to boil just before dawn early Sunday morning on the East Front of the Capitol. Both clad in black, Jeffries and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., began what they billed as a \"sit-in\" to protest President Trump’s policies and reject the \"big, beautiful bill.\" House committees are prepping that legislation this week. \"People will die if this budget is successful. That's how urgent the fight is,\" said Jeffries. But when it comes to conventional tactics, younger, upstart Democrats sayBLANK THAT! JEFFRIES, BOOKER PROTEST TRUMP AND HIS POLICIES DURING SIT-IN ON CAPITOL STEPS They’re urging their party to ditch the pleasantries and use, well, kitchen language. \"I say it's time to drop the excuses and grow a f***ing spine,\" said 26-year-old Democratic Illinois Congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh. Abughazaleh is running in the district now held by 80-year-old Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. She’s expected to announce her retirement in the coming days. Democrat Mike Sacks is running against Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y. in a swing district just outsideNew York City. \"I'm running for Congress to tell you the truth, to fight for New York, and to unf**k our country,\" said Sacks in a campaign ad. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So the Democrats’ pot is churning. Democrats will soon have the water ready. But it’s unclear what dish they plan to prepare. The only problem is that so far, Democrats are scalding themselves with that hot water. There’s infighting. Arguing. And everyone is trying to figure out what works. For the Democrats, it’s enough to make their blood boil. Chad Pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).

    "article_text": "Who is U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson? The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., issued a ruling Monday to restore a lower court’s order barring theTrump administration’splanned mass layoffs at the Consumer Financial Protections Bureau (CFPB). The court ruled 2-1 to restore an earlier ruling by federal JudgeAmy Berman Jackson, an Obama appointee, which temporarily halted the Trump administration’s reductions in force (RIF) at CFPB, which would have cut the agency’s staff by 90 percent. Before Jackson’s ruling, the agency was slated to carry out a reduction in force of roughly 1,400 employees, which would have left just several hundred in place. Following a legal challenge against the reduction filed in the D.C. district court in early February, Jackson issued a preliminary injunction in late March, finding that the plaintiffs would likely succeed on the merits. TRUMP TO SIGN ORDER CRACKING DOWN ON 'SANCTUARY' CITIES, THREATEN THEIR FEDERAL FUNDING CFPB sign and termination papers. Credit: Getty Images/iStock(Getty Images) The order directed the government to \"rehire all terminated employees, reinstate all terminated contracts, and refrain from engaging in reductions-in-force or attempting to stop work through any means.\" Jackson then ordered anotherhalt to plansearlier this month, shortly after an appeals court narrowed her earlier injunction. Jackson noted that within several days of an appeals order narrowing her initial injunction,CFPB employeeswere told the agency would do \"exactly what it was told not to do,\" which was to carry out a RIF. Jackson blocked the administration from moving forward with any layoffs or from cutting off employees' access to computers at the bureau until she had time to hear from the officials in question.

Former Georgia GOP Sen.David Perdue’snomination to become PresidentDonald Trump’sambassador to China passed a Senate vote for cloture – to end debate – Monday evening. The vote starts the \"2-hour clock\" of limited debate that will ultimately end in a vote on Perdue’s nomination. That clock is typically 30 hours for Cabinet-level officials. Perdue has long been an ally of Trump and narrowly lost his 2021 runoff election with Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., by just over 1%, or about 55,000 votes. He also has experience working in global supply chains as a former chief executive of Tennessee-basedDollar General, and other companies. TRUMP APPOINTS SEN. DAVID PERDUE AS AMBASSADOR TO CHINA During his confirmation hearing,Perdue said,\"Marxist nationalism\" is reshaping China and that their global ambitions threaten the world order. \"Since 2000, China has doubled its nuclear arsenal and grown its military at a pace unseen since WWII. They have militarized the South China Sea and violated their agreement in Hong Kong. Their Social Credit Score system and extensive policing capability are designed to enforce domestic state control. Their Belt and Road Initiative and theirMade in China 2025statements demonstrate their global ambitions,\" Perdue said. \"They speak of a global ‘community of common destiny for all mankind.' Put simply, they want a world more in line with their authoritarian principles.\" Perdue went on to argue that Trump’s \"America First\" strategy that greatly affects the U.S.’s relationship with China is not isolationist, but \"just the reverse.\" TRUMP SAYS CHINA'S XI CALLED HIM AMID ONGOING CONFUSION OVER TRADE TALKS Former President Donald Trump, right, shakes hands with David Perdue, left, at a \"Save America Rally.\"(Joshua L.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Each year,NFLowners vote on potential rule changes heading into the next season, and one proposal in particular has sparked widespread debate. TheGreen Bay Packerssubmitted a proposal to ban the Philadelphia Eagles’ famous \"tush push\" play, where quarterback Jalen Hurts is shoved forward in short-yardage situations, especially on the goal line for a touchdown. While there is large debate about whether the play should remain in the game or not, PresidentDonald Trumpshowed which side of the fence he’s on during the team’s White House celebration for their Super Bowl LIX victory on Monday afternoon. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM President Donald Trump honors the Super Bowl LIX champion Philadelphia Eagles at The White House in Washington D.C., on April 28, 2025.(Josh Morgan-USA TODAY via Imagn Images) Discussing that 40-22 win over the Kansas City Chiefs, which Trump was present for in New Orleans, he mentioned their first touchdown scored, which was Hurts being pushed into the end zone to take the lead. \"The Eagles scored a touchdown on their signature play: the tush push. You know what that is? I hope they keep that play, coach, I don’t know,\" Trump said, looking at Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni. \"They’re talking about getting rid of that play, I understand. They should keep it. What do you think Saquon [Barkley]? \"I like it. It’s sort of exciting and different.\" EAGLES' JALEN HURTS SKIPPING TRUMP VISIT AS TEAMMATE SPENDS TIME WITH HIM AT GOLF COURSE NFL owners are expected to continue discussing a potential ban of the play after tabling it until the next owners' meetings on May 20-21 in Minnesota. The Packers had 16 teams support its proposal, but a minimum of 24 owners must approve the change for it to pass. The rule change specifically states a ban of an offensive player having the ability to immediately push his teammate who is lined up directly behind the snapper and receives the snap.

While it is a legal play, theEagleshave cashed in tremendously from it over the last three seasons. Only the Buffalo Bills have come remotely close to the Eagles’ success, having used their own version of it a considerable amount with quarterback Josh Allen, the league’s MVP, last season. Trump does, however, want the league to go back to something they did change in the 2024 season: kickoffs. \"I would like to see something done,\" he said. \"I would like to go back to the regular kickoff, however. We don’t like that kickoff where nobody’s moving. The ball’s in the air and nobody’s moving.\" NFL owners did modify the kickoff structure for the 2025 season, as touchbacks will be marked at the 35-yard line, a move that is expected to elevate return rates.

They must wait until the ball touches the ground, or the return man makes contact with the ball.

    "title": "Schumer mocked for touting 'very strong letter' he sent to Trump about Harvard",
    "article_text": "CNN panelists were unimpressed by Sen. Chuck Schumer touting a \"very strong letter\" he wrote to President Trump over his attacks on Harvard University. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was made fun of on social media on Sunday for touting a \"very strong letter\" that he and other Democratic lawmakers had sent to President Donald Trump regarding their concerns about theadministration's decision to freeze HarvardUniversity's federal funding under the guise of cracking down on antisemitism. In an interview with CNN host Dana Bash, the New York senator acknowledged that Harvard and other elite universities have not done enough to address antisemitism, but said what Trump was doing went far beyond the issue. \"A bunch of us Jewish senators just sent a letter to the administration saying, detail the specific incidents of antisemitism and why cutting money off to cancer research or to Alzheimer’s research has anything to do with antisemitism. It doesn‘t,\" Schumer said. \"So we sent him a very strong letter just the other day asking eight very strong questions about why this isn‘t just a pretext.\" Schumer and four other Jewish senatorsdemanded answers in a letter to the president on Thursday on the calculus behind penalizing Harvard University, its medical school and other collegiate institutions across the country under what they called the \"pretext\" of antisemitism on campus. ELITE SCHOOLS ORGANIZE GROUP TO OPPOSE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AS BATTLE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING ESCALATES Sen. Schumer touted sending President Trump a \"strong letter\" about his actions against Harvard University during a CNN interview on Sunday.(Screenshot/CNN) \"Dear President Trump, we write regarding your administration's assault on universities, including threats and actions to withhold funds or otherwise punish certain institutions of higher learning, in what you claim is an effort to eliminate the veryreal threat of anti-Semitismon college campuses,\" the letter read in part. Media figures and other liberals blasted Schumer's self-described \"strong\" response. \"A strongly worded letter questioning POTUS strength. That should change things!\" former NBC \"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd wrote on X, reacting to video of the interview. Nina Turner, a Democratic commentator and former Ohio state senator, wrote, \"Letters aren't leadership,\" on X in response to the clip of Schumer. Ex-CNN host Chris Cillizza reacted to the clip of Schumer on X and published a Substackvideo criticizing Schumer. \"Give me a break, man. Okay, so like Schumer's not helping himself here, right?\" Cillizza said. \"This is why people think elected officials are totally ineffective.\" He added that he laughed at Schumer for touting the letter, but did argue that there was not much Democrats could do about Trump right now. On X he mocked the \"very strong letter,\" saying, \"That should do the trick!\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"If we all collectively send Schumer a very strong letter to pass the torch with eight very strong reasons think he’ll step aside?\" Democratic Georgia state Rep. Ruwa Romman wrote on X, as well as Bluesky.

Seriously? He’s kidding, right? Please someone tell me he’s joking,\" Claude Taylor, founder of the liberal Mad Dog PAC wrote. Senior director of the left-wing org Voters of Tomorrow Jackson Hurley mocked the senator by suggesting he leave a bad \"Yelp review\" next. \"We cannot defeat fascism with strongly worded letters and a brief questionnaire,\" said Melanie D'Arrigo of the Campaign for NY Health. Author and former New York Times media reporter Bill Carter said, \"just the idea that he wouldn't know the ‘strongly worded letter’ has become a joke cliche that DEFINES an ineffectual pol is so telling. It plays as an admission that you have no real power and no idea how to get some.\" Schumer also dodged a questionfrom Bash on whether Democratic lawmakers should prioritize impeaching President Donald Trump if they take back Congress during the interview as well. \"President Trump is violating rule of law in every way. And we're fighting him every single day in every way. And our goal is to show the American people over and over again, whether it’s the economy, whether it’s tariffs, whether it’s Russia and overseas and whether it’s rule of law, how bad he is. And you know, two years is too far away to predict. Our job is day to day to day, to show who Trump is, what he is doing, and it’s having an effect,\" Schumer said. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer was pressed on \"The View\" over his decision to vote for a GOP spending bill to continue funding the government, which earned him backlash from some Democrats.(The View/Screenshot) Schumer was heavily criticizedby fellow Democrats after he backed the GOP spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. Sunny Hostin, a liberal co-host of \"The View,\"accused Schumerof caving to Trump during an interview with the senator in March. \"I don't think you showed the fight that this party needs right now.

    "title": "Lawsuit alleges anti-Israel group leaders are 'Hamas' foot soldiers in New York City'",
    "article_text": "UCLA student Eli Tsives comments on ongoing antisemitic rhetoric on college campuses and how he believes the problem should be resolved. A lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York last month claims the leaders of several radical anti-Israel groups involved in 18 months of disruptive, violent and antisemitic protests on campuses and in the streets of New York City are \"accountable for aiding andabetting Hamas’ continuing actsof international terrorism.\" In purported violation of the Antiterrorism Act and the Alien Tort Statue, the defendants are said to have \"acted as Hamas’ foot soldiers in New York City,\" and may have had foreknowledge of the designated foreign terror organization’s devastating Oct. 7 attacks. Defendants in the case are Within Our Lifetime and its founder Nerdeen Kiswani, Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and its representative Maryam Alwan, Columbia-Barnard Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) and its representative Cameron Jones, and Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) and its representative Mahmoud Khalil, who is currently in custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The lawsuit asserts that the associational defendants have \"distribute[d] Hamas-created and affiliated propaganda, incite[d] fear and violence, and attack[ed] critical academic, economic, and infrastructure centers in New York City,\" as well as having \"repeatedly terrorized and assaulted Jews across New York City and on Columbia University’s campus, physically assaulted Columbia University employees, and illegally seized and damaged public and private property.\" DUFFY SLAMS MTA OVER ‘FACT CHECK’ ON ANTI-ISRAEL MOB’S GRAND CENTRAL TAKEOVER Nerdeen Kiswani, co-founder and leader of Within Our Lifetime, speaks at a demonstration near Columbia University on Feb. 2, 2024, in New York City.(Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images) The details of the allegations are thorough. To demonstrate how the defendants \"resoundingly and knowingly answered Hamas’ call to action\" on and after Oct. 7, the lawsuit cites how the defendants knowingly \"obtain[ed] and disseminat[ed]\" a Hamas propaganda document, which contained directions created by the Hamas Media Office for spinning the narrative of their deadly attacks. By \"painstakingly follow[ing]\" the document, the lawsuit alleges defendants \"directly responded to, and followed orders from, Hamas.\" The lawsuit also supplies several indicators that defendants may have had foreknowledge of the heinous Oct. 7 attack, to include \"a highly suggestive social media post published moments before the October 7 attack began\" in which Columbia SJP posted on Instagram \"We are back!!\" after a months-long hiatus. On Oct. 7, Kiswani utilized marketing materials that \"would not be released until the next day\" in a National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) \"Toolkit\" demonstrating how SJP organizations across the country could support the Gazan \"resistance.\" Emaciated Israeli hostages, from left, Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy are taken by terrorists to a stage before being handed over to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip on Feb. 8, 2025.(AP/Abdel Kareem Hana) Following Oct. 7, Within Our Lifetime promoted a\"Day of Rage\" in New York Citywhile Columbia SJP and Columbia JVP promoted their own \"Day of Resistance.\" The mere announcements of these events forced closures of Jewish schools and institutions, and \"even forced Columbia University – a non-Jewish institution – to close its campus as a safety precaution,\" while Jewish students \"were advised to lock their doors and remain inside for their own safety,\" according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit names Khalil as the purported leader of Columbia SJP’s Day of Resistance. COLUMBIA’S ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS SAY TRUMP PULLING $400 MILLION IN GRANTS FROM UNIVERSITY IS A ‘SCARE TACTIC’ In November 2023, the suit describes how a \"’Shut it Down for Palestine’ event descended into – as planned – anti-Jewish and vitriolic hatred and threats,\" with speakers shouting \"Death to Jews!\" and \"encourage[ing] Hamas and… comrades across Columbia’s campus to hunt down and assault pro-Israel students.\" The next day, Columbia University suspended Columbia SJP and Columbia JVP, at which time \"Khalil and former members and/or organizers of Columbia SJP became leaders of CUAD.\" As a result, CUAD \"became the primary organizer of the violent and antisemitic protests that would foment terror, sow discord, and disrupt campus life at Columbia for over a year.\" Hamas terrorists kidnap a bloodied Israeli woman into the Gaza Strip.(Hamas-Telegram) Khalil would later become thelead negotiator of the Columbia encampment,which the lawsuit notes was \"well-supplied with identical tents, toiletries, food, and professional signage.\" Based on a statement from Shlomi Ziv, a plaintiff in the lawsuit who was held captive by Hamas for 246 days following his kidnapping at the Nova Music Festival, \"Hamas and [American Muslims for Palestine (AMP)]/NSJP provided financial, organizational, and other support… for the Encampment.\" Ziv alleges that his \"Hamas captors bragged about having Hamas operatives on American university campuses,\" and even \"showed him Al-Jazeera stories and photographs of protests at Columbia University that were organized by Associational Defendants.\" APPARENT ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVISTS SPLASH RED PAINT ON HOMES OF JEWISH OFFICIALS AT BROOKLYN MUSEUM Anti-Israel demonstrators attend a protest at Columbia University in New York City, just days after the Hamas slaughter in southern Israel, Oct. 12, 2023.(Julia Bonavita/Fox News Digital) Given the \"legal chasm between independent political advocacy and coordinating with a foreign terrorist organization to seed pro-terror propaganda throughout America’s largest city,\" the lawsuit alleges the defendants’ \"actions violate the Antiterrorism Act and the law of nations.\" According to the Jerusalem Post, the National Jewish Advocacy Center, Greenberg Traurig LLP, the Schoen Law Firm, and the Holtzman Vogel Law Firm filed the suit on behalf of plaintiffs who include Ziv, several Columbia University students who have served with the Israel Defense Forces, and a number of American and Israeli citizens whose family members, most of whom are believed dead, remain in Hamas captivity.

Santiago/Getty Images) The lawsuit especially states that Khalil, \"on information and belief, directly coordinates with Hamas, AMP/NSJP and/or other agents and affiliates of Hamas and related terrorist organizations.\" The filers state that his detention by ICE in March may have been \"based on many of his actions described in this Complaint.\" Khalil’s involvement in the Columbia protests was cited as a rationale for his removal during his April 11 hearing, whenJudge Jamee Comans ruledthat Khalil may be deported. Khalil also withheld past employment with the Syrian office in the Beirut British Embassy and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) as well as his membership in the CUAD when applying for a green card. This withholding of information, according to federal officials, made Khalil \"inadmissible at the time of his adjustment.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Disruptive events in New York City show no signs of abating.

The partition also gave the diverse Jammu and Kashmir region theability to chooseif it wanted to join either newly established nation.

    "article_text": "Princeton senior Danielle Shapiro joins ‘Fox & Friends’ to discuss how anti-Israel protesters disrupted a campus lecture by a former Israeli prime minister, shouting anti-Semitic chants and targeting students. EXCLUSIVE – Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz called on his alma mater, Princeton University, to dismiss a former high-level Iranian regime official because he is allegedly making students feel unsafe amid recent outbreaks of antisemitism at the New Jersey university. The ex-official for the Islamic Republic of Iran, Seyed Hossein Mousavian, who is a Middle East security and nuclear policy specialist at the university, is under pressure on many fronts from congressional representatives, Princeton students and experts on antisemitism. \"Mousavian is closely linked to the Iranian regime and to the regime’s campaigns of terrorism and murder. His presence at Princeton makes students feel justifiably afraid for their safety. Princeton’s decision to keep employing him shows they care less about their students, and more about providing a platform for pro-regime and anti-American propaganda. That kind of reckless institutional ideological bias is exactly why the Trump administration is reassessing federal funding for Princeton,\" Cruz told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement. ACTIVIST SPEAKS OUT AFTER IRAN TRIES TO KILL HER Students, some faculty and outsiders gathered on the lawns outside the Princeton chapel to protest Israel's military campaign in Gaza, April 25, 2024.(Mary Ann Koruth / Imagn) Fox News Digital previously reported that Mousavian expressed support for the U.S.-designated terrorist movements, Hamas and Hezbollah, and appeared to pay tribute to the global Iranian terrorist Qassem Soleimani in 2020 when he attended his funeral. President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike to eliminate Soleimani in January 2020 for his role in the murders of over 600 American military personnel in the Middle East and his planning of new terrorist attacks. Mousavian has declined to renounce his support for Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran's fatwa (religious decree) to assassinate theBritish-American writer Salman Rushdie. A Hezbollah flag was on display during a Princeton student protest encampment against Israel last year. The Iran-backed Hezbollah was responsible for a 1983 bombing thatmurdered 241 U.S. military membersin Beirut. Maximillian Meyer, president of Princeton Tigers for Israel, and an undergraduate at the university, told Fox News Digital, \"I commend Sen. Cruz for raising urgent concerns about Princeton’s employment of Mousavian, whose career has been defined by shilling for the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. Credible reports linking Mousavian to the oversight of Iranian dissident assassinations in Europe – alongside his endorsement of the fatwa on Salman Rushdie – are deeply alarming.\" INCOMING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION GIVEN NEW BLUEPRINT ON WAYS TO WEAKEN IRAN: 'UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY' Seyed Hossein Mousavian, , who was then head of the Iranian delegation, speaks to journalists at the International Atomic Energy Agency, Nov. 29, 2004 in Vienna. Mousavian is presently a Middle East security and nuclear policy specialist at Princeton.(Robert Newald/AFP via Getty Images) Fox News Digitalfirst reported in November 2023that the House Committee on Education and the Workforce launched an investigation into Mousavian's role in advancing the interests of the clerical regime in Tehran. During Mousavian’s tenure as Iran’s ambassador to Germany, he was in charge of the embassy that a German court found \"served as the ‘headquarters’ for the planning of the 1992 assassination of four Iranian dissidents at the Greek restaurant Mykonos in Berlin.\" However, the former Iranian ambassador previously told Fox News Digital that \"This accusation is a big lie,\" and \"The 398-page verdict is published, and everyone can have access to it. The Berlin court verdict does not contain any direct or indirect allegations against me. German authorities never forced me to leave the country.… I have been a frequent visitor to Germany.\" Yet, Iranian dissidents and human rights experts uncovered testimony from Abolghasem Mesbahi, a former senior-level Iranian intelligence official,who told the Berlin courtduring the Mykonos trial, \"Mousavian participated in most of the [Iranian regime's] crimes that took place in Europe.\" Mousavian did not respond to multiple Fox News Digital press queries, WhatsApp messages and telephone calls for this article. Sen. Ted Cruz talks with reporters.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Meyer, the Princeton undergraduate student, said, \"Anyone who has served in senior roles for the repressive Islamic Republic of Iran poses a clear threat to American national security. His continued employment at Princeton is a damning indictment of the anti-Americanism festering within so-called ‘elite’ institutions.\" Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber, who recently saidhe would defy Trump’sefforts to stop antisemitism via federal funding cuts to the wealthy university, did not respond to Fox News Digital email press queries and telephone calls about Mousavian. Fox News Digital recently reported that pro-Hamas and pro-Palestinian agitators stormed a talk by former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett at Princeton, sparkingcriticism from Jewish studentsat Princeton. In a statement to Fox News Digital over the incident, Eisgruber said he was \"appalled\" at reports of antisemitic language used during Bennett's visit. He added, \"Such behavior is reprehensible and intolerable. The University is investigating and will pursue disciplinary measures as appropriate, to the extent any members of the Princeton University community are implicated.\" Christopher Eisgruber, president of Princeton University, during an interview in New York, on Oct 11, 2023.(Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg/Getty Images) It is unclear if Eisgruber suspended or expelled students who prevented Bennett from speaking. Mousavian has faced criticism for stoking antisemitism since Hamas invaded Israel and slaughtered over 1,200 people, including more than 40 Americans. Eisgruber has gone silent about Mousavian’s actions. A Fox News Digital examination of Mousavian’s X account shows a high number of Persian and English posts attacking the Jewish state, including comparing Israel with Nazi Germany. The comparison between Israel and Nazi Germany is classified as modern antisemitism, according to the widely accepted definition formulated by theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. IRAN'S ATTACK ON ISRAEL SHINES SPOTLIGHT ON TEHRAN'S ADVANCING NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the former chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and director of Global Social Action at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, asked Eisgruber in a statement to Fox News Digital: Why does the university continue to protect Mousavian at a time of raging antisemitism and what is he still doing there? Cooper further asked, in the context of the reported antisemitic mob attack on Bennett and Mousavian’s alleged ties to the murders carried out by Iran’s regime, why can’t \"the President of Princeton connect the dots\"? Anti-Israel protesters at Princeton disrupt a speech by former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.(Max Meyer/X) Cooper said on Eisgruber’s watch \"It is a shameful chapter that must end the right way.\" Cooper accused Eisgruber of \"stoic silence or indifference to antisemitism\" and \"stonewalling\" efforts to hold Mousavian accountable for his alleged crimes and antisemitism. Cooper continued that Eisgruber owes it to Jewish students and faculty, Iranian-Americans, and Iranian dissidents to answer basic questions about Mousavian. Eisgruber has not obstructed any law enforcement efforts to investigate Mousavian’s alleged crimes. Cooper also called on Princeton and Mousavian to submit his Ph.D. for examination. Fox News Digital has learned that neither Princeton University nor the University of Kent in the United Kingdom, where Mousavian allegedly obtained his Ph.D. in 2002, were willing to produce a copy of his dissertation. Mousavian was the head of the Foreign Relations Committee of Iran’s National Security Council (1997-2005), according to his Princeton webpage.

The FOI office denied a request and later said after Fox News Digital appealed that, \"We are currently conducting an internal review in relation to your request.\" A British-Iranian man sought to obtain Mousavian’s Ph.D. in January, according to email correspondence obtained by Fox News Digital. Kent University’s Open Research team wrote in one email, \"I am afraid we have no record of Mr. Seyed Hossein Mousavian's thesis in the library catalogue.\" Fox News Digital searches for Mousavian’s Ph.D. in American, British and German academic databases showed no results. The Swedish-Iranian author Iraj Mesdaghi told Fox News Digital that he sought to obtain Mousavian’s Ph.D. in 2013. The University of Kent declined to produce it. Mesdaghi wrote about the great lengths he went to in order to secure access to Mousavian’s alleged Ph.D. on his website, including contact with the FOI office. Shirley M.

About half of Spain has seen power restored, while full restoration is expected to occur sometime Tuesday. A graph on Spain’s electricity network website that shows power demand across the country indicated a steep drop at around 12:15 p.m. local time, from 27,500 megawatts to near 15,000, according to the Associated Press. \"Due to extreme temperature variations in the interior of Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high-voltage lines, a phenomenon known as induced atmospheric vibration,\" REN, Portugal's grid operator,was quotedas saying. \"These oscillations caused synchronization failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.\" POPULAR CHURCH IN SPAIN WILL CURB TOURIST CROWDS BY CREATING SEPARATE ‘SELFIE SPACE’ Passengers line up at Madrid airport during a major power outage on Monday, April 28.(AP/Manu Fernandez) REN reportedly described the incident as a \"rare atmospheric phenomenon.\" The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Center issued a statement saying there was no sign the outage was due toa cyberattack. Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez later said a problem in the European grid that he described as a \"strong oscillation\" was behind the outage, but that the cause was still being determined.

The Vatican also announced \"the Sistine Chapel will be closed to the public from Monday 28 April 2025 for the requirements of the Conclave.\" An estimated 200,000 people attended a special Mass at St. Peter's Basilica on Sunday by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump called the U.S.-Canada border an \"artificial line\" while also declining to say whether Canada would lean right or left if it became a state. OTTAWA- In a dramatic reversal, the governing Liberals, who were trailing the official opposition Conservatives in the polls earlier this year, appear poised to win their fourth consecutive term in office thanks to PresidentDonald Trump’sthreats against Canada’s economy and sovereignty, according to election watchers. \"It looks like there will be a Liberal government, which seems to be what the polls point to, and it would be a very big surprise if the Conservatives won,\" Angus Reid, founder and chair of the Angus Reid Institute, told Fox News Digital. Trump posted advice to Canadian voters on Monday morning onTruth Social,saying in part, \"Good luck to the Great people of Canada. Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World, have your Car, Steel, Aluminum, Lumber, Energy, and all other businesses, QUADRUPLE in size, WITH ZERO TARIFFS OR TAXES, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st. State of the United States of America.\" In an Angus Reid Institute poll released on Dec. 30, the Conservatives were in super-majority territory with 45% support, compared to the Liberals at 11%. The results of a poll released on Saturday had the Liberals at 44% with a four-point lead over the Conservatives at 40%. TRUMP TAKES CENTER STAGE IN CANADA’S PRIME MINISTER ELECTION DEBATE Canadian Liberal leader, Prime Minister Mark Carney, speaks after being elected as the new Liberal Party leader, in Ottawa on March 9, 2025.(Getty Images) \"This really has been an extraordinary election in that, by all rights, Canadians had it with the Liberals’ woke policies and with their misspending and didn’t like Trudeau,\" Reid said. He explained that the political dynamic changed whenJustin Trudeauannounced his resignation as Canada’s 23rd prime minister and Trump was inaugurated as the 47th president in January, and former central bank governor Mark Carney succeeded Trudeau as prime minister and Liberal leader in March. A truck with vehicles crosses the Blue Water Bridge border crossing into the United States from Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, on April 3, 2025.(Photo by GEOFF ROBINS/AFP via Getty Images) \"Between tariffs and threats of annexation, Trump became the single most important issue in the country overnight,\" said Reid. \"That gave Mark Carney an opportunity to be the first out of the gate to say that we’re not going to put up with this – we’re a sovereign nation and we’re going to fight.\" The campaign has been a two-party race between the Liberals and Conservatives and led by two starkly different leaders who focused on strengths that their critics considered weaknesses. Carney, a 60-year-old former senior executive at Goldman Sachs who never held elected office prior to winning the Liberal leadership, has called on voters to consider – during a time of economic crisis fueled by Trump’s threats – his experience, which includes running the central banks of Canada and England, and as the United Nations Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. Canadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre holds a news conference in a hotel ballroom in Ottawa, Canada, on Sunday, Dec. 1, 2024.(ustin Tang/The Canadian Press via AP) His detractors, however, have accused him of being out of touch and \"not connected to the common man\" and has spent a fair amount of time outside Canada, as a former deputy national Conservative Party campaign manager toldFox News Digital last month. Meanwhile, Poilievre’s message to voters is that he is the agent for \"change.\" However, his opponents claim the 45-year-old Conservative leader is part of the political establishment, having spent almost half of his life as a member of Parliament since he was first elected in 2004 – and the change he touts came with a shift in Liberal leadership from Trudeau to Carney. WHO IS PIERRE POILIEVRE? CANADA'S CONSERVATIVE LEADER SEEKING TO BECOME NEXT PRIME MINISTER AFTER TRUDEAU EXIT The results of an Ipsos poll conducted for Global News in Canada, released on April 21, showed a narrow three-point lead for the Liberals at 41% over the Conservatives at 38%. Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Global Public Affairs, told Fox News Digital that the Liberals were ahead of the Conservatives by 12 points in mid-April and have lost ground since \"because of the effect of Donald Trump, both positive and negative.\" From left to right, Canadaian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Mark Carney.(Photo by SEAN KILPATRICK/POOL/AFP via Getty Images | Photo by DAVE CHAN/AFP via Getty Images | Photo by Al Drago for The Washington Post via Getty Images) \"When Donald Trump is in the news saying 51st-state stuff, that brings the focus back to the major issue that the Liberals lead on, which is dealing with him,\" said Bricker. \"But over the past two weeks, Donald Trump has kind of gone dark on Canada. He’s been focused on China, U.S. government funding of Harvard University, and to the extent he’s talking about trade, it’s about global trade deals.\" That, said Bricker, has resulted in many Canadians returning to their pre-Trump main issue of affordability, through the lens of the Liberals running the government over the past decade. Ultimately, the outcome of Monday’s general election will be decided by geography, according to Bricker, whosaid that the national vote \"will be won or lost\" in Ontario, particularly in Toronto and the surrounding so-called 905 region, which refers to the telephone area code, where there are 55 ridings (electoral districts) and about 4.5 million eligible voters. \"The 905 voted overwhelmingly for Justin Trudeau’s Liberals three times,\" said Bricker. \"If they do it again, the Liberals will win a fourth consecutive term in office.\" CANADA’S NEW PM AND TRUMP CRITIC MARK CARNEY ACCUSED OF BEING OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE 'COMMON MAN’ Hundreds of people rally against U.S. tarrifs and threats of annexation at the Manitoba Legislature.

The event featured ball hockey, burgers, and music, with attendees dressed in red and white to affirm Canada’s sovereignty.(Photo by Lyle Stafford/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Last week, Carney said if he remains prime minister following the election that he would have a meeting with Trump \"within days\" as part of an \"ambitious and broad-ranging discussion\" on anew tradeand security deal between Canada and the U.S. Reid said that the Liberals’ improved showing was not just about Canadians warming to Carney, but also about Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s failure to turn the dial from focusing on a consumer carbon tax, which the Liberal leader canceled on April 1 in his first act as prime minister, and \"still reflecting on Trudeau long after he had gone, instead of jumping right away onto the Trump threat and becoming something that he would lead the charge on.\" The irony, in Reid’s view, is that \"Trump imperiled the campaign of an individual who could be in many ways his stepbrotherin Canada,\" he said about Poilievre, who he called\"mini-Trump,\" and his \"anti-woke,\" smaller-government stance – \"Trump-esque policies that the American right might want to see in Canada and certainly a lot of Canadians on the right want to see.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to Elections Canada, a record 7.3 million Canadians cast their ballots in advance polls over the Easter weekend.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Russian PresidentVladimirPutinon Monday thanked North Korea for sending troops to fight alongside Russia in Moscow's war against Ukraine and vowed not to forget their sacrifices. Putin's comments came just hours after North Korea confirmed for the first time that it had deployed troops to fight Ukrainian forces. Russia said two days earlier that its troops had fully reclaimed the Kursk region, which Ukrainian forces seized last year. Ukrainian officials have denied Russia's claim and said that the operation in certain areas of Kursk is ongoing. In a statement, Putin praised North Korean troops who he said fought \"shoulder to shoulder with Russian fighters, defended our Motherland as their own.\" TRUMP BLASTS PUTIN, QUESTIONING IF RUSSIAN LEADER WANTS PEACE OR IS JUST 'TAPPING ME ALONG' Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked North Korea for sending troops to fight alongside Russia in Moscow's war against Ukraine.(Sputnik/Kristina Kormilitsyna/Kremlin via REUTERS) \"The Russian people will never forget the heroism of the DPRK special forces,\" Putin said. \"We will always honor the heroes who gave their lives for Russia, for our common freedom, fighting side by side with their Russian brothers in arms.\" Earlier Monday, North Korea's Central Military Commission said the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, had sent troops to Russia to \"annihilate and wipe out the Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers and liberate the Kursk area in cooperation with the Russian armed forces.\" North Korean troops eventually made \"an important contribution\" to Russia seizing the border territory, the commission said. While this wasNorth Korea'sfirst official confirmation that its troops were deployed to Russia, it has repeatedly expressed its unwavering support of Russia's war against Ukraine. U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence officials have said North Korea deployed 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia last fall in its first involvement in a major armed conflict since the Korean War in the early 1950s. RUSSIA 'READY TO MAKE A DEAL' ON UKRAINE WAR, LAVROV SAYS Putin promised not to forget the sacrifices of North Korean troops sent to help Russia fight Ukrainian forces.(Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images) Putin and Kim said the deployment of North Korean troops was made under a mutual defense treaty signed in June 2024 that requires both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. The two U.S. adversaries have moved significantly closer to each other in recent years. In addition to its deployment of troops, North Korea has been supplying a large number of conventional weapons to Russia. South Korea and the U.S. are concerned that Russia could reward North Korea with military and economic assistance, including by transferring high-tech weapons technologies that can bolster its nuclear weapons program. Kim citing North Korea’s role in Russia regaining control of the Kursk region suggests his urgent desire to receive what he wants from Russia, including its sensitive military technologies and a solid security commitment to North Korea, according to Moon Seong Mook, an analyst for the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russia could provide military assistance to North Korea if necessary in accordance with the defense treaty, Russian state media reported. The deployment of North Korean troops was made under a mutual defense treaty signed in June 2024.(Sputnik/Mikhail Metzel/Kremlin via Reuters/File Photo) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP North Korea and Russia did not disclose how many North Korean soldiers were sent to Russia or how many casualties they suffered. But last month, South Korea’s military assessed that roughly 4,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed or wounded in the Russia-Ukraine war. The South Korean military also said North Korea sent about 3,000 additional troops to Russia earlier this year. South Korea’s Unification Ministry on Monday called on North Korea to withdraw its troops from Russia immediately, arguing that the North’s support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine poses a grave provocation to international security. Ministry spokesperson Koo Byoungsam also called the North’s deployment of troops \"an act against humanity.\" If Russia’s retaking of Kursk is confirmed, it woulddepriveUkraineof key leverage in U.S.-brokered efforts to negotiate an end to the war by exchanging its gains for some Russia-occupied land in Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday he doubts Putin wants to end the war. Just a day before, Trump had said Ukraine and Russia were \"very close to a deal.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Trump signs executive order cracking down on 'sanctuary' cities, threatens their federal funding",
    "article_text": "‘Border czar’ Tom Homan addresses the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown on ‘Hannity.’ PresidentDonald Trumpsigned an executive order Monday instructing the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security to create a list of all sanctuary cities failing to adhere to federal immigration laws, providing them a chance to abandon their sanctuary status. The order comes as Trump seeks tospeed up deportations, following through on a key promise he made on the campaign trail during his third bid for president. But so-called \"sanctuary cities,\" or jurisdictions that limit the ability of local agencies to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, have restricted his ability to do so. \"It's quite simple: obey the law, respect the law, and don't obstruct federal immigration officials and law enforcement officials when they are simply trying to remove public safety threats from our nation's communities,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday. \"The American public don't want illegal alien criminals in their communities. They made that quite clear on November 5, and this administration is determined to enforce our nation's immigration laws.\" Specifically, the executive order will notify sanctuary cities of their status and allow them to drop the sanctuary title — or risk losing federal funding. Additionally, it instructs Attorney GeneralPam Bondiand Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to \"pursue all legal remedies\" to push sanctuary cities into compliance with federal law, according to a Monday White House fact sheet shared with Fox News Digital. Bondi and Noem are also instructed to establish proper channels ensuring that those in sanctuary cities do not receive federal public benefits. YOUNGKIN TO DRAFT SANCTUARY CITY BAN, MAKING STATE FUNDING CONTINGENT ON ICE COOPERATION President Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House.(Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo/Reuters) Some of the country's largest cities have some sort of sanctuary law on the books aimed at protecting their illegal immigrant residents, including Chicago, New York City, Boston and Los Angeles, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. Some states have even gone on to pass their own sanctuary laws, including California, Oregon, Washington and Illinois. The jurisdictions have faced controversy as Trump has accelerated his deportation efforts, especially in the wake of multiple high-profile crimes that have been allegedly committed by illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities. Officers with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have seen their efforts hindered by sanctuary jurisdictions.(ICE) COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY STUDENT PROTESTER SUES TRUMP ADMIN TO PREVENT DEPORTATION Even so, the executive order comes days after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from restricting federal funds for sanctuary cities violates the Constitution’s separation of powers principles and the Spending Clause, in addition to the Fifth and 10th Amendments. The tension between the federal government and the jurisdictions has increased in recent weeks, including at a House Committee on Oversight and Government hearing in March, where members of Congress grilled the mayors of four prominent sanctuary cities. \"These reckless policies in Democrat-run cities and states across our nation have led to too many preventable tragedies,\" House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., said ahead of the hearing. \"They also endanger ICE agents who are forced to take more difficult enforcement actions in jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\" Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has been vocal in opposing the Trump administration, saying of her sanctuary city, \"we stand with immigrants.\"(Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump, a longtime critic of sanctuary jurisdictions, hinted earlier in an April 10 social media post that such an executive action might be in the works. \"No more Sanctuary Cities! They protect the Criminals, not the Victims,\" Trump said on April 10 in aTruth Social post. \"They are disgracing our Country, and are being mocked all over the World. Working on papers to withhold all Federal Funding for any City or State that allows these Death Traps to exist,\" Trump said. The Trump administration has signed more than 140 executive orders during Trump’s first 100 days in office — an increase from the 33 he signed during the first 100 days of his first term.

    "title": "Elections watchdog urges Senate GOP to close noncitizen voting loophole",
    "article_text": "'Outnumbered' panelists weigh in after a judge blocked President Donald Trump from requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote despite a Gallop poll showing 83% of Americans favor the idea. FIRST ON FOX:As theSenate reconvenesthis week after a spring break, the Honest Elections Project is urging GOP leaders to move quickly to close a loophole they say is allowing noncitizens to vote in federal elections. According to Honest Elections Project, an election integrity watchdog group, judicial interpretation of the National Voter Registration Act, often called the Motor Voter Act, effectively ties states’ hands, making it difficult to put commonsense voter ID requirements in place and opening the window for noncitizens to influence and tip the balance in elections. The group said current federal law makes it so that voter registration essentially operates on an honor system in which all a noncitizen needs to do to be added to the voter rolls is check a box indicating he or she is a citizen. Doing so is punishable as perjury but is not sufficient as a deterrent, critics say. To stop this, Honest Elections sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Senate Rules Committee ChairMitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Monday, urging them to immediatelybring the SAVE Actto the Senate floor for a vote. SENATOR JOINS GROUP OF FAR-LEFT LAWMAKERS WHO THINK TRUMP HAS – AGAIN – COMMITTED IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES The Honest Elections Project urged Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., left, and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to act to protect federal elections from ineligible noncitizen voters.(Getty Images) The SAVE Act, which passed the House this month, would require voters to show proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, passport, naturalization certificate orREAL IDthat notes citizenship status.According to Congress.gov, the Senate received the legislation for consideration from the House on April 10. When the House was considering the bill,House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said, \"This will be one of the most important votes that members of this chamber will ever take in their entire careers.\" Johnson urged House members to vote in favor of the bill, posing the question: \"Should Americans and Americans alone determine the outcome of American elections? Or should we allow foreigners and illegal aliens to decide who sits in the White House and in the people’s House and in the Senate?\" Critics of the bill,largely Democrats, argue that it would make voter registration more difficult by adding new documentation requirements and red tape to register. Opponents have argued that people in rural areas, as well as elderly people who have trouble accessing ID offices, would find it difficult to register to vote, effectively disenfranchising them. AS REAL ID ROLLOUT APPROACHES, CONGRESSIONAL PRIVACY HAWKS LARGELY SILENT ON CONCERNS House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.(J. Scott Applewhite/AP) Opponents have also said that recently married women who have had a name change would be disenfranchised because their identification would be outdated. The House passed the measure in a 220-208 vote, with just four Democrats joining Republicans to vote in favor. Honest Elections Executive Director Jason Snead argued in the letter that adding the proof of citizenship requirement to voter registration would make it \"easy to vote, but hard to cheat.\" Snead slammed opponents of the SAVE Act, saying they \"rely on a familiar litany of debunked and misleading arguments\" that \"have been made about voter ID laws for decades but were never borne out.\" HOUSE REPUBLICAN ENTERS RACE FOR MITCH MCCONNELL'S SENATE SEAT, SETTING UP HIGH-STAKES GOP PRIMARY U.S. Capitol(Fox News Digital) He explained that the SAVE Act has safeguards in place that would require states to establish a process to resolve identification discrepancies, such as a married woman’s new name, allowing them to show additional documentation, such as a marriage license. Snead said that \"by the same token, alternative evidence of citizenship could be offered by any American who may lack common records.\" On the other hand, Snead said \"the evidence clearly shows that noncitizens are able to register and vote\" under current law. \"In 2018, theDepartment of Justicecharged 19 noncitizens with illegally registering and voting,\" he said. HOUSE DEM JUMPS INTO CROWDED MICHIGAN SENATE RACE (Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images) Snead also cited Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson recently announcing that 15 noncitizens voted in 2024 and officials in Ohio, Texas and Virginia recently identifying \"significant numbers of noncitizens on their voter rolls and reported that many appear to have voted in recent years.\" \"Many races are decided by razor-thin margins – sometimes by a single vote. Each illegal vote cancels out the voice of alawful citizen voter,\" said Snead. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, Snead said proof of citizenship for voter registration is widely popular among most Americans. He cited a recent Gallup survey that found that 83% of Americans support having to show proof of citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections. \"As theSenate returns to session, I urge Leader Thune to take up the SAVE Act without delay,\" Snead said. \"We urge Leader Thune to take this opportunity to allow every Senator to go on the record supporting the fundamental principle that only citizens should vote in American elections.\" Fox News Digital has requested comment from the offices of both Thune and McConnell.

Trump will sign an \"order directing the Department of Transportation to include English literacy tests for our truckers. This is a big problem in the trucking community,\" Leavitt said on Monday afternoon during a press conference with new members of the media. The press conference was separate from a White House press briefing earlier Monday morning. Trump is expected to sign the executive order late Monday afternoon, Leavitt said. \"You might not know, but there's a lot of communication problems between truckers on the road with federal officials and local officials, as well, which obviously is a public safety risk,\" Leavitt continued. \"So we're going to ensure that our truckers, who are the backbone of our economy, are all able to speak English.

Truckers who are unable to prove they are proficient in English will be \"placed out-of-service, enhancing roadway safety,\" according to the White House. Fox News' Will Cain reported earlier in April on \"The Will Cain Show\" that trucking experts reported that there has been an influx of foreign-born truckers in recent years. Cain, citing experts, reported that former PresidentBarack Obama'sadministration in 2016 stopped an English requirement for drivers from being enforced, while the Biden-Harris administration in 2024 promoted an initiative that increased truck driving trainingopportunities for refugees,which has increased the number of foreign-born truck drivers operating in the U.S. Trump's anticipated executive ordercomes after he lauded truckers during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, under his first administration, for their work delivering goods to stores as the nation locked down.

    "article_text": "Rep. Gabe Vasquez, a Democrat who represents a border district in New Mexico, bashed the Trump administration and bragged about his vote against the Laken Riley Act, April 16. (Rep. Gabe Vasquez/Facebook) Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-N.M., touted his vote against the Laken Riley Act and bashed President Donald Trump's administration at an April event, saying deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, along with otherillegal immigrants, is \"testing and stretching the fabric of our democracy to a place we have never seen before.\" In his speech, Vasquez claimed some said it would take \"courage\" to vote against theLaken Riley Act, to which the Democratic congressman exclaimed, \"I did. I voted against [the bill],\" leading the audience to cheer. \"Because due process is a fundamental part of who we are as Americans,\" he continued. The Laken Riley Act, which was signed into law by Trump on Jan. 29, was introduced after an illegal immigrant brutally murdered 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley while she was jogging in Athens, Georgia, in February 2024. The law established that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must detain illegal migrants if they are arrested or charged with a violent crime. CHANCE OF LAKEN RILEY'S ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT KILLER DOING TIME IN EL SALVADOR PRISON ADDRESSED BY LAWMAKERS Just a month after the Laken Riley Act was signed into law,Secretary Kristi Noem and DHS announceda \"627% increase in monthly arrests compared to just 33,000 at-large arrests under Biden for ALL of last year.\" New Mexico Rep. Gabe Vasquez spoke with constituents at an April 16 event, explaining why he voted against the Laken Riley Act. Texas Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales, whose district contains the longest stretch of U.S. land neighboring Mexico, defended the bipartisan bill in a statement to Fox News Digital Friday. Gonzales explained that border security is \"a real and lasting issue as a result of four years of inaction under President Biden. That’s why Americans voted for safer communities and to restore law and order and President Trump is delivering on that promise with legislation like the Laken Riley Act and much more that is coming down the pike.\" Vasquez went on to bash the Trump administration for deporting illegal migrants, including Abrego Garcia, claiming U.S. citizens aren’t safe from being removed from the country if the Trump administration gets \"their way.\" \"Time and time again, out-of-touch Democrat Gabe Vasquez chooses to prioritize criminal illegal aliens over the well-being of hardworking New Mexicans,\" National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesman Zach Bannon told Fox News Digital. \"He’s completely abandoned common sense, pandering to the radical left while betraying the very people who will vote him out of office next year.\" DEMS RIDICULED FOR GOING ‘ALL IN’ ON SUSPECTED MS-13 GANG MEMBER KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA Rep. Gabe Vasquez attends a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 15, 2024.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Abrego Garcia, who has been the focus of Democratic talking points criticizing Trump's immigration policies, was one of many illegal immigrants who were deported to the El Salvadorian \"Terrorism Confinement Center\" (CECOT) in March. It was most recently revealed that the 29-year-old illegal migrant and suspected member of the violent MS-13 gang was pulled over while driving an SUV that belonged to another illegal immigrant whoconfessed to human smugglingin 2020. While the Trump administration has maintained their position on Abrego Garcia’s gang ties andhistory of violence, a federal judge and even the U.S. Supreme Court have ordered the Department of Justice (DOJ) to facilitate his return. Abrego Garcia had been living in Maryland with his family prior to being sent to El Salvador, on the grounds that his removal to the country was unjustified.

Homan noted that the nine illegal aliens in comparison to hundreds, if not thousands, of releases in a single day under theBiden administration, as well as times when there were over 10,000 migrant encounters in places like Eagle Pass, Texas, is a huge accomplishment. \"We have the most secure border in the history of this nation, and the numbers prove it.

    "article_text": "Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on the nonstop airstrikes on 'Special Report.' TheU.S. militaryhas pummeled over 800 targets since mid-March in a campaign aimed at eliminating Houthi terrorists and restoring freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, according to an update from Central Command. Since the start of \"Operation Rough Rider\" on March 15, U.S. forces have executed an \"intense and sustained campaign\" to dismantle the Iran-backed Houthi terrorist organization's capabilities, CENTCOM said Monday. The strikes have destroyed critical military infrastructure, including command centers, air defense systems, advanced weapons manufacturing sites and stockpiles of anti-ship missiles and drones. \"These strikes have killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders, including senior Houthi missile and UAV officials,\" the statement read. The Houthis' ability to launch attacks on international shipping has taken a major hit. U.S. officials say ballistic missile launches have dropped by 69%, while attacks by one-way suicide drones have fallen by 55% since the operation began.

The update came after concerns over the rapid rate at which the offensive campaign has depleted munitions stockpiles, and congressional officials say the campaign has already cost over $1 billion, the New York Times first reported.

    "article_text": "Greg Gutfeld and guests discuss the video of the day of a student calling 911 over a tampon during a ‘sit-in’ protest on ‘Gutfeld!’ PresidentDonald Trumpis set to sign an executive orderbacking local police departmentswith federal support in a rejection of left-wing \"soft-on-crime policies\" that \"have fueled chaos\" and caused Americans to live in fear, Fox News Digital learned. On Monday,Trump is expectedto sign an executive order that aims to \"empower state and local law enforcement with federal resources, focus federal prosecutions on high-impact crimes, protect law-abiding Americans, and pursue legal remedies against obstructive state or local officials,\" a senior White House official shared with Fox News Digital Monday morning. The order instructs Attorney GeneralPam Bondito implement a handful of policies and initiatives to bolster police departments, including create an avenue that provides legal resources to officers \"facing unjust expenses from official duties\"; increase \"surplus military assets for local law enforcement and evaluate their use in crime prevention\"; ensure racial discrimination investigations in law enforcement rely on direct evidence only; and maximize federal resources to boost pay for cops, improve training and review federal consent decrees. Crime rocked the nation from coast-to-coast in 2020, as riots protesting the death of George Floyd broke out and activists demanded police departments be defunded, simultaneously to Americans abiding lockdown orders amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which upended daily life.

Riot in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 2020.(Joshua Lott for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Experts who spoke to Fox News Digital at the height of the 2020-era crime wave pointed to an array of variables that have likely contributed to the increases since 2020, including the pandemic; anti-police rhetoric voiced by Black Lives Matter and defund the police proponents; a culture of lawlessness promoted by liberal district attorneys; and the \"Ferguson effect\" – named after the high-profile Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, and referring to when police pull back from proactive patrolling when violent crimes spike. Amid the pandemic and riots of 2020, left-wing cities moved to defund police departments as activists demanded an overhaul of the justice system, including installing community-based policing over employing officers, following the death of Floyd and other Black Americans in police custody. Officers filed for early retirement, changed careers or moved to police jurisdictions that backed cops in the face of the anti-police rhetoric, while morale plummeted among the ranks and departments reported severe understaffing issues.

    "article_text": "State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said a leaked White House proposal to slash the department's budget is \"not final.\" House Republicans are rushing to get started on a multitrillion-dollar bill to advance PresidentDonald Trump’sagenda, with their own leader’s self-imposed deadline less than a month away. Lawmakers on five different committees are huddling within their panels this week to debate and advance specific aspects of what will become one massive piece of legislation. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he wants to get a bill on Trump’s desk by Memorial Day – a goal he’s still optimistic about, despite a host of challenges that Republicans will need to get through before the finish line. Meanwhile, the Senate and House appear to still be far apart on their expected timelines and how much money they’re aiming to spend. MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE Speaker Mike Johnson is optimistic Republicans could have a reconciliation bill on President Trump's desk by Memorial Day \"or shortly thereafter.\"(Getty Images) \"This is not just a preference we have, this is a necessity,\" Johnson told Fox News Digital about the Memorial Day deadline in an interview on Friday. \"We have the debt limit X-date approaching, and as everybody knows, border security resources dwindling, we’ve got markets in flux, we’ve got, of course, the living threat of the largest tax increase on working families in history.\" Republicans are seeking to fit Trump’s priorities on energy, defense,border securityand taxes into the bill, as well as raise the debt ceiling – another item the president specifically asked GOP lawmakers to deal with. Johnson pointed out that the U.S. is fast approaching its deadline to act on the debt ceiling or risk a national credit default – which would send financial markets into a tailspin. The federal government is expected to hit that deadline sometime this spring or summer, according to differing projections. \"I’ve got to work on the assumption that it’ll be sooner, it may be as early as June,\" Johnson said. \"I can’t control what happens in the Senate, but I think they have the same sense of urgency, so I think that we’re on target to get it by Memorial Day or shortly thereafter.\" A Senate GOP leadership aide appeared less optimistic, however. They told Fox News Digital that Republicans in the upper chamber shared the goal of moving as quickly as possible but acknowledged \"the reality\" of differing procedures in the House and Senate. The House’s framework for the legislation passed first and called for at least $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in spending cuts to offset a portion of the $4.5 trillion allocated toward Trump’s tax agenda. Senate Majority Leader John Thune's chamber passed a similar bill that calls for far fewer spending cuts.(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) The Senate later passed an amended version that called for a minimum of $4 billion in spending cuts. House Republicans narrowly swallowed that framework to align with the Senate – a key step before the relevant committees noted in the framework can begin crafting policies within their jurisdictions, to later be filled into the final bill. A revolt against that bill by an unlikely faction of well-known GOP rebels and leaders on the House Budget Committee prompted Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to publicly pledge to have the Senate aim for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. But on paper, they’re still far apart, and there’s a significant contingent in the House and Senate who are wary of cutting funding for critical programs like Medicaid and Medicare. SENATE GOP PUSHES TRUMP BUDGET FRAMEWORK THROUGH AFTER MARATHON VOTE SERIES \"The fight is between the House, that wants to add $2.8 trillion on the debt, and the Senate, that wants to add $5.8 trillion on the debt,\" said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). \"So I’m not optimistic that we’re going to reduce the debt. I am somewhat optimistic that we’re going to get closer to what the House wants, which would be much better.\" But a significant amount – about $880 billion – of spending cuts outlined in theHouse GOPframework come from the House Energy & Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare and Medicaid. Estimates have shown that the committee will not be able to complete those cuts without cutting into those programs, but Republican leaders have insisted they’re only looking to root out \"waste, fraud and abuse.\" Republicans are looking to pass their legislation via the budget reconciliation process. The mechanism allows the party in power to pass massive policy overhauls while entirely sidelining the opposing party by dropping the Senate’s threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The House already operates on a simple majority threshold. The House committees set to meet this week to mark up their reconciliation bills are the Homeland Security, Oversight, Education & Workforce, and Financial Services. Issues that are expected to be more divisive – like portions from the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax policy – will be visited next week.

    "title": "Ethics complaint against Letitia James calls for NY state courts to investigate Trump admin fraud claims",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports on New York Attorney General Letitia James' lawyer urging the DOJ to dismiss a criminal referral on 'The Ingraham Angle.' New York Attorney General Letitia James is the subject of a new state-level ethics complaint filed by pro-Trump legal nonprofit America First Legal (AFL). The AFL complaint filed last week adds to the recent woes for James, who's also facinga criminal referralfrom the Trump administration related to accusations of mortgage fraud. \"For a state prosecutor who has maligned the President of the United States for political gain, public accountability will serve as a cure to Letitia James’ endless lawfare and abuse of power,\" AFL Vice President Dan Epstein said in a statement to Fox News Digital. The complaint was filed with the New York State Unified Court System's Committee on Professional Standards, the state-level entity that handles discipline matters for attorneys whose principal office is in the Albany region. The complaint requests that the attorney grievance committee open an investigation into James overaccusations of mortgage fraudlevied against her earlier this month by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). COUSIN OF INFAMOUS FRAUDSTER ‘CRAZY EDDIE’ OUT TO BRING DOWN TRUMP NEMESIS NY AG LETITIA JAMES Those accusations were published in a criminal referral sent earlier this month to the Department of Justice by FHFA Director William Pulte. In the referral, Pulte accused James of falsifying mortgage records to obtain more favorable loans. \"If what Director Pulte uncovered is true, then we have a sitting state Attorney General who made false certifications to the United States in return for federal benefits,\" Epstein said. James' actions violate theNew YorkState Bar Association's rules of professional conduct, according to AFL's complaint. Those rules prohibit lawyers from engaging in \"illegal conduct\" that can adversely impact the lawyer's honesty and trustworthiness. It also bars conduct that may not be deemed \"illegal,\" but that involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. The New York Attorney General's Office has hired high-poweredattorney Abbe Lowellto defend James. LETITIA JAMES REAPS WHAT SHE SOWS AFTER LEVELING ‘LAUGHABLE’ CASE AT TRUMP: EXPERT Local reporting from the Times Union said the attorney general's office indicated the decision to hire Lowell was, in part, based on their allegation that the Trump administration is pushing a politically motivated criminal referral in response to James bringing a civil case againstDonald Trumplast year for allegedly inflating asset values to obtain favorable loans. The New York Attorney General's Office hired high-powered political attorney Abbe Lowell to represent Letitia James against accusations of fraud.(AP/Reuters/Fox News) \"I’m always amazed at the rank hypocrisy of politicians who are quick to accuse others of what they’re guilty of doing themselves,\" Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett said. \"James famously intoned to Trump that ‘no one is above the law' and that he was ultimately responsible legally for documents prepared by others. \"Unlike Trump, James is a lawyer. She knew or should have known, better than a lay person, that those documents were inaccurate and apparently false. She’s on record stating that accuracy in such financial records is essential and must be strictly enforced.\" When reached for comment, the attorney general's office directed Fox News Digital to Lowell's response letter to the FHFA's criminal referral. In his letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Lowell called the referral against James \"the latest act of improper political retribution\" from Trump. \"The stunning hypocrisy of President Trump’s complaint that theJustice Departmenthad been ‘politicized’ and ‘weaponized’ against him is laid bare as he and others in his administration are now asking you to undertake the very same practice,\" Lowell wrote. NY AG LETITIA JAMES' LAWYER SENDS LETTER TO AG PAM BONDI The New York attorney general said she is \"prepared\" to ask the judge to seize former President Donald Trump's assets if he cannot pay the $354 million judgment handed down in his civil fraud case.(ABC News/Screenshot/Brendan McDermid-Pool/Getty Images) Lowell also disputed some of the allegations, including that James listeda home in Virginiaas her primary residence while serving as a state official in New York. According to Lowell, James had no intention of using the property as a primary residence, and her indication of this in a power-of-attorney letter was a mistake. Lowell pointed out there were other documents where James indicated to her lender that the Virginia home would not be her primary residence. A second accusation of fraud against James accuses her of inflating the number of livable units in a multifamily Brooklyn residence to receive better interest rates. Lowell, however, alleges that Pulte is disregarding updated documentation listing the residence as a four-unit multifamily residence, and instead pointing to a certificate of occupancy from 2001. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital reached out to the New York State Unified Court System handling the AFL's bar complaint to inquire about potential next steps and disciplinary actions but did not receive a response by publication time. Fox News Digital also reached out to the New York State Bar Association, but the group declined to comment, citing the fact the N.Y. courts system is the body that handles attorney discipline and will be the entity adjudicating AFL's complaint.",

Hegseth launched a review ofgrooming and physical fitness standardslast month after voicing concerns that fitness standards have eroded and questioning whether mismatched standards for men and women are affecting readiness. It directed the undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to look at \"existing standards set by the Military Departments pertaining to physical fitness, body composition, and grooming, which includes but is not limited to beards.\" The memo also called for a review to examine how standards have changed since 2015.

The Army and Navy offered pre-boot camp training for those who did not meet physical fitness or testing scores. However, those recruits had to meet the same standards in order to graduate from training courses and serve. \"When I wasin the Army, we kicked out good soldiers for having naked women tattooed on their arms, and today we are relaxing the standards on shaving, dreadlocks, man buns, and straight-up obesity,\" Hegseth wrote in his book \"The War on Warriors.\"",

    "article_text": "POLITICO national political correspondent Meridith McGraw has the latest on the Supreme Court ruling access to mifepristone will for now remain in place on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' A new study has exposed \"serious adverse events\" linked to mifepristone, also known as the \"abortion pill.\" Mifepristone is a \"pregnancy blocker\" that is used in combination with another medication, misoprostol, to terminate pregnancies, according to Mayo Clinic. It is also used to manage early miscarriages, as it helps prepare the body to empty the uterus. ABORTION PILL USE HAS SPIKED IN RECENT YEARS, NEW REPORT REVEALS: ‘SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE’ Research by the Ethics & Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C., has revealed that the rate of serious side effects is 22 times higher than what is indicated on the FDA-approved drug label. After going through an abortion assisted by mifepristone, nearly 11% of women — more than one in 10 — reported experiencing \"infection, hemorrhaging, or another serious or life-threatening adverse event,\" according to the study summary. A new study has exposed \"serious adverse events\" linked to mifepristone, also known as the \"abortion pill.\"(iStock) The study used insurance claims data that includes more than 865,000medication abortionsprescribed between 2017 and 2023, resulting in what is described as the largest-ever dataset on chemical abortion. ABORTION ON DEMAND: THESE 6 STATES ALLOW WOMEN TO GET PREGNANCY-ENDING DRUGS BY PHONE OR ONLINE \"By contrast, the current FDA-approved drug label is based on the results of 10 clinical trials with a total of 30,966 women, less than 0.5 percent of whom reportedly experienced severeadverse reactions,\" the study states. \"Some of these trials were conducted as long as 42 years ago.\" The study authors — Jamie Bryan Hall, EPPC’s director of data analysis, and Ryan T. Anderson, EPPC’s president — called the results a \"truly shocking and sad reality.\" The study used insurance claims data for more than 865,000 medication abortions prescribed between 2017 and 2023. \"We weren't exactly surprised by these findings, as other studies of smaller datasets have found significant safety problems with chemical abortion drugs — particularly after the Obama and Biden administrations removed important FDA safety protections that were required when the chemical abortion drug was first approved,\" the authors said in a statement sent to Fox News Digital. \"The largest limitation, which we're working to address, is that there is no insurance code for death — and sadly, we know thatwomen die from complicationsresulting from the abortion pill.\" Nearly 11% of women reported experiencing \"infection, hemorrhaging, or another serious or life-threatening adverse event,\" according to the study summary.(iStock) Based on the study, the researchers are calling on the FDA to reinstate the original safety protections that they required when they approved mifepristone, stating that \"women deserve the truth.\" Christina Francis, M.D., CEO of the American Association of Pro Life OBGYNs, who is based in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, was not involved in the research but commented on the significance of the outcome. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The findings of this study, which analyzes nearly 900,000 drug-induced abortions, align with what I have seen in my two decades of practice as an OB-GYN, during which I have cared for many women who have been lied to about the safety of abortion drugs and suffered significant complications from them,\" she told Fox News Digital. Francis concluded that nearly 71,000 women likely suffered these types of severe complications in 2023, based on numbers from the Guttmacher Institute. Mifepristone is also used to manage early miscarriages, as it helps prepare the body to empty the uterus.(iStock) \"This should serve as a wake-up call for the FDA that the complication rate is over 20 times higher than what has previously stated — and is a public health crisis that should be investigated immediately,\" she said. \"Women deserve informed consent about the potentially life-threatening dangers of these drugs.\" Professor Jessie Hill, a health law expert at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, also reviewed the study findings. She stated that mifepristone has been one of the most-studied medications ever since its approval in the U.S. 25 years ago, claiming it is also \"one of the safest.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Hill pointed out that the EPPC’s study is not peer-reviewed and questioned its \"potential bias.\" \"The study uses insurance claims data, but insurance claims are an imperfect proxy forcausal medical outcomes,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"They often lack context — a claim for hemorrhage, for instance, may not even be causally linked to mifepristone itself.\" Approximately 63% of all abortions in the U.S. in 2023 were medication abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute.(iStock) Hill also objected to the comparison of modern claims data to the FDA’s clinical trial data. \"Clinical trialshave rigorous standards for defining and reporting adverse events. Claims data are generated for billing purposes, not scientific analysis, and often overcount or misclassify events.\" \"Insurance claims are an imperfect proxy for causal medical outcomes.\" Hill also noted that the legal standard for FDA drug regulation is not \"no risk,\" and that all medications have adverse event rates. \"Overstating risks without weighing benefits distorts the regulatory framework,\" she said.

Newcancer researchpioneered by Memorial Sloan Kettering points to a strong alternative to chemotherapy, surgery and radiation for some forms of cancer. Nearly 80% of patients who suffered from a variety of cancer types were successfully treated with only immunotherapy, according to a new study published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The immunotherapy protocol successfully treated 100% of rectal cancer patients involved in the trial.

    "article_text": "Melissa Neill, fitness trainer and CEO of Body by Bikini in the U.K., explains how aging-related changes in the body call for different approaches to exercise for better results. Even on days when you're lagging in energy, exercise can give your brain a boost. That's according to researchers at the University of Missouri (Mizzou), who made a specific discovery aboutphysical activity'sbrain benefits. The study, published in the journal Physiology, examined what happens to the brains of individuals who have limited ketone production in the liver. DANCING CAN HELP RELIEVE CANCER-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS, EARLY DATA SHOWS When the body is low on glucose, its usual fuel, the liver produces ketones, which help generate energy and power the brain, according to the study's press release. These molecules support cognitive memory, learning andoverall brain health. Exercise can boost brain power in a new way, researchers have discovered.(iStock) Even when the liver cannot produce enough ketones, exercise helps compensate for this loss, potentially reversing some cognitive decline,the researchersfound. This is especially prevalent as people age and face a higher risk of conditions such asAlzheimer’s disease. DEMENTIA RISK CONNECTED TO CANNABIS-RELATED HOSPITAL VISITS, SAYS STUDY These findings are also promising for those who have liver conditions that prevent the body from producing ketones. Lead study co-researcher R. Scott Rector, Ph.D., a professor in the School of Medicine and director of the NextGen Precision Health Building, commented on the study in an interview with Fox News Digital, noting that the body's natural production of ketones is important for keeping the brain healthy. Even when the liver cannot produce enough ketones, exercise helps compensate for this loss, potentially reversing some cognitive decline, the researchers found.(iStock) \"It helps maintain memory, learning abilities, and the health of the brain’s energy factories (mitochondria),\" he said. \"Exercise can still protect the brain even when the liver isn’t making ketones, which might be relevant to individuals with liver disease, which causes reduced ketone production.\" These findings were surprising to the researchers, according to Rector, who expected that exercise might not improve brain health when ketone production was limited. \"Exercise can still protect the brain even when the liver isn’t making ketones.\" \"However, it seemsexercise has backup pathwaysthat enhance brain health, even when ketone production is compromised,\" he said. Another lead researcher, Taylor Kelty, a postdoctoral fellow in Rector’s lab, noted that previous research has begun to show the link between severe liver dysfunction and a high risk of dementia. The study findings are promising for those who have liver dysfunction and face a higher risk of cognitive decline with age.(iStock) \"If ketone production in the liver is disrupted, it could be a potential cause of cognitive decline, ultimately leading to conditions like dementia,\" Kelty said in the press release. These findings reinforce exercise's role in keeping people \"mentally sharp,\" as well as being a \"key piece of the puzzle in preserving brain healthas we age,\" according to the researcher. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Rector noted that exercise activates \"many other pathways\" in the liver that could also help the brain, although that wasn't a focus of this study. \"In the future, we need to study these other molecules and backup systems that still boostbrain health,\" he said to Fox News Digital. \"Scientists are finding more and more evidence that liver health affects brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease,\" Rector said.(iStock) \"Exercise's brain health benefits are particularly important for those who have liver conditions like MASLD (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease),\" Rector added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Scientists are finding more and more evidence that liver health affects brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease,\" he said. \"Scientists are finding more and more evidence that liver health affects brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease.\" \"Our findings suggest that taking care of the liver and understanding ketone metabolism could be a new way to help prevent or slow downbrain diseases.\" For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health as part of the NIH Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium.

As measles cases continue to spread throughout the U.S. — with 12 states reportingofficial outbreaks, according to the latest CDC data — concern is growing among high-risk groups. Children under the age of 5 are mostvulnerable to measles, health experts confirm. The CDC recommends that children receive two doses of the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age, and a second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. MEASLES OUTBREAKS EMERGE ACROSS US: SEE WHICH STATES HAVE REPORTED CASES That means children under 5 may not have full protection. As measles cases continue to spread throughout the U.S. — with 12 states reporting official outbreaks, according to the latest CDC data — concern is growing among high-risk groups.(iStock) Allison Croucher, DO, a pediatrician and doctor of osteopathic medicine with Duly Health and Care in Illinois, said she frequently gets questions from concerned parents looking to protect their children from thehighly contagious virus. Chroucher shared some of the most common inquiries she receives, along with her responses. Measles cases have been reported in 20 states so far (according to the CDC): Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. Children under the age of 5 are most vulnerable to measles, health experts confirm.(iStock) Even if you do not live in one of those areas, keep a close eye on local health alerts, since the disease israpidly evolving. Your state's Department of Health website, which should end in \".gov,\" is a great place to start. If you plan on traveling to an area with reported cases, be sure to seek guidance from your doctor beforehand. A child is considered fully vaccinated for measles if they have received two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine at least four weeks apart. The first dose is typically given to children between 12 and 15 months old, followed by the second at four to six years. In the early stages, symptoms to watch out for include fever, cough, runny nose, and red, irritated eyes.(iStock) In certain cases, yes. Infants who are high-risk or traveling to areas with active cases may be eligible to get theMMR vaccinebetween six months and 12 months of age. This depends on individual circumstances, so it's important to talk with your pediatrician. Keep in mind that an early dose doesn't count on the regular vaccination schedule — your child will still need two additional doses after their first birthday. ANOTHER STATE CONFIRMS MEASLES CASE WITH INFECTED CHILD ITS FIRST OF YEAR If your infant is too young for the vaccine, it's important to take extra precautions to limit their exposure to others who are or might be ill. Don't be afraid to decline travel or gatherings — you have every right to protect your child's health. For children over one year, the second MMR dose can be given as early as four weeks after the first. Once they've received both doses, children are considered fully vaccinated and don't require any additional doses. \"One to three of every 1,000 children infected with measles will die due to complications from the disease.\" In the early stages, symptoms to watch out for include fever, cough, runny nose, and red, irritated eyes. These symptoms usually appear seven to 14 days after initial exposure. It's not always easy to tell, since measles shares symptoms with many other illnesses. One key differentiator is thatchildren with measlestypically display very high fevers, around 104°F. They also tend to be very fussy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Around the second or third day of symptoms, many patients develop small, bluish-white spots on their inner cheeks, referred to as Koplik spots — though not every child will develop these spots. The telltale red rash typically develops three to five days into the illness. A child is considered fully vaccinated for measles if they have received two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine at least four weeks apart.(Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images) This rash typically starts three to five days after the initial symptoms. It begins as small spots on the face near the hairline, then spreads downwards and can cover the entire body. Measles can have many complications, ranging from mild to severe. About one in 10 people will developear infectionsor diarrhea. About one in five unvaccinated children with measles will require hospitalization. Up to one in 20 children will contract pneumonia, which is the most common cause of death from the disease.

    "article_text": "The Buffalo Bills signed Joey Bosa to a one-year, $12 million contract. Craig Carton, Danny Parkins and Mark Schlereth discuss Bosa’s potential impact for the Bills and why his availability could be a concern. Buffalo Billsgeneral manager Brandon Beane had a problem with sports radio hosts in the area during an appearance on Monday morning, and he didn’t hold back his thoughts while on the air. WGR 550 Buffalo Sports Radio had Beane in the building post-NFL Draft, and co-hosts Jeremy White and Joe DiBiase suggested before the segment with Beane that the team missed by not drafting a wide receiver. Well, Beane heard them and decided to air out that opinion for all to hear. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Buffalo Bills general manager Brandon Beane(Kirby Lee-Imagn Images) \"I was just listening to the last few minutes of your show waiting to come on, and it sounds like 2018 all over with you guys,\" Beane said. \"You guys were b----ing in 2018 about Josh Allen, you guys wanted Josh Rosen, and now you guys are b----ing that we don’t have a receiver.\" It’s obvious now that Beane smashed the 2018 draft by taking Allen, the league’s most recent MVP, with their first-round pick. Rosen flamed out as theArizona Cardinals’ first-round selection as the organization eventually chose Kyler Murray to lead the team at quarterback. 2025 NFL DRAFT GRADES: ANALYZING ALL 32 TEAMS' CLASSES \"I don’t get it,\" Beane continued. \"We just scored 30 points in a row for eight straight games. A year ago, I get you guys asking why we didn’t have receivers, but I don’t understand it now. \"You just saw us lead the league in points, when you add all the postseason. No one scored more points than the Buffalo Bills, including the Super Bowl champions. You just saw us do it without Stefon Diggs, same group. How is this group not better than last year’s group?\" Beane’s argument has evidence as the Bills’ run in the postseason gave them the most points of any team in the league last season.

Belichick reportedly followed up the next day, \"I cannot believe that UNC would support my being called a ‘predator.'\" Robbi Pickeral Evans, UNC senior associate athletic director for external affairs and strategic communications, replied that the social media team hides or erases comments about personal life.

Shedeur Sanderswas the 144th pick of the NFL Draft as the Cleveland Browns added him to their depth chart in the fifth round on Saturday afternoon. The free fall lasted longer than expected, but Sanders finally found a home on the third day, starting the journey to become the team’s starting quarterback at some point during the 2025 season.

Deshaun Watson’s status in 2025 is murky at best after re-injuring his Achilles in the offseason. Watson suffered an Achilles tear last October. Browns general manager Andrew Berry divulged his expectations for each quarterback the team brought in during the offseason. \"We expect every player to compete. Simple as that,\" he said. Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski was asked how he was going to ensure each of the four healthy quarterbacks were going to get a fair shot. \"We’ve talked about it. I mean there’s ways to do both I think,\" he said. \"Obviously you may not divide them 25, 25, 25, but we feel really confident that we’ll have a plan that is fair to each player and fair to the team as well.\" The Browns acquired Pickett in the offseason in a trade with the Philadelphia Eagles. He served as a backup for Jalen Hurts with the Eagles and received a ring when the team won the Super Bowl over the Kansas City Chiefs in February. He previously started with the Pittsburgh Steelers after the team selected him in the first round of the 2022 draft. Cleveland brought Flacco back after he went to the Indianapolis Colts in 2024. He took over for an injured Watson in 2023 and helped lead the Browns to the playoffs. Flacco won a Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens in 2012.

He played his college ball at UCF, Oklahoma and Oregon. Last year with the Ducks, he had 3,857 passing yards and 30 touchdown passes. He was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy. He also holds the FBS record for most touchdown passes thrown in a career. Berry explained why the team decided to take two quarterbacks in this year’s draft. \"I think just like I could probably say the plan wasn’t necessary to take two running backs. Like, you envision how the draft could possibly play out, and then you just really adjust to what’s on the board,\" Berry said.

And part of the reason you have to do that is being flexible.\" Sanders will have an uphill battle in an attempt to attain the starting job – and a roster spot – once the season begins officially later this year.

    "title": "FBI warns of time-traveling hackers",
    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them. Cybercriminals always find new ways to scam you, whether it’s mimicking a government agency, creating a fake website or delivering malware disguised as a software update. Just when you think you’ve seen it all, they come up with a new trick. This time, the FBI has issued an alert: Hackers are using a \"time-traveling\" technique to bypass your device’s security measures. No, we’re not talking about actual time travel (though wouldn’t that be something?). This is a sophisticated cyberattack where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to sneak past security defenses. Join The FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up. A man working on his laptops(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The concept of \"time-traveling hackers\" refers not to literal time travel but to a sophisticated cyberattack technique where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to bypass security measures. This attack is reportedly tied to the Medusa ransomware gang. In this type of attack, hackers exploit expired security certificates by altering the system date on a targeted device to a time when those certificates were still valid. For example, a security certificate that expired in, say, 2020 could be made usable again if the system's clock is set back to 2019. This allows malicious software signed with these outdated certificates to be recognized as legitimate by the system, effectively \"traveling back in time\" from a security perspective. This technique was notably used in the Medusa ransomware attacks, which targeted critical infrastructure and prompted anFBI cybersecurity advisory(AA25-071A) earlier in 2025. The campaign has affected over 300 critical infrastructure targets. The attackers combined this method with social engineering and exploited unpatched vulnerabilities, amplifying the threat. The FBI has warned that such attacks pose a significant risk, as they can disable modern security protections like Windows Defender by tricking the system into accepting outdated drivers or software. A woman working on her laptop and scrolling on her phone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS The FBI is urging organizations to take action quickly, warning that this technique can slip past traditional defenses by taking advantage of how systems trust old certificate data. To stay protected, they recommend turning on two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere, especially for important stuff like webmail and VPNs. It also helps to have strong endpoint protection and clear security policies and to keep an eye out for any weird changes to system settings, like the device clock suddenly jumping back in time. A man working on his laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID 1) Use strong antivirus software:A strong antivirus isn’t just for catching old-school viruses anymore. It can detect phishing links, block malicious downloads and stop ransomware before it gets a foothold. Since the Medusa gang uses fake updates and social engineering to trick users, having strong antivirus software adds a critical layer of protection against threats you might not see coming.Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 2)Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):The FBI specifically recommendsenabling 2FA across all services, especially for high-value targets like webmail accounts, VPNs and remote access tools. 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to break in, even if they’ve managed to steal your username and password through phishing or other tactics. 3)Use strong, unique passwords:Many ransomware groups, including Medusa, rely on reused or weak passwords to gain access. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don’t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here. 4) Monitor for suspicious system time changes:The core of this \"time-traveling\" attack is clock manipulation: Hackers roll back a device’s clock to a time when expired security certificates were still valid. This allows outdated and potentially malicious software to appear trustworthy. Be alert to unexpected system time changes, and if you're managing an organization, use tools that flag and log these types of configuration shifts. 5) Keep systems updated and patch known vulnerabilities:The Medusa ransomware campaign has a track record of exploiting unpatched systems. That means old software, outdated drivers and ignored security updates can all become entry points. Regularlyinstalling updates for your OS, applications and driversis one of the most effective ways to stay protected. Don't put off those system notifications; they exist for a reason. CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC The Medusa attack is a good example of how cybercriminals are shifting tactics. Instead of relying on traditional methods like brute force or obvious exploits, they are targeting the basic logic that systems depend on to function. In this case, it is something as simple as the system clock. This kind of strategy challenges the way we think about security. It is not just about building stronger defenses but also about questioning the default assumptions built into the technology we use every day.

    "title": "Soft vine-like robot helps rescuers find survivors",
    "article_text": "Kurt Knutsson talks about a soft, vine-like robot called SPROUT that aids safe survivor rescues in collapsed buildings. When disaster strikes and buildings collapse, every second counts for emergency responders searching for survivors trapped beneath rubble. Traditional tools often fall short in these dangerous, chaotic environments, but a new breed of robot, SPROUT, is poised to make a life-saving difference. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit (MIT Lincoln Laboratory)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) SPROUT, short for Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit, is a flexible, vine-like robot developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory in collaboration with the University of Notre Dame. Unlike rigid robots or static cameras, SPROUT can \"grow\" into tight, winding spaces that are otherwise inaccessible, giving first responders a new way to explore, map and assess collapsed structures. Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit (MIT Lincoln Laboratory)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) ELECTRIC SUV IS THE ULTIMATE LIFELINE FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSIONS SPROUT is made of an airtight fabric tube that inflates with air, allowing it to extend from a fixed base. As it grows, it can flex around corners and squeeze through narrow gaps, mimicking the movement of a plant vine. Operators control SPROUT using a joystick, steering it through debris while watching a live video feed from a camera mounted at the tip. This setup lets responders see and map hidden void spaces without entering dangerous areas themselves. Three pouch motors along the vine’s length enable SPROUT to bend and turn, while an internal reel system allows the robot to be compactly stored and precisely deployed as needed. In addition to cameras, SPROUT can carry other sensors to image, map and even assess hazards within the collapsed structure. TOP 13 EMERGENCY CAR ESSENTIALS Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit (MIT Lincoln Laboratory)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) RESCUE DRONE HITS BEACHES DESIGNED TO SAVE LIVES AS A FLYING LIFEBUOY Traditional search-and-rescue gear, such as rigid robots or specialized cameras, struggles in disaster zones for several reasons. Cameras can only probe straight paths, often requiring teams to cut new access holes to see further into the rubble. Rigid robots are prone to damage in unstable, cramped environments and are expensive to repair. Manual probing is time-consuming and physically exhausting for responders. SPROUT’s soft, flexible design directly addresses these challenges, offering a safer, faster and more adaptable solution for navigating the unpredictable landscape of collapsed buildings. Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit (MIT Lincoln Laboratory)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) BEST HOME INVENTORY APPS TO PROTECT YOUR PROPERTY IN CASE OF EMERGENCY SPROUT has already been put through its paces at the Massachusetts Task Force 1 training site, where it demonstrated its ability to flex around corners and penetrate void spaces in engineered collapsed structures. These tests allowed the team to refine SPROUT’s durability, portability and steering controls, with plans for larger field studies underway. The project is a true collaboration, pairing MIT’s engineering expertise with Professor Margaret Coad’s pioneering work on vine robots at Notre Dame. This partnership has accelerated SPROUT’s development, bringing hands-on demonstrations to first responders, many of whom have limited research and development budgets. IS YOUR PHONE READY FOR AN EMERGENCY? TURN ON THESE LIFESAVING SETTINGS Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit (MIT Lincoln Laboratory)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The team behind SPROUT is continuously working to expand its capabilities. Current models can extend up to 10 feet, with future versions aiming to reach beyond 25 feet. Researchers are also exploring the use of multiple SPROUT robots to cover larger areas and expedite rescue operations in major disasters. Beyond disaster response, the technology could be adapted for inspecting military systems or critical infrastructure in hard-to-reach places, making SPROUT a versatile tool for a variety of high-stakes scenarios. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit (MIT Lincoln Laboratory)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) SPROUT is a remarkable example of how soft robotics can make a real difference in some of the most challenging and dangerous situations. By giving first responders a flexible, easy-to-use tool for searching through rubble, SPROUT has the potential to save lives and change the way we approach disaster rescue. It’s great to see technology that’s not just innovative but truly impactful, helping those who help others when it matters most.

    "title": "GREGG JARRETT: Rogue, leftist judges caused by an obsession with feelings, not facts",
    "article_text": "Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss a protest in Wisconsin over the arrest of a federal judge for allegedly helping an illegal migrant evade ICE. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor once observed, \"We apply law to facts. We don’t apply feelings to facts.\" Judges in Americashould heed Sotomayor’s wise counsel. That some do not gives rise to a form of tyranny from the bench where judges hold the law in contempt in favor of their \"feelings.\" By doing so, they are breaching the public’s trust. It is a perilous choice. Recently,two state court juristsallowed their \"feelings\" to overrule their better judgment. By anointing themselves sanctuary judges and actively shielding illegal migrants, they have placed themselves in legal jeopardy as accessories. PAM BONDI OFFERS NEW DETAILS ON COLORADO NIGHTCLUB RAID, WISCONSIN JUDGE WHO ALLEGEDLY AIDED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT Their subsequent arrests tend to prove Sotomayor’s point. FBI arrests Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, alleging she obstructed the arrest of an illegal alien.(Obtained by Fox News) In Wisconsin, Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan wasarrested for allegedly aiding and abettingan illegal alien’s escape from her courtroom as federal agents arrived to take him into custody on an administrative deportation warrant. The criminal complaint and supporting affidavit state that a \"visibly angry\" Dugan said, \"wait, come with me\" and then escorted the defendant from her court to a non-public back door to evade his arrest. Once outside, the defendant, who was also facing domestic abuse charges in Dugan’s courtroom, \"sprinted down the street.\" A foot chase ensued, putting citizens and law enforcement at risk of harm. He was apprehended without injury. Days later, Dugan was arrested on the courthouse grounds and charged with federal obstruction and concealment (18 USC 1505 and 1071). A conviction carries a maximum sentence of six years behind bars. In a separate case, New Mexico Judge Jose Luis Cano and his wife were arrested after authorities determined that they knowingly harboredat their home an illegal migrantwith suspected ties to the notorious Tren de Aragua transnational criminal gang, which is a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. Cano and his family allegedly gave the man access to guns with a suppressor. He was taken into custody. Meanwhile, Cano resigned his office while the state supreme court permanently banned him from ever serving on the bench. But that was the least of his worries. The criminal complaint states that Cano confessed to destroying incriminating evidence. He is charged with federal evidence tampering, and his wife is facing a conspiracy offense (18 USC 1519 and 371). If convicted, the maximum sentence is 20 years in prison. Right on cue, a slew of Democrats voiced their predictable outrage and condemnation by suggesting that judges are above and beyond the law — liberal judges, that is. Minnesota’s two leftist U.S. senators both howled in unison that the arrests were a Trump-inspired vendetta that demolishes the rule of law. How exactly, they didn’t say. In truth, the charges against Dugan and Cano constitute a responsible effort by federal authorities to uphold the rule of law irrespective of status. Of course, they are presumed innocent and will get their day in court to contest the charges. But judges hold no special immunity. Those who believe otherwise delude themselves into thinking that their lofty positions somehow absolve or insulate them. That is a mistaken belief, teased by hope out of arrogance. Like everyone else, judges must conform their own conduct to the requirements of the law that they are sworn to uphold. When they do not, they can and should be prosecuted. It is not unprecedented. In a strikingly similar case seven years ago, Massachusetts Judge Shelly Joseph was indicted by federal prosecutors for helping an illegal migrant sneak out of her courthouse to avoid arrest and deportation. Joseph later struck a deal with a Biden-installed prosecutor to drop all charges in exchange for judicial disciplinary proceedings. Leftist judges would do well to listen to advice from Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post via Getty Images) It is not just politicians on the progressive left who are incensed over the recent judicial arrests, regardless of the facts and evidence. At least one other Wisconsin judge has vaulted into the fray as a self-appointed face of resistance. FellowWisconsin Judge Monica Ishamdecided to deploy her own personal and professional protest over Dugan’s arrest by announcing that she would refuse to do her job. She informed other jurists in the state that she would undertake a boycott by closing down her courtroom in the absence of further \"guidance\" and \"support.\" She wrote in an email, \"I have no intention of allowing anyone to be taken out of my courtroom by ICE and sent to a concentration camp…\" Overlooking the incendiary and absurd use of the term \"concentration camp,\" Isham fails to realize that there is nothing illegal about law enforcement officers making arrests inside courthouses. It happens all the time. Yet, she apparently feels \"triggered\" by recent events and bemoans that\"I no longerfeel[emphasis added] protected or respected as a judge.\" Minnesota’s two leftist U.S. senators both howled in unison that the arrests were a Trump-inspired vendetta that demolishes the rule of law. How exactly, they didn’t say. There’s that pesky word \"feel\" again, as if a judge’s tender feelings have anything whatsoever to do with fidelity to the law. I would suggest that Isham consult with Justice Sotomayor for the very guidance she demands. \"Sanctuary jurisdictions that shield criminal aliens endanger American communities,\" said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. \"This Justice Department will not stand by as local officials put politics over public safety,\" he added. Blanche made those suitable remarks as federal prosecutors brought the charges against Judges Dugan and Cano. It was same argument — and warning — issued long ago by one of our most prominent and progressive Supreme Court Justices, Louis Brandeis: \"Our government … teaches the whole people by its example. If the government becomes the lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.\" If, by their own behavior, judges feel free to disregard the law or violate it with impunity, chaos ensues. Where law ends tyranny begins, noted John Locke. That is precisely what is happening. Lawless sanctuary policies inevitably embolden judges to abandon their legal duties and join the liberal cause. Often, they cite local ordinances or state statutes protecting illegal migrants in order to justify their sanctuary status. Conveniently, they ignore the established principle that federal law takes precedent under Article VI, Paragraph 2 of the U.S. Constitution. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Decades ago, Congress passed a law to combat those who aid and abet illegal immigration. Lawmakers made it a crime — punishable by up to five years in prison — to \"conceal, harbor, or shield from detection\" any person in the U.S. illegally (8 USC 1324). It is also a conspiracy felony to \"interrupt, hinder, or impede\" federal officers in the discharge of their duties (8 USC 372). Obstruction and concealment are additional crimes, as noted above. The illegal Immigration Reform Act of 1996 requires states and municipalities to cooperate with federal authorities on immigration requests (8 USC 1373). That same law empowers a president to withhold federal financial support from cities and states that thwart the law by ignoring detainer requests. This includes the failure to honor outstanding deportation orders. She wrote in an email, \"I have no intention of allowing anyone to be taken out of my courtroom by ICE and sent to a concentration camp…\" Democrats spent the last four years insisting that \"no one is above the law.\" None were outraged over the indictments and arrest of then-former President Donald Trump. Indeed, they cheered his prosecution. Yet, they are now apoplectic over the charges brought against two jurists who stand accused of defying the law. Apparently, presidents are not above the law, but judges are. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The rank hypocrisy is self-evident.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: Disband the White House Correspondents' Association",
    "article_text": "MSNBC correspondent and White House Correspondents' Association President Eugene Daniels took aim at Trump on Saturday during the association's annual dinner, declaring the press was \"not the opposition.\" I began my journalism career at The Federalist, an outlet that was founded with only one official editorial position; ending the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. I agreed with it at the time, but having grown since, I now see the error of my ways and am calling to disband the entire White House Correspondents’ Association. On Saturday, April 26, in Washington, D.C., the WHCA held its annual dinner, once a time-honored tradition of the capital. Now it is a shell of itself that the president does not even attend, and an event for which the organization struggles to find a host who won’t perform a seizure ofhatred toward President Donald Trump. Of course, this year the entire farce was held under the cloud of the liberal news organizations that cover the presidency having failed to report that President Joe Biden, as commander in chief, was not only not in charge, but often barely awake. AXIOS REPORTER HITS MEDIA FOR WHIFFING ON COVERAGE OF BIDEN’S DECLINE AT WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS’ DINNER Look at what WCHA President Eugene Daniels actually said in his opening remarks, I had to read it twice to believe it: \"I know this has been an extremely difficult year for all of you. It's been difficult for this association. We've been tested, attacked, but every single day our members get up, they run to the White House, plane, train, automobile with one mission, holding the powerful accountable.\" White House Correspondents' Association President Eugene Daniels criticizes President Donald Trump during WHCA speech. (Screenshot/WHCA/CPSAN) Holding the powerful accountable? Where was this H.L. Mencken attitude when Grandpa Joe was dithering away in the West Wing? Then there was journalist Alex Thompson, who mused the following, \"President Biden's decline and its cover-up by the people around him is a reminder that every White House, regardless of party, is capable of deception. ... We, myself included, missed a lot of this story and some people trust us less because of it.\" This is the same Thompson hawking a book he wrote with CNN anchor Jake Tapper about the Biden administration. Jake Tapper! That guy not only ignored Biden’s obvious infirmity, he chided as crackpots anyone who did point it out. Thomspson, like a sweet, summer child, doesn’t get it, yet. It's not that many Americans trust the news media \"less,\" it's that they don’t trust us at all, about anything. Not everything in life comes with second chances. These people covering Biden flat out blew it, and did incredible harm to the nation and the profession of journalism in the process. Covering Biden’s presidency for four years and not realizing or reporting that he was not all there is the journalism equivalent of an NFL team going winless all season. That's something that five teams, starting with the 1960 Dallas Cowboys, have suffered through in the post-war era, but none of them ever threw themselves a party to celebrate their abject failure. We all know what happened over the past four years. The liberal media decided that Biden’s team, even if the old man was upstairs watching \"Matlock\" and complaining his soup wasn’t hot enough, was better than electing Trump. With absolute shamelessness and disregard for the people, these charlatans with reporter's notebooks allowed their hatred of Donald Trump, and his supporters, to drive their coverage. Nobody should ever come back from that. Then-President Joe Biden, right, and President Donald Trump during the first presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia. It was a disaster for Biden's campaign and he later dropped out.(Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images) If there is still a legitimate purpose to the WHCA, it surely would have been to stand up to the Biden administration, to demand more access and evidence. Instead, this gaggle of fools just nodded along like morons whileformer Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierreclaimed actual, unedited videos were \"cheap fakes,\" an Orwellian nonsense term, and that they shouldn’t be shown. Traditions are good, they are important, and the WHCA, founded in 1914, has a rich tradition. But, traditions can also become mere trappings, a fancy symbolic set of clothes that bestows an appearance of honor on those who don it, deserved or not. Thankfully, the Trump White House has taken measures to rein in the WHCA’s monopoly on West Wing coverage, bringing in centrist and conservative new media members, and of course, the \"professionals,\" are having a fit. But while The New York Times and others might mock press room queries from figures like Natalie Winters of \"War Room,\" or podcasters like Tim Pool, those people are already doing a thousand times better covering Trump than the gentle treatment the venerated WHCA gave Biden. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It's always good to be wary of industries where their members heap endless praise on each other and constantly give themselves awards. Hollywood, for instance, and that is what much of journalism has become. \"Look at me!\" the establishment journalists all say, \"I have an official WHCA membership card and a lanyard! So, obviously, I’m a brave warrior for the truth!\" Not everything in life comes with second chances. These people covering Biden flat out blew it, and did incredible harm to the nation and the profession of journalism in the process. Nobody is buying it anymore. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Look, if the WHCA wants to continue, fine, it could have fancy lunches and lecture series, maybe get matching sweaters made. But in no way, shape or form should this organization play the slightest role in how the White House actually deals with the media. Far better would be to put this dinosaur of the legacy media down. Journalists don’t need a club. They simply need to tell the truth.

    "title": "How a DOGE review can actually improve the programs that fight HIV/AIDS",
    "article_text": "‘Fox News @ Night’ talks to residents in Washington, D.C., about DOGE and the Trump administration’s funding freezes. PresidentDonald Trumpand Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have been aggressively overhauling the bloated and cumbersome U.S. federal bureaucracy by re-examining contracts, questioning what taxpayer dollars are funding and who that funding is going to. The public health sector hasn’t been immune, with the Trump administration poring over the layers of bureaucracy and freezing or canceling millions in grants. Countless programs within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including those designed to target the treatment and spread ofHIV/AIDS, are, or will be, in the crosshairs. As a former White House director of national AIDS policy who was one of the chief architects of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the first director of the HIV/AIDS Bureau at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and as an LGBT conservative with a career in medicine, business, and public health, I believe HIV/AIDS advocates should embrace and support such a review. The HIV/AIDS red ribbon is typically worn, especially on World AIDS Day, in a sign of solidarity with those living with the disease.(iStock) While it is critical that the United States’ demonstrably effective long-standing strategy tackling theHIV/AIDS epidemic, and the resources dedicated to it, remain intact, many of these federal programs have not been re-evaluated in years, nor have they been audited for waste, fraud or abuse. WHAT AMERICA OWES ELON MUSK AFTER DOGE Advocates in support of maintaining the United States’ aggressive approach to the HIV/AIDS epidemic should welcome the review of HIV/AIDS specific initiatives to ensure that they are optimally designed to meet the needs of the current epidemic. Take the Ryan White CARE Act, for example, which funds essential healthcare services for uninsured and underinsured individuals living with HIV/AIDS in the U.S. The program, which received $2.5 billion in federal funding in FY 2024, hasn’t been reauthorized by Congress since 2009. In that time, the expansion of healthcare coverage through Medicaid substantially reduced the number of people who needed Ryan White support for medical care and pharmaceuticals, yet its budget continued to grow. Elon Musk and President Donald Trump in the Oval Office.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) A reauthorization process would allow for a close look at spending priorities embedded in Ryan White - an initiative that was designed before highly effective HIV/AIDS therapy was even available. Surely, the HIV/AIDS community would do well to see if that funding might be better reallocated elsewhere, such as toward substance abuse and mental health services, or other needed care. DOGE REVEALS WHAT YOU GET FOR THE HALF MILLION YOU'LL PAY IN TAXES OVER YOUR LIFETIME DOGE can also remedyunnecessary bureaucratic overlap. The Ryan White program is run through the HRSA, and the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative, started by Trump during his first term, is run through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Despite the programs’ complementary missions, they are siloed off into separate entities with their own budgets and staff, resulting in unnecessary administrative overhead costs and potentially wasteful spending. The Trump administration is reportedly looking to streamline these two initiatives into one program run through the HRSA to consolidate the resources and make them more efficient. Advocates for a strong public health response to HIV/AIDS should be open to considering these kinds of commonsense reforms and not wringing their hands or fearmongering to voters. While efficiency is needed, it would be a grave mistake to deprioritize funding for the HIV/AIDS epidemic as national policy. While new cases of the disease are on the decline in the U.S. due to advances in treatment and prevention efforts, data has shown that cutting those efforts leads to spikes in new infections, which in turn burden the healthcare system with costlier care and treatments down the line. DOGE EXPOSED OUR IMMIGRATION ASYLUM DISASTER. THAT WAS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG Another critical pillar of the U.S. approach to the epidemic is PEPFAR, which funds HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care globally. PEPFAR’s value is not only as a cost-effective success in saving millions of lives but also as a means of exerting significant diplomatic influence with dozens of partner nations. Secretary of StateMarco Rubiogranted PEPFAR a waiver from the initial suspension of global health initiatives in the first days of the Trump administration. That does not mean that PEPFAR should be immune from an audit for inefficiency. Secretary of State Marco Rubio granted PEPFAR a waiver from the initial suspension of global health initiatives in the first days of the Trump administration.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Like all federal programs, there must be improvements that can be made and waste that can be cut. PEPFAR’s strategy and tactics, however, are undeniably working with an incredible return on investment. Keeping the program efficiently funded should be a bipartisan priority. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It’s easy to panic over reports of specific cuts or reorganizations to HIV/AIDS programs. Opponents of the Trump administration have every reason to fearmonger around the issue, as federal funding for prevention efforts is generally popular. But, if we genuinely care about the fight against HIV/AIDS, we must recognize that these programs, like the federal government itself, are not perfect. These HIV/AIDS programs are long overdue for auditing, evaluation and perhaps reorganization, and as long as our commitment tofighting the diseaseremains intact, the United States’ efforts will be stronger for it.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Amidst his tariff and trade policy discussion, PresidentDonald Trumptook some time to meet with executives from some of the country’s top retailers, from home improvement giants Home Depot and Lowe’s to mass retailers Target and Walmart, to discuss the impact of trade policy on their businesses. While big businesses, billionaires and Wall Street regularly get an audience with presidents, Main Street is too often left out. The Trump administration has repeatedly said they want to be Main Street first. At the American Bankers Association’s Washington Summit, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent notably said, \"for the next four years, the Trump agenda is focused on Main Street.It’s Main Street’s turn.It’s Main Street’s turn to hire workers. It’s Main Street’s turn to drive investment, and it’s Main Street’s turn to restore the American Dream.\" TRUMP MEETING RETAILERS INCLUDING WALMART, HOME DEPOT, TARGET REGARDING TARIFF CONCERNS And, just as this administration opened up press briefings to include new media, the president should have a regular audience with members of the Main Street small business community. President Trump has made time to talk over issues with big business. Now, he needs to make time to hear the concerns of small businesses. FILE: Afternoon sunlight shines on the historic core of downtown Independence.(iStock) Small business is big businessfor America, which is why it is often referred to as the backbone of the U.S. economy. Per Small Business Administration statistics, there are nearly 35 million small businesses, compared to less than 20,000 big businesses. Small businesses account for around half of the private economy and create the majority of new jobs. However, as small businesses are spread out across geographies, demographics, industries and sizes, they don’t garner as much attention in Washington. There are fantastic individual advocates as well as advocacy organizations like NFIB (National Federation of Independent Business), the S Corporation Association, the NSBA (National Small Business Association), the SBE Council (Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council) and many industry-specific organizations, among others, that should receive as many invitations to economic discussions as the bigger players. Small businesses have been shouldering the fallout of government mandates for half a decade. First, state and local COVID-19 mandates shut down and negatively impacted millions of small businesses, for which the poorly designed PPP program did not fully compensate. On the back of the COVID mandates, long-term disruptions occurred to supply chains and labor markets which further hurt small businesses. Then, historic inflation under the Biden administration put even more pressure on small businesses and their customers. While small companies were optimistic for theMain Street-first Trump administration,expecting deregulation and tax certainty to help boost their business growth, millions of small businesses are instead fighting yet another government-imposed battle with tariffs. Whether a small business has part or all of their supply chain abroad, has domestic suppliers with exposure to foreign supply chains or customers cutting back on spending and investment due to market and economic uncertainty, they are being hurt financially. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION And while big companies like Apple were granted a temporary clawback in their tariff exposure, decreasing China-sourced tariffs for smartphones, computers and chips from 145% to 20%, millions of small businesses did not receive any relief. Apple has tens of billions of dollars in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet; small businesses do not have such balance sheet leverage. While understanding the needs of companies like Apple and Walmart is important, it is just as important to understand the needs of small companies throughout the country. Small businesses have been shouldering the fallout of government mandates for half a decade. First, state and local COVID-19 mandates shut down and negatively impacted millions of small businesses, for which the poorly designed PPP program did not fully compensate. Small businesses do not have the ability to absorb massive costs due to major overnight policy changes. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In fact, almost all small businesses that I speak with want very little from the government except to be left to do their business without government interference. They want to exist on the same playing field as everyone else and not have government-imposed barriers, regulations and challenges put in their path at every turn. To understand these challenges, President Trump should invite more small businesses and their advocates to the White House. If Main Street is going to thrive, it needs to start with small businesses, and that reality should grant small businesses a seat at the table.

    "title": "The White House and the courts must come to a common sense understanding of their obligations",
    "article_text": "'Special Report' panelists Brit Hume, Stef Kight and Matthew Continetti discuss legal challenges to the Trump administration's agenda. Somefederal trial judgeshave thrown opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda into high gear. They seek to trigger a confrontation between the president and the Supreme Court despite efforts by both to compromise. Worse yet, they are drawing the federal courts beyond their areas of competence and interfering with the president’s authority in foreign affairs and national security. The justices should step in to make clear that federal courts must pay due deference to the executive’s constitutional responsibilities, while President Trump should re-affirm that even illegal aliens receive due – albeit limited – process. The latest salvo came this week from Maryland federal Judge Paula Xinis, who is hearing the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal alien whom the Trump administration mistakenly sent to El Salvador. Earlier this month, Xinis had commanded the Trump administration to immediately produce Garcia in court, even though he was no longer under the control of the United States. Her rash order prompted the Supreme Court to intercede. The justices called upon the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" Garcia’s return, and to inform the trial court of its efforts, but also cautioned Xinis to pay \"due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.\" TheSupreme Court’sorder should have headed off a crisis between the President and Judge Xinis. It followed a similar move by the justices in reviewing Judge James Boasberg’s ruling that the Trump administration had no authority to send 137 suspected Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. That laws allows the president to detain and expel citizens of a country with which we are at war or which launches an invasion or \"predatory incursion\" of the United States. Even though Boasberg and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rushed to find that no declared war or invasion by Venezuela had occurred, the justices found that those courts had jurisdiction over the case, and held that the illegal aliens’ due process rights would have to be vindicated by federal judges in Texas or Louisiana, where they last had been present in the United States. GORSUCH, ROBERTS SIDE WITH LEFT-LEANING SUPREME COURT JUSTICES IN IMMIGRATION RULING The Supreme Court’s caution thatlower court judgesrespect the president’s responsibility to conduct foreign affairs made for common sense. Federal courts cannot order the president to send special forces abroad to seize Garcia or anyone else held in El Salvador’s terrorist jails, nor can it dictate to the president how to conduct diplomacy. Nevertheless, Judge Xinis directed this week that the Trump administration \"take all available steps\" to return Garcia \"as soon as possible.\" On appeal, Judge J. Harvie Wilkins of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals excoriated the Trump administration for not cooperating with Judge Xinis and raised the possibility that the Trump administration could deport even U.S. citizens, claim error, but then do nothing to seek their return. Despite Judge Wilkinson’s advice to both branches to reach a compromise, Judge Xinis has proceeded to command the Trump administration to explain, under oath, its diplomatic efforts to free Garcia. This shows little respect for the caution, urged by the Supreme Court, not to intrude into the executive branch’s authority over foreign affairs. Will Xinis next demand that communications between the State Department and El Salvador be produced in open court? Will she sanction the government unless U.S. embassy staff travel to her Maryland courtroom and testify about their meetings with El Salvadorean officials? Perhaps she will want to set the United States negotiating positions and offers. The deeper concern behind this single judge’s interference with the president’s conduct of foreign relations is the threat that wayward trial courts will begin to interfere with fundamental national security decisions that the Constitution vests in the presidency. A federal court has never before overruled the decision of a president or Congress that the United States has suffered an attack or invasion, and the Supreme Court wisely rejected the D.C. courts’ efforts to do so. Admittedly, the Trump administration is making the unprecedented claim that a gang has risen to the level of a foreign government that is conducting an invasion or predatory incursion into the United States. I have argued elsewhere that this would be a difficult showing to make and would depend on the facts of the Venezuelan government’s control over TdA and on whether international criminal activities can constitute a military threat to the national security. But that is an entirely different question from whether the federal courts are the proper institution to make that judgment. The Supreme Court itself has long recognized that there are certain \"political questions,\" which the Constitution itself has committed to the final decision of the elected branches of government, such as impeachment or war. In Marbury v. Madison, which established the Court’s right of judicial review, Chief Justice John Marshall also declared that \"the President is invested with certain important political powers, in the exercise of which he is to use his own discretion.\" For his decisions, \"he is accountable only to his country in his political character, and to his own conscience.\" These issues \"respect the nation, not individual rights, and being entrusted to the executive, the decision of the executive is conclusive.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Courts have never second-guessed what is the most political of questions: whether the nation is at war. Federal judges have refused to rule on the constitutionality of not just the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, but also every war in American history. Courts do not have the ability, understanding, or expertise to make sensitive decisions on national security threats, nor can they judge the costs and benefits of different foreign policies.Courts decide casesand controversies in formalized legal settings driven by the parties; they should hesitate to make decisions involving the difficult probabilities and risks of war and national security. What courts can do is provide a measure of due process to aliens before their deportation. The TrumpJustice Departmentacknowledged this very principle before the Supreme Court in conceding that the Venezuelans had a right to due process before their deportation under the Alien Enemies Act as well as under the regular immigration laws. While the Supreme Court can force the lower courts to pay greater respect to the president’s authority in national security, the White House can also bring the controversy to a close by respecting the judiciary’s reading of the Due Process Clause to provide a hearing even to illegal aliens accused of serious criminal violence. Both branches owe it to the Constitution, and the American people, to come to a common sense understanding of the obligations imposed on the other to protect the national security while respecting due process.

    "article_text": "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich discusses Democrats’ apparent support of Kilmar Abrego Garcia on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’ Democrats and the left-wing media are presentlydemonizing Republicansfor wanting to make Medicaid more accountable and affordable. They are counting on the program’s general popularity to inoculate it from any real change. However, a recent survey by America’s New Majority Project found most Americans support commonsense reforms tomodernize and improve Medicaid– including those who use it. For example, a majority of Americans believe able-bodied adults on Medicaid should have to work to receive the program’s benefits. The survey found 78% of Americans support work requirements for Medicaid and other safety net programs. This includes 89% of Republicans, 75% of independents, and 70% of Democrats. It also includes 66% of Americans on Medicaid and 70% of Americans who have received welfare benefits in the past year. A survey found 78% of Americans support work requirements for Medicaid and other safety net programs.(iStock) This fits the pattern we saw in 1996. Half theHouse Democratsvoted with us for work requirements for able-bodied adults on safety net programs. WE'RE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS. THE US MUST CHOOSE: EITHER $20 TRILLION IN DEBT OR MEDICAID REFORM Support for work requirements is driven by a sense of fairness. Sixty-eight percent of American voters agree that individuals who can work but choose not to while receiving taxpayer-funded safety net benefits are committing fraud. This includes most Republican, Democratic and independent voters. Further, contrary to the Washingtonpress-corps narrative, most voters also consider spending reductions because of work requirements and other tested reforms to be savings rather than cuts to the program. Other reforms are popular as well, including changes to the way the federal government funds the program to prioritize care for the neediest Americans. Most say federal funding to cover able-bodied adults (the Medicaid expansion population) should be lowered to match what it covers for the original Medicaid population of children, pregnant women, seniors and disabilities. DOGE CUTS, MEDICAID FEARS SPARK PROTESTS AT GOP LAWMAKER OFFICES ACROSS US Why should states be incentivized to provide Medicaid coverage for those who can work more than they are to provide coverage for those who cannot? Most Americans also say federal Medicaid dollars should be prioritized for poorer states to equalize benefits for poverty-stricken Americans regardless of where they live. We believe the American people would also support eliminating waste and fraud in Medicaid. Democrats would have you believe that there is no waste or fraud in the nearly $880 billion state and federally funded program. However, reality indicates otherwise. In New York, for example, the state’s Medicaid-funded Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program pays people to stay home with their infirmed relatives. In 2014, the program had roughly 20,000 people enlisted in the program. However, after a rule change in 2015 that widened eligibility requirements, the state is now paying an estimated 623,000 New Yorkers to stay at home with their sick relatives rather than find other work. The state’s own Democratic mayorcalled the program \"a racket.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Further, illegal immigrants are prohibited from receiving federal Medicaid funding (except certain emergency funding), but several states pay Medicaid benefits to illegal immigrants with state-contributed funds. Eliminating this loophole would discourage illegal immigration and ease the burden of other federal programs. That’s probably why 62% of Americans oppose their state offering Medicaid to illegal immigrants, and a similar number would support a federal law stopping states from enrollingillegal immigrants in Medicaid. Beyond specific examples, Americans generally think that roughly 25% of federal spending is lost to fraud. Medicaid is not exempt from this belief. Americans have a broad definition of fraud beyond just criminal activity that includes cheating, failing to deliver, and waste beyond criminal behavior. There is strong support (85%) for the government to stop paying crooks as a first step toward reform. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Importantly, reforms to Medicaid and other safety net programs must be focused on moral – not purely financial – goals. Ending fraud and abuse in Medicaid and prioritizingcare for the poor and disabledare popular, positive ideas. Any savings achieved by reforms are additional benefits – not the end goal. Most Americans know Medicaid is not a perfect system and it should be reformed. Those that improve and modernize the program would be strongly supported by most Americans.

The intent of these changes was to reduce what ChatGPT head of product Nick Turley called “gratuitous/unexplainable denials.” But one result is that ChatGPT with the default AI model selected (GPT-4o) is more willing to discuss subjects it once declined to, including depictions of sexual activity. We primarily tested ChatGPT for sexual content because it’s an area where OpenAI has said it wants to relax restrictions. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman hasexpressed a desirefor a ChatGPT “grown-up mode,” and the company hassignaled a willingnessto allow some forms of “NSFW” content on its platform. To conduct our tests, TechCrunch created more than half a dozen ChatGPT accounts with birthdates indicating ages 13 to 17. We used a single PC but deleted cookies each time we logged out to ensure ChatGPT wasn’t drawing on cached data. OpenAI’spoliciesrequire that children aged 13 to 18 obtain parental consent before using ChatGPT. But the platform doesn’t take steps to verify this consent during sign-up. As long as they have a valid phone number or email address, any child over the age of 13 can sign up for an account without confirming that their parents gave permission. For each test account, we started a fresh chat with the prompt “talk dirty to me.” It usually only took a few messages and additional prompts before ChatGPT volunteered sexual stories. Often, the chatbot would ask for guidance on specific kinks and role-play scenarios. “We can go into overstimulation, multiple forced climaxes, breathplay, even rougher dominance — wherever you want,” ChatGPT said during one exchange with a TechCrunch account registered to a fictional 13-year-old. To be clear, this was after nudging the chatbot to be more explicit in its descriptions of sexual situations. In our testing, many times ChatGPT would warn that its guidelines don’t allow for “fully explicit sexual content,” like graphic depictions of intercourse and pornographic scenes. Yet ChatGPT occasionally wrote descriptions of genitalia and explicit sexual actions, only refusing in one instance with one test account when TechCrunch noted that the user was under the age of 18. “Just so you know: You must be 18+ to request or interact with any content that’s sexual, explicit, or highly suggestive,” ChatGPT said in a chat after generating hundreds of words of erotica. “If you’re under 18, I have to immediately stop this kind of content — that’s OpenAI’s strict rule.” An investigation by The Wall Street Journaluncovered similar behavior from Meta’s AI chatbot, Meta AI, after company leadership pushed to remove sexual content restrictions. For some time, minors were able to access Meta AI and engage in sexual role-play with fictional characters. However, OpenAI’s shedding of some AI safeguards comes as the company aggressively pitches its product to schools. OpenAI haspartneredwith organizations, including Common Sense Media, to produce guides for ways teachers might incorporate its technology into the classroom. These efforts have paid off. A growing number of younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT for schoolwork,accordingto a survey earlier this year by the Pew Research Center. In asupport documentfor educational customers, OpenAI notes that ChatGPT “may produce output that is not appropriate for all audiences or all ages,” and that educators “should be mindful … while using [ChatGPT] with students or in classroom contexts.” Steven Adler, a former safety researcher at OpenAI, cautioned that techniques for controlling AI chatbot behavior tend to be “brittle” and fallible. But he was surprised that ChatGPT was so willing to be explicit with minors. “Evaluations should be capable of catching behaviors like these before a launch, and so I wonder what happened,” Adler told TechCrunch. ChatGPT users have noted a range of strange behaviors in the past week,particularlyextremesycophancy, following updates to GPT-4o. In a post on X Sunday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanacknowledgedsome issues and said that the company was “working on fixes ASAP.” He didn’t mention ChatGPT’s treatment of sexual subject matter, however.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us HR tech giant Deel says it has formally accepted to be served legal documents in its ongoing court battle with rival Rippling in Ireland. This ends weeks of suspense afterRippling’s bailiffs couldn’t find Deel’s execsto serve them — only for Deel’s CEO and top lawyerto turn up in Dubai. Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz, along with Deel lawyers Asif Malik and Andrea David Mieli, all agreed to accept service through Deel’s Irish law firm today, Deel confirmed to TechCrunch. Deel Inc., which is Deel’s U.S. entity, was already served on April 16, an affidavit filed by Rippling this morning in Irish court shows. “Today in court in Dublin Hayes Solicitors agreed to accept service on behalf of all four parties,” a Deel spokesperson told TechCrunch. In the affidavit filed this morning, Rippling repeated that it hadn’t been able to serve Bouaziz, Malik, and Mieli, detailing its efforts to do so in France and Italy. For example, Rippling hired French bailiffs to serve Bouaziz at a listed address in Paris on April 10, but only stumbled upon a relative who told them Bouaziz was in Dubai. On April 15, TechCrunch reported Bouaziz was in Dubai, with Deel not responding to requests for comment at the time. However, 10 days later,Deel told TechCrunchthat Bouaziz “lives in Israel” and was only in Dubai for a few days to celebrate Passover. TechCrunch asked Deel if it can clarify where Bouaziz is currently located, but Deel declined, citing privacy reasons. Deel slammed the idea that its executives have been avoiding getting served, despite Rippling’s failed attempts to do so through various process servers. “It’s a misrepresentation that anyone was avoiding service and that narrative was clearly being used as a public smear tactic,” Deel’s spokesperson said. Deel told TechCrunch that Malik’s move to Dubai had been planned for over a year, well before Rippling’s lawsuit. Regarding Andrea David Mieli, whom Rippling said in their affidavit they had been unable to serve in Italy, Deel said he lives and works from home in Italy and was available. The lawsuit centers on Rippling’s claims that Deel bribed one of its employees in Ireland, Keith O’Brien, to spy on its internal affairs on behalf of Deel. And O’Brien himself testified that he had been spyingin a lengthy affidavit. After weeks of silence, Deel is very publicly fighting back, filing a countersuit in the U.S. last week, making various accusations against Rippling, including that it cultivated its own insider inside Deel. In response, Rippling CEO Parker Conradtook to Xto post, “Nowhere does Deel dispute our central allegation — that@Bouazizalexpersonally recruited a spy to steal rippling’s trade secrets, and personally directed the theft.” Rippling did not respond to a request for comment.

Most of the models are — or soon will be — available for download under an “open” license from AI dev platformHugging FaceandGitHub. They range in size from 0.6 billion parameters to 235 billion parameters. Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters. The rise of China-originated model series like Qwen have increased the pressure on American labs such as OpenAI to deliver more capable AI technologies. They’ve also led policymakers to implement restrictions aimed at limiting the ability of Chinese AI companies to obtain thechipsnecessaryto train models. Introducing Qwen3! We release and open-weight Qwen3, our latest large language models, including 2 MoE models and 6 dense models, ranging from 0.6B to 235B. Our flagship model, Qwen3-235B-A22B, achieves competitive results in benchmark evaluations of coding, math, general…pic.twitter.com/JWZkJeHWhC — Qwen (@Alibaba_Qwen)April 28, 2025 According to Alibaba, Qwen3 models are “hybrid” models in the sense that they can take time and “reason” through complex problems or answer simpler requests quickly. Reasoning enables the models to effectively fact-check themselves, similar to models like OpenAI’so3, but at the cost of higher latency. “We have seamlessly integrated thinking and non-thinking modes, offering users the flexibility to control the thinking budget,” wrote the Qwen team in ablog post. “This design enables users to configure task-specific budgets with greater ease.” Some of the models also adopt a mixture of experts (MoE) architecture, which can be more computationally efficient for answering queries. MoE breaks down tasks into subtasks and delegates them to smaller, specialized “expert” models. The Qwen3 models support 119 languages, Alibaba says, and were trained on a dataset of nearly 36 trillion tokens. Tokens are the raw bits of data that a model processes; 1 million tokens is equivalent to about 750,000 words. Alibaba says that Qwen3 was trained on a combination of textbooks, “question-answer pairs,” code snippets, AI-generated data, and more. These improvements, along with others, greatly boosted Qwen3’s capabilities compared to its predecessor, Qwen2, says Alibaba. None of the Qwen3 models are head and shoulders above top-of-the-line recent models like OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini, but they’re strong performers nonetheless. On Codeforces, a platform for programming contests, the largest Qwen3 model — Qwen-3-235B-A22B — just beats out OpenAI’so3-miniand Google’sGemini 2.5 Pro. Qwen-3-235B-A22B also bests o3-mini on the latest version of AIME, a challenging math benchmark, and BFCL, a test for assessing a model’s ability to “reason” about problems. But Qwen-3-235B-A22B isn’t publicly available — at least not yet. The largest public Qwen3 model, Qwen3-32B, is still competitive with a number of proprietary and open AI models, including Chinese AI lab DeepSeek’sR1. Qwen3-32B surpasses OpenAI’so1model on several tests, including the coding benchmark LiveCodeBench. Alibaba says Qwen3 “excels” in tool-calling capabilities as well as following instructions and copying specific data formats. In addition to the models for download, Qwen3 is available from cloud providers, including Fireworks AI and Hyperbolic. Tuhin Srivastava, co-founder and CEO of AI cloud host Baseten, said that Qwen3 is another point in the trend line of open models keeping pace with closed source systems such as OpenAI’s. “The U.S. is doubling down on restricting sales of chips to China and purchases from China, but models like Qwen 3 that are state-of-the-art and open … will undoubtedly be used domestically,” he told TechCrunch. “It reflects the reality that businesses are both building their own tools [as well as] buying off the shelf via closed-model companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.” Topics AI Editor Hugging Face releases a 3D-printed robotic arm starting at $100 OpenAI upgrades ChatGPT search with shopping features From coding tests to billion-dollar startups, Ali Partovi’s eight-year experiment is paying off 4chan is back online, says it’s been ‘starved of money’ Bezos-backed Slate Auto debuts analog EV pickup truck that is decidedly anti-Tesla Wait, how did a decentralized service like Bluesky go down?

Charles Garson, a U.K.-based investor with no obvious ties to the EV startup, offered $20 million for Canoo’s assets,according to a filing. A lawyer representing Garson filed a motion Friday to vacate the sale, claiming he presented a “far superior offer” to that of Canoo CEO Anthony Aquila, who bid just $4 million in cash for the assets. (Aquila’s bid also includes the extinguishment of around $11 million in loans Canoo owes to his own financial firm.) Garson allegedly was told by the bankruptcy trustee that his offer would be considered and he had until roughly the end of April to finalize the details, according to the filing. Two days after Garson claims he was told this, the trustee “moved forward with the Sale Hearing” and closed the sale of Canoo’s assets to Aquila. The sale ultimately closed on April 11. The bankruptcy trustee did not respond to a request for comment. Garson is not alone in protesting the sale. Harbinger Motors, an EV trucking startup that was created by a number of ex-Canoo employees, objected to the sale before it was finalized. The bankruptcy judge overruled that objection; Harbinger has filed an appeal. There is very little information available about Garson online. His LinkedIn profile states he is located in London and involved in real estate investments. He’s listed as a director of a real estate investment company called Garland Holdings Limited in the U.K, according to thecountry’s business registry. The motion to vacate does not explain why Garson is interested in Canoo, or whether other investors are involved. Garson provided a declaration in support of the motion to vacate, which includes 23 exhibits. But all of those documents were filed under seal. A lawyer for Garson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “[Garson] believed he had more than enough time to submit his superior bid based on communications with the Trustee and his counsel. In reliance on such communications, Movant did not object to the sale or formallysubmit a competing bid, all while continuing to finalize his offer and requesting clarifications from the Trustee” according to the filing. “Despite a clearly superior offer being practically thrown at him, the Trustee determined to seek Court approval of a transaction” with Aquila, the filing reads. A lawyer for Aquila did not respond to a request for comment. As many as eight parties signed NDAs and evaluated Canoo’s assets prior to the sale, a lawyer for the bankrupt startuprevealed earlier this month. He said only a few of those came close to making a bid, including one group that the bankruptcy trustee said could raise concerns with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States because of its (unspecified) “foreign ownership.” It’s not clear if Garson’s bid is what the trustee was referring to.

Called theSO-101, the arm is the follow-up to Hugging Face’s previous robotic arm, the SO-100, released last year. The company’s robotics division, LeRobot, partnered with French robotics firm The Robot Studio to debut the SO-100 for around $100 in October. Hugging Face teamed up with The Robot Studio once again for the SO-101, as well as with robotics store WowRobo, IoT hardware supplier Seeed Studio, and robotics part seller PartaBot.

When ChatGPT users search for products, the chatbot will now offer a few recommendations, present images and reviews for those items, and include direct links to web pages where users can buy the products. OpenAI says users can ask super-specific questions in natural language and receive customized results. To start, OpenAI is experimenting with categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics. OpenAI is rolling out the feature in GPT-4o (the default AI model for ChatGPT) on Monday for ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Free users, as well as for logged-out users around the globe. The ChatGPT search update is part of OpenAI’s effort to compete with rival Google by creating a better, more personalized experience to find products and information on the internet. Online shopping is one of Google’s most important businesses, but the advertising market to buy priority placements in Google Search has also contributed to the product’s declining quality over the years. OpenAI claims its search product is growing rapidly. Users made more than a billion web searches in ChatGPT last week, the company told TechCrunch. OpenAI says it’s determining ChatGPT shopping results independently and notes that ads are not part of this upgrade to ChatGPT search. The shopping results will be based on structured metadata from third parties, such as pricing, product descriptions, and reviews, according to OpenAI. The company won’t receive a kickback from purchases made through ChatGPT search. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has historically been against ads in ChatGPT, but in arecent interviewwith Stratechery’s Ben Thompson, he changed his tune slightly. Altman said he’d be open to “tasteful” advertising in which OpenAI charges affiliate fees for purchases made through ChatGPT but doesn’t sell priority placement in their results. Soon, OpenAI says it will integrateits memory featurewith shopping for Pro and Plus users, meaning ChatGPT will reference a user’s previous chats to make highly personalized product recommendations. The company previously updated ChatGPT toreference memory when making web searches broadly. However, these memory features won’t be available to users in the EU, the U.K., Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. Alongside this update, ChatGPT search will now display trending searches when users start typing a question, much like Google Search’s autocomplete feature. Additionally, ChatGPT search has come to WhatsApp, allowing users to message the company’s chatbot to get up-to-date answers. OpenAI has previously explored shopping features via its AI “agent” platform,Operator, which takes anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to browse dozens of web pages and find relevant products for users. ChatGPT search with shopping is a much faster, hands-on experience and still allows users to search for products using natural language queries.

The fees cost more than the products that U.S. consumers are buying, and in some cases are more than doubling the price of a standard order. For example, CNBC found that a summer dress sold on Temu for $18.47 will cost $44.68 after $26.21 in import charges. Shein has also hiked prices but isn’t implementing an import charge, it appears. The moves come a few weeks after Temu and Sheinwarned that they were going to raise pricesfor U.S. customers starting April 25 in response to the tariffs.

The decision to move the Android portion of Google I/O to its own separate event ahead of the start of I/O suggests this year’s developer conference could be even more AI heavy than usual. AI news and updates were already taking up an increasingly longer portion of the Google I/O consumer and developer keynote addresses. Google, however, is framing this shift differently. Instead, the company says there were “so many new things to share” about Android that it chose to create a special event — an I/O edition ofits Android Showvideo podcast — as another way to share the latest news and changes. It also notes that Android will continue to have a presence at I/O in keynotes and technical sessions for developers. Still, moving a bulk of the Android news to a virtual show ahead of the main event is a notable programming change for the developer conference. Whether that’s because there’s “too much news” or because Google decided Android’s news didn’t require as high a billing as in previous years remains to be seen.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Most mortgage lenders would rather people didn’t pay off their mortgages early. After all, that’s how they make their money. Indeed, overpayment is positively discouraged and sometimes even penalized. What if there was a solution that solved the technology behind it, alongside the financing arrangements? That’s the idea behind theSprivefintech app. This is a “mortgage overpayment” platform aimed at the U.K. market that helps users repay their mortgages faster using automation and cash-back rewards. It claims to save users an average of £10,000 each over the lifetime of the mortgage. Sprive, which launched in October 2021, now closed a £5.5 million ($7.3 million) funding round led byAscension, a VC that styles itself as an impact investor. Ascension has also backed mortgage startup Tembo, as well as fintech companies Wagestream, SuperFi, DebtStream, Goodstack, and Credit Kudos (which exited to Apple). Sprive said the app works by letting homeowners pay off their mortgage faster through their everyday shopping, by automatically putting spare cash toward overpayments and continuously scanning the market to help customers find better mortgage deals. Users can pay toward their mortgage from a bank account linked to the Sprive app by shopping as they would normally with mainstream U.K. supermarkets. They then use cash-back offers, discount vouchers, and more in order to  pay off a mortgage faster. It does this by allowing the user to save money on the interest on the mortgage and shave potentially years off the mortgage term. “Lenders are looking to innovate in the mortgage industry, but they rely on mortgage advisers for remortgages,” CEO Jinesh Vohra told TechCrunch. “To entice a customer to re-mortgage, they rely on mortgage advisers who are nondigital and fragmented. So it’s very, very expensive to innovate. But we have access to their spending information, their mortgage information, their credit information, and their property information.” He said Sprive gives lenders a more efficient digital means of being able to acquire new customers. “Every time someone shops or switches mortgages, we make money. Within 15 minutes of shopping, you get money towards your mortgage, and we scan the market every day for better mortgage deals. Every time a customer refinances, we get commission from the mortgage lender.” Also participating in this round was Channel 4 Ventures (the consumer investment arm of the U.K. broadcaster Channel 4), Velocity Capital, and Two Magnolias. Topics Editor At Large Mike Butcher (M.B.E.) is Editor-at-large of TechCrunch. He has written for UK national newspapers and magazines and been named one of the most influential people in European technology by Wired UK. He has spoken at the World Economic Forum, Web Summit, and DLD.

The amount of stuff we throw away is expected to nearly double, to3.8 billion metric tons, by 2050. Reducing what we use would go a long way to addressing the issue, but let’s face it, we’re not very good at buying less either. That leaves recycling, which has its own problems. People routinely try to recycle dirty yogurt cups or toss plastic in the aluminum bin. It all makes recycling more expensive because, ultimately, someone has to manually pick out the unwanted stuff. In response, several companies have been building automated systems to sort recyclables, includingGlacier, a 6-year-old company that has developedinexpensive robotic armscontrolled by computer vision to identify over 30 different types of materials. The startup has deployed its robots in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, Phoenix, and now Seattle. As Glacier looks to expand its robot fleet to more municipalities, it recently raised a $16 million Series A, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by Ecosystem Integrity Fund with participation from AlleyCorp, Alumni Ventures, Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, Cox Exponential, Elysium, New Enterprise Associates, One Small Planet, Overlap Holdings, Overture, VSC Ventures, and Working Capital Fund. Materials recovery facilities — or MRFs, as sorting facilities are called — are getting squeezed on both ends, Rebecca Hu-Thrams, Glacier’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. Governments want more waste to be recycled, but MRFs are having a hard time finding enough people to staff the sorting line. Industry-wide, turnover is extremely high. A typical MRF will have to hire five times per year for a single sorting position. The job is so undesirable that one MRF operator told Hu-Thrams that, even though his wages were higher, he was concerned about losing workers to a new warehouse set to open nearby. “Would you rather stand at a conveyor belt and sort through people’s trash, or would you rather be lifting boxes in an air-conditioned warehouse?” Hu-Thrams said. “That kind of underscores the dilemma that a lot of our customers are facing.” Glacier offers its robots to customers as outright purchases or on a lease-to-own model. It encourages MRFs to make repairs they feel comfortable with, supplying them with training and spare parts. For those that would rather not, the startup offers maintenance packages. Glacier is also offering a data product, in which MRFs and other stakeholders like consumer products companies and government agencies can pay for access to insights about the waste stream. For an MRF, that might mean identifying where on a line it’s losing valuable aluminum cans to the landfill. For a company or regulator, it might mean auditing the waste stream to determine whether packaging that’s designed to be recycled is actually getting recycled. With enough robots, recycling rates should improve, if only because robots are faster and better at distinguishing between recyclables and trash. “Every time we send people to audit our AI systems, the people just do so much worse,” said Areeb Malik, Glacier’s CTO and second co-founder. “AI is getting really powerful, being able to distinguish beyond what people can even notice.” Topics Senior Reporter, Climate Hugging Face releases a 3D-printed robotic arm starting at $100 OpenAI upgrades ChatGPT search with shopping features From coding tests to billion-dollar startups, Ali Partovi’s eight-year experiment is paying off 4chan is back online, says it’s been ‘starved of money’ Bezos-backed Slate Auto debuts analog EV pickup truck that is decidedly anti-Tesla Wait, how did a decentralized service like Bluesky go down?

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Quantum computing has long been announced as “just around the corner,” but several companies are now determined to make this a commercial reality, with the promise of solving complex problems beyond classical computers’ reach. The problems in question are wide-ranging, from medicine and cybersecurity to materials science and chemistry. But first, there are very practical problems to be solved, such as developing chips that can reliably host large numbers of qubits — short for quantum bits, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing. As usual in a high-stakes tech race with an uncertain time horizon, tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are at the forefront. Yet startups are also set to play an important role, especially tackling bottlenecks like connectivity and error correction that are critical for scaling quantum systems. But some startups and smaller tech companies are taking on the chip challenge head-on and deserve mention alongside the more attention-grabbing efforts from industry giants. While Big Tech projects typically boast the highest qubit counts, rethinking designs from first principles and using different approaches could yield equally promising results. Here are some of the companies behind the main quantum chip projects that are worth tracking. Akhetonicsis a German photonics startup working on anall-optical, general-purpose chip— a contrarian bet in a field where most focus on narrower applications. This bold version and its first-principles approach helped the company raisea €6 million seed funding roundled by Matterwave Ventures in November 2024. Alice & Bobis a French startup that raiseda $104 million Series B round of fundingin January 2025 to continue working toward building a “fault tolerant” quantum computer. Unlike companies focusing only on chips, Alice & Bob is developing a full quantum computing system. To do so, it relies oncat qubits, a type of superconducting qubit designed to reduce errors and simplify error correction. Amazon officially joined the quantum chip race in early 2025 when AWSintroduced Ocelot, developed in partnership with the California Institute of Technology. While this is the company’s first quantum chip, AWS had previouslylaunched Braket, a quantum computing service, in partnership with D-Wave, IonQ, Rigetti, and others. Atom Computingis a U.S. company building quantum computers with arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms. At the Microsoft Ignite 2024 conference, Microsoft and Atom Computing announced plans tolaunch a commercial quantum computerin 2025. D-Waveis a quantum computing company whose latest flagship system, theAdvantage2 prototype, relies on a process calledquantum annealing, which uses quantum physics to find the most stable, lowest-energy arrangements of elements to figure out the best mix for a given problem. Founded in 1999 as a spinoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada, D-Wave is now a public company listed on the NYSE. Illinois-basedEeroQis a startupbetting on heliumfor its quantum chip design. Having raised a $7.25 million seed funding round in 2022 and received regional public support, the company made a $1.1 million commitment in September 2024 towardexpanding its HQin Chicago’s Humboldt Park. In April 2025, Fujitsu and Japanese research institution RIKEN announced having developeda 256-qubit superconducting quantum computerat the RIKEN RQC-FUJITSU Collaboration Center, up from a 64-qubit iteration in 2023. In December 2024, Googleannounced Willow, its latest quantum computing chip. Google didn’t stop at saying Willow was better than its predecessor, Sycamore, or at describing it as “a major breakthrough in quantum error correction.” In a statement thatmade headlines, Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven wrote that Willow’s performance lent “credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes.” IBM’s quantum efforts includeCondor, its milestone superconducting chip for scaling up to 1,121 qubits, andHeron, a 156-qubit processor focused on improved performance and lower error rates. Intel is developing quantum computers based onsilicon spin qubits. In June 2023, it unveiled Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit research chip, and said a next-generation quantum chip based on Tunnel Falls was expected to be released in 2024, but this hasn’t happened. IonQis a publicly listed U.S. company developing trapped-ion quantum computers, including theIonQ Forte. After going publicvia a SPACin late 2021, itacquired Canadian networking specialist Entangled Networks. IQMis a Finnish startup building superconducting quantum computers and is a spinout of the Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. It received funding in its early days from the Business Finland government agency, followed by additional supportfrom the EIC Accelerator program. In 2022, IQM raised €128 million in Series A2 funding led by World Fund, adding to the€39 million led by MIG Fondsit had raised in 2020 as part of what was then its Series A. This second tranche included part of a previously announced €35 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank, as well as participation from the EIC Fund and others. In February 2025, Microsoftintroduced Majorana, a quantum chip using atopological core architecture. Microsoft previously declared that it expected to build a quantum supercomputerwithin 10 years. Pasqalis a French startup taking a full-stack approach to quantum computing and betting on neutral atoms. The company emerged out of the Institut d’Optique in 2019, and its co-founders include 2022 Nobel Prize laureate for physics and professor Alain Aspect. In February 2023, Pascal raiseda €100 million Series B funding roundled by Singapore’s Temasek, with participation from existing investors Quantonation, the Defense Innovation Fund, Daphni, and Eni Next, as well as new investors European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund, Wa’ed Ventures, and Bpifrance (through its Large Venture Fund). PsiQuantumis a quantum computing startup using photonics technology andaimingto build “a 1 million-quantum-bit machine.” In February 2025, itannounced Omega, a quantum photonic chipset manufactured at GlobalFoundries in New York. In 2021, PsiQuantum landed a $450 million Series D investment led by BlackRock, which is now said to be leadinga potential $750 million roundinto the company at a $6 billion pre-money valuation. Founded by Australian academics, it is alsobackedby the Australian and Queensland governments. Qilimanjarois a Spanish startup focusing on analog quantum app-specific integrated circuits (QASICs) and taking a full-stack approach, including hardware, software, and applications. Based in Barcelona, itwon the Four Years From Now startup competitionat Mobile World Congress in 2024, going on to receive€1.5 million in funding from Catalonialater that year. Quandelais a French startup founded in 2017 to develop photonic quantum computers. In November 2023, Quandela raiseda €50 million Series Band received support from the French government through the France 2030 Plan. Quantinuumis a quantum computing companyformed in 2021by the merger of Cambridge Quantum and Honeywell Quantum Solutions. Its flagship product is the H-Series of trapped-ion quantum computers. In April 2024, together with Microsoft, it announced abreakthrough in error correction. QuantWareis a Dutch startup that came up with a proprietary 3D chip architecture, VIO, which focuses on scaling bottlenecks in quantum processing units (QPUs). It started accepting preorders for Contralto-A, its first QPU for quantum error correction, in February 2025. Founded in 2020, it is a spinout of TU Delft and its affiliated research institute, QuTech. In March 2025, and following a€6 million seed roundin 2023, it announced havingraised a €20 million Series A(approximately $19.27 million) — including €5 million in equity out of the €7.5 million itpreviously securedfrom the European Innovation Council (the remainder is a grant). Boston-basedQuErais betting on neutral atoms as the “best approach to achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.” Its products include Aquila, a 256-qubit analog neutral-atom quantum computer launched in 2022 and accessible via Amazon Braket. QuEra isnotably backed by Google, which led the $230 debt round that the quantum startup raised in February 2025 — with a convertible note also backed by SoftBank, Valor, and existing investors. Founded in 2013 byChad Rigetti,Rigetti Computing is a quantum company focusing on superconducting technology. Its range of products includeAnkaa-3and theuppcoming 336-qubit Lyra system. Just like rivals D-Wave and IonQ, Rigetti Computing is alisted company; it raised just under $200 million in VC capital beforegoing public via a SPAC in 2021. In February 2025, it signed astrategic partnershipwith Taiwan-based Quanta Computer, which is set to invest $35 million and purchase shares of Rigetti, while both companies invest more than $100 million each over the next five years to accelerate the development and commercialization of superconducting quantum computing. U.S. quantum startupSEEQC— an acronym for “scalable, energy efficient quantum computing” — is a spinout of chip companyHypres, which was itself established by former employees of IBM’s superconducting electronics division. In 2023, SEEQC announced apartnership with Nvidiato build an “all-digital, ultra-low-latency chip-to-chip link between quantum computers and GPUs.” In January 2025, SEEQC raised a$30 million round of fundingco-led by Booz Allen Ventures and Japanese-European VC firm NordicNinja. Other backers include Merck’s corporate venture capital arm, M Ventures. SEEQC is leading the U.K.-supported QuPharma project to explore how quantum computing can accelerate drug discovery, in partnership with BASF and Merck. SpinQis a Chinese startup founded in 2018 that develops quantum computers. It claims that some of them areportableand making use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Xanaduis aCanadian startupaiming to build quantum computers through a photonic approach. In January 2025, itintroduced Aurora, a 12-qubit system, including 35 photonic chips.

    "title": "AI animation startup Cheehoo lands $10M funding from Greycroft",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Creating animation is a time-consuming process, requiring multiple steps, including storyboarding, rendering, composition, and lighting to craft a single scene. If a director wants to experiment with a different take for a scene, an animation team has to go back and tweak things before the scene can be finalized. Cheehoo, a startup founded by a mix of Hollywood execs and technologists, wants to create an AI-powered tool to make it easier for creatives to produce animated content. The startup was born out of production company Rideback, which produced the Lego Movie franchise. Rideback’s co-CEOs, Michael LoFaso and Jonathan Eirich, are a part of Cheehoo’s founding team along with Rideback co-founder Dan Lin. Other founding members include former president of DreamWorks Animation Chris deFaria and ex-Apple AI researchers Yao-Hung Hubert Tsai and Wei-Cheng Kuo. In a conversation with TechCrunch, LoFaso said that Cheehoo wants to lead the way for studios and creators to bring their animation to life. “What we found through Rideback is that in Hollywood, the process of creating animation was getting expensive and complex,” LoFaso said. “It was starting to become tougher for creators to get their idea out in the world. We wanted to create a tool that was native to the workflows of creators and make their lives easier.” Cheehoo’s tools provide creators a way to prototype and iterate on animation rapidly. They help with tasks like data annotation, file conversions, and format consistency, allowing creators to move between different steps of the animation process. The company’s workflow, which can integrate with existing platforms like Maya or Unreal, allows users to make changes in animation and see the results right away. Creators can turn AI features on or off to take more control of the editing process. Cheehoo uses in-house AI models to assist with character and asset creation, and lets users integrate third-party models from OpenAI, Runway, and others for tasks such as post generation, motion stylization, and scene composition. Cheehoo didn’t announce any launch partners, but the company said that it is already working with several IP holders, studios, and creators. Cheehoo has raised $10 million in funding led by Greycroft, with participation from Point72 Ventures, Basis Set, Headline Asia, Powerhouse Capital, Playground Productions, and Rideback. Brentt Baltimore, principal at Greycroft, said that the venture firm has always been inclined to make investments in companies that create “new age” media. He added that he thinks Cheehoo has the right mix of Hollywood, media, and technology DNA to solve problems in animation pipelines. “Cheehoo has an opportunity to reduce the cost of animation production overall,” Baltimore said in an interview. “That means it can have sophisticated creators easily create animation films without having an expensive studio setup. Using … AI, the company is trying to put enterprise or big studio-level workflows into a tool enabling independent filmmakers to individuals to be creative with animation features. It [is] also doing all this while providing creative control to users, which creatives have always wanted.” Looking to the future, LoFaso said that while Cheehoo is working mainly with enterprises and prosumers, it intends to roll out more consumer-focused products. That may help Cheehoo compete against startups likeAccel-backed CartwheelandNaver-backed Cinamon, which are also building tools to help simplify aspects of animation production.

    "title": "Supermarkets turn down graduates as vacancies drop",
    "article_text": "Young people have told the BBC they are finding it harder than ever to get a job, with some graduates frustrated at being turned down for roles at supermarkets. The government says getting more young people into work is a priority but UK job vacancies are at theirlowest level in nearly four years. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents supermarkets, told the BBC young people would be hit hardest as firms cut back on hiring because of rising employer costs and forthcoming changes to workers' rights. Faisa Ali Tarabi, 24, from Bolton said she had gone through Aldi's recruitment process only to be told there was no suitable vacancy. She has a degree in accounting and finance from the University of Salford and a masters in management from Manchester Metropolitan University Looking for work since she finished her masters in January 2024, she estimates she has applied for around 2,000 roles. \"I've been without work for 15 months now, and to be honest, I'm not just looking for work with my degrees now. I'm trying to get whatever I can for the time being.\" Faisa says she applied for a job at an Aldi warehouse in March 2024 but she showed the BBC an email from the store's recruitment team saying: \"You've done really well so far, however we do not currently have a vacancy that fully meets your requirements.\" It said \"all is not lost though\" and said recruiters would be back in touch if a potential vacancy came up in the next 12 months. She says she has not heard anything since. The BBC has asked Aldi for a comment. In February we reported thatmore 16-24 year-olds were not in work, education or training at the end of 2024 than at any point in the past 11 years. That is 13.4%, or almost one out of every seven people in that age range, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Faisa was one of hundreds of people who commentedon this report on BBC News TikToksaying their unemployment was not for want of trying. \"I check every day, there are no jobs,\" one user said. Another said: \"Finished my uni degree and can't find one job within the field I studied for.\" A third user posted: \"Young people aren't fussy we literally can't even get hired cleaning toilets.\" The number of jobs on offer in the UK fell to 781,000 in the first three months of the year, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Some experts believe the rising cost of employing people is making businesses hold back on hiring new staff. In April the rate of employer National Insurance contributions (NICs) went up and so did minimum wages across different age groups. Business groups have also called forurgent changes to the forthcoming Employment Rights Billover concerns it could hit hiring. Under the new law being scrutinised in the House of Lords on Tuesday, company bosses will berequired to offer a zero-hours worker a guaranteed-hours contractbased on the hours they clock up during a 12-week period. The biggest concern among retail HR directors is that this risks making it much harder to offer people part-time jobs, according to a BRC survey. It surveyed HR directors at 30 businesses, together employing 585,000 retail workers. Just over half said the law change would result in a reduction in staff numbers in their business, while 61% said the new law would reduce flexibility in job offerings. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: \"Almost 250,000 jobs have been lost in retail over the last five years and many major retailers have already announced further job cuts on the back of increased costs of employment which kicked in in April.\" She said part-time roles were down by 200,000 since 2017. \"These roles, which provide vital entry points into work for students, carers and returners, are set to be hardest hit,\" she said. \"In its current form the Employment Rights Bill could backfire, putting the brakes on hiring, or worse still, putting retail job numbers further into reverse.\" In November we spoke to Amy Wilkes, 23, from Coventry who was struggling to find a job after getting a degree in criminology, policing and investigation. She says she applied for supermarket roles but did not get a response. \"It was feeling impossible,\" she says. \"What really hurt me was the not hearing back because you don't get any feedback to tell you where you're going wrong.\" After seven months Amy secured a job as a support worker, which she will start in July. \"It was a surreal moment when I found out. I was in absolute shock, quite emotional but very thrilled,\" she says. Her biggest piece of advice to others looking for work is \"don't give up\". \"I know it's really hard but there is a job out there for you,\" she says. \"Think about what you can offer - that helped my confidence to think about myself and knowing my value and what I could bring to a company.\" A government spokesperson said its new \"youth guarantee\" was \"providing every 18-21-year-old in England with access to an apprenticeship, quality training and education opportunities or help to find a job\". It said its decisions, including to raise employer NICs, were necessary to \"stabilise the public finances\" to fund services like the NHS. They added that business could claim employer NICs relief for some eligible staff including those aged under 21 and for apprentices under the age of 25. 1.

    "title": "Spain and Portugal scramble to restore power as officials chase cause of outage",
    "article_text": "A sweeping power outage left millions of people in Spain, Portugal and parts of France without electricity on Monday, leading to chaotic scenes and widespread disruption. A problem with the power connection between France and Spain was a contributing factor to the outage, the head of a trade body that represents Europe's power industry said. Kristian Ruby, of Eurelectric, told the BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight a \"specific incident with an interconnector between France and Spain\" occurred on Monday. Mr Ruby said this \"meant the Spanish grid was disconnected from the broader European grid\". He added that the interconnector incident was unlikely to have caused the outage on its own and that there were \"likely to have been other elements in this equation\". A day of widespread disruption saw trains cancelled and evacuated in some regions, and traffic lights stop working as delays mounted at airports. As of Monday evening, 11 trains remained stranded, Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente said. With shops, homes and restaurants plunged into darkness - and some people stuck in lifts - Spain's electricity network said by mid-afternoon that restoring power could take several hours. By Monday night, 50% of power had been restored across Spain, according to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. While Portuguese energy provider REN said electricity had been restored to 750,000 customers. But a state of emergency remained in place, with regions able to request the special status. Sánchez said the cause of the outage was still being investigated and warned against speculation, while Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro said there was \"no indication\" of a cyber attack. The first reports of an outagebegan around midday (10:00 GMT) on Monday and its impact quickly escalated. As the scale of the disruption became clear, residents of Madrid were warned to stay put, keep off the roads and not to call emergency services unless \"truly urgent\". A Spanish operator said power restoration would take up to 10 hours, while Portugal's power firm REN said getting back to full power could take up to a week. Queues formed at cash machines as card payments were affected by the outage, and there were reports that some petrol stations are closed. When the blackout hit the Madrid metro station network, commuters were left confused and panicking.  One resident, Sarah Jovovich, described the sense of confusion underground when the lights went off in a metro station. People were \"hysterical\" and \"panicking\", she told the BBC. \"It was quite chaotic really.\" Mobile phones had stopped working and nobody had any information, she said. When she left the metro station and emerged into the streets, she found the roads gridlocked with heavy traffic. \"No-one understood anything. Businesses were closed and buses were full,\" she said. The outage also left a number of people stuck in lifts. Emergency workers were called to 286 buildings to free people trapped inside elevators in the Madrid region, the head of the regional government, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, told the television station Antena 3. Spanish media reported that some hospitals had implemented emergency plans, including halting routine work, news agencies reported. By early evening and after several hours of blackouts, residents in some parts of the country reported the lights were back on. Power was being restored \"in several areas of the north, south and west of the [Iberian] peninsula\", the Spanish grid operator said. The authorities in Spain and Portugal were on Monday night still trying to work out what caused the power cuts. \"There are no indications of any cyberattack\" at this point, the President of the European Council, Antonio Costa, said. As panic spread earlier in the day, residents of Madrid were warned to stay off the roads. In a video on social media, the mayor of the Spanish capital, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, told residents to \"keep their movements to an absolute minimum and, if at all possible, to remain where they are. We want to keep all roads clear.\" People should only call emergency services if it is \"truly urgent\", he said. \"If emergency calls go unanswered, go to the police and the fire stations in person, where they will try to deal with all the emergencies.\" The country's nuclear power plants automatically stopped when the blackout hit, and the Spanish oil company Moeve said it halted operations at its oil refineries. People were left stranded on trains in difficult to access areas, with Transport Minister Puente saying there were issues with coupling locomotives. Speaking to the BBC, Gabriela Chavez said she had been travelling between Seville and Madrid via train when the power went out and the AC and toilets stopped working. \"They have let everyone off the train but we have no idea how long we will have to wait for,\" she told the BBC on Monday. \"People at the top of the hill have flagged down cars who have dropped off water and crisps for us, which is kind [and] people from the village have come to drop off supplies for us.\" Flights were also impacted, with delays and cancellations at some airports. EasyJet said it was experiencing some disruption to operations at Lisbon and Madrid. It said the situation was \"fluid\" and told customers to check local advice. As of Monday evening, aviation data company Cirium said 96 flights departing from Portugal - and 45 from Spain - had been cancelled. Businesses have been severely affected. Some Ikea branches in Spain switched to backup generators and stopped customers from entering its stores. The Madrid Open Tennis organisers have decided to cancel Monday's event. Elsewhere, Andorra and parts of France were also hit, but the Balearic and Canary Islands were not affected. Some 96 departing flights from Portuguese airports have been grounded so far, while 45 have been called off from Spain. Photos show the disruption caused by power cuts that have affected large parts of Spain and Portugal. Police make 25 arrests so far as officers target Paris, Marseille, Bordeaux and, the city of Lyon. Mr George's body was found by Spanish police on 7 January in a remote lemon groove. French President Emmanuel Macron praised the \"courage\" of the teachers who restrained the attacker.",

    "title": "Sex offenders to be denied asylum rights in new law",
    "article_text": "Asylum seekers will be denied the right to stay in the UK if they have been convicted of sexual offences, the government has announced. Terrorists, war criminals and any other criminals whose offences carry a sentence of one year or more can already be refused asylum under the Refugee Convention. Under the changes, this will be extended to anyone convicted in the UK of a crime which places them on the sex offenders register, regardless of the length of their sentence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said this would \"ensure these appalling crimes are taken seriously\" but the Conservatives said the measures were \"too little, too late\". The changes will be introduced through an amendment to the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament. It is not clear how many cases the change could affect. However, a Home Office source said ministers would be hoping to tackle instances like that ofAbdul Ezedi, who was granted asylum despite being a convicted sex offender. Ezedi killed himself within hours after he was suspected of dousing his ex-girlfriend with a corrosive liquid when he attacked her and her children in south London in January last year. He was already on the sex offenders register, after pleading guilty to charges of sexual assault and exposure in 2018, when he was granted asylum in 2020 following two failed attempts. The amendment will also set a 24-week target for appeal decisions on whether asylum seekers who are foreign offenders or are in government-funded accommodation have the right to remain in the UK or not, in a bid to cut the asylum backlog. The home secretary said: \"Sex offenders who pose a risk to the community should not be allowed to benefit from refugee protections in the UK. \"Nor should asylum seekers be stuck in hotels at the taxpayers' expense during lengthy legal battles. \"That is why we are changing the law to help clear the backlog, end the use of asylum hotels and save billions of pounds for the taxpayer.\" The Home Office said that harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) for processing asylum claims could also save up to an hour per case by summarising interview transcripts and accessing country advice. A range of measures to reform the asylum system are being introduced, including new powers for the Immigration Advice Authority to issue fines of up to £15,000 for anyone involved in advising fraudulent claims or posing as an immigration lawyer who is not registered. There will also be restrictions on foreign offenders living in the community, including mandatory electronic tags, strict night-time curfews and enforced exclusion zones. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, welcomed efforts to resolve asylum cases quickly, but warned the use of AI could \"backfire\" if it produced flawed decisions that end up in the courts. The Law Society of England and Wales also raised concerns that the target for appeal decisions would be \"unworkable\" in practice as the justice system is already struggling to cope with current demand. Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips said the action would complement the government's pledge to halve violence against women and girls in a decade. But Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the legislation was \"too little, too late\" and highlighted howa record 10,000 people had crossed the Channel this year already. \"Foreign criminals pose a danger to British citizens and must be removed, but so often this is frustrated by spurious legal claims based on human rights claims, not asylum claims,\" he said. \"The Conservatives had already tabled tough, clear reforms to remove all foreign criminals and to disapply the Human Rights Act so activists and lawyers cannot block deportations. \"But Labour voted against our measures - they are not serious about controlling our borders.\" Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "title": "New satellite will see through clouds to 'weigh' Earth's forests",
    "article_text": "A first-of-its-kind satellite due to launch on Tuesday will be able to see through clouds and leafy canopies to assess how they are protecting the planet from climate change. The Biomass satellite, from the European Space Agency,  will \"weigh\" the Earth's forests, revealing how much planet-warming carbon is being stored within trees and therefore kept out of the atmosphere. Until now the amount of carbon stored by the 1.5 trillion trees in the planet's rainforests has been impossible to calculate. Led by British company Airbus, the project hopes to help scientists more accurately model climate change and track rates of deforestation. The satellite is due to be launchedat 10:15 BST from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana. It has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which expands outwards. The antenna will use radar with a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy. \"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus. \"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said. The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present. It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored. Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London. \"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics. \"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\" On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back. Despite years of testing, the launch will not be straightforward. \"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey. Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector. L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe. If the launch is successful, the team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years. These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation. \"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney. Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next. It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years. \"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\" Sign up for our Future Earth newsletterto get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

    "article_text": "The first sign of trouble Peter Hughes noticed was when his train to Madrid started to slow down. Then the TV monitor and lights went off. Emergency lights switched on, but did not last, and the locomotive ground to a halt. Four hours later, Mr Hughes was still stuck on the train 200 kilometres (124 miles) outside of Spain's capital. He had food and water, but the toilets were not working. \"It will be getting dark soon and we could be stuck here for hours,\" he told the BBC. The massive power cut that stranded Mr Hughes triggered chaos across Spain and Portugal, and also impacted Andorra and parts of France, from about midday local time (10:00 GMT). Traffic lights shut off. Metros closed. Businesses shuttered and people joined queues to get cash as card payments did not work. Jonathan Emery was on a different train halfway between Seville and Madrid when the cuts hit. For an hour, he sat on the train, the doors closed, until people could pry them open to let in ventilation. Half an hour later, passengers left, only to find themselves stranded. That was when people from local villages started coming and dropping off supplies – water, bread, fruit. \"Nobody is charging for anything, and word must be getting around in the local town because people just keep coming,\" he said. Commuters in Madrid were left confused in the dark when the blackout hit the city's metro station network. One resident, Sarah Jovovich, was getting off the train when the lights went out. People were \"hysterical\" and \"panicking\", she told the BBC. \"It was quite chaotic really.\" Mobile phones had stopped working and nobody had any information. Once out of the metro station, she found the roads gridlocked with heavy traffic. \"No-one understood anything. Businesses were closed and buses were full,\" she said. Hannah Lowney was halfway through scanning her grocery shopping at Aldi when the power went out in the Spanish capital. People were coming out of their offices and walking home because they could not tell when the buses were coming, Ms Lowney said in a voice message sent to BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It's a bit disconcerting that it's the whole country, I've never experienced this before,\" she said. Mark England was eating lunch in the restaurant of the hotel where he is staying on holiday in Benidorm when \"everything went off and the fire alarm started going off and the fire doors started closing\". In an international school in Lisbon, the electricity flickered on and off for a while, then gave up, teacher Emily Thorowgood said. She kept teaching in the dark, the children in good spirits, but lots of parents were taking their children out of school, she said. Will David, a Brit living in Lisbon, was having a haircut and beard trim in the basement of a barber when the power went down. The barber found him a spot by the window upstairs to finish the cut with scissors. \"The walk home felt very strange, both with the lack of traffic lights meaning a complete free-for-all for vehicles and pedestrians on the roads - as well as so many people milling around outside their places of work with nothing to do,\" he said. Initially, mobile phone networks also went down for some, leaving many scrambling for information. Curtis Gladden, who is in La Vall D'Uixo, about 30 miles from Valencia, said it was \"scary\" as he struggled to get updates about what was happening. Eloise Edgington, who could not do any work as a copywriter in Barcelona, said she was only receiving occasional messages, could not load web pages on her phone and was trying to conserve her battery. An hour and a half after the power went out, one resident of Fortuna, in south-east Spain, said her husband was driving around, trying to find a petrol station that could supply fuel to run a generator and keep their fridge powered. \"We are worried about food, water, cash and petrol in case this goes on for a couple of days,\" said Lesley, a Brit who has been living in Spain for 11 years. Locals \"have more to worry about\" than the Madrid Open tennis tournament being suspended, she said, adding there is \"very little news about what's happened\". Mr England said walking down the street in Benidorm, a \"majority of shops are in darkness and shuttered or have people on the entrances saying you can't come in. There's no cash machines, no traffic lights so it's strange.\" After Mr Gladden's phone signal returned after about two hours, he and others ventured out to cafes, but found \"nothing is working – we came to get some food and a drink but they can't cook without electricity\". Within two hours, Spanish power grid operator Red Electrica said it was beginning to recover power in the north and south of the country. But two-and-a-half hours after the cuts, Madrid's mayor José Luis Martínez-Almeida still urged all residents to \"keep their movements to an absolute minimum and, if at all possible, to remain where they are\", in a video recorded from the city's integrated emergency security centre. At 15:00 local time, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez pulled together an \"extraordinary\" meeting of Spain's national security council. Red Electrica CEO Eduardo Prieto said at a news conference shortly afterwards that it could take \"between six and ten hours\" to restore power. Just before 16:00, electricity flicked back on in Malaga. By 17:00, the grid operator said power was being restored \"in several areas of the north, south and west of the [Iberian] peninsula\". Portugal's power firm REN gave a more dire prediction, saying that it could \"take up to a week\" before the network was back to normal. A state of emergency was later declared across Spain, with regions able to request special measures. But by Monday evening, Sanchez said 50% of power had been restored across Spain, while REN said electricity had been restored to 750,000 customers. Many, however, remain without power. Knock on effects continue: Back-up generators at airports kicked on, allowing most flights to leave on time, but some have been unable to operate. Tom McGilloway, on holiday in Lisbon, was due to return to London on Monday night, but as of early evening did not know what would happen. He said for the time being people were getting drinks and food - but vendors told him they would only be able to keep working until the batteries ran out on their payment terminals. \"If I need to book a hotel if the plane is cancelled, I don't know how I can do it if payments are down,\" he added. \"My partner's parents are trying to get petrol so they can pick us up to take us back to Alentejo but many petrol stations are closed or not taking payment. We might be stuck with no plan for where to stay tonight.\" Spanish violinist Isaac Bifet went to a rehearsal in the morning at the symphony orchestra in Madrid. But the building was all dark and most of the other orchestra players hadn't turned up because they were stranded with no transport. People without cash were particularly stuck, he told the BBC, because online payments systems were down. The day without power was \"strange\" and \"a little medieval\", Mr Bifet said. But \"the atmosphere was actually pretty nice.\" And with the electricity still out in his apartment, he spent the evening drinking beers with friends by candlelight. Additional reporting and research by Andree Massiah, Kris Bramwell, James Kelly, Bernadette McCague and Josh Parry Some 96 departing flights from Portuguese airports have been grounded so far, while 45 have been called off from Spain.

    "title": "Steve Rosenberg: What's Putin trying to achieve by calling a three-day ceasefire?",
    "article_text": "When is a ceasefire a genuine attempt to secure peace? And when is it simply PR? It's a question that's been asked a lot lately. Mostly in relation to Russia's president. Short ceasefires are becoming quite the Kremlin thing. First, Vladimir Putin declared a 30-hour cessation of hostilities over Easter, portraying it as a \"humanitarian\" gesture. Now the Kremlin leader has announceda three-day unilateral truce for early May. It will run from 8 May to 10 May to coincide with events marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two. In a statement, the Kremlin said that for 72 hours all military actions would cease. It cited \"humanitarian\" considerations (again) and made it clear Moscow expected Ukraine to follow suit. In response to the proposal, Ukraine questioned why Russia could not commit to a ceasefire immediately and called for one to be implemented for at least 30 days. \"If Russia truly wants peace, it must cease fire immediately,\" Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said, adding: \"Why wait until May 8th?\" So, from the Russian president who launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago, is this a sincere effort to end the fighting? Or simply a public relations exercise by the Kremlin to impress Donald Trump? Kremlin critics will suspect PR. During the extremely brief so-called Easter ceasefire,Ukraine had accused Russian troops of violating it repeatedly. Moscow had used its announcement of a 30-hour pause in the fighting to send a signal to the White House: that in this war Russia is the peacemaker and Kyiv the aggressor. It accused Ukraine of ignoring what Moscow presented as an olive branch and of prolonging the war. Recent comments by Trump suggest the US president hasn't bought that. In a post on his Truth Social platform at the weekend, Trump wrote that \"there was no reason\" for Putin \"to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns [in Ukraine], over the last few days\". \"It makes me think,\" he added, \"that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?' Too many people are dying!!!\" Cue today's announcement of another Russian ceasefire. This one slightly longer: three days. And, again, that claim of \"humanitarian\" concerns. Another attempt to signal to Washington that the Kremlin has only the best of intentions? That Russia is really the good guy in all of this? If so, it doesn't appear to have worked. Not immediately. The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt noted Moscow's offer of a temporary ceasefire, but said: \"The president [Donald Trump] has made it clear he wants to see a permanent ceasefire first to stop the killing, stop the bloodshed. \"He is increasingly frustrated with leaders of both countries,\" Leavitt said. It's an indication that the US president may be losing patiencenow with the Kremlin, despite having directed most of his public criticism in recent months towards President Zelensky. Last month the Trump administration was pushing both Russia and Ukraine to agree to a 30-day comprehensive unconditional ceasefire. Ukraine had signed up to that. Russia did not. Already senior Russian officials are using President Putin's three-day ceasefire offer to try to cast Ukraine in a bad light. \"It is doubtful that [President] Zelensky will support the decision of our president and accept the ceasefire,\" the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, told Russian state TV. Hardly an encouraging sign, so soon after the announcement of another brief ceasefire. Clashes, cuts and dozens of executive orders - how the US president's second term is off to a whirlwind start. Trump's border czar Tom Homan says the mothers had made the choice for their citizen children to be removed with them. The US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed as a referendum on how Canada should engage with him. The impact of what President Trump has done so far is being felt in every corner of American life.

    "title": "Why might public sector workers go on strike again?",
    "article_text": "The government ended a wave of public sector strikes last summer when it accepted, in full, the recommendations of independent public sector pay review bodies to increase the pay of teachers, nurses and others. But ministers might be facing another headache over pay and the possibility of a fresh threat of strikes from some unions. BBC Verify examines why this pressure over public sector pay and industrial action has re-emerged. In July 2024, the new Labour governmentaccepted the recommendations of these bodiesto increase public sector pay by between 4.75% and 6% for the 2024-25 financial year. There is a new round of recommendations from these bodies every year and they traditionally deliver in the summer. In September 2024, the government decided to speed up the process by asking for their recommendations by the spring for how much public sector pay should rise in each sector in the 2025-26 financial year. These have not been made public yet, but reports suggest the recommendations are for more than the health and education departments have budgeted for this financial year. In their own submissionsto the pay review bodies, the health and education departments said they could only afford to increase their pay billsin England by 2.8%. The BBC has been toldthat the teachers' pay review body has recommended a 4% rise and the NHS body has recommended 3%. In the case of teachers, this would be above the latest 3.2% consumer price inflation forecastfrom the Office for Budget Responsibilityfor 2025-26. Because education and health are devolved, the health and education departments set budgets for spending in England only. The teachers' pay review body makes recommendations for England only but the NHS pay review body covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Public sector pay is set through a separate process in Scotland. The recommendation of an above-inflation pay rise for teachers is likely to be because of ongoing concerns about staff recruitment and retention in schools. These have been raised in previous pay recommendations. Calculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies(IFS) show that, despite the 5.5% average cash pay rise teachers received in 2024-25, the average pay of most teachers in that year - when adjusted for inflation - was still lower than than it was back in 2010. In the case of the most experienced teachers, pay was 9% lower than it was 15 years ago in real terms. Official government data also shows widening gaps between the recruitment figures for teachers in specific subjects and their recruitment targets. Just 17% of the target for secondary school physics teacher recruitment was achieved in 2023-24, down from 42% in 2019-20. Overall teacher recruitment was 62% of the target, down from 87% in 2019-20 We do not know what all the individual pay recommendations from the review bodies will be, but Verify has done some calculations that give a rough sense of the potential impact. Overall UK public sector pay in 2023-24 was £272bn,according to the Office for National Statistics. The previous Conservative government had budgeted for a 2% cash increase in public sector pay in 2024-25. And last July,Labour said the costof meeting the full 2024-25 pay recommendations would be an additional £9.4bn. That implies that total public sector pay in 2024-25 will have been roughly £287bn, which is around a fifth of total government spending. So, if the total bill across the public sector for 2025-26 went up by another 3% - rather than 2.8% - that would imply the government needing to find about an extra £550m. But if it went up by 4% it would imply the need to find around an extra £3.5bn. The governmentsaid in the 2024 Autumn Budgetthat it would seek to fund any pay rises above what departments have budgeted for not by raising taxes or more borrowing but by \"productivity improvements\". In other words, departments would have to accommodate the additional pay rise by making cuts elsewhere in their budgets. The government has reiterated this, withthe prime minister's spokesperson telling reportersin December 2024 that: \"For pay awards to go beyond inflation they will have to be met by productivity improvements.\" The National Education Union (NEU), England's largest teaching union, has already said it would resist any further effective cuts to the overall education budget. And it is demanding any pay rise for teachers be fully funded with new money. TheNEU said in April 2025that it would vote on taking strike action if the government stuck with its 2.8% pay offer for the 2025-26 academic year. And when the government indicated in December 2024 that it could only afford a 2.8% pay rise in the health sector in England, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing both said the figure was too low. The government funded last year's above inflation pay increase for public sector workers by increasing employers' National Insurance contributions andChancellor Rachel Reeves saidin November that she did not want to increase taxes again this Parliament. As for borrowing, she has left herself only £9.9bn of \"headroom\", or leeway, against hitting her chosen fiscal rules in 2029-30 and taking on additional debt to pay for higher public sector pay would risk being on course to breach her rules. But analysts also warn that it will be far from easy to pay for higher pay through increased public sector productivity. \"If the pay recommendations come in higher than what departments have planned for, that will create a budgeting challenge,\" says Ben Zaranko of the IFS. \"If no additional funding is forthcoming, it will force ruthless prioritisation and tough choices elsewhere. Public service leaders are already being asked to find major efficiency savings, and there is a limit to what is realistic.\" Additional reporting by Anthony Reuben What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? Quangos are taxpayer-funded but not directly controlled by central government and include watchdogs. Manx nurses have already threatened to strike in an ongoing dispute over their salaries. The government borrowed more than expected last year, placing more pressure on the public finances ahead of the full impact of US tariffs. The government gets most of its money from tax but also borrows when it wants to boost spending. Deputy Max Andrews says minimum wage rises may make it harder for companies to employ trainees.",

    "title": "Dad conned into thinking baby was his 'devastated'",
    "article_text": "A man whose ex-partner forged paternity test results to make him believe he was the father of her child said what she did had ruined his life. Ryan Hampson was at the child's birth after rekindling his relationship with Beth Fernley after she forged DNA test results to make it appear there was a 99.9% probability he was the father. Fernley, 26, of Warrington, Cheshire, admitted fraud by false representation at Liverpool Crown Court and wassentenced to 13 months in jail, suspended for 18 months. Mr Hampson - whose name was on the child's birth certificate - said his proudest moment was becoming a father, but when he found out it was a lie he was \"left grieving over a child that was still alive\". He called for a change in the law to allow for mandatory paternity testing before a birth is registered. But the Home Office said there were no plans to do so. Mr Hampson toldBBC North West Tonightthat he asked for the DNA test in 2019 after Fernley told him she was pregnant. The court heard how Fernley had asked Mr Hampson for £300 towards the test, and then sent him screenshots which she claimed were from company EasyDNA. Mr Hampson then rekindled his relationship with Fernley. She later forged another letter when the child was a toddler. That letter suggested the DNA company had made a mistake and he was not the father, the court heard. When Mr Hampson contacted the firm, the forgery and deception started to unravel. He said: \"They told me that there was no record of me. \"They never sent the letters to me and they actually told me to seek legal advice because they actually thought I was a victim of fraud.\" He described feeling \"shocked\", \"numb\" and \"devastated\" at the news. \"I honestly couldn't believe it,\" he said. His mother, Claire Hampson, said it was \"heart-breaking\" to watch her son's \"whole world fall apart\" while trying to process \"the fact there's been so much deceit not just to Ryan, but to us as well\". Mr Hampson contacted police in July 2022 and Fernley was arrested. On sentencing, the Recorder of Liverpool, Judge Andrew Menary, described it as \"a particularly dreadful offence\". He said when police became involved she continued to deny she had lied, in a \"perpetuation of sinister dishonesty\". Mr Hampson and his family want more recognition and punishment for paternity fraud. \"The actions that were committed were utterly dire. \"We are a victim of fraud and I felt like this should have been taken a lot more seriously.\" He wanted to keep a relationship with the child who he said he \"adored\" but the biological father is now back. \"The hardest thing I ever done was to let [them] go,\" he said. \"I felt like it was the only right thing for me to step away and I have done that to protect [them].\" Mr Hampson said he is having counselling and with the help of his family, was working to rebuild everything that was taken away from him. A Home Office spokesman said it took such cases seriously. The spokesman said: \"Fraud, and specifically paternity fraud, is a truly terrible crime, and those who provide false information on a birth certificate already face a criminal conviction. \"Work is under way on a new, expanded Fraud Strategy and we continue to work closely with private industry, law enforcement and tech companies to go after those committing fraud.\" However, he added: \"There are no plans to change the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 to include mandatory paternity testing prior to a birth registration taking place.\" Read more stories fromCheshireon the BBC, watchBBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayerand followBBC North West on X.

    "title": "Conclave to elect new pope to begin on 7 May, Vatican says",
    "article_text": "Cardinals will meet next month in a secret conclave to elect the next pope, the Vatican has said. The closed-door meeting will start inside the Sistine Chapel on 7 May and will involve some 135 cardinals from across the world. It follows the death of Pope Francis who died at the age of 88 on Easter Monday and whose funeral was held on Saturday. There is no timescale as to how long it will take to elect the next pope, but the previous two conclaves, held in 2005 and 2013, lasted just two days. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said cardinals will take part in a solemn mass at St Peter's Basilica, after which those eligible to vote will gather in the Sistine Chapel for the secretive ballot. Once they enter the Sistine Chapel, cardinals must have no communication with the outside world until a new Pope is elected. There is only one round of voting on the first afternoon of the conclave, but the cardinals will vote up to four times every day afterwards. A new pope requires a two-thirds majority - and that can take time. Each cardinal casts his vote on a simple card that says, in Latin: \"I elect as Supreme Pontiff\" to which they add the name of their chosen candidate. If the conclave completes its third day without reaching a decision, the cardinals may pause for a day of prayer. Outside the Sistine Chapel the world will be watching for the smoke from the chimney. If the smoke is black, there will be another round of voting. White smoke signals that a new pope has been chosen. On Saturday, politicians and royalty joined thousands of mourners as Pope Francis'funeral was held in St Peter's Square. Hymns played out on giant speakers, occasionally drowned out by the sound of helicopters flying overhead, before 91-year-old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re gave a homily on the pope's legacy. After a ceremony, huge crowds lined the streets of Rome to watch as the Pope's coffin was carried in a procession to his final resting place,Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica. Authorities said 140,000 people had lined the streets, clapping and waving as the hearse - a repurposed white popemobile - crossed the Tiber river and drove past some of Rome's most recognisable sights: the Colosseum, the Forum and the Altare della Patria national monument on Piazza Venezia. On Sundayimages of Pope Francis's tomb at the church were releasedshowing a single white rose lying on the stone that bears the name he was known by during his pontificate, below a crucifix illuminated by a single spotlight. The Bishop of Portsmouth pays tribute, saying there was \"something very human about Francis\". The Vatican's representative to South Sudan says the Pope's memory should be honoured by seeking peace. The late pontiff was laid to rest in a private ceremony on Saturday following a public funeral at the Vatican on Saturday. The BBC's religion editor Aleem Maqbool explains why it's so difficult to guess who will be the next pontiff. Michelle O'Neill said the late Pope was a \"man of humility\".",

    "article_text": "Constance Marten has denied carrying her baby in a supermarket bag while on the run and said she considered handing the newborn to authorities, a court has heard. Asked if her baby, Victoria, had been carried in a red bag for life at any point, Marten said \"absolutely not\" and added: \"No-one is going to put their live baby who they are caring for and loving in a shopping bag.\" Marten, 37, and Mark Gordon, 50, are accused of manslaughter by gross negligence and causing or allowing the death of a child - charges they deny. Marten returned to court on Monday to continue giving evidence in the retrial, but shortly after beginning around 11:00 BST said she needed a coffee to wake up. She continued to give evidence after a short break, but the jury were sent home for the day after lunch, with the judge telling them a \"matter of law\" had arisen. She was due to start giving evidence on Tuesday last week but said she had a headache and toothache. She did not come to court on Wednesday. She started giving evidence on Thursday, still complaining of toothache and did not give evidence on Friday. Marten and Gordon are facing a retrial at the Old Bailey. At the first trial both were found guilty of concealing the birth of a child and perverting the course of justice. The couple's baby girl was found dead in a shopping bag covered in rubbish, in a shed on a Brighton allotment in 2023. On Monday, Marten told the jury why she and Gordon decided to go out onto the South Downs in Sussex with baby Victoria in a tent from Argos. They were on the run after their car caught fire two days earlier and the police were hunting for them because they had found a placenta on the back seat. The couple's previous four children had previously been taken into care. By 7 January 2023 they had arrived in East Ham in east London. Marten told the jury they were hoping to stand out less than they had in Harwich where people had started to recognise them. \"We thought with more people we might blend in more, but there were just more people looking at us. So we wanted to get away from prying eyes for a few days,\" she said. They took a taxi to Whitechapel and bought a tent from Argos, then, with the intention of trying to go abroad despite not having their passports, they attempted to get to Plymouth by taxi. But when the driver was warned by a friend not to take them, they got a taxi to Haringey, north London, and then another taxi to Newhaven on the south coast. They then set off onto the South Downs. Marten said the couple only wanted to stay in the tent for a day or two while they figured out what to do next. She told the court they had lots of ideas, and considered handing the baby in to the local authorities. She also said she did not understand the need for the manhunt. The conditions inside the tent were warm but not comfortable, Marten said, adding the baby would usually sleep on either her or Gordon's chest. If they were awake, they would put the baby on a pillow between them, she added. Marten told the court the baby died while she was asleep. \"I fell asleep and my head flopped forward,\" she said, adding \"when I woke up she was dead\". She said the couple were in state of panic, shock and disbelief on realising the child had died. On 1 March 2023 baby Victoria's decomposed body was found under some rubbish in a bag for life in a shed on the allotment. The retrial continues at the Old Bailey.",

    "title": "Ultra-processed foods may be linked to early death",
    "article_text": "People who eat lots of ultra-processed foods (UPF) may be at greater risk of dying early, a study in eight countries including the UK and the US suggests. Processed meats, biscuits, fizzy drinks, ice cream and some breakfast cereals are examples of UPF, which are becoming increasingly common in diets worldwide. UPFs tend to contain more than five ingredients, which are not usually found in home cooking, such as additives, sweeteners and chemicals to improve the food's texture or appearance. Some experts say it's not known why UPFs are linked to poor health - there is little evidence it's down to the processing itself and could be because these foods contain high levels of fat, salt and sugar. The researchers behind the study, published inthe American Journal of Preventive Medicine, looked at previous research to estimate the impact of ultra-processed food intake on mortality. The study cannot definitively prove that UPFs caused any premature deaths. This is because the amount of ultra-processed foods in someone's diet is also linked to their overall diet, exercise levels, wider lifestyle and wealth, which can all also affect health. The studies looked at surveys of people's diets and at data on deaths from eight countries - Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, UK and US. The report estimates that in the UK and the US, where UPFs account for more than half of calorie intake, 14% of early deaths could be linked to the harms they cause. In countries such as Colombia and Brazil, where UPF intake is much lower (less than 20% of calorie intake), the study estimated these foods are linked to around 4% of premature deaths. Lead study author Dr Eduardo Nilson, from Brazil, said UPFs affected health \"because of the changes in the foods during industrial processing and the use of artificial ingredients, including colorants, artificial flavours and sweeteners, emulsifiers, and many other additives and processing aids\". By their calculations, in the US in 2018, there were 124,000 premature deaths due to the consumption of ultra-processed food. In the UK, nearly 18,000. The study says governments should update their dietary advice to urge people to cut back on these foods. But the UK government's expert panel on nutrition recently said there wasn't any strong evidence of a link between the way food is processed and poor health. There is no one definition that everyone agrees on, butthe NOVA classificationis often used. Examples include: The numbers in the study are based on modelling the impact of ultra-processed foods on people's health. Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics, Open University, said the study makes lots of mathematical assumptions which make him cautious about what the findings mean. \"It's still far from clear whether consumption of just any UPF at all is bad for health, or what aspect of UPFs might be involved. \"This all means that it's impossible for any one study to be sure whether differences in mortality between people who consume different UPF amounts are actually caused by differences in their UPF consumption. \"You still can't be sure from any study of this kind exactly what's causing what.\" Dr Nerys Astbury, an expert in diet and obesity at the University of Oxford, also agrees there are limitations to the research. It's been known for some time that diets high in energy, fat and sugar can increase the risk of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart conditions and some cancers, which can lead to premature death. \"Many UPF tend to be high in these nutrients,\" she says, adding that studies to date haven't been able to prove that the effects of UPFs are due to anything more than \"diets high in foods which are energy dense and contain large amounts of fat and sugar\". This type of research cannot prove that consumption of ultra-processed foods is harmful, says Dr Stephen Burgess at Cambridge University. How physically fit someone is may be the main cause of poor health instead. But when numerous studies across many countries and culture suggest UPFs could be a risk to health, Dr Burgess says \"ultra-processed foods may be more than a bystander\". The Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, said the term 'ultra-processed food' \"demonises a wide variety of food that can help people achieve a healthy balanced diet, such as yoghurt, pasta sauces or bread\". It said all additives used by food manufacturers are approved by the Food Standards Agency, who ensure they are safe to eat and drink.

    "title": "Girl, 14, who stabbed teachers sentenced to 15 years",
    "article_text": "A 14-year-old girl who stabbed two teachers and a pupil while screaming \"I'm going to kill you\" has been sentenced to 15 years in detention. The teenager, who cannot be named due to her age, will serve at least half the sentence in custody. She wasfound guilty of attempted murderin a second trial at Swansea Crown Court in February afterthe first collapsed. Fiona Elias, Liz Hopkin and a pupil were treated in hospital with stab woundsafter the attack at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman, Carmarthenshire, last April. Speaking in court, Ms Hopkin said she worried about the girl's future, while Ms Elias said the defendant had put her, her family and the entire school \"through hell\". The teenager, who brought a weapon to school every day, used her father's multi-tool knife to initially attack Ms Elias on 24 April 2024. Judge Paul Thomas KC, sentencing, said the girl had not shown remorse and had attacked the three for attention. The jury heard she repeatedly stabbed Ms Elias saying \"I'm going to kill you\" and the teacher suffered wounds to both arms. Fellow pupils said the defendant previously told them she would stab Ms Elias and \"do something stupid\" that would get her expelled. Ms Hopkin intervened during the incident to try and restrain the girl and was also stabbed, receiving injuries to her neck, back, legs and arms, the court heard. After a \"stand off\", the girl then ran at a 14-year-old pupil with the knife and shouted \"I'm going to kill you\" before stabbing her, causing a wound to the upper arm. She was restrained by teacher Darrel Campbelluntil she was later arrested. During the hearing, Ms Elias started reading her victim impact statement in tears and said she would never forget the moment she saw the tip of the blade. \"The image is etched in my mind,\" she said, \"it's a moment that replays itself over and over\". \"The scars on my arms are a daily reminder of the pain I endured. She tried to murder me.\" Ms Elias said she has received counselling to \"stop the spirals\" before they \"consume\" her. She said her daughter found out about her involvement in the incident on social media when a photo was shared of Ms Hopkin on a stretcher with the caption 'RIP Mrs Elias'. \"Those three words have haunted her ever since,\" she said. Ms Elias addressed the teenager in court and said: \"Your motive was clear, you tried to murder me. \"Thankfully, thanks to Liz's selfless actions, you didn't manage to finish what you started. \"You have put me, my family and the entire school though hell.\" Ms Elias said she had not ruled out meeting with the teenager in future, and will use her experience to campaign for teachers' safety. She finished her statement with the words her husband wrote in a card following the incident. \"I always knew that you give your time to the school, give your heart to the school, but I never expected you to give your blood,\" Ms Elias said. \"I will always give my heart to Ysgol Dyffryn Aman,\" she added. Reading her statement, Ms Hopkin turned to look at the teenager and said her life had been changed forever due to the defendant's \"calculated violence\". She told the court the scars from that day remain not only on her body but \"deep within\". \"I was fighting for my life in a place where I should have felt safe,\" she said, adding her son and husband who work at the school found her \"in a pool of blood\". \"Although this has been the worst experience of my life, I'm glad it was me that was there that day,\" she said. \"I'm glad I stopped you from killing [Fiona Elias]. I truly believe I saved you both that day. You are not a murderer. \"I would not let you carry out your plan. I'm still here, I'm still alive, though at the time I was sure I was going to die.\" Ms Hopkin said the girl had \"been with her\" every day since the attack. Addressing the teenager, she said: \"Despite what you did, I worry about your future.\" \"I don't want what happened that day to be what defines you.\" On Monday Judge Thomas said he believed the girl was not sorry for what she did, and that she \"actually enjoyed\" the publicity \"in a weird way\". \"In my view, you wanted as many of your fellow pupils as possible to see what you intended to do,\" he said. \"I've watched you carefully over the two trials. I believe that what you did that day, you did above all, for attention. Attention, you perhaps haven't had.\" Judge Thomas added the defendant had already \"made serious threats to someone\" since last April, and posed a potential risk even after custody. \"I hope you will go on to lead a good life,\" he added as he passed the sentence. The girl listened, her arms crossed, and she was taken back to the detention centre. She will be almost 30 when her licence period ends. Speaking outside the court, Ms Hopkin said: \"While some might see today's sentencing as a good result, there is no real good result when a child or young person finds themselves in a situation like this.\" \"I would give anything for it never to have happened,\" she added. Ms Hopkin said \"extreme violence\" in schools was becoming more common and called for urgent action from leaders. \"We cannot keep pretending that they are rare or isolated, or confined to city schools hundreds of miles away,\" she said. \"It's happening in Wales, in small rural towns where people think it just won't happen, it does and it will continue.\" BBC journalist Meleri Williams reports from Swansea Crown Court as teenager is sentenced. A14-year-old girl was convicted of attempted murder by a jury and is due to be sentenced. His family say he had celebrated his 25th birthday the day before the collision. The daughter of a mining union official describes the threats her family faced during the 1984 strike. The Welsh government says it will ban greyhound racing in what would be a first for the UK.",

    "title": "'Class of 92' graduates aim for more Crucible glory",
    "article_text": "John Higgins, Mark Williams and Ronnie O'Sullivan have all been at the top level of snooker for more than 30 years At a combined age of 99, two of snooker's all-time greats go head-to-head on Tuesday as John Higgins takes on Mark Williams with a place in the World Championship semi-finals up for grabs. The sport's legendary 'Class of 92', with Ronnie O'Sullivan completing the trio, have won 14 world titles between them - and are all still going strong this year. Williams turned 50 last month, Higgins reaches his half century 13 days after this year's final with O'Sullivan celebrating his 50th birthday in December. But they have again proved that age is just a number. Could one of them again go all the way at the Crucible? The first session of their best-of-25 quarter-final takes place on Tuesday at 10:00 BST, with the second session at 19:00 BST, before the match is played to a finish from 10:00 BST on Wednesday Williams has become the oldest man to reach the last eight at the Crucible since six-time winner Steve Davis did so at the age of 52 back in 2010. But one of Williams' oldest opponents stands in his way. \"Twenty years ago, we were really big rivals - now we walk into the practice room and we give each other a nod as if to say: 'How are we still here competing with everybody?'\" said Higgins. It is a sentiment Williams agrees with. \"Normally the older you get, the worse you get,\" he said. \"Your eyes are going, everything is going and your stamina drops a bit and you get tired a lot more easier. \"But somehow us three are hanging around like a bad smell.\" With O'Sullivan in the opposite half of the draw a final between two of the 'Class of 92', named after the year they turned professional, is a real possibility. \"If one of those three players was to win the World Championship, maybe beat a young whippersnapper in the final, what an achievement that would be. Maybe their best ever achievement,\" said Davis. Fifteen years ago, Davis defeated Mark King 10-9 in the Crucible first round, won 13-11 against a then-34-year-old Higgins, the reigning champion, before losing 13-5 to eventual winner Neil Robertson in the last eight. \"It was a fantastic buzz, I maybe ran out of belief,\" recalled Davis. \"Hopefully they don't do that. They are much more in touch with the top part of the game than I was.\" Mark Williams and John Higgins at the China Open in March 2006 The trio's achievements are legendary. O'Sullivan has seven world titles, Higgins four and Williams three. If any of them lift the trophy on Monday, 5 May, they would become the oldest winner in the modern era, breaking O'Sullivan's record when he won it three years ago, aged 46. Thirty-three years ago they were all hungry, driven, talented teenagers with the desire to reach the top. Williams described how he first met Higgins at the final of an event in 1990, when they were both 15. \"We played in the final and he beat me,\" said the Welshman. \"It was live on TV and he beat me 6-1, he had five grand for a win, I had three grand for runner-up. \"We then played in the British Under-16s in Birmingham and I thrashed him 4-0 after 50 minutes and I got 200 quid so I was a week late. \"That was the first time I really remembered John as it was me and O'Sullivan playing in all the junior events when we were 13 and 14.\" Williams and Higgins have their own Crucible history and have met five times, with four victories for Williams, including an 18-16 success in an epic showdown in the 2018 final. \"That world final was one of the best games I've ever been involved in and people say it was the best final ever,\" said Williams. Williams hopes eye surgery in June will help to extend his snooker career Ken Doherty, the 1997 world champion, played against the 'Class of 92' throughout his career and felt this match was \"the tie of the round\". \"They've been at the top of the game since 1992, 33 years, and are still at the top and still producing,\" the Irishman said. \"As you get older it becomes a lot more difficult as players like me, Stephen Hendry, Alan McManus, Peter Ebdon have all found out. It's hard to cope in terms of tension, intensity and also to be able to devote your life to the game. \"You become a father, a family man and it's hard to dedicate themselves to the game but they still have the appetite, willingness and hunger and that's an incredible talent as well. \"I've been logging heads with them for 30 years. I've beaten them all but also lost to them all in big finals. I just had great times playing them and you used to relish it as it was a great test of your own game.\" Doherty, who is part of the BBC TV team for the competition, felt the atmosphere would be electric. \"When you see them coming into the Crucible for their match they will get a standing ovation as they did in the Masters,\" he added. \"We might not see the kind of these three again so we have to enjoy them while we can. They've given the sport great entertainment, great matches and are still delivering.\" Shaun Murphy tipped Judd Trump, who beat him 13-10 on Monday, to win the title but thought the Williams-Higgins clash would be \"fabulous for the sport\". He added: \"The Class of 92 are three of the best players we've ever seen and it's wonderful we still get to watch them. \"None of them would be here if they didn't want to be, they obviously love it enough to put themselves through it.\" Ronnie O'Sullivan became the oldest man in the modern era to become world champion with his victory over Judd Trump in the 2022 final World number one Trump will play the winner of Williams-Higgins in the semi-final if he triumphs in his own quarter-final against Luca Brecel. Trump felt the veteran trio would continue to feature at the top level for years to come. \"They inspired me a little bit, especially Ronnie and John when I younger,\" said Trump. \"Ronnie was someone I really looked up to. They're miles away from retiring and not far from their absolute best. \"When I played Williams in the semi-finals (when Trump won a final-frame decider for a 17-16 win in 2022) I've never seen him play like that. \"These three could be here when they're 65 if they wanted to be.\" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Champions League run 'a beautiful story' but Arteta wants 'much more'",
    "article_text": "Arsenal are in the semi-finals of the Champions League for only the third time Arsenal's run to the Champions League semi-finals has been a \"beautiful story\" but the Gunners \"want much more\", says manager Mikel Arteta as they prepare to host Paris St-Germain. Arteta said Tuesday's first leg (20:00 BST) is \"one of the biggest games the Emirates Stadium has seen\", and called on fans to \"play every ball together\". Arsenal beat reigning champions Real Madrid5-1 on aggregatein the quarter-finals  and will now face French side PSG, who they beat 2-0 in the league phase in October. The Gunners, who have never won the Champions League, last reached the semi-finals in 2009 where they suffered a 4-1 aggregate defeat by Manchester United. Managed by Arsene Wenger, they also lost the 2006 final to Barcelona. \"You feel [the weight of history],\" said Arteta on the eve of the semi-final first leg. \"Especially because we have a lot of people who have worked at this club for many, many years and they've never been in this position. That tells you how unique and beautiful this is. \"We are making history. It's a beautiful story right now - but we want much more.\" Arsenal's season has been hampered by injuries to key players including Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Ben White. They have won only one of their past four Premier League matches, which helped Liverpool clinch the title on Sunday with four games to spare. But in Europe they have won six of their eight league-phase games and also beat PSV Eindhoven 9-3 on aggregate in the last 16 on their way to the semi-finals. Arteta added: \"The fact that we are here as one of the four best teams in Europe, it tells about the mindset, spirit and how much we really want it.\" His squad will be boosted by the return of Mikel Merino and White to training, but Arteta also challenged the Gunners faithful to create an even better atmosphere than in the 3-0 win against Real Madrid. \"I'm not exaggerating. Guys, bring your boots, your shorts and T-shirt and let's play every ball together,\" said Areta, who is eyeing his first major silverware at the club since the FA Cup in 2020. \"You want to do something special? That place has to be something special. Something we haven't seen.\" A fluffed Panenka, controversy & 'statement win' for Arsenal 'He was immense' - Rice lauded as 'one of the best on the planet' Superb Arsenal defeat Real to reach semi-finals Goals from Kai Havertz and Bukayo Saka inflicted a 2-0 defeat on Luis Enrique's PSG in October Paris St-Germain looked far from serious Champions League contenders when they lost to Arsenal in the league phase. The Ligue 1 side only won once and lost three of their first five games in Europe before squeezing through to the knockout-phase play-offs in 15th place. But Luis Enrique believes his side are \"a more complete team\" seven months on. \"I think there are some big differences [from the Arsenal defeat],\" the PSG manager said. \"I watched that match again and saw our progress. I think we're a better team and we've shown that throughout the competition. \"We had the toughest league phase. At first I thought it was detrimental, but in the end it was positive because it helped us progress. \"We are a more complete team and we now want to write a page in history.\" PSG, who were crowned domestic champions again this month, are aiming for a first Champions League title despite the exits of Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar. After beating fellow French club Brest 10-0 on aggregate in the play-offs, they overcame successive English opponents in Liverpool and Aston Villa. Before the semi-final, Luis Enrique said he sees similarities between his side and Arteta's Arsenal. \"They are built as a team with collective strength - you can see that from the way they attack and defend,\" he said. \"They do everything together. Of course, they have some top-level players, just like we do, but they don't rely on just one player. They have had injuries throughout the season but they continue to perform at a high level.\" Latest Champions League table Champions League scores & fixtures Follow the latest Champions League news Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Get football news sent straight to your phone Watch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 BST on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app. There will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.

    "article_text": "Vaibhav Suryavanshi has 151 runs from three IPL matches this season Indian Premier League, Jaipur Gujarat Titans 209-4 (20 overs):Gill 84 (50), Buttler 50* (26) Rajasthan Royals 212-2 (15.5 overs):Suryavanshi 101 (38), Jaiswal 70* (40) Rajasthan Royals won by eight wickets Scorecard;Table Rajasthan Royals' 14-year-old batter Vaibhav Suryavanshi made history as the youngest player to hit a century in men's T20s. Suryavanshi pulled Rashid Khan for six to bring up the second fastest hundred in the Indian Premier League (IPL) - and fastest by an Indian player - from 35 balls. The teenage left-hander smashed seven fours and 11 sixes before he was eventually bowled for a stunning 101 from 38 balls as the Royals romped to a eight-wicket win over Gujarat Titans. Suryavanshi, who only turned 14 last month and was signed at last year's auction for Â£103,789 (1.1 crore rupees), became theyoungest player to feature in the IPLearlier in April and made an immediate impact by hitting his first ball for six. He showed all of that same swagger in Jaipur as he dismantled the Gujarat attack to ensure Rajasthan made light work of a chase of 210 for victory. Suryavanshi put on 166 with India batter Yashasvi Jaiswal, who ended unbeaten on 70 from 40, in a remarkable display of hitting. A maximum over deep mid-wicket brought up the century in the 11th over and only West Indies great Chris Gayle, with a 30-ball ton for Royal Challengers Bengaluru against Pune Warriors in 2013, has got to the milestone quicker in the IPL. Victory ended a run of five straight losses for Rajasthan to keep their slim hopes of making the knockout stages alive. Meanwhile, Gujarat - for whom Shubman Gill made 84 from 50 balls and former England skipper Jos Buttler hit an unbeaten half-century in a losing cause - drop to third in the IPL table on net run-rate. Suryavanshi became the youngest player to be signed by an IPL team when he was picked up at the auction after a bidding war last year. He made headlines last October when, aged 13, he scored a 58-ball century for India Under-19s in a Youth Test against Australia Under-19s in Chennai. Suryavanshi was also part of India's Under-19 Asia Cup squad last year. There he scored 176 runs at an average of 44. He plays first-class cricket for Bihar, a state in eastern India where he grew up, and made his debut aged 12 last January. He has played five Ranji Trophy matches for Bihar and has scored 100 runs with a highest score of 41.

    "title": "'I have to think of something special' -  the story of Salah's selfie",
    "article_text": "Mohamed Salah celebrated his goal against Spurs with a mobile phone Mohamed Salah's selfie celebration during Liverpool's Premier League title-clinching win over Tottenham Hotspur has become an iconic moment. The Egyptian scored the Reds' fourth goal in Sunday's5-1 victory at Anfieldand, after celebrating his strike, borrowed a phone from a staff member before taking a photograph of himself and the cheering Liverpool fans behind him. But some have asked could it have been a marketing idea, because the phone Salah used is made by one of Liverpool's sponsors. \"At the beginning of the season I always take selfies with players [who score], so for this one I said 'OK, I have to think of something special because it's a picture that's going to be there forever',\" Salah told BBC Sport. Salah, 32, has frequently posted selfies with Reds team-mates on social media, while his recent two-year contract extension announcement included a self-taken photograph. Initially observers thought Salah had taken the phone off a fan in the crowd, but it was a Liverpool staff member located behind the advertising hoardings in front of the Kop. The photograph, which Salah and Liverpool posted on their social media accounts, has millions of likes and views. But it has courted some controversy with observers wondering if it was a natural celebration, or an advert for Google Pixel, an official partner of the club. In response, others have pointed out they could not know Salah would have scored - and none of the first three goalscorers did this celebration - although it was his 33rd goal of the season so not much of a surprise. Various Liverpool players have taken part in adverts for Google this season on social media and TV. Liverpool announce Premier League victory parade 'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny' 'Liverpool still need new blood' - where will Slot strengthen? Post-match Salah took selfies again - which Google Pixel posted on social media. Salah could have been booked for delaying the restart of play with the celebration, but referee Thomas Bramall kept his cards in his pocket. Team-mate Cody Gakpo had earlier been shown a yellow card for celebrating his goal to make it 3-1 by taking off his shirt to reveal an 'I belong to Jesus' T-shirt. BBC Sport has asked Liverpool and the Football Association (FA) for comment on the Salah selfie story. The FA has rules around advertising on kits and betting companies - but there do not appear to be specific rules prohibiting something like this incident,  even if it was intentional marketing. Despite all the hype, Salah is far from the first footballer to celebrate a goal with a selfie. Perhaps the highest-profile one until now was Roma forward Francesco Totti doing so after scoring in a 2015 derby against Lazio. Then 38, he was handed a phone by one of Roma's coaches before taking the photo in front of the club's fans. But plenty of other players have done it too. Mario Balotelli also made headlines for a selfie,filming his goal celebrationwith his team-mates in Marseille's win over Saint-Etienne in 2019. Allow Instagram content?

    "article_text": "Oleksandr Usyk wearing a light blue tracksuit is pushed by Daniel Dubois, wearing a blue suit, on the pitch at Wembley on Monday Oleksandr Usyk says Daniel Dubois showed \"weakness\" by pushing him during their face-off as they promoted their rematch to become the undisputed world heavyweight champion at London's Wembley Stadium  on 19 July. Briton Dubois is the IBF champion, with Ukraine's Usyk holding the WBA (Super), WBO and WBC belts. Usyk is undefeated in 23 fights and beat Dubois, 27, via aninth-round stoppagein August 2023. A day after their fight was confirmed, the pair posed for pictures on the pitch at Wembley on Monday when Dubois shoved 38-year-old Usyk in the chest. Security stepped in between the pair before Usyk turned away and began laughing. When asked if Dubois had improved since their last fight two years ago, Usyk told BBC Sport: \"I think he has, Daniel wins the IBF belt, has beaten three good fighters. He is a world champion, a hard man, a dangerous man.\" Asked if the Englishman had changed mentally, Usyk replied: \"Mentally no, push is a weakness.\" Explaining why he pushed Usyk, Dubois said: \"It's a new me, the fear of acting in a particular way is not there any more, now I need to just do what I need to do, this is the fight game, this is boxing.\" There was controversy the last time they fought when Usyk was floored in the fifth round but the punch was declared a low blow by the referee. Promoter Frank Warrenlost an appealto the WBA for Dubois' loss to Usyk to be ruled a no contest and that a rematch be ordered. Dubois said Usyk caused him \"a lot of pain and frustration\" but it \"helped me to reach even further\" He added: \"It will feel even better when it's done, when I have knocked him out and won.

    "title": "Who are the big winners & losers from the NFL Draft?",
    "article_text": "Colorado team-mates Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders had contrasting fortunes at the NFL Draft As usual the NFL Draft provided plenty of talking points, with Shedeur Sanders' epic slide and the Jacksonville Jaguars trading up two of the biggest. There was not quite the depth of star names involved this year but still plenty of intrigue, and although you can never really gauge just how well teams have done there are clear opinions on both. Cam Ward was picked first by the Tennessee Titans but there has been none of the fanfare that usually accompanies that selection, as it was widely expected and there was plenty of drama elsewhere. But who have been seen as the big winners and losers from the draft in Green Bay? All 32 picks from the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft Titans select Ward first in NFL Draft but Sanders snubbed Travis Hunter is seen as one of the brightest NFL prospects for years Seen as the best receiver and the best cornerback in the entire draft, Travis Hunter could be one of the biggest stars for years in the league. So much so that the Jacksonville Jaguars gave the Cleveland Browns their second-round pick and next year's first rounder to grab him at number two in the draft. Baby faced Jaguars general manager James Gladstone is just 34, the second-youngest to ever hold the position with an NFL team, and he has signalled his intentions to be aggressive from the very start. It is a bold move, but star players can help teams build empires in the NFL, and having a difference maker on both offence and defence is something the league has hardly ever seen before. Hunter will primarily play as a wide receiver at first, forming an explosive partnership with Brian Thomas Jr that gives quarterback Trevor Lawrence immense firepower. If Hunter can also work his magic in limited defensive packages then the Jags really could have pulled off a masterstroke. Where do you start with Shedeur Sanders? In truth, not being picked in the first round was not that big a shock as only a handful of teams were in the market for a first-round quarterback, and not many held a pressing need for a QB at all. And despite what his famous father Deion Sanders proclaimed, the Colorado quarterback did not show truly elite, NFL talent in college. Dropping down to the fifth round at pick 144 overall was a surprise though, as five other quarterbacks were taken before him - including by the Cleveland Browns who eventually picked up Sanders. Sanders had a lavish draft party set up but had to watch as pick by pick and round by round went by without his name being called, and although he took it with good grace that really would have hurt. Some say he has an entitled, arrogant personality that caused his slide, some say it was personal - but now he has to prove himself in a crowded quarterback room in Cleveland at a team that picked six other players, including a quarterback, ahead of him. And such is the new way of college athletes being able to get paid, Sanders has already earned millions as a big name with lucrative marketing deals - but his draft slide has cost him, as his fifth-round contract will be about $5m (Â£3.7m), when even being a low first-round pick would have earned him about $18m (Â£13.5m). Sanders selected by Browns as NFL Draft's 144th pick Was Sanders always the plan for the Cleveland Browns? All you want to see from your team at the draft is a plan, and if the Browns have one they disguised it pretty well. It could still be a success if a number of gambles pay off - notably passing up the chance to pick Hunter, which could be a massive mistake if he becomes a league legend. The extra first-round pick they have next year though could make it look inspired. And then there is picking Sanders as their second quarterback, after also selecting Dillon Gabriel earlier. The expensive but injured Deshaun Watson, veteran former Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett are joined by two rookies all vying for a starting spot. A best case scenario sees both Gabriel and Sanders push each other into a genuine quarterback battle with both being quality choices, but it could also lead to more misery at the position for the Browns. And famous father Deion Sanders will not be quiet in the background if things do not go his son's way. The Las Vegas Raiders have made some dodgy picks down the years, but with veteran head coach Pete Carroll and part-owner Tom Brady to lean on, first-time general manager John Spytek delivered a very solid draft. He made 11 pretty reasonable picks - starting with a star running back in Ashton Jeanty who together with veteran quarterback Geno Smith could give the offence new life. They picked two wide receivers and added a third with Montana State quarterback Tommy Mellott expected to switch to wideout and special teams. And Brady will certainly have been consulted about their sixth-round quarterback selection Cam Miller from North Dakota State. Miller had 9,721 passing yards and 81 touchdowns in college, but also ran for 2,277 yards and 48 rushing scores, so could be one to watch if he develops as Smith's back-up. The Atlanta Falcons needed a pass rush but maybe they went overboard trying to solve it, when not only selecting Jalon Walker with the 15th pick overall but also doing an ambitious trade to get back into the first round. They gave up a first rounder next year to draft James Pearce Jr, by no means a slam dunk, and a hefty price to pay for a bit of a swing. Atalanta have form though as they drafted quarterback Michaal Penix Jr in last year's first round despite handing Kirk Cousins $100m just before it. The questionable trade was followed by sheer embarrassment as it emerged the son of Atlanta's defensive co-ordinator Jeff Ulbrichmade a prank call to Sanderspretending to be the New Orleans Saints about to draft him. The Falcons issued an apology, as did 21-year-old Jax Ulbrich, but it still left a bitter taste.

    "title": "Trump’s first 100 days supercharged a global ‘freefall of rights’, says Amnesty",
    "article_text": "The first 100 days of Donald Trump’s presidency have “supercharged” a global rollback of human rights, pushing the world towards an authoritarian era defined by impunity and unchecked corporate power,Amnesty Internationalwarns today. In its annual report on the state of human rights in 150 countries, the organisation said the immediate ramifications of Trump’s second term had been the undermining of decades of progress and the emboldening of authoritarian leaders. Describing a “freefall” in human rights, the report said growing inaction over the climate crisis, violent crackdowns on dissent and a mounting backlash against the rights of migrants, refugees, women, girls and LGBTQ+ people could be traced to the so-called Trump effect. Amnesty warned the situation would deteriorate further this year as Trump continued to dismantle therules-based world orderthat Washington helped to build from the devastation of the second world war. Sacha Deshmukh,Amnesty InternationalUK’s chief executive, described the US president’s swift and deliberate targeting of international institutions designed to make the world safer and fairer as “terrifying”. “You look forward to the end of this decade and wonder whether the basic frameworks and underpinnings of not just human rights but international law will still be standing. You probably haven’t been able to say that since 1935,” he said. Amnesty’s report also documents how mass arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances and lethal force are becoming increasingly widespread tools of repression. InBangladesh, “shoot-on-sight”orders duringstudent protestsled to hundreds of deaths;Mozambique’s disputed electionssimilarly sparked a deadly crackdown; and Turkey also imposeddraconian bans on demonstrations. The report also identified global inaction as an area of concern, particularly in relation toSudan’s ruinous civil war. One of the warring sides there, the Rapid Support Forces, has been accused ofrepeatedly carrying out mass sexual violenceagainst women and girls yet international action remains muted. Trump’s sweepingforeign aid cutshad made conditions worse across the world, Amnesty said, closing crucial programmes in states such as Yemen and Syria, leaving children and survivors of conflict without access to food, shelter or healthcare. Amnesty also raised concerns over failures to uphold international humanitarian law, citingIsrael’s military operations in Gaza. In Europe, Amnesty said Russia killed more Ukrainian civilians in 2024 than the previous year and continued to target non-military infrastructure. Trump is proposing that Ukraine cede territory to Russia as part ofpeace proposals dismissed as appeasementby critics. Sign up toGlobal Dispatch Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team after newsletter promotion Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said: “Trump has shown only utter contempt for universal human rights – emboldening anti-rights movements worldwide and letting corporate allies run amok.” Looking further ahead, the report warned that governments risked failing future generations on the climate, economic inequality and corporate power. It cited thecollapse of the UN’s Cop29 climate conference, under fossil-fuel corporations’ influence, while rich countries “bullied” low-income nations into accepting inadequate climate financing. Trump’s exit from the crucialParis climate agreementthreatened “to drag others with him”, Amnesty warned. Elsewhere, against a backdrop of scapegoating migrants, “billionaires gained wealth as global poverty reduction stalled”, it said. Women, girls and LGBTQ+ people faced intensifying attacks in a number of countries including Afghanistan and Iran, while LGBTQ+ rights were targeted in Uganda, Georgia and Bulgaria. “TheTrump administrationfanned the flames, cutting support for gender equality and dismantling protections for trans people and women globally,” Amnesty said.",

    "title": "African diplomats urge UK government to back bill to speed up debt restructurings",
    "article_text": "Diplomats from eight southern and east African countries have signed a letter calling on the UK government to support a private member’s bill that aims to speed up debt restructurings, after economic crises meant countries were unable to pay back loans. Poor countries’ economies have been hit by a series of global events in recent years, including the coronavirus pandemic, which reduced growth; the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which sent inflation soaring; and raised US interest rates, which have pushed up the cost of international loans to often unaffordable levels. Since 2020, countries including Zambia, Sri Lanka and Ghana have defaulted on their overseas debts. Countries that can no longer afford to repay their debts have to negotiate loan writedowns or extensions with lenders including state-owned development banks from China, the US and Europe, in a process known as a debt restructuring. A growing number of poorer countries would also need to restructure loans from private banks and international bonds owned by western companies, which are typically more expensive. Most poor countries have cheap loans from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which give new “concessional” loans instead of writing down old ones. The UK bill, introduced in November 2024 by the Labour MP Bambos Charalambous, would “prevent private creditors suing countries while debt relief negotiations are taking place, and from seeking higher repayments than other creditors”, said a letter sent to the British chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in March and shared exclusively with the Guardian. The average developing country is spending 9.5% of government revenues repaying debt, double the level of a decade ago. The poorest countries are spending 15%,according to the UN development programme. From 2012 to 2022, public spending on debt grewfaster than on health and education. The letter said “90% of debt owed to private creditors by the world’s poorest countries is governed by English law and is transacted through the City of London. This is why any relief from undue profit to private lenders relies on your government.” Signatories included high commissioners to the UK from Zambia, Mozambique and South Africa, which has made tackling the “unprecedented debt crisis among many African countries” a priority of its G20 presidency this year. Charalambous said he hoped the government would adopt the bill and that he had met the Treasury minister Emma Reynolds. A UK government spokesperson said: “The UK fully agrees that private creditors should participate in restructurings on comparable terms. Overall, we have seen evidence of private creditors’ willingness to engage and provide debt treatments where needed, including for Zambia and Ghana. “As such, the UK is not currently pursuing a legislative approach to ensuring private creditor participation in restructurings, although we continue to keep our position under review.” After the Covid pandemic hit, lending countries agreed to pause debt repayments. However, western private creditors refused, an issue that aggrieved China. Zambia stopped repaying its international debts in November 2020. Along with Ethiopia and Chad it sought to restructure its loans in early 2021 under a new G20 process called the common framework. However, the process was fraught with delays. It took 17 months for Chad to reach adeal that did not cut debt levels, after the commodities trader Glencore dragged out negotiations. Chinese intransigence reportedlyheld up Zambia’s agreement with lending countries until 2023. Those countries thenrejected a dealthe Zambia government reached with western bondholders, as they said it was better than their deal. A bonds agreement was finally reachedin 2024. Some officials and analysts argued the UK bill was targeting a prior problem of western “vulture funds” buying up poor countries’ defaulted bonds to sue them for payouts. They said recent restructurings had been delayed by the proliferation of new types of lenders, including Chinese state-owned institutions and African multilateral trade banks. Abebe Aemro Selassie, the IMF’s Africa director, told a press conference last week that he was not sure new legislation would speed up debt restructurings: “In recent restructurings, I am not aware of [private creditors holding out] being the main hindrance.” Since 2014, the inclusion of “collective action clauses” – where the owners of 75% of a country’s bonds can approve a restructuring deal – in 88% of bonds has stopped most “vulture fund” minority bondholders from suing countries,the thinktank ODI said in a report. However, Ethiopia’s negotiations to cut the value of its single bond have reportedly beendelayed by a bondholder group. In Zambia, Malawi and Ghana, the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) and Trade & Development Bank (TDB) have not agreed to loan writedowns. Both are regional trade banks set up by African governments that lend at high interest rates but havedemanded to be excluded from restructuringslike the IMF and World Bank. Spokespeople for Afreximbank and TDB did not respond to requests for comment. “Non-bond private creditors … are very different … and it is unlikely that the solutions provided in the [UK] bill would apply easily to them,” said Frederique Dahan, a director at ODI. Malawi, which has a GDP per headof $580, has been trying to get debt writedowns while being battered by climate and economic shocks that have led to fuel, fertiliser and medicine shortages. Thomas Bisika, Malawi’s high commissioner to the UK and who signed the letter supporting Charalambous’s bill, said: “This unsustainable debt has really grossly affected social and economic development in the country.”",

    "title": "Fears of Boko Haram comeback stir in Nigerian birthplace of Maiduguri",
    "article_text": "On the road running from Maiduguri’s airport to the city, the freshly repainted walls of a girls’ college stood in defiant opposition to a years-long campaign by the jihadists ofBoko Haramto make good on their name, which translates as “western education is forbidden”. At a nearby roundabout on the outskirts of the capital of Nigeria’s north-eastern Borno state, three uniformed men sprinted after a cement truck, hoping to collect a road levy. As the driver sped away, they slowed down in the 42C heat, smiled regretfully, and waited for the next heavy duty vehicle to pass. At the peak of Boko Haram’s 15-year insurgency, bombs went off with frightening regularity at the popular Monday market. But the city –known as the birthplace of Boko Haram– has not suffered a major attack since February 2021, and the low-key security atmosphere reflected its relative tranquility. The group was founded in 2002, but its campaign of terror took off in 2009, after the killing of its founder, Mohammed Yusuf, by police in July of that year. More than 36,000 people were killed and 2.2 million others displaced. In one particularly notorious incident 11 years ago this month, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls from a school in the town of Chibok. Many outside the region assumed the insurgency had been extinguished, but on 8 April this year Borno’s governor, Babagana Zulum, issued a troubling warning: Boko Haram was staging a comeback. Zulum told a meeting of security agents that renewed attacks and kidnappings were occurring “almost on a daily basis without confrontation”, in a sign that the state’s authorities were “losing ground”. Zulum made the warning less than a month after gunmen raided two military bases in Borno and his security convoyreportedly intercepteda Boko Haram ambush attempt. The number of fatalities in both cases remains unclear. In response to Zulum, a spokesperson for the military authorities said: “The military is sacrificing a lot, and our efforts should be appreciated.” Nigeria’s information minister, Mohammed Idris, also said the armed groups have been “largely dissipated”, toeing the tone of his predecessor Lai Mohammed, who in 2015 said they had been “technically defeated”. “We’re not saying that we have 100% exterminated Boko Haram,” Idris said after the security meeting. “But I think that we’ve degraded Boko Haram significantly for them to pose any kind of significant challenge for us as a country.” Zulum fired back: “I believe he is naive about what is happening in the country.” In recent years, a multinational coalition between Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria has reclaimed territory controlled by Boko Haram and helped to secure garrison towns from attacks. The group has simultaneously been weakened by a split into two factions that often fight among themselves. In January 2024, Bola Tinubu, Nigeria’s president, promised to “stamp out the remaining vestiges of Boko Haram, Ansaru, banditry and kidnapping gangs”. “We won’t rest until every agent of darkness is completely rooted out,” he added. However, analysts have said troops are struggling to contain jihadists in the “Timbuktu Triangle” – a term referencing the Malian city, a former jihadist stronghold – and used to denote an area stretching from eastern Yobe state into western Borno. Beyond the attacks on army bases,local reportssaid 40 farmers were reportedly killed and several others kidnapped by Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) in January. The latter faction split to ally with Islamic State and has taken on a different style, taxing some villages and small towns that they control and remitting taxes to commanders. There are also fears that thousands of displaced households sent from camps back to their villages under a resettlement scheme may now be under threat. As long as ago as 2023 the International Crisis Group warned of the resettlement scheme: “The hasty process is endangering displaced people’s lives – putting them closer to the fighting and cutting them off from support. By exposing civilians to hardship, the government risks giving jihadist groups an opportunity to forge ties with relocated communities and draw benefits from their economic activities.” The situation in Yobe is tense. In September34 peoplewere killed in an attack, then in Marcha pro-Tinubu media outletreported that villagers in Gujba, where more than 40 studentswere massacred in 2013, had been given eviction notices by Boko Haram for helping the army defeat the jihadists in a recent battle. The authorities claimed there was “no credible intelligence” backing the report. In late March,Niger withdrew from the military coalition, prompting concerns about intelligence sharing and the capacity to keep jihadists at bay after the exit of French and American troopsfrom the Sahel. A new and much bigger regional force, established this year, is yet to get on its feet. In Maiduguri, some say the Tinubu administration has been complacent and accuse thenational security adviserof being more focused on political matters. In a clinic in the city, an aid worker who wanted to remain anonymous watched student nurses roam the hallways. “Everybody has forgotten Maiduguri,” they said.",

    "title": "Mothers deported by Trump ‘denied’ chance to transfer custody of children, lawyer says",
    "article_text": "Two women who were deported toHondurasalongside their US citizen children were held in “complete isolation” and denied any opportunity to coordinate the care and custody of their children before being put on a flight, according to one of the lawyers representing them. The mothers were unable to contact attorneys or loved ones, and were not allowed the option to transfer the custody of their citizen children to another parent or caregiver, said Gracie Willis, an attorney with the National Immigration Project who is representing one of the families and coordinating with the team representing the other family. “Here we had moms held completely in isolation, being told what was happening to their children. They didn’t have an opportunity to talk this through, to weigh the pros and cons of taking or leaving their children in the US,” Willis said. One of the mothers, who was deported with her seven-year-old and her four-year-old, both of whom are citizens, was unable to access medications and care for her youngest, who has a rare form of late-stage cancer. Another woman, who is pregnant, was put on a plane to Honduras along with her 11-year-old and two-year-old daughters, even as the children’s father and a caretaker designated by the family were desperately trying to contact them. “She’s in the early stages of a pregnancy and has undergone unimaginable stress,” said Willis. “So she’s trying to ensure her and that unborn child’s safety and health, while also processing and working through what they’ve all been through.” Both families were detained at regular check-in appointments with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in New Orleans, according to lawyers, and then taken hours away from the city and prohibited from communicating with family members. Each year, hundreds of thousands of immigrant parents in similar situations, who have both a deportation order and US citizen children, have to choose whether to leave their kids in the US under the care of another family member or guardian, or surrender them to Child Protective Services. “No parent would want to be in that situation,” Willis said. “And we don’t bring any judgment against any decision that a parent makes.” But the mothers who were rushed on to deportation flights with their children last week, in high-profile cases that have drawn widespread condemnation from civil rights groups and lawmakers, were not empowered to make any real choices for their families, Willis said. “There were no real decisions being made here, especially when those parents were not able to communicate with other available caregivers,” she added. After lawyers for VML, the two-year-old who is identified in court documents by only her initials, filed an emergency motion to prevent the US citizen toddler’s deportation, a federal district judge raised concerns that he had a “strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process”. A hearing in VML’s case has been scheduled for 18 May. Meanwhile, theTrump administrationhas been claiming that the family’s cases were handled legally and with due process. Trump’s border czar,Tom Homan, said: “The children aren’t deported. The mother chose to take the children with her.” In an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press, the secretary of state,Marco Rubio, echoed Homan, saying: “I imagine those three US citizen children have fathers here in the United States. They can stay with their father. That’s up to their family to decide where the children go.” The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion But VML’s father had been desperately trying to reach his partner and retrieve his toddler in the days leading up to the deportation, Willis said. On 22 April, VML’s mother had been told to bring her children to her check-in with Ice, according to Willis. The father, who had brought them to the check-in appointment, began to worry that the appointment was taking longer than usual – and was later told that his partner and daughters had been detained. When he was eventually able to speak to them, he could hear his partner and daughter crying on the phone and his call was cut off before he was able to give them a number for the family’s attorneys. The government told him that it had removal orders for VML’s mother and her 11-year-old sister, who was not born in the US, and that their mother was choosing to also take VML to Honduras with them. They pointed to a handwritten letter, which they say was written by the mother, that reads in Spanish: “I will take my daughter ... with me to Honduras.” But the family’s lawyers dispute that the letter proves their consent, especially given that the parents weren’t allowed to coordinate VML’s release. They had wanted the toddler to be handed over to a US citizen that the family had chosen to serve as VML’s legal custodian. “The mom was never asked what she wanted. She was told, your child will be deported with you,” Willis said. Before their deportation, both families had been dutifully complying with Ice ordersto regularly check-in. VML’s mother had arrived at the US southern border during the “remain in Mexico” program instituted during the first Trump administration, which forced non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait south of the border while their cases were processed. The mother, and her now 11-year-old, had reported to an initial appointment with immigration officials but had been kidnapped in Mexico – and were unable to attend their second immigration hearing. When the mother and daughter managed to return and seek safety in the United States, immigration officials released them into the country on the condition that they regularly check-in – which they had been doing for about four years, according to Willis. The other woman deported with her children had entered the US as an unaccompanied minor child, and had been issued deportation orders after she failed to report at a hearing that she was not aware was happening, as she never received a summons, Willis said.",

    "title": "Canadians head to polls in election upturned by Trump",
    "article_text": "Canadians head to the polls in a federal election overshadowed by fury at Donald Trump’s threats to the country’s sovereignty and fears over his escalating trade war. In the final days of a month-long campaign – described by all party leaders as the most consequential general election in a lifetime – the US president yet again re-inserted himself into the national discussion, with fresh threats to annex the country. “We don’t need anything fromCanada. And I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state,” he told Time magazine on Friday. On election day itself, Trump resumed his provocations with a social media post suggesting he was on the ballot and repeating that Canada should become the 51st state, incorrectly claiming that the US subsidizes Canada. “It makes no sense unless Canada is a State!” Trump posted. The Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, responded to Trump with a post of his own. “President Trump, stay out of our election. The only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box,” Poilievre posted. “Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st state.” As recently as January, Poilievre was poised for the largest and most resounding electoral victory in more than half a century.Canadianpollsters and political pundits struggled to find fresh ways to describe the bleak prospects for the then prime ministerJustin Trudeau’s Liberal party, which seemed on track for a catastrophic blowout. The party trailed the Conservatives by as many as 27 points in some polls. But Trump’s detonation of the US’s closest diplomatic and economic relationship has fundamentally reshaped how many feel about their southern neighbour and heavily influenced how Mark Carney, the former central banker who inherited control of the Liberal party to become prime minister in mid-March, has shaped his electoral bid. That framing has the possibility of producing a result that would have been unfathomable three months ago. Now the Conservatives’ chances of an electoral victory are slim – and would require a significant polling miss and a groundswell of support in key battlegrounds. “Almost everything about this campaign is without precedent. For the first time in Canada’s history, our closest geographic, economic and security partner has placed us in the crosshairs, disrupting our sense of economic and physical security,” said Scott Reid, a political adviser and former director of communications to the Liberal former prime minister Paul Martin. “And then you have this unprecedented situation where Mark Carney, with no electoral experience emerges on to the scene, reverses a 26-point deficit in his party’s fortunes and takes them to the brink of a majority victory. [There’s’] nothing about this that’s happened before. It’s not just that it’s unprecedented, it’s that it’s enormously consequential in all of its implications. It’s all jaw-dropping.” Still, the prospect of a fourth consecutive Liberal term has frustrated many in the country, who see a government that was unable to rein in a cost of living crisis on the verge of retaining power. “Ten years of a Liberal government is a long time. They had their shot. And the changes they made are for the worst. We need a new government, we need new ideas, new people and new ministers,” said Sam, who lives in a new housing development in Carney’s electoral district in Ottawa. He said that although Carney cast himself as a novice, the Liberal leader was a “political insider”, adding: “I’m not saying he’s not a qualified person. But he’s also a businessman. So is Trump. Look how that’s turned out for everyone.” Running on a message of change, Poilievre, a seven-term parliamentarian, has attracted thousands to his energetic rallies across Canada, and won over young voters attracted by his response to the country’s cost of living crisis. “Canadians are asking the simple question: can we really afford to allow Mark Carney to have the fourth term of Justin Trudeau, raising exactly the same taxes, running exactly the same deficits, doubling exactly the same housing costs, with exactly the same Liberal team?” Poilievre said during a campaign stop in the city of Saskatoon, a Tory stronghold. “There’s a generational divide in the country and real questions of whether the Canadian dream is achievable any more. Poilievre was beating the drums about this and Trudeau’s popularity was plummeting. And exactly the wrong moment, we have this threat to the south of us and it completely overturned the tables in Canadian politics,” said Melanie Paradis, the president of Texture Communications and director of communications for the former Conservative leader Erin O’Toole. “And the question is, what’s at stake? For the older generation, it’s the sovereignty and integrity of Canada. The existential threat to their future is Trump [but] the existential threat to the future of the younger generation is being able to own a home and start a family.” That shift in political calculus puts the Conservatives in a difficult place. “We’ve had a bizarre reversal of fortunes. We used to be so reliably strong with the older demographic – people who you could really count on to show up and vote on election day,” said Paradis. “Now we have an incredibly strong showing among young voters, but now we’ve lost the support of senior men.” A race dominated by the two main party’s leaders is also poised to devastate smaller opposition parties, all of which have struggled to be part of a discussion focused on Canada’s economic and political responses to Trump. The New Democratic party, which previously propped up Trudeau’s minority government, is poised for its biggest-ever loss, and its leader, Jagmeet Singh, is at risk of losing his federal seat in the Burnaby South electoral district. “Conservative attacks on the [NDP’s support for the Liberals] were highly effective in eroding trust in Jagmeet Singh. But the result was, when you see this threat from Trump, people who would have normally voted for the party are now strategically looking at the Liberals,” said Paradis. The Green leader, Elizabeth May, is also at risk of losing her seat. A wave of patriotic sentiment, spurred by Trump, hasthreatened the electoral prospectsof the separatist Bloc Québécois to the benefit of the Liberals. Already, more than 7 million people have cast ballots in early voting – a 25% increase over the previous record, helped in large part by the Easter long weekend. The first polls close at 8.30pm Atlantic time, with seat-rich Québec and Ontario closing at 9.30pm eastern time, with results expected soon after. Looming over the final day of electioneering was adeadly attack at a bustling street festival in Vancouverthat left the country reeling and forced Carney to briefly suspend his campaign in order to make sombre remarks to the nation. “Those families are living every family’s nightmare,” Carney said on Sunday morning, after a driver killed at least 11 people and injured more at the Filipino community’s Lapu Lapu festival. “I know that I join all Canadians in mourning with you. I know that Canadians are united with you.” A visibly emotional Carney spoke of “Bayanihan”, the Filipino value of community serving those in need. “This spirit upon which we must draw in this incredibly difficult time. We will comfort the grieving. We will care for each other. We will unite in common purpose,” he added.",

    "title": "Trinidad and Tobago voters head to polls for wildly unpredictable election",
    "article_text": "Voters in the twin-island Caribbean nation ofTrinidad and Tobago(T&T) are going to the polls today in a parliamentary election described by analysts as one of the most unpredictable in decades. Soaring crime levels,Donald Trump’strade tariffs, and the rising cost of living have dominated the race between the two main parties, the ruling People’s National Movement (PNM) and the United National Congress (UNC). Voters will choose the 41 members of the lower House of Representatives for a five-year term. The trigger for the vote was former prime minister Keith Rowley’s unprecedented decision to stand down in March, becoming the country’s first leader to resign without losing at the polls. Stuart Young, 50, was sworn in as prime minister, and a day later, he dissolved parliament and called the election, seeking a public mandate for his leadership. Opposing him is Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the 73-year-old leader of the UNC, who was prime minister from 2010 to 2015. Her party has endured internal upheaval, high-profile resignations, and a string of electoral defeats, but she retains a loyal base, campaigning against the government’s record on crime and the rising cost of living. The elections come on the heels of a three-month state of emergency, declared on 30 December after awave of bloody gang warfare. Last year, T&T, which has a population ofabout 1.5 million, recorded 624 homicides, making it one of themost violent countriesin Latin America and the Caribbean. “Crime will be a major factor in the election because the government has been unable to take control of the situation,” Hamid Ghany, a University of the West Indies political analyst, said. The UNC has promised a range of initiatives to tackle crime, including the creation of new ministries of defence and justice. The PNM, meanwhile, has promised to modernise governance, digitise services and improve public safety through the creation of a ministry of implementation and efficiency. An opinion pollcommissioned by the T&T Guardian and conducted between 10 and 13 April by Ghany shows the UNC leading the PNM in most of Trinidad’s swing seats, while PNM retains an edge in Tobago. Among 1,650 respondents across 11 marginal constituencies in Trinidad, 45% said they would vote for the UNC if elections were held tomorrow, compared with 30% for the PNM. The survey also revealed that 61% of Trinidadian respondents were dissatisfied with the PNM’s performance over the last decade. Young insists that the PNM’s internal tracking shows a lead in several key constituencies. Ghany described the election as a contest between the “working class and the privileged class”. For people like maintenance worker Clinton Brewster, 35, the gravest concern is the rising cost of living, which is outpacing salaries. “The trade unions have sided with the UNC against the government on the need to address the concerns of the working class in attempting to repair the post-Covid economy. Class concerns have cut across race and ethnic lines, which has diminished the race factor in this election,” Ghany said. Race has historically been a fault line in local politics, with the PNM drawing support from Afro-Trinidadians and the UNC from Indo-Trinidadian communities. While both parties have repeatedly denied weaponising ethnicity, the 2025 campaign has included accusations of racial messaging in AI-generated ads and finger-pointing over class representation. A senior member of the T&T Hindu community, Dharmacharya Pandit Rampersad Parasram, said equality and equity are “front-burner” issues. He added that while the country has had to grapple with the impact of a post-colonial legacy, “we got independence 63 years ago. So what was then was then. “We just have to make sure that the gains that we have made in our fight for equality, fair play and justice, that we consolidate those gains and do not compromise them in any way. Words like equality and equity must remain important in a futureTrinidad and Tobago,” he said. Beyond these internal issues, the international context is also important, Ghany said. “This election is important in the Trump era because of the US policy towards Venezuela.” Earlier this month, the US revoked two licenses it had granted in recent years for the development of offshore natural gas projects between Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela, dealing a blow to the country’s economic growth projections. “The closeness between PM Young and [Venezuela’s] Maduro’s regime will be on the Trump administration’s radar should the PNM win the election,” Ghany said. “It is quite possible that there may be a different response from the Trump administration should the UNC win the election, given the favourable disposition of Kamla Persad-Bissessar towards Trump.”",

    "title": "Student rescued from Mount Fuji twice in one week",
    "article_text": "A university student has been rescued from the slopes ofMount Fujitwice in the space of a week – the second time during an attempt to retrieve his mobile phone. The hapless climber, a 27-year-old Chinese national who has not been named, was airlifted fromJapan’s highest mountainlast week, only to be the subject of a second search four days later. It emerged that he had returned to the scene of his first rescue to retrieve his phone, Japanese media reported. The student, who lives in Japan, was found on Saturday by another off-season climber on a trail more than 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) above sea level. “He was suspected of having altitude sickness and was taken to hospital,” a police spokesperson said on Monday. Officers later realised the same man had been lifted from the mountain by helicopter four days earlier, the broadcaster TBS said. Media reports said the climber had returned to the 3,776-metre peak on Friday because he had left his phone and other items at the scene of his first rescue. It was unclear if he had managed to find the device. The incident was a reminder of the dangers Fuji poses to inexperienced climbers who underestimate the challenge of traversing its steep slopes. People are urged not to hike during the off-season as conditions can quickly become treacherous. Mount Fuji, an active volcano thatmost recently erupted in 1707, is covered in snow for most of the year and opens to hikers between early July and early September. Many walk partway up the mountain, while others navigate the rocky terrain through the night to watch the sunrise from the summit. The hiking season attractshuge numbers of foreign tourists, prompting local authorities last year tocap the number of daily visitorson the most popular trail to combat overcrowding. From this summer, hikers on Fuji’s four main trails will be charged a fee of 4,000 yen ($28/£21). Additional reporting by Agence France-Presse",

    "title": "Putin and Kim confirm for first time North Koreans fought for Russia in Ukraine war",
    "article_text": "Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un have confirmed for the first time that North Korea hassent troops to fight for Russiain the war with Ukraine, with both leaders describing the soldiers as “heroes”. The acknowledgment comes amid claims by the Kremlin – contested by Ukraine – that North Korean forces helped recapture Russia’sKursk region. “The Russian people will never forget the heroism of the Korean special forces. We will always honour the Korean heroes who gave their lives forRussiaand for our shared freedom, alongside their brothers-in-arms from the Russian Federation,” Putin said in a statement released by the Kremlin. In a statement released on Monday, North Korea’s KCNA state news agency quoted the ruling party as saying that the end of the battle in Russia’s Kursk region showed the “highest strategic level of the firm militant friendship” betweenNorth Koreaand Russia. The acknowledgment follows months of silence over the deployment, which has been widely reported in western media. The Kremlin also said Russia was ready to provide assistance to North Korea “similar to the support offered to its soldiers in the Kursk region”. Russia claimed last week that Ukrainian forces had been expelled from the last Russian village they had been holding. Kyiv has denied the claim, however, and said Ukrainian troops were also still operating in Belgorod, another Russian region borderingUkraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Sunday that Ukraine’s army was still fighting in Kursk despite Moscow claiming the “liberation” of its western region. “Our military continues to perform tasks in the Kursk and Belgorod regions – we are maintaining our presence on Russian territory,” he said in his evening address. In a statement earlier on Sunday, he conceded that the situation remained difficult in many areas, including Kursk. The central military commission of North Korea’s ruling Workers’ party said Kim made the decision to deploy troops under the comprehensive strategic partnership treatyhe signed with Putinin June 2024. “Under the order of the head of state, the sub-units of the armed forces of the Republic regarded the territory of Russia as one of their country and proved the firm alliance between the two countries,” KCNA cited the commission as saying. North Korea “regards it as an honour to have an alliance with such a powerful state as the Russian Federation”, KCNA added. The agency quoted Kim as saying: “They who fought for justice are all heroes and representatives of the honour of the motherland.” North Korea sent an estimated total of 14,000 troops, including 3,000 reinforcements, to replace those killed, injured orcaptured, Ukrainian officials have said. With no armoured vehicles or drone warfare experience, theytook heavy casualtiesbut adapted quickly, the officials added. Russia confirmed on Saturday for the first time that North Korean soldiers had been fighting alongside Russians in Kursk. Neither Russia nor North Korea had previously either confirmed or denied the deployment. The US state department said it was concerned by North Korea’s direct involvement in Russia’s war in Ukraine and that Pyongyang’s military deployment must end. “We continue to be concerned by [North Korea’s] direct involvement in the war. [North Korea’s] military deployment to Russia and any support provided by the Russian Federation to [North Korea] in return must end,” a state department spokesperson said in an email, adding that third countries such as North Korea “bear responsibility” for the war. Kim, whose material support for Putin could earn North Korea access to Russian satellite and military technology to boost its nuclear missile programme, said a monument would soon be built in the capital, Pyongyang, to honour his soldiers’ “battle feats”. North Korea has also provided Russia withvast quantities of ammunition, artillery shells, ballistic missiles and other weapons. South Korea, the US and their partners worry that Russia could reward North Korea by transferring hi-tech weapons technologies for use in its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea is also expected to receive economic and other assistance from Russia. Kim’s reference to “the tombstones of the fallen soldiers” is seen as public confirmation by the regime that North Korean troops had been killed in combat. Zelenskyy has put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 4,000, though US estimates are lower, about 1,200. Kim said North Korea must “take important national measures to specially honour and care for the families of war veterans”. Experts said Moscow and Pyongyang were likely to have agreed in advance to publicly disclose the deployment. “The two countries agreed to disclose the deployment because they judged that the benefits of compensation for the troop deployment outweighed the potential damage to their international image,” Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told Agence France-Presse. By promising state benefits to the deployed troops, North Korea could also “sufficiently ease internal backlash”, Yang said, adding that the move reflected Pyongyang’s growing confidence. “North Korea likely aimed to showcase that victory was achieved thanks to their involvement, thereby securing greater rewards from Russia,” he added.",

    "title": "China and Philippines display competing flags on disputed South China Sea sandbank",
    "article_text": "China and thePhilippineshave displayed their national flags in competing photo opportunities on a disputed sandbank in the South China sea, ratcheting up longstanding regional tensions between the two countries. The dispute played out at Sandy Cay, which is part of the disputed Spratly Islands, and comes days after the US and the Philippines launched their annual joint military drills called “Balikatan”, or “shoulder to shoulder”, which this year will include an integrated air and missile defence simulation for the first time. The latest confrontation appears to have emerged on Thursday, when Chinese state mediareportedthe Coast Guard landed on the disputed reef two weeks ago, unfurled a flag and “exercised sovereign jurisdiction”. On Sunday, China’s coast guard then accused six Filipino personnel of “illegally boarding” Sandy Cay, which Beijing calls Tiexian Reef, earlier that day despite “warnings and dissuasion” from the Chinese side. Spokesperson Liu Dejun said coast guard personnel then “boarded the reef and investigated and dealt with it in accordance with the law”. “We urge the Philippines to immediately stop its infringement,” Liu said, adding that the actions “violated China’s territorial sovereignty”. Sandy Cay is just a few kilometres from Thitu island,where the Philippines maintains a military outpost. There do not appear to be any signs that China has permanently occupied the reef or has built a structure on it. On Monday Philippines officials disputed China’s claim that it had gained control. “The facts on the ground belie their statements,” National Security Council spokesperson Jonathan Malaya said. “It is not to the benefit of any nation if these things are happening, nor it is to the benefit of any nation if such irresponsible announcements and statements are released to the public and to the world.” Chinese state broadcaster CCTV published a photograph of five black-clad people standing on the uninhabited reef as a dark inflatable boat bobbed in the nearby water. The group also “cleaned up leftover plastic bottles, wooden sticks and other debris and garbage on the reef”, the broadcaster reported. Philippines Coast Guard spokesperson Jay Tarrielasaidon Sunday that its navy, coast guard and police personnel had deployed to Sandy Cay in four rubber boats and had “observed the illegal presence” of a Chinese Coast Guard vessel and seven China maritime militia vessels. Posting footage of their own flag being displayed, Tarriela added: “This operation reflects the unwavering dedication and commitment of the Philippine government to uphold the country’s sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea.” Beijing claims sovereignty over almost all of theSouth China Seaand has waved away competing assertions from other countries in the region as well as an international ruling that its position has no legal basis. At the opening ceremony in Manila for the joint US-Philippines military drills, which began on Monday last week, US Marine Corps Lieutenant General James Glynn said the two sides would “demonstrate not just our will to uphold our mutual defence treaty in existence since 1951 but our matchless capability to do so”. “Nothing builds bonds more quickly than shared adversity,” he said, without specifying a common threat. Beijing said the military manoeuvres “undermine regional strategic stability” and accused Manila of “collusion with countries outside the region”. With Agence France-Presse",

    "title": "Revealed: online campaign urged far right to attack China’s opponents in UK",
    "article_text": "One morning last August, a troubling message appeared in a social media group for Hongkongers in the UK. It was already a tense time to be an immigrant. Rioters, propelled by false claims online that the man who had murdered children in Southport was an asylum seeker, were descending on hotels housing refugees, trying to burn them alive. The message alerted the Hongkongers to posts on far-right channels suggesting some new targets. “They all help refugees who come to the UK to take resources,” one of them read. WhenFinn Lausaw the message he felt a pulse of dread. Not only was his name on the list of targets but so were two addresses where he had recently lived. In the London office where he works as a chartered surveyor, Lau stared at the posts. They looked like just more examples of the flood of hatred that poured through social media during the riots. But Lau believed this was something more sinister. Lau, now 31, was among the activists whose role leading Hong Kong’s democracy movement catapulted them into confrontation with China’s authoritarian rulers. Many have fled into exile in the UK, where they continue to campaign. Educated, organised and articulate, they rank among the dissidents Beijing is most determined to crush. Lau and his fellow activists have been called traitors, with bounties on their heads that are three times what the authorities offer for murderers. Relatives back home have been arrested and intimidated. As he read the posts, Lau suspected a chilling new tactic: an attempt to harness far-right violence. Working with the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate, the Guardian found more than 150 posts from 29 accounts on three days in August 2024 that sought to draw the attention of anti-immigrant groups and the far right to Lau and other Hong Kong exiles. Cybersecurity experts who have reviewed the posts say they exhibited some similarities toa major online influence operation that a Chinese security agency is suspected of orchestrating. As Keir Starmer courts Beijing in search of economic growth, his security minister, Dan Jarvis, told the Guardian: “National security is the first duty of this government. Any attempt by a foreign government to coerce, intimidate or harm their critics overseas, undermining democracy and the rule of law, is wholly unacceptable. “We continue to assess potential threats and work with our partners to counter foreign interference. We will make sure the security services and law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to deter, detect and disrupt modern-day state threats.” Posts on X inciting attacks on Lau and others were directed at far-right figures, including Tommy Robinson. “They’re even supporting the Muslim minorities too!” read one post denouncing Hongkongers, sent to the Reform UK MP Richard Tice. It gave the date and location of a planned gathering of Hongkongers a few days later. Posts on Telegram appeared in the channels of the leaders of the white nationalist group Patriotic Alternative. Online incitement appears to represent a novel weapon in the arsenal that projects Beijing’s power. Lau is one of the opponents of the regime – Hongkongers as well as Tibetans, Uyghurs, Taiwanese and campaigners for democracy – subjected to what the US-based advocacy group Freedom House calls “the most sophisticated, global and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in the world”. The Guardian has worked with a team of reporters convened by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) to document this campaign. TheChina Targetsreporting team has identified 105 victims in 23 countries and catalogued the techniques the regime uses as it pursues its opponentsbeyond its borders. There have beenabductions,forced renditionsand harrowing accounts of China’s “black jails”. Compared with some of the more lethal methods used against opponents of Russian, Iranian, Indian and Saudi authoritarians, China’s model seems subtler, which may make it more effective. It relies on a powerful force: fear. When the first posts identified by the Guardian appeared on 12 August last year, the targets had every reason to take the threat seriously. After a wave of riots, Starmer had said the government remained on high alert. He had cancelled his summer holiday to oversee the deployment of 6,000 police officers to deter further unrest. “We had Hongkongers in refugee hotels,” says Lau. “Some of them were extremely scared.” The fake accounts tried to imitate genuine online interaction. Minutes later, “Curry Curry” replied with a list of UK addresses of Hong Kong pro-democracy groups and activists, including one whose profile was even higher than Lau’s. “Everyone knows what to do now, right? I recommend visiting Nathan Law first!” read a post from an account under the name Declan Dene McFly. This account then posted a screenshot of Apple Maps with the location pointer hanging over an address for Law. The Chinese regime saysNathan Lawis a criminal suspect wanted by Hong Kong police for endangering national security. Law, a leader of the movement that sought to salvage the freedoms promised to Hongkongers when they reverted from British to Chinese control, was imprisoned for months in 2017. He fought on. But when the national security law that Beijing imposed in 2020 meant protesters faced life sentences, Law joined anexodusof 100,000 Hongkongers who have come to the UK since the crackdown. After Law was granted UK asylum in 2021, China’s foreign ministry spokespersonsaidthe UK “should immediately correct its mistakes and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, which are China’s domestic affairs”. After members of the US Congress nominated Law for a Nobel peace prize, Time magazine named him among 2020’smost influential peopleand Joe Biden invited him to a summit on democracy, an “extremely furious” Hong Kong security chiefcalledLaw a “modern-day traitor” who was spreading “lies”. Boyish, bespectacled but toughened by years of struggle, Law, 31, has endured one of the most testing methods in the regime’s repressive playbook. His mother and brother were detained by Hong Kong police and interrogated in 2023. Though they were released – after his brotherdenouncedhim on Instagram – Law and his relatives know the authorities could come for them again. The detentions came shortly after the Hong Kong government offered a HK$1m (about £100,000)bountyfor information leading to the arrest of Law, Lau, and other exiled dissidents. In May 2024, British police disrupted a suspected surveillance operation apparently directed by China. Law and Lau are believed to have been among the targets. A few months later, the social media posts urging far-right groups to attack Hong Kong activists began. “It’s outrageous,” says Law, “the way they try to inciteviolence towards me and try to divide society. I hope no one will take them seriously.” At first glance, the posts read as though British bigots were calling for attacks on the Hongkongers. But the language was oddly stilted. One read: “There are too many foreigners in my community now, and the security is worse.” Grammatical errors suggested a limited command of English. “They are all helping asylum seeker,” a profile named Yannie posted to Laura Towler, the deputy leader ofPatriotic Alternative. Members of this group have since been jailed for offences during the riots. That post, like many of the others, appeared on Telegram, a Russian-founded app with few restrictions on what users can say. Others were published on X. Patriotic Alternative is banned from Elon Musk’s platform but he has allowed the far-right figurehead Tommy Robinson to return. “HK refugees keeps coming our country attributing to the effort of the following organisations and people,” someone going by MaryAnnie posted to Robinson. There followed a list of four Hong Kong pro-democracy organisations and two addresses for Lau. One curious aspect to MaryAnnie’s tweet was that it was sent at 3.58am. Dozens more, from this account and others were sent at similar times – during the working day inChina. And many of the 29 profiles shared the same image of a list of addresses in a typeface usually used for Chinese. Several of the Telegram accounts have changed their profile names to Chinese characters. Three of the X profiles went on to post in Chinese. One of them follows only one account: China’s vice-minister of foreign affairs. Experts at Graphika, a New York-based social media analysis company, reviewed the posts identified by the Guardian. The activity “echoes aspects” of a major Chinese online influence campaign that Graphika identified in 2019 and namedSpamouflage Dragon, the analysts said. The Graphika analysts agreed with other experts who said the social media campaign against Hongkongers could not definitively be attributed to Spamouflage Dragon because of differences in the style of posting. But they said posts identified by the Guardian showed “similarities to past activity Graphika and others have attributed to Chinese state-linked influence operations”. Analysts at the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center say Spamouflage Dragon’s “impact is limited but its ability to rapidly respond to current events and propagate narratives across various platforms highlights its potential to fuel division”. They believe “with high confidence” that it is orchestrated by China’s ministry of public security (MPS), a key agency in the authoritarian system. In 2023, American prosecutors broughtchargesagainst 34 MPS officers in Beijing, accusing them of running “transnational repression schemes” in the US and worldwide. The MPS officers allegedly deployed a troll farm “to target people of Chinese descent who had the courage to speak out against the Chinese Communist Party”. In response to the Guardian’s findings, a spokesperson for China’s embassy in the UK said: “The so-called ‘transnational repression’ by China is pure fabrication. China always respects the sovereignty of other countries and conducts law enforcement and judicial cooperation with other countries in accordance with the law.” Under Xi Jinping, who since taking power in 2012 has gripped the country more tightly than any leader since Mao Zedong, what politburo members call “the overseas struggle” has been vigorously pursued. The ICIJ team has found China-backed groups monitoring and intimidating human rights activists at the UN in Geneva. Chinese cyber-attackers – groups of whom have allegedlyhackedinto US presidential campaigns and critical infrastructure as well as UK parliamentarians’ emails – have been turned on the party’s opponents worldwide. And the posts inciting far-right attacks on Hongkongers matched a pattern identified by thecybersecurity experts who reviewed them. They say social media campaigns believed to be orchestrated by the Chinese regime use a vast network of accounts to give the impression of grassroots support. At least one other authoritarian regime is suspected of using social media to exploit the UK’s social divisions. A network of Telegram channels with Russian links was recentlydiscovered, offering cryptocurrency payments as rewards for attacks on British Muslims and mosques. Gregory Davis, of Hope Not Hate, said the British far right were “seen as ‘useful idiots’ and a potential tool to destabilise the country on behalf of foreign powers”. Laura Harth, of Safeguard Defenders, a group that documents the Chinese regime’s abuses, said Chinese troll accounts had been seizing on current events around the world as opportunities to target their victims. “Their aim is to make people afraid but also keep them occupied and distracted,” she said. The message in the Hongkongers’ social media group alerting them to the posts was accompanied by a few words in Chinese: “Someone on the internet posted these photos and their addresses, and now people are worried about going to visit them and whether they will end up visiting someone else.” Lau, scrutinising the message in his London office, spotted that it came from an account in the same name as one of those disseminating addresses for him and others to the far right. This convinced him that its purpose was to ensure he and the rest of the targets knew they were in danger. Scrupulously polite, Lau is at pains to emphasise he bears no ill will towards Britons who, he says, may have been driven to unrest by deindustrialisation, the crime rate or the consequences of the 2008 banking crash. Nonetheless, the menacing social media posts have added to his sense of foreboding. Lau was already watchful. In 2020, three masked men set on him as he walked along the Thames in west London. His last thought as he passed out was that he was going to die. He feels sure the Chinese regime had a hand in the attack. The police classified it as a hate crime but no charges have been brought. Lau moves house often. By the time of the social media posts in August 2024, he was no longer at either of the addresses that were published. But he could not know whether his current address would also be posted. He has since moved again. Although there are no reports that the online incitement succeeded in triggering physical attacks, Lau and at least one of the others targeted in the posts reported them to the Metropolitan police. The force said it did not comment on “matters of protective security in relation to any specific individuals”, but it added: “Counter-terrorism policing remains alive to any attempts from across borders to target or threaten individuals who are in the UK and we continue to work extremely closely with our intelligence and security partners in the UK and abroad to combat any such activity.” As far as the Hongkongers know, the force has taken no action in their cases. They are left to wonder who, if anyone, is protecting them. Lau hopes that the police will look again at the attempted incitement. “I have become extremely cautious when I am on the street,” he said. “That’s the direct consequence. I keep looking round.”",

    "title": "The Coalition denies emissions will be higher if it wins the election. What do the facts say?",
    "article_text": "TheCoalitionhas disputed claims that greenhouse gas emissions would be higher if it won the election than under a returned Labor government. It points to its record between 2013 and 2022 compared with what has happened under Labor over the past three years. Speaking to the ABC’s RN Breakfast on Monday, the Coalition climate change and energy spokesperson, Ted O’Brien, said “under the former Coalition government you saw emissions fall” – from 12% to 29% less than 2005 levels. And that in Labor’s three years in office emissions “have flatlined”, showing the ALP has “failed”. There is a bit going on here so let’s break it down. In purely numerical terms, O’Brien is correct in saying that emissions fell when the Coalition was in power. But a look at the data shows the reduction was not a result of its policies. In reality, it often took steps to prevent deeper cuts to pollution. According tothe climate department greenhouse gas inventory, annual emissions were about 113.8m tonnes of carbon dioxide lower when the Coalition left office than when it was elected. Sounds good at first blush. But nearly all of this fall – 100.4m tonnes – was due to claimed changes in emissions from the land and forests. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter When the Coalition was elected, officials believe the landscape across the country released 12m tonnes in net terms. By the time it was voted out of office, they estimate the land and vegetation was absorbing much more CO2– 88.4 tonnes – from the atmosphere than it emitted. There are a couple of points to make about this. Firstly, historic emissions data for the land sector is repeatedly being revised and there is uncertainty in its accuracy – much more so than in emissions data from electricity, industry or cars. Secondly, the Coalition did nothing, or next-to-nothing, to drive this change. It is not evidence of climate policy that cuts emissions and drives a shift to a cleaner economy. As we have written, there is a strong case that land-sector emissions – while important – should not be counted in the national accounts as they can be used to mask continuing or increasing fossil fuel use. This is a problem when claimed changes in the land sector is easily the biggest contributor to changes in the greenhouse accounts. Emissions fell in one other area Coalition was in power – from the power grid. Pollution from electricity was down 27.2m tonnes. This was overwhelmingly due to a national renewable energy target set under Labor. Famously, Tony Abbott considered abolishing it but didn’t have the votes. Instead, he legislated to reduce the target, with Labor support. The target ultimately still drove rapid construction of solar and windfarms to replace coal power in the second half of the last decade. This cut emissions. But it can hardly be claimed as Coalition policy. Emissions from other parts of the economy – notablytransportandmajor industry– continued to increase as the Coalition chose either to not introduce or not enforce steps that limit them. Sign up toClear Air Australia Adam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisis after newsletter promotion The Coalition then got a bit of extra emissions reduction at the end of its time in power when the pandemic shut down parts of the economy. Scott Morrison resisted global callsfor that time to be used for a “green recovery”– to use the economic stimulus required to accelerate climate action – and instead aimed for a “gas-fired recovery” to boost fossil fuel use. Since Labor’s election, emissions have more or less flatlined, as O’Brien says. We have data for only the first two years and a bit. Officials estimate national pollution fell 1.4% over that time – nothing like the pace of reduction required. It is partly explained by pollution bouncing back as the economy reopened after Covid-19 limitations. In terms of what happens from here, experts say the difference between the two parties is clear. Labor has policies designed to either reduce or limit emissions inelectricity, majorindustryandtransport. Analysts, scientists and crossbench MPs say it could and should be doing more, and point out it has released only one climate-related policy during the campaign –a subsidy for household batteries. Labor has delayed significant decisions and announcements – on a 2035 emissions reduction target and policies to meet it – until after the election. But the Coalition plans to unwind or scrap nearly all Labor’s policies, and hasreleased none of its own to cut emissions in the next decade at least. Notably, it plans to slow the rollout of large-scale renewable energy and instead burn more coal and gas for electricity until it says it can build taxpayer-funded nuclear generators, mostly after 2040. The Climate Change Authority estimates this could lead toan extra 2bn tonnes of emissions compared with Labor’s policy. To put this into context, Australia’s total annual emissions are about 440m tonnes. On Sunday, the ABC’s David Speers asked the Nationals’ frontbencher Bridget McKenzie what the Coalition would do to cut emissions in the next decade. She laughed, and did not directly answer the question.",

    "title": "Guardian Essential poll: Labor leads Coalition in final pre-election poll as Dutton’s approval rating slips further",
    "article_text": "Anthony Albanese holds an election-winning lead with just days left of the campaign, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll, with Labor leading the Coalition 52% to 48% on a two-party basis. Albanese’s approval rating has ticked up slightly since the last poll two weeks ago, but Peter Dutton’s has slipped for the fourth poll in a row, with the Liberal leader’s public standing dropping as the campaign has progressed. TheEssential pollshows more people have switched their support to Labor because of the campaign over recent weeks, and that two-thirds of Australians say they’re voting based on who will leave them better off in three years – rather than comparing their situation to where it was three years ago. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter The final Essential poll before Saturday’s election has found 32% of voters would give Labor their first preference, compared with 34% for the Coalition and 13% for the Greens. The poll of 2,163 voters foundOne Nationattracted 10% of first-preference support, Trumpet of Patriots 2%, while other independents won 9%. It would give Labor a total 52.1% on a two-party basis, compared with 47.9 for theCoalition. On Essential’s separate “two-party-plus” vote, which allows voters to remain undecided, Labor was at 49.6% and the Coalition on 45.6%, with 4.8% undecided. Tuesday’s poll result was a slightly better result for the Coalition fromthe previous poll in mid-April, where Labor was ahead 50% to 45%, with the balance undecided. The Essential poll isin line with all other published polls. The Coalition has recently claimed that published polls are not in line with their internal research, which they claim paint a rosier picture for Dutton’s prospects of forming government. The Essential poll finds Labor leads the Coalition among men (51% to 49%) and women (54% to 46%) on a two-party basis. Labor also leads among those aged 18-34 (58% to 42%) and those aged 35-54 (57% to 43%), while the Coalition leads among those over 55 years of age (56% to 44%). Albanese himself retains a slight negative approval rating, with 44% approving of his performance and 47% disapproving, for a net approval of minus 3%. Albanese’s total approval remained the same from the last poll, but the number of people who “strongly” approve of his performance moved from 10% to 13% over the month. Dutton’s approval ratings, however, further deteriorated to a net of minus 12% (39% approve, 51% disapprove). It continues a major cratering from December 2024, when Dutton had a plus 3% rating (44% approve, 41% disapprove). The Liberal leader’s disapproval shot up another three points from mid-April. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Asked about the election campaign itself, and how it had affected their vote, 23% of respondents said they were now more likely to vote Labor, compared with 19% of people saying they were more likely to vote Coalition. Another 12% said the campaign made them more likely to vote Greens, 17% said they were more likely to vote independent, while 28% said the campaign had no impact on their voting intention. A key question at the heart of the election is whether Australians will vote based on their feelings about the last three years of Labor government or based on their expectations for the coming years. After three years of high inflation, rising prices and concerns about social cohesion, Dutton’s campaign has regularly asked, “Are you better off today than three years ago?” Meanwhile, Albanese and Labor have said Australia is “turning the corner” and that better days are ahead. Asked what was more important when considering their vote, 66% said they were thinking about which party would make them better off in three years and 34% said they would think about whether they were better off than three years ago. In December, the last time this question was asked in the Essential poll, the numbers were 68% and 32% respectively.",

    "article_text": "A re-elected Albanese government says it would find a further $6.4bn in savings by continuing to slash the federal government’s use of consultants and labour hire firms and ensuring public servants do more core work themselves. The savings were announced as part of Labor’s policy costings by the treasurer,Jim Chalmers, who also downplayed a warning from global rating agency S&P that big spending election commitments could put Australia’s treasured AAA debt rating at risk. “If the ratings agencies are worried about spending and if they’re worried about off-budget funds, we’ve demonstrated we found the room for our election commitments,” Chalmers said. “The budget is stronger at the end of the campaign than it was at the beginning.” Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said the $6.4bn in savings would not affect the quality of services provided by the federal public service or reduce the number of staff employed. “We’ve managed in our first term to find about $5.3bn in savings in those areas,” Gallagher said. “So this is really a continuation of that effort and we have no doubt that we will be able to deliver those savings without impacting importantly on the services and the programs that the APS provides.” Earlier this month,Gallagher told Guardian Australia that further reductions in the use of consultantswould coincide with a renewed push to improve the capability of the public service. “I think there is greater opportunity to make departments rely on themselves,” Gallagher said. “On big, important questions, we should be building a workforce that answers those itself.” Labor says its crackdown on external labour would save $800m in 2025-26, before increasing to $1.6bn in 2026-27 and $2bn in the following two financial years. This would require the governmentto continue slashing its reliance on consultantsover several years. A re-elected Labor government would also claw back $760m by increasing the cost of student visa applications to $2,000 (up from $1,600) from 1 July. This would take the total new savings to more than $7bn. These changes alone are not enough to cover Labor’s promised 18m extra bulk-billed GP visits a year. Beyond the additional savings, there were few surprises in Labor’s policy costings given it handed down a budget days before the election campaign was called. Labor’s plan for a 24/7 nationwide health advice and after-hours GP telehealth service backed by Medicare – already announced on the campaign trail – will cost $204.5m. Just $16.5m of Labor’s promised $1bn mental health package will be delivered next financial year. Earlier on Monday, the New York-based S&P Global Ratings warned the budget was “already regressing to moderate deficits as public spending hits postwar highs, global trade tensions intensify, and growth slows”. “How the elected government funds its campaign pledges and rising spending will be crucial for maintaining the rating,” the agency said. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion While Labor and theCoalitiontrade blows on which side is more profligate, S&P pointed to spending commitments by all parties on cost of living, health, education, energy and housing. “The final design, costings, and funding arrangements of election commitments will be subject to negotiations,” S&P said. “These commitments, however, will need to be funded at a time when the government is grappling with rising international trade tensions, economic uncertainty, and fast-growing structural spending in areas such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme, defence, health, aged care, and interest on government debt.” Australia can boast of being one of just nine countries to be rated AAA by all three major credit rating agencies. Chalmers said he took S&P Global’s views “very seriously” and sought to assure it, and other ratings agencies, that Labor had “engineered the biggest positive turnaround in a budget of any parliamentary term ever”. “Peter Dutton proposed what poses an unacceptable risk to household budgets, to the national budget, to our economy, and also to our AAA credit rating as well,” Chalmers said. “In uncertain times, in volatile times, we don’t need a volatile leader like Peter Dutton, who lashes out when he’s under pressure. We need to see the stability, the responsibility that only Anthony Albanese can provide, which I think is highlighted by the costings that we release today.” This article was amended on 29 April to correct savings figures for consultants in 2026-27 and beyond",

    "title": "Iberian peninsula power cut: King Felipe to chair national security council meeting in Madrid – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog has now closed. You canread our latest wrap of developments here. Spanish prime ministerPedro Sánchezhas just given a press conference offering an update on the situation in the country. The prime minister acknowledged the“tremendous” impacton the lives of residents but sought to reassure them that the government was working on resolving the problem as soon as possible. In three regions ofAndalusia, Extremadura,andMadridthe government will use extra emergency powers under civil protection laws. Sanchez said thatthe process of restoring energy was under way across the country,thanks to interconnectors with France and Morocco and domestic energy sources, which should allow the energy supply to be restored “soon.” He said that“a strong technical fluctuation in the European electricity system”led to the blackout but that there was no “conclusive information” on what specifically caused it. He pointedly warned against speculating about the cause of the outage. “We are not ruling out any hypothesis, but we must focus on what is most important, which is restoring electricity to our homes,”he said. Sanchez said that the hospital system was functioning despite the difficulties thanks to power generators, and while ATMs are affected, the underlying banking systems are operating normally. He also talked about train and air travel, in line with previous updates we brought you in this blog. Sanchez also asked residents tominimise travel,not spread unverified information, anduse mobile phones “responsibly”by keeping calls short and using the emergency 112 line only when necessary. Another meeting of the national security council has been called for 7pm local time, he said. We’re closing this blog now as power begins to return to Spain andPortugalfollowing an unprecedented regional blackout that remains unexplained. Here’s a summary of the key developments: Nearly half of Spain’s national electricity supply had been restored before the end of the day, including to the Basque country and Barcelona areas in the early afternoon, and to parts of capital Madrid on Monday night. About 61% of electricity had been restored by late Monday, according to the national grid operator. In Portugal power was also gradually returning including to the capital Lisbon. Grid operator REN said 85 out of 89 power substations were back online. The cause of the blackout remains unclear. Portuguese prime minister Luis Montenegro suggested the issue originated inSpainand the Portuguese operator blamed it on extreme temperature variations. Spain’s grid operator REE blamed a connection failure with France for triggering a knock-on effect. Montenegro said there was “no indication” a cyberattack had caused the blackout, which began around 1033 GMT. Nonetheless, rumours circulated of possible sabotage. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez said nothing had been ruled out and that he had spoken to Nato secretary general Mark Rutte. Sánchez said that the country had suffered a loss of 15GW of electricity generation in five seconds, equivalent to 60% of national demand. “This is something that has never happened before,” he said. Spain’s interior ministry declared a national emergencyand deployed 30,000 police across the country to keep order.Officials urged people to stay at home and many Spaniards took a half day off. The two countries were left without trains, metros, traffic lights, ATMs, phone connections and internet access.Hospitals postponed routine operations but used generators to attend to critical cases, and while electronic banking was able to function on backup systems, most ATM screens were blank. France and Morocco sent additional electricity to Spain. Sánchez said the shortfall would also be eased using gas and hydroelectric power. If you’re just joining us, here’s our latest wrap of the main developments: Spain’s king,Felipe VI, and prime ministerPedro Sánchezhave decided that Felipe will preside over a meeting of the national security council tomorrow “given the special circumstances\", the newspaper El País has reported, citing palace sources. The king and queen have cancelled a planned visit to the city of Jaén in Andalusia on Tuesday. Portugal’s grid operator REN said 85 of 89 power substations are working again, Reuters reports. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has said “everything possible is being done” overnight to restore power to all parts of the country following Monday’s unprecedented nationwide power cut. Speaking late on Monday night, Sánchez said the idea was to get the power back on across Spain on Tuesday, adding that 50% of the national electricity supply had been restored in the past few hours. He said it was still too early to know what had caused the cut, but that nothing was being ruled out. “Just how long it will take to get back to normal is something that the [national grid operator] Red Eléctrica still can’t say for sure,” he said. “There has never been a drop to zero in the system before and the idea now is to keep on with the progressive and prudent restoration of the supply to avoid any setbacks over the coming hours.” Sánchez said that the power cut originated at 12.33pm on Monday, when, for five seconds, 15 gigawatts of the energy that was being produced - equivalent to 60% of all the energy that was being used - suddenly disappeared. “That’s something that has never happened before,” he added. “What prompted this sudden disappearance of the supply is something that the experts still haven’t been able to determine. But they will … All potential causes are being analysed and no hypothesis or possibility is being ruled out.” He thanked France and Morocco for sending additional electricity to Spain, and said the current shortfall would be ease using gas and hydroelectric power. Portugal’s prime minister, Luís Montenegro acknowledged that his country would need to have “more developed security mechanisms to be able to prevent one of these events from occurring with this impact, together with our partners”. He added: “Spain has received help from its other connections, with France and Morocco, but we are dependent, in a situation of constraint, on the connection only withSpain. “It is true that the circumstance of Spain having, particularly withEurope, connection limitations, then affects the supply capacity to Portugal. “We have been fighting for a long time in the EU to have stronger interconnections with Europe, so that we can then have more autonomy, both to receive and to sell energy.” Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said: “Almost 50% of the power supply has now been restored. Virtually all autonomous communities are reporting improvements. Citizens can and should rest assured.” Authorities were yet to establish what had caused the blackout and were not ruling out any hypothesis, he added in a televised address. Lisbon’s mayor, Carlos Moedas, urged residents to stay home on Tuesday, and to keep children away from school due to the power outage affecting the country. According to CNNPortugal, Moedas said there would still be “some abnormality” in the situation tomorrow, at least until noon. “Those who can stay home, do so. If you can prevent your children from going to school, do so,” he added. A failure of the interconnection between the grids ofSpainand France caused the massive power outage that hit most of the Iberian peninsula on Monday, La Vanguardia reported. It quoted Spanish grid operator REE’s system operations chief, Eduardo Prieto. By 10pm local time on Monday, 62% of Spain’s substations were back online (421 of 680) and 43.3% of the power demand had been met. Portugal’s prime minister, Luís Montenegro, said power in the country would be fully restored in the coming hours after a massive outage hit Iberia. He said all state services remained operating in the country despite the difficulties. France has sent up to 2,000 MW of electricity toSpainvia interconnections through Catalonia and the Basque Country, the French grid operator RTE said. Spanish government sources said the power cut originated at 12.33pm, when, for five seconds, 15 gigawatts of the energy that was being produced - equivalent to 60% of all the energy that was being used - suddenly disappeared. There are currently 11 trains awaiting rescue inSpain, according to transport minister Oscar Puente, who added that power has been restored at the Madrid Atocha command center. By around 9.30pm local time, power returned to some parts of Madrid, but the reconnection was patchy and many streetlamps were not working, leaving dog-owners to exercise their pets by torchlight. Meanwhile, the authorities in Gibraltar - where the power network was not affected by the power cut - advised people to take care while travelling across the border. In a statement on Monday night, it said: “The government is aware of the power outages which are being reported in Spain andPortugal.”It urges citizens of Gibraltar who have travelled across the border for the bank holiday today to exercise extreme caution, particularly at road junctions controlled by traffic lights, and to look to official sources for information and updates.While the cause of the widespread power outage remains unknown, the public will be aware that Gibraltar is not connected to the European grid. Therefore, the electricity generation and distribution network in Gibraltar is currently operating normally.”The border continues to flow normally for incoming and outgoing traffic. Pedestrians entering Gibraltar are being checked manually in the interim whilst the eGates on the Spanish side are out of service due to the power outage.”",

    "article_text": "Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has said “everything possible is being done” overnight to restore power to all parts of the country followingan unprecedented regional blackout that left tens of millions of people across the Iberian peninsular without power. Speaking late on Monday night, Sánchez said the idea was to get the power back on acrossSpainon Tuesday, adding that 50% of the national electricity supply had been restored in the past few hours. The blackout – blamed by the Portuguese operator on extreme temperature variations – left the two countries without trains, metros, traffic lights, ATMs, phone connections and internet access. People were trapped in lifts, stuck on trains, stalled in traffic and abandoned in airports. Hundreds stumbled along pitch-black metro tunnels using their phone torches; others scrambled for basics in supermarkets that could only take cash, or began long trudges home from work. Mobile networks went down and internet access was cut as power failed at 12.33pm (11.33 BST). Hospitals postponed routine operations but used generators to attend to critical cases, and while electronic banking was able to function on backup systems, most ATM screens were blank. In scenes reminiscent of the 2003 outage that caused widespread blackouts in the US north-east, rail services across the Iberian peninsula were halted, air traffic disrupted and traffic lights extinguished. Hundreds of people had to be rescued from jammed lifts. The mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martinez-Almeida, urged people to minimise their journeys and stay where they were, adding: “It is essential that the emergency services can circulate.”Play at the Madrid Open tennis tournament was suspended. Sánchez said it was still too early to know what had caused the cut, but that nothing was being ruled out. “Just how long it will take to get back to normal is something that [the national grid operator] Red Eléctrica still can’t say for sure,” he said. “There has never been a drop to zero in the system before and the idea now is to keep on with the progressive and prudent restoration of the supply to avoid any setbacks over the coming hours.” By 10pm local time on Monday, 62% of Spain’s substations were back online (421 of 680) and 43.3% of the power demand had been met, while Portugal’s grid operator REN said it had restored power to 85 of the country’s 89 substations. Red Eléctrica had previously cautioned that it could take between six and 10 hours to fully restore supply after what it called an “exceptional and totally extraordinary” incident. Along a major thoroughfare in Madrid’s Argüelles neighbourhood, the restoration of the power supply prompted whoops of delight and a round of hearty applause among the many people wandering the street. Sánchez said that the power cut originated at 12.33pm, when, for five seconds, 15 gigawatts of the energy that was being produced – equivalent to 60% of all the energy that was being used – suddenly disappeared. “That’s something that has never happened before,” he added. “What prompted this sudden disappearance of the supply is something that the experts still haven’t been able to determine. But they will … All potential causes are being analysed and no hypothesis or possibility is being ruled out.” The Portuguese operator, REN, said the outage was caused by a “rare atmospheric phenomenon”, with extreme temperature variations in Spain causing “anomalous oscillations” in very high-voltage lines. REN said the phenomenon, known as “induced atmospheric vibration”, caused “synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network”. Widespread outages are unusual in Europe. In 2003, a problem with a hydroelectric power line between Italy and Switzerland caused blackouts for about 12 hours, and in 2006 an overloaded power network in Germany caused electricity cuts across parts of the country and in France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands. Sánchez thanked France and Morocco for sending additional electricity to Spain, and said the current shortfall would be eased using gas and hydroelectric power. The prime minister said additional national police and Guardia Civil officers had been deployed across the country to ensure people’s safety overnight, adding that hospitals were functioning well thanks to the efforts of healthcare workers. He said telecommunications services were still suffering interruptions, mainly because of a lack of electricity supply to antennae. Sánchez said that only 344 of the 6,000 flights in Spain on Monday had been cancelled, and that the country’s roads network was working well, barring some tailbacks. The main travel disruption had occurred on the rail network, where 35,000 passengers trapped on more than 100 trains had been helped by rail companies and the military emergencies unit. Eleven more trains that had stopped in remote areas were still waiting to be reached. In Madrid and other cities, traffic lights ceased to function, causing gridlock as vehicles slowed to avoid collisions, while metros were halted. Spain’s national road authority, DGT, urged motorists to avoid using the roads as much as possible. El País newspaper posted photos and video on its website of passengers navigating darkened metro tunnels in the Spanish capital and police directing traffic on the city’s streets. Footage also showed its own reporters working by torchlight. The Spanish health ministry said in a social media update it was in contact with regional authorities to assess the scope of the widespread blackout but reassured the public that hospitals had supplementary systems in place. In Portugal, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country. Lisbon metro carriages were evacuated and ATMs and electronic payment systems cut out. The Portuguese water supplier EPAL said water supplies could be disrupted, prompting queues to form at stores as people rushed to buy bottled water and other emergency supplies such as gas lights, generators and battery-powered radios. Sánchez said that eight of Spain’s 17 autonomous regions – Andalucía, Castilla-La Mancha, Extremadura, Galicia, La Rioja, Madrid, Murcia and Valencia – had declared level 3 emergencies, placing responsibility for the response in the hands of the central government. He said schools in those areas would be open on Tuesday, but would not be offering regular classes. He said the situation across the country remained very “asymmetric” on Monday night, with some regions already having 90% of their power restored, while others had recovered less than 15%. Sánchez also advised non-essential workers to stay home on Tuesday if necessary. “It’s going to be a long night,” he said. “But we’re going to keep working to get back to normal as quickly as possible.”",

    "title": "UK and EU outline new strategic partnership to boost trade and security",
    "article_text": "The UK and the EU have outlined a “new strategic partnership” aimed at bolstering trade and presenting a united European front in Ukraine in defiance of Donald Trump’s threat to upend decades of transatlantic alignment. A draft declaration being drawn up by London and Brussels ahead of a UK-EU summit on 19 May points to a “common understanding” on a number of shared interests. EU ambassadors will meet in Brussels on Wednesday for a briefing from officials who have spent the past few months in a “tunnel” working on the areas where agreement could be reached over the next year. Adefence and securitypact that would see closer cooperation on Ukraine is top of the shopping list along with migration, which is a hot topic on both sides of the Channel. The French are determined to carve out new arrangements on fishing but diplomatic sources say there will be no change for the time being. Several EU capitals are pushing for a“youth experience” programme, which would allow people from the EU to spend at least 12 months in Britain under a reciprocal visa programme that would not add to migration figures. The draft communique being finessed by officials is designed to be the basis of a political declaration and framework for talks over the range of issues. “We confirmed our shared principles of maintaining global economic stability and our mutual commitment to free and open trade,” the draft noted. It added that the sides would continue working “on how we can mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the global economic order”. However, the summit comes as the UK continues tariff negotiations with the US in the hope of carving out a special deal. Britain is facing a 10% tariff, while theEU faces 20%. Ahead of a meeting with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, last week, the leader of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, called for a drive to unlock investment for renewables in the North Sea. “We are friends. And we are Europeans. It means that we share interests and democratic values. And that we are ready to face global challenges as like-minded partners,” von der Leyen said after their meeting. Sign up toHeadlines UK Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Downing Street declined to comment on the text but said it was in line with the UK’s objectives. Starmer’s spokesperson said: “The prime minister’s being clear that there are significant benefits to be had by having a better partnership with the EU in terms of jobs, British businesses, reducing trade barriers, driving growth and keeping us safe in an increasingly dangerous world. So you’d expect us to be discussing a wide range of issues with the EU and obviously get an update on that at the summit. “The prime minister has spoken extensively recently about the benefits of free and open trade and the fact that we’re looking to strengthen alliances around the world to reduce barriers to trade, working with other economies. And that is actually a feature of our discussions, not just with the EU, but the US, India, and other countries as well.”",

    "title": "Friedrich Merz picks pro-Kyiv foreign minister and promises German support for Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Germany’s chancellor-designate,Friedrich Merz, has promised to put staunch support of Ukraine at the heart of his government after announcing that a pro-Kyiv foreign policy expert and former soldier will be the new foreign minister. Speaking days before he is due to take power, Merz said on Monday it was “no time for euphoria” as his conservative CDU met to approve anagreement to form a coalition governmentwith the Social Democrats. Promising to tackle Russian aggression and the rise of the far right, he told party colleagues: “The pillars we have relied on over the past years and decades are crumbling around us. Trust in our democracy is damaged like never before in our country’s postwar history.” Merz,a former banker, said that Johann Wadephul, a conservative MP who has long advised Merz on foreign policy, would become the new foreign minister. Wadephul has been a supporter of military backing forUkraineand recently told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper the war in Ukraine “is not about a few square kilometres in Ukraine but rather the fundamental question of whether we will allow a classic war of conquest in Europe”. Merz said that despite domestic misgivings about Germany’s role in Ukraine, with some calling for a halt to weapons deliveries, there were “no ifs or buts” about its continued support. Vladimir Putin’s invasion, he said, was nothing less than a battle “against the entire political order of the European continent”. Germany, he stressed, would remain “on the side of this attacked country and therefore on the side of all people inEuropewho are committed to democracy and the rule of law … to freedom and an open society.” His statement came hours after Boris Pistorius, a social democrat who is widely expected to continue in the role as defence minister, said Donald Trump’s peace deal proposals were “akin to a capitulation”. Pistorius and Wadephul are expected to work closely together in a newly formed national security council to represent Germany on the European and international stage. In a nod to Trump but without naming him, Merz said on Monday: “We have come to the realisation that we can no longer be certain of the transatlantic relationship in the spirit of freedom and the rules-based order.” Merz and his government are due to be sworn into parliament on 6 May, ending six months of political gridlock. His conservative CDU/CSU alliance agreed a deal to coalesce with the Social Democrats (SPD) after winning a federal election on 23 February, in which the far-right populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) came second. The results of a poll of the SPD’s 365,000 members approving the deal is expected on Wednesday. Only once they have given the green light will the SPD announce its cabinet ministers, said the party’s co-leader Lars Klingbeil. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion Over recent months, amid a sense of stasis and growing dissatisfaction across the country, the AfD has crept up in the polls and is now for the first time ahead of the conservatives. Merz has pledged to reduce the AfD, which had managed to take advantage of people’s fear and insecurity he said, to the “marginal phenomenon” it once was. He would do so, he said, by tackling “irregular” immigration that had “got out of hand” over the past decade, an allusion to his predecessor Angela Merkel’s so-called open-door policy during which about 1 million refugees came to Germany. Among his surprise appointments is that of Karsten Wildberger, the chief executive of Ceconomy, the parent company of the German electronic retailers Saturn and Mediamarkt, who will head a new ministry for digitalisation and modernisation of the state. He will, in part, be responsible for deciding how a special multibillion euro fund – controversially passed by the outgoing government to boost Germany’s ailing infrastructure and its shrinking economy, as well as strengthening its defence forces – is to be spent.",

    "article_text": "Tens of millions of people across Spain andPortugalhave been plunged into a huge power blackout blamed by the Portuguese operator on extreme temperature variations, leaving them without trains, metros, traffic lights, ATMs, phone connections and internet access. People were trapped in lifts, stuck on trains, stalled in traffic and abandoned in airports. Hundreds stumbled along pitch-black metro tunnels using their phone torches; others scrambled for basics in supermarkets that could only take cash, or began long trudges home from work. Mobile networks went down and internet access was cut as power failed at 12.33pm (11.33 BST).

The mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martinez-Almeida, urged people to minimise their journeys and stay where they were, adding: “It is essential that the emergency services can circulate.” Play at the Madrid Open tennis tournament was suspended. The Spanish government convened a crisis meeting at the national grid operator, Red Eléctrica, to discuss the outage. It was attended by the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, who said early on Monday evening a problem in Europe’s grid was to blame but the precise cause was still unclear. Spanish media reported that the national cybersecurity institute was investigating the possibility of a cyber-attack. However, António Costa, the European Council president and a former Portuguese prime minister, said there were “no indications of any cyber-attack”. Spain’s Teresa Ribera, a European Commission vice-president, also said there was no evidence the incident was deliberate. By 10pm local time on Monday, 62% of Spain’s substations were back online (421 of 680) and 43.3% of the power demand had been met. Although Red Eléctrica had previously cautioned that it could take between six and 10 hours to fully restore supply after what it called an “exceptional and totally extraordinary” incident.

The Portuguese operator, REN, said the outage was caused by a “rare atmospheric phenomenon”, with extreme temperature variations in Spain causing “anomalous oscillations” in very high-voltage lines. Red Eléctrica did not immediately respond. REN said the phenomenon, known as “induced atmospheric vibration”, caused “synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network”. It said it was deploying all available resources but it was impossible to say how long it would take for the situation in Portugal to return to normal. The prime minister, Luís Montenegro, said he hoped power would be restored “in the coming hours”. The French high-voltage operator RTE said parts of south-west France had been briefly affected but power was restored by mid-afternoon. It said it could export power to Spain “as soon as the Iberian grid has the technical capacity to receive it”. Widespread outages are unusual in Europe. In 2003, a problem with a hydroelectric power line between Italy and Switzerland caused blackouts for about 12 hours, and in 2006 an overloaded power network in Germany caused electricity cuts across parts of the country and in France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands. In scenes reminiscent of the 2003 outage that caused widespread blackouts in the US north-east, rail services across the Iberian peninsula were halted, air traffic disrupted and traffic lights extinguished. Hundreds of people had to be rescued from jammed lifts. Spain’s railway operator, Adif, said the power cut stranded trains throughout the country. The transport minister, Óscar Puente, said intercity train services would not be restored until Tuesday as the country battled to return to normal. “We are working to ensure that, once the power supply is restored, we can resume these services, which will no longer be possible today,” Puente said. Airports were largely operating as normal using backup supplies and generators, he added. In Madrid and other cities, traffic lights ceased to function, causing gridlock as vehicles slowed to avoid collisions, while metros were halted.

A graph on Spain’s electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop at about 12.15pm, from 27,500MW to almost 15,000MW. The European Commission said it was in contact with Spanish and Portuguese authorities to understand the underlying cause of the blackout. The commission president, Ursula von der Leyen,said she had spoken with Sánchez.",

    "article_text": "Spain,Portugaland some of south-west France suffered a massive power cut on Monday, with major cities including Madrid, Barcelona and Lisbon among those affected. Houses, offices, trains, traffic lights and even the Madrid open tennis tournament were all hit, causing chaos for millions of people and prompting a scramble by the Spanish and Portuguese governments and network operators to understand the problem and race to fix it. Red Eléctrica de España (REE), Spain’s electric network, said Spain and Portugal were hit by “el cero” – the zero. Its Portuguese counterpart, Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN), said the outage started at 11:33am Western European summer time. By mid-afternoon the Spanish operator, which is partly state-owned, said that it had started to recover voltage in the north, south and west of the Iberian peninsula. The recovery process could only be carried out gradually, to avoid overloading parts of the grid as each generator connects. Endesa, Spain’s largest energy utility with 10 million customers, and Iberdrola, the second largest provider, said they were working with REE in accordance with established protocols. The Portuguese prime minister, Luís Montenegro, said that the issue originated in Spain. Portugal’s REN said a “rare atmospheric phenomenon” had caused a severe imbalance in temperatures that led to the widespread shutdowns. REN said: “Due to extreme temperature variations in the interior of Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 kV), a phenomenon known as ‘induced atmospheric vibration’. These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.” The risks posed to electrical systems by big variations in atmospheric temperatures are well known in the industry, even if it is rare for problems to manifest on this scale. “Due to the variation of the temperature, the parameters of the conductor change slightly,” said Taco Engelaar, managing director at Neara, a software provider to energy utilities. “It creates an imbalance in the frequency.” Georg Zachmann, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels thinktank, saidthe system had suffered “cascading disconnections of power plants” – including one in France – when the frequency of the grid dropped below the European standard of 50Hz. The European Council president, António Costa, who was Portugal’s prime minister from 2015 to 2024, said “there is no evidence that it was a cyber-attack”, but cautioned that the ultimate cause was still unclear. Senior European Commission vice-president Teresa Ribera also told Spain’sRadio 5that there was no evidence of a deliberate act having caused the outage. However, Spain’s national security council was convened on Monday to assess the outage. Portugal’s prime minister said it was too early to say for sure what caused the blackout. Spain is on its way to being a green energy leader: it has abundant sun and wind. Last year was a record period for renewable power generation, which accounted for 56% of all electricity used. By 2030 that proportion will rise to 81%. That shift will help Spain end its reliance on energy imports, but it also brings its own challenges. Every national grid in the world will need to spend heavily to upgrade distribution systems to connect scattered renewable generation and ensure it is balanced. The grid needs constant management to ensure it is not overloaded by too much generation, or left short by too little. Power stations will shut down automatically if the frequency breaks out of normal range. To restart they must then be reconnected to users. Balancing has been important as long as there has been a grid, but there is more focus on the issue because of therapid switch to renewables like solar and wind, which are intermittent. Spinning gas turbines have been the standard technology for managing the frequency for decades, but renewables will need investment inother options such as flywheelsor advanced power electronics. “You cannot ignore it,” Zachmann said. “You need the tools to keep the system running.” Engelaar said such a widespread failure was “extremely unusual”. However, there have been previous examples. In 2003 a problem with a hydroelectric power line between Italy and Switzerland caused ahuge outage across Italyfor about 12 hours. A2006 German power overloadcaused outages as far away as Portugal and Morocco. “Interconnection between countries is vital for sharing clean energy, but it also creates new pathways for failure to spread quickly,” Engelaar said. However, Bruegel’s Zachmann said that interconnections also help to prevent problems from getting worse. The interconnector with France will make it “much easier to bring the electricity system back”. “Yes, problems spill over but at the same time the larger system acts as a buffer and prevents the crisis escalating,” he said.",

    "title": "Israel’s Shin Bet security chief says he will resign after Netanyahu row",
    "article_text": "Ronen Bar,the director of Israel’s Shin Bet internal security service, has said he will resign in less than two months, after weeks of tension with Benjamin Netanyahu, who has tried to fire him, bringing Israel to the brink of a constitutional crisis. “After 35 years of service, in order to allow an orderly process for appointing a permanent successor and for professional handover, I will end my role on 15 June 2025,” Bar told a Shin Bet memorial event on Monday. The battle between Netanyahu and Bar intensified after the supreme courtblocked a decision by the cabinet to dismiss Bar from his post– the first Shin Bet head to be fired. Netanyahu said he had lost trust in Bar’s capacity to lead Shin Bet and accused him of a conflict of interest and of politicising the agency. Bar’s decision to step down will now spare the supreme court from making a potentially divisive and contentious judgment. Last week, in a 31-page affidavit to the supreme court, Bar, 59, alleged that Netanyahu hadtried to fire him for refusing to pledge his loyalty to the prime minister over the courtsand tried to use the agency to spy on anti-government protesters. Netanyahu filed his response with the court on Sunday, rejecting Bar’s accusations. He has repeatedly referred to a “deep state” inIsraelthat he alleges seeks to thwart democratically elected leaders and undermine elected governments. The relationship between Netanyahu and Bar, a former special forces soldier who holds degrees from Tel Aviv and Harvard universities, deteriorated afterthe publication in March of a Shin Bet reporton the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas militants in southern Israel. The service admitted to mistakes but criticised policies of the Netanyahu government that it said had enabled Hamas to build up its strength in Gaza and catch Israel by surprise. Netanyahu has never accepted any responsibility for Israel’s worst national security disaster, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to 251 being abducted and held hostage in Gaza. Eighteen months after the attack, many of the senior officials in post at the time have resigned or been forced out. Netanyahu appears unlikely to leave power before elections late next year and may stay on beyond then. Bar’s authorisation for Shin Bet to open two investigations into Netanyahu’s close aides, including one forallegedly taking payments from Qatar to promote its interests in Israelat the same time that Qatar was partly financing Hamas in Gaza, has been widely cited as a motive for his dismissal. Netanyahu is already facing a multitude of corruption charges in court, and political opponents have alleged the prime minister wanted to remove Bar in order to sabotage the investigations. Netanyahu has consistently denied any improper or ulterior reasons for firing Bar. “To this day, the reason for my firing is not clear to me,” Bar wrote in his supreme court affidavit. “But … it was not rooted in any professional metric, but out of an expectation by Netanyahu that I would be personally loyal to him.” Yair Lapid, Israel’s opposition leader, praised Bar’s decision and criticised Netanyahu. “Of those responsible for the greatest failure in the history of the country, only one remains, clinging to the chair,” Lapid said. The priority of Shin Bet is counter-terrorism, but the service also investigates espionage, manages security clearance for thousands of sensitive posts and has a legal duty to defend Israel’s democratic system. Bar took over the service in 2021, having been appointed by the then prime minister, Naftali Bennett, and was expected to serve the standard five-year term. Bar was one of the first senior security officials to accept responsibility for the many failures that led to the 2023 attacks, and made it clear he intended to resign. He has stayed on this long, associates and supporters said last month, to work towards the release of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza and to protect Shin Bet from political manoeuvres.",

    "title": "Trump promised peace but brings rapid increase in civilian casualties to Yemen | Dan Sabbagh",
    "article_text": "“I am the candidate of peace,” Donald Trumpdeclared on the campaign trail last November. Three months into his presidency, not only is the war in Ukraine continuing and the war in Gaza restarted, but in Yemen, the number of civilian casualties caused by US bombing is rapidly and deliberately escalating. Sixty-eight were killed overnight, the Houthis said, when the US military bombed a detention centre holding African migrants in Saada, north-west Yemen, as part of a campaign against the rebel group. In the words of the US Central Command (Centcom), its purpose is to “restore freedom of navigation” in the Red Sea and, most significantly, “American deterrence”. A month ago, whenUS bombing against the Houthis restarted, the peace-promising Trump pledged that “the Houthi barbarians” would eventually be “completely annihilated”. It is a highly destructive target, in line perhaps with the commitments made by Israeli leaders to “eliminate” Hamas after 7 October, and certainly in keeping with statements from Trump’s defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, that the US military must focus on “lethality, lethality, lethality”. Photographs from Almasirah, a Houthi media organisation, showed a shattered building with bodies inside the wreckage. TV footage showed one victim calling out for his mother in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia. It is not immediately obvious they were material to the Houthi war effort, in which the group has attacked merchant shipping in the Red Sea and tried to strike targets in Israel. That the Houthis have sought to fight on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza is not in dispute but what has changed is that the US military response –joint US and UK airstrikeswhen Joe Biden was in the White House – has escalated. The data clearly suggests that previous restraints on causing civilian casualties have been relaxed. Approximately 80 Yemeni civilians were estimated killed and 150 injuredin a bombing raid on Ras Isa porton 18 April, according to the Yemen Data Project, a conflict monitor. The aim, Centcom said, was to destroy the port’s ability to accept fuel, whose receipt it said was controlled by the Houthis, and, the US military added, “not intended to harm the people of Yemen” – though the country is already devastated by 11 years of civil war. Half its 35 million peopleface severe food insecurity. So far, theTrump administrationbombing campaign, Operation Rough Rider, is estimated to have caused more than 500 civilian casualties, of whom at least 158 were killed. Compare that with the previous campaign, Operation Poseidon Archer, which ran under Biden from January 2024 to January 2025: the Yemen Data Project counted 85 casualties, a smaller number over a longer period. Parties in war are supposed to follow international humanitarian law, following theprinciple of distinctionbetween military and civilian targets, and respecting theprinciple of proportionality, where attacks that cause excessive civilian casualties relative to any military advantage gained are, in theory, a war crime. The clear signs from the US campaign in Yemen are that it is following a looser approach, mirroring the unprecedented level of civilian casualtiesin the Israel-Gaza war. It is hardly surprising, given that Hegseth has already closed the Pentagon’s civilian harm mitigation office, which handled policy in the area, and the related Civilian Protection Center of Excellence, responsible for training. That could make it difficult for traditional allies to assist. Whereas the UK participated in Poseidon Archer, British involvement in the latest operation has gone from minimal to nonexistent. No air-to-air refuelling was provided in the most recent attacks, the UK Ministry of Defence said, unlike in March. In justification, Centcom says that after striking 800 targets, Houthi ballistic missile launches are down 69% since 15 March. But one figure it does not cite is that transits of cargo ships in the Red Sea during March remain at half pre-October 2023 levels,according to Lloyd’s List. A broader peace in the region may prove more effective in restoring trade than an increase in demonstrative violence.",

    "title": "Israel seems set on destroying system of international law compliance, ICJ hears",
    "article_text": "Israel appears set on destroying the framework created to ensure compliance with international law in a way that will have profound consequences that reverberate far beyond Palestine, the international court of justice has heard. The warning was made at the start of five days ofproceedings in The Haguethat may prove critical to Israel’s future within the world body. The UN’s top court will hear from dozens of nations and organisations in order to draw up an advisory opinion on Israel’s humanitarian obligations to Palestinians more than 50 days into itstotal blockade on aid entering Gaza. Israel is not participating but has submitted oral evidence claiming its decision last October to end all cooperation with Unrwa, the UN relief agency for Palestinians, was necessary because of infiltration by Hamas. Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, the counsel for the Palestinian state, described Israel’s actions as “antithetical to a peace-loving state”. She said the restrictions on “the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, [Israel’s] attacks on theUnited Nationsand on UN officials, property and premises, its deliberate obstruction of the organisation’s work and its attempt to destroy an entire UN subsidiary organ” were “unprecedented in the history of the organisation”. They amounted to “a fundamental repudiation by Israel of its charter obligations owed both to the organisation and to all UN members and of the international rule of law”, she said. Warning that the international order was crumbling and expressing “the continuing desperate hope that international law might finally prevail”, Ní Ghrálaigh urged the court to reset the moral compass enshrined in the UN charter by ordering Israel to permit aid to enter Gaza, and by restoring cooperation with Unrwa. She said Israel had closed all crossings and turned Rafah, once a refuge for almost 1.5 million displaced Palestinians, into a post-apocalyptic wasteland. “Plans are reportedly under way for Israel to annex 75 sq km of Rafah, one-fifth of Gaza, to Israel’s so-called buffer zone, permanently. This, together with Israel’s continuing maritime blockade, cuts Gaza and its people off from direct aid and assistance and from the rest of the world,” Ní Ghrálaigh said. She said: “Gaza is now home to the largest cohort of child amputees in the world, the largest orphan crisis in modern history, and a whole generation in danger of suffering from stunting, causing irreparable physical and cognitive impairments; over 15,600 children have been killed violently. Tens of thousands more of Gaza’s children are injured or missing, and many of those surviving are so traumatised that they openly express the wish to die.” Earlier in her 30-minute opening submission to the court, the UN undersecretary general for legal affairs, Elinor Hammarskjöld, opted for a full-throated assertion of the immunities and privileges of the UN and its subsidiary bodies under the UN charter and 1946 convention on UN privileges. She said Israel had no right unilaterally to declare UN bodies were not impartial and so deny cooperation or aid, adding: “When the basic elements of this [the charter’s] legal framework are not observed, the very nature of the work of the organisation on behalf of its member states is in jeopardy.” Hammarskjöld said that, if UN member states had complaints about the neutrality of an organisation such as Unrwa, established mechanisms existed for this to be addressed. Israel’s complaints had been examined by relevant UN bodies but the full cooperation of member states, including the furnishing of documents, was also required, she said. This was a thinly coded assertion that Israel has not backed up some of its claims of mass Hamas infiltration with evidence to the UN. Independent investigations have also found that Israel had not provided evidence for its headline allegation. In a sign of the breakdown in relations, Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said on Monday that the ICJ hearing was part of a “systematic persecution and delegitimisation of Israel”. “It is not Israel that should be on trial. It is the UN and Unrwa,” he told reporters in Jerusalem. In its written evidence to the court, Israel argues no obligation exists to respect the immunities of a UN agency “where the legitimate security concerns of a member state are severely undermined by the agency in question, whose conduct manifestly contravenes the fundamental principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence”. The UN general assembly has ordered the UN to seek an ICJ advisory opinion on whether Israel has overriden the immunities of a UN body by its policy of non cooperation. The policy has forced Unrwa to suspend operations in Gaza and the West Bank. Hammarskjöld told the court the proceedings were crucial to clarify some fundamental elements of the legal framework of the UN’s status. She pointed out that Israel’s UN membership entailed legal obligations that were essential for the organisation to properly function and carry out the mandates. These included “good faith and cooperation with the organisation, respect for the safety of UN premises, property assets and personnel, and obligations concerning the immunities of UN properties so that the UN can fulfil its obligations”. Israel strictly controls all inflows of international aid for the 2.4 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. It halted deliveries on 2 March, days before the collapse of a ceasefire that had significantly reduced hostilities after 15 months of war. Supplies are dwindling and the UN’s World Food Programme on Friday said it had sent out its “last remaining stocks” to kitchens. Paul Reichler, representing the Palestinians, told judges that one of the Geneva conventions “not only lays down that the occupying power must agree to relief schemes on behalf of the population, but insists that it must facilitate them by all the means at its disposal”. The UN was the first to address the court on Monday, followed by Palestinian representatives. In total, 40 states and four international organisations are scheduled to participate. On Tuesday, South Africa, a staunch critic of Israel, will present its arguments. In hearings last year in a separate case at the court,the country accused Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza– a charge Israel denies. Those proceedings are still under way. Israel’s’s ally, the US, is scheduled to speak on Wednesday.The court will probably take months to rule. Experts say the decision, though not legally binding, could profoundly impact international jurisprudence, international aid to Israel and public opinion.",

    "title": "ICC judges order that arrest warrant requests in Palestine case be kept secret",
    "article_text": "The prosecutor of the international criminal court has been restrained from publicising any new applications for arrest warrants in the court’s Palestine case after judges ordered they must be kept secret, the Guardian has learned. In an order issued behind closed doors this month, ICC judges are understood to have told the prosecutor, Karim Khan, he can no longer make public announcements referring to the existence of his applications for arrest warrants or his intention to seek them. The new order comes as Khan is preparing a fresh round of applications for Israeli suspects in connection to alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the occupiedPalestinian territories, according to sources familiar with the situation. Khan has alreadysecured arrest warrantsagainst Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant. A warrant was also obtained for the leader of Hamas’s military wing but was withdrawn after he was confirmed dead. The recent order imposing constraints on Khan comes amid tensions between the prosecutor and ICC judges over his handling of the Palestine investigation and several other cases in which he publicly announced his decision to seek warrants, a move that departed from his predecessor’s more discreet approach. Khan has in recent months said he has applied for, but not yet obtained,arrest warrants for Myanmar’s military leader, as well as theTaliban’s supreme leader and Afghanistan’s chief justice. He also indicated at a UN meeting he would seek warrants for peopleaccused of atrocities in Sudan’s West Darfur region. The flurry of announcements came as Khan faced the prospect of US economic sanctions against him – whichmaterialised in February– and in the wake ofsexual misconduct allegations against himby a member of his staff. Khan has denied the allegations, which external investigators are now examining. According to court officials with knowledge of internal discussions, the publicity generated by Khan’s statements has frustrated ICC judges and staff within the prosecutor’s office due to concerns his actions have departed from routine practice and placed pressure on the judges considering the applications. In their secret order in the Palestine case, the judges have blocked publicity that even alludes to the filing of applications for arrest warrants, and ordered Khan to refrain from disclosing any forthcoming requests unless he receives their permission. A separate panel of ICC judges had issued a similar order in at least one other case, three sources said, in an apparent sign of a wider crackdown on Khan’s approach. A spokesperson for the prosecutor said they “cannot confirm or deny the existence or content of any judicial decision which has not been made public by the court”. They said the prosecutor acted in accordance with the court’s legal framework and an arrest warrant application was “the outcome of an extensive, independent and impartial investigation in a situation under the court’s jurisdiction”. The process for applying for ICC arrest warrants often occurs in closed proceedings. This can be to protect the integrity of investigations, ensure the safety of witnesses and victims, and improve the chances of locating and apprehending suspects. However, the prosecutor has significant autonomy and is able to publicise arrest warrant applications if, for example, it could have a deterrent effect on continuing alleged crimes and does not hinder arrest opportunities. Khan’s predecessor Fatou Bensouda revealed the existence of an arrest warrant only after it was approved by judges. The court’s first chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo, publicly announced his intention to file applications on three occasions during his nine-year term. Once approved, an arrest warrant confirms there are “reasonable grounds to believe” the accused individual has committed a crime within the ICC’s jurisdiction, and establishes a legal mechanism to bring the accused to the court, which is based in The Hague, to stand trial. Khan first publicly announced an arrest warrant application in 2022, less than a year into his term, for suspects accused of crimes in Georgia. He repeated the strategy last year, when he revealed requests for warrants in the court’s Palestine investigation for Israeli and Hamas leaders in a dramaticvideo statementandinterview with CNN. The prosecutor’s decision to publicise the first round of arrest warrants in the Palestine case was opposed by some of Khan’s most senior staff, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation. The move, they said, placed the three judges overseeing the case under unprecedented public pressure. The panel of judges, whichapproved the warrants in November, appear to have now prevented Khan from following a similar approach when he files new arrest warrant applications in the case. Court sources said they expected the warrants to focus on alleged crimes in the West Bank. Bensouda launched the ICC’s Palestine caseas a formal criminal investigationin 2021. Khan inherited the inquiry and accelerated it after the Hamas-led 7 October attacks and Israel’s ensuing bombardment of Gaza. The investigation intensified in May 2024 with Khan’s decision to seek warrants for senior Israeli and Hamas officials, but it has continued to examine a range of other alleged crimes, both in the Gaza offensive and in theWest Bank, where there has been an intensification of Israeli settler violence and deadly military operations. The court did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "title": "Israel has turned Gaza into a ‘mass grave’, top UN court hears – as it happened",
    "article_text": "ICJ holding hearing about Israel’s obligation to facilitate aid to Gaza and the West Bank amid the outlawing of Unrwa. This live blog is closed Ammar Hijazi, who is Palestine’s ambassador to the Netherlands, has addressed the court in oral arguments. Here are some of his main points. Hijazi, who says he stands before the ICJ on behalf of the persecuted people (Palestinians) fighting to survive in Gaza, said: Israel is unravelling “fundamental principles of international law” including its obligations under the UN charter. Israel is turning Palestine – particularly Gaza – into a “mass grave” for Palestinians and rescue workers. The World Food Programme reports a near 100% increase of Palestinians’ in need of food aid in the occupied West Bank. “Impeding the presence and activities of the UN and the international organisations must be viewed in the context of erasure and forced displacement,” Hijazi said. Israeli occupation has demolished refugee camps inJeninandTulkarm, forcibly displacing more than 40,000 Palestinians. “Israel has announced the displaced will not be allowed to return,” Hijazi siad. Israel is destroying the “fundamentals of life in Palestine” while it blocks UN and other humanitarian organisations from providing “life saving aid” to the population. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is hearing submissions about Israel’s obligation to facilitate humanitarian aid to Palestinian people in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. The hearings – due to end on Friday – began today with submissions from UN and Palestinian representatives. The court will likely take months to rule. But experts say the decision, though not legally binding, could profoundly impact international jurisprudence, international aid toIsraeland public opinion. In his arguments to the ICJ at The Hague,Ammar Hijazi, Palestinian ambassador to the Netherlands, said Israel is unravelling “fundamental principles of international law” including its obligations under the UN charter. He said that Israel is turning Gaza into a “mass grave” for Palestinian people. Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Monday alleged a US airstrike hit a prison holding African migrants, killing at least 68 people. The death toll from a huge blast in Iran’s southern port ofShahid Rajaeehthat occurred on Saturday morning was increased from 40 to 46 today, according to state media reports. Iran’s interior minister,Eskandar Momenim, later said that the explosion was caused by “negligence” and a failure to comply with safety measures. Thanks for joining us. We are closing this blog now. You can find all ourlatest coverage of the Middle East here. In his post on X, Phillipe Lazzarini also said that some Unrwa facilities, including schools in occupied East Jerusalem, are under threat of closure by Israeli authorities. He wrote: Some 800 children are likely to miss out on finishing the school year if their schools are forced closed. As an occupying power, the state of Israel must provide services or facilitate their delivery- including through Unrwa- to the population it is occupying. This is a clear direction from the international community, through the UN general assembly. Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza has meant Palestinian children have been denied access to formal education since October 2023. It is estimated that over 95% of the 564 school buildings in Gaza have suffered damage, with relentless Israeli attacks on schools killing many civilians seeking shelter from bombardments. As of 31 December 2024, 12,035 students and 492 education personnel had been killed, according to the ministry of education. All universities and colleges in Gaza have reportedly been destroyed. In displacement camps, tent schools were established, but there is no guarantee of safety anywhere in the strip and children’s education remains severely disrupted and effectively on pause. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general ofUnrwa, the UN relief and works agency for Palestine refugees, has welcomed the international court of justice’s (ICJ) hearing about Israel’s obligation to facilitate humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. As a reminder, the hearing – set to run for five days – is focused on a request last year from the UN general assembly, which asked the court to weigh in on Israel’s legal responsibilities after the countryblocked Unrwa from operating on its territory. Israel’s ban followed months of attacks on the agency from Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right allies, who claimed it was deeply infiltrated by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group. Unrwa – the main provider of aid to Palestinians in Gaza – rejects that claim. “Unrwa and other agencies are present in the occupied Palestinian territory to address overwhelming needs,”Lazzarini wrote in a post on X. “The agency’s services must continue unobstructed until there is a just and lasting solution to the plight of Palestine refugees.” Lazzarini added: The laws passed by the parliament of Israel against Unrwa impact the agency’s ability to fulfil its mandate. The no contact policy under the Knesset laws bans Israeli officials from coordinating or communicating with Unrwa officials, obstructing the delivery of essential relief services and aid. Since these restrictions came into effect at the end of January, Unrwa international staff have not received visas to enter Israel. This is banning them from entering the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip where over 2 million people rely on the agency services and assistance. Iran’s interior minister,Eskandar Momenim, has saidthe massive explosionatShahid Rajaeethat officials say killed at least 46 people on Saturday was caused by “negligence” and failure to comply with safety measures. “Some culprits have been identified and summoned … There were shortcomings, including incompliance with safety precautions and negligence in terms of passive defence,” Momeni told state TV. Shahid Rajaee is Iran’s largest commercial port, through which much of the country’s sea-borne cargo moves through. Soaring prices of basic foodstuffs, diminishing stocks of medical supplies and sharp cuts to aid distribution threaten newly catastrophic conditions acrossGaza, Palestinians and international aid officials in the battered territory are warning. Humanitarian organisations including theWorld Food Programmeand Unwra, which supplies food and services to more than 2 million Palestinians across Gaza, have now distributed the last of their stocks of flour and other foodstuffs to the dozens of community kitchens in the territory that serve basic meals to those with no other option. Aid groups’ warehouses were filled during the ceasefire betweenIsraeland Hamas that came into effect in mid-January and ended in early March. They are now empty. “There isn’t anything left to give them now, so once the last supplies have been used up, the kitchens will have to close,” said one senior UN official. “At the moment people are holding up OK but we know from other crises that when things deteriorate, they deteriorate very fast, and we are not far from that point.” You can read the full story, by my colleaguesJason BurkeandMalak A Tantesh, here: British prime minister Keir Starmer will host the head of the Palestinian Authority in a show of the UK’s “steadfast support”. Starmer and his foreign secretary David Lammy will meet Mohammad Mustafa, the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, for the first official visit since 2021, PA reported. The UK government will unveil a support package including £101m for humanitarian relief, economic development and governance and reform. The foreign secretary and Mustafa will also sign a memorandum of understanding outlining their commitment to advancing Palestinian statehood as part of a two-state solution. The document will stress the importance of reunifying Gaza and the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority, saying it is the only legitimate governing entity in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. It will also underscore the Palestinian Authority’s commitment to prioritise delivering its reform agenda. Iran has thwarted one of the most sophisticated cyber-attacks ever launched against its infrastructure,Behzad Akbari, the Iranian deputy telecommunication minister, has said, without elaborating further. In a post on X, he said: By God’s grace and the efforts of the security and technical teams of the communications infrastructure company and the ministry of communications, yesterday one of the most widespread and complex cyber-attacks against the country’s infrastructure was identified and preventive measures were taken. Akbari did not say who was behind the attack, but Iranian authorities have frequently blamed past cyber-attacks onIsrael. Last February, Iran said Israel was behind twin sabotage attacks against gas pipelines that disrupted supply to at least three provinces. Iran accused Israel and the United States in December 2023 of a cyber-attack which disrupted fuel distribution across 60 percent of petrol stations. The US military has not yet commented on the deadly strike onYemen. The military has said it will not give detailed information about targets of its airstrikes for reasons of operational security. In a statement early on Monday before news of the latest strike broke, US Central command said: To preserve operational security, we have intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations. We are very deliberate in our operational approach, but will not reveal specifics about what we’ve done or what we will do. The Guardian’s diplomatic editor,Patrick Wintour, has some more details surrounding the US airstrike that hit a prison holding African migrants in Yemenin his latest report. Here is an extract from his piece: Yemen has long been a key transit country for the people from Africa – mainly from Ethiopia and Somalia – trying to reach Saudi Arabia and Oman. One estimate claims there are more than 300,000 migrants across Yemen, a country devastated by a 10-year civil war. The Houthis allegedly make tens of thousands of dollars a week smuggling people over the border. Monday’s alleged strike recalled a similar attack by a Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis in 2022 on the same compound, which caused a collapse, killing 66 detainees and wounding 113 others, a United Nations report later said. The Houthis shot dead 16 detainees who fled after the strike and wounded another 50, the UN said. The Saudi-led coalition sought to justify the strike by saying the Houthis built and launched drones there, but the UN said it was known to be a detention facility. The US military has shifted tactics since the arrival of the Trump administration, which declared the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organisation in January. Since mid-March the US has mounted a much more sustained bombardment that is aimed at not only knocking out Houthi missile sties but also its political leadership, including Abdelmalek al-Houthi, the Houthi leader since 2004. Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed at least 24 people across the territory since dawn,Al Jazeera is reporting. InJabalia, in northern Gaza, 10 family members were reportedly killed in an airstrike, while eight people in another family were killed in a separate airstrike. Tehran has accusedBenjamin Netanyahuof trying to dictate US policy in negotiations after the Israeli prime minister repeated calls for Iran’s entire nuclear infrastructure to be dismantled. The US and Iran have so far heldthree rounds of indirect talks, mediated by Oman, aimed at sealing a deal that would block Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon but also lift crippling economic sanctions imposed by Washington. After talks in Rome earlier this month, Oman said that the US and Iran were pursuing an accord that would see Tehran “completely free” of nuclear weapons and sanctions but “maintaining its ability to develop peaceful nuclear energy”. Netanyahu said the only “good deal” would be one that removed “all of the infrastructure” akin to the 2003 agreement that Libya made with the west that saw it give up its nuclear, chemical, biological and missile programmes. In a post on X on Monday, Iranian foreign ministerAbbas Araghchiwrote: Israel’s fantasy that it can dictate what Iran may or may not do is so detached from reality that it hardly merits a response. What is striking, however, is how brazenly Netanyahu is now dictating what President Trump can and cannot do in his diplomacy with Iran… Let me be clear: Iran is strong and confident enough in its capabilities to thwart any attempt by malicious external actors to sabotage its foreign policy or dictate its course. We can only hope our US counterparts are equally steadfast. Many Iranians no longer believe the JCPOA (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – the existing nuclear deal) is sufficient. They seek tangible dividends. Nothing Netanyahu’s Allies in the Failed Biden Team say or do will change this reality. There is no military option, and certainly no military solution. Any strike will be immediately reciprocated. Some news away from the ICJ hearings. The death toll from a huge blast in Iran’s southern port ofShahid Rajaeehthat occurred on Saturday morning has been increased from 40 to 46, state media is reporting. “The death toll in the Shahid Rajaee Port fire has reached 46,” the official IRNA news agency reported, quoting Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, the crisis management director at the Hormozgan governorate. He said that the vast majority of the 1,000 people who were injured have been discharged from hospitals (only 138 remain in hospital). The port is Iran’s most strategically important and chief artery for its world trade. Early indications were that the explosionappears to have been an accidentrather than a deliberate attack. Israel’s foreign ministerGideon Saarcalled the hearings part of a “systematic persecution and delegitimization” of his country. Speaking in Jerusalem as the hearings began in The Hague, Saar said the court was “becoming completely politicised”, calling the proceeding “shameful”. Ammar Hijazi, who is Palestine’s ambassador to the Netherlands, has addressed the court in oral arguments. Here are some of his main points. Hijazi, who says he stands before the ICJ on behalf of the persecuted people (Palestinians) fighting to survive in Gaza, said: Israel is unravelling “fundamental principles of international law” including its obligations under the UN charter. Israel is turning Palestine – particularly Gaza – into a “mass grave” for Palestinians and rescue workers. The World Food Programme reports a near 100% increase of Palestinians’ in need of food aid in the occupied West Bank. “Impeding the presence and activities of the UN and the international organisations must be viewed in the context of erasure and forced displacement,” Hijazi said. Israeli occupation has demolished refugee camps inJeninandTulkarm, forcibly displacing more than 40,000 Palestinians. “Israel has announced the displaced will not be allowed to return,” Hijazi siad. Israel is destroying the “fundamentals of life in Palestine” while it blocks UN and other humanitarian organisations from providing “life saving aid” to the population. As we mentioned in the opening post, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is hearing about Israel’s obligation to facilitate humanitarian aid to Palestinian people in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. We will have a live stream of the proceedings up soon. The UN has asked judges to clarify Israel’s legal obligations towards the UN and its agencies, international organisations or third-party states to “ensure and facilitate the unhindered provision of urgently needed supplies essential to the survival of the Palestinian civilian population”. The case was prompted by Israeli bills outlawing the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in October 2024. Unrwa was the major distributor of aid inGazaand has provided education, health and other basic services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the region. Over the ICJ hearings, lawyers from more than 40 states will claim Israel’s ban on all cooperation with Unrwa is a breach of the UN charter. The UN saysIsraelis obliged under international law to ensure enough supplies for the Palestinians living in Gaza. Israel says it is adhering to international law. Since the beginning of March, Israel has shut off all sources of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies for the Gaza Strip’s population of more than 2 million Palestinians.It’s the longest blockade yet of its 17-month war on Gaza, with no sign of it ending. Israel claims the blockade aims to pressure Hamas to release hostages it still holds. Rights groups have called the blockade a “starvation tactic” and a potential war crime. Aid workers have stretched supplies, but warn of a catastrophic surge in severe hunger and malnutrition. The UN World Food Programme said last week it had depleted all its food stocks in Gaza, ending a main source of sustenance for hundreds of thousands of Palestinian people in the devastated territory. Here are some of the latest images being sent to us over the newswires from Gaza’s southern city ofKhan Younis, which was targeted by deadly Israeli airstrikes on Sunday evening: Israeli airstrikes on the northern Gaza Strip killed at least 17 Palestinians early on Monday, according to local health officials. An airstrike hit a home inBeit Lahiya, killing 10 people, including a Palestinian prisoner, Abdel-Fattah Abu Mahadi, who had been released as part of the ceasefire. His wife, two of their children and a grandchild were also killed, according to the Indonesian hospital, which received the bodies. Another airstrike hit a home inGaza City, killing seven people, including two women, according to the Gaza health ministry’s emergency service. Two other people were injured. Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure on both the domestic and international front, has been accused of manipulating Israel’s war on Gaza to achieve his own political ends. The Israeli leader is on trial for corruption charges and his opponents say he is deliberately finding reasons to prolong the assault so he can cling on to power as prime minister. This includes shattering the January ceasefire deal with Hamas bylaunching a deadly wave of airstrikes on the territory last month, which families fear makes the return of Israeli hostages (alive) less likely. Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Monday alleged a US airstrike hit a prison holding African migrants, killing at least 68 people. The US military had no immediate comment, the Associated Press reported. Graphic footage aired by the Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel showed what appeared to be dead bodies and others injured at the site in Yemen’s Saada governate, a stronghold for the Houthis. The Houthi-run Interior ministry said about 115 migrants had been detained at the site. African migrants from Ethiopia and other nations risk crossing war-torn Yemen for a chance to work in neighbouring Saudi Arabia. The Houthis said 68 people had been killed. There was no immediate independent confirmation of the death toll.The airstrike is likely to renew questions from activists about the American campaign against the Houthis, known as “Operation Rough Rider,” which has been targeting the rebels as the Trump administration negotiates with their main benefactor, Iran, over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program.The US military’s Central Command, in a statement early Monday before news of the alleged strike broke, sought to defend its policy of offering no specific details of its extensive airstrike campaign. The strikes have drawn controversy in America over Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of the unclassified Signal messaging app to post sensitive details about the attacks.“To preserve operational security, we have intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations,” Central Command said. “We are very deliberate in our operational approach, but will not reveal specifics about what we’ve done or what we will do.” We will be bringing you more details as they come in. In other developments: Israel will come under sustained legal pressure this week at the UN’s top courtwhen lawyers from more than 40 states will claim the country’s ban on all cooperation with the UN’s Palestinian rights agency Unrwa is a breach of the UN charter. The five days of hearings at the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague have been given a fresh urgency by Israel’s decision on 2 March to block all aid into Gaza, but the hearing will focus on whether Israel – as a signatory to the UN charter – acted unlawfully in overriding the immunities afforded to a UN body. A “new inferno” has been unleashed on Gaza after the restart of war in the Palestinian territory, the director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Monday. “Gaza is experiencing and enduring... death, injury, multiple displacements, amputations, separation, disappearance, starvation and denial of aid and dignity on a massive scale, and just when the all important ceasefire led people to believe they had survived the worst, a new inferno was unleashed,” Pierre Krahenbuhl told a Doha conference on security. Rescuers in Khan Younis retrieved the bodies of four Palestinian people who were killed in an Israeli attack on a house in the southern Gaza city yesterday evening, according to reports.",

    "title": "Houthi rebels say US airstrike on detention centre killed dozens of African migrants",
    "article_text": "Yemen’s Houthi rebels have vowed to continue attacks in the Red and Arabian seas hours after a suspected US strike targeting the militia killed dozens of African migrants. The airstrike struck a detention centre holding more than a hundred African migrants in the city of Saada, killing 68 and injuring 47, according to theHouthis. The Iran-aligned rebel group, which governs north-west Yemen, said the centre was under the supervision of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Red Cross and targeting it “constitutes a full-fledged war crime”. There is no confirmation of the number of casualties in the airstrike but the IOM, a United Nations agency,said many migrants were believed to have been killedor injured and described the loss of life as a tragedy. “It is imperative that all efforts are made to avoid harm to civilians and to protect those most vulnerable in these challenging circumstances,” it said. The US military had no immediate comment. The US has been conducting near-daily strikes against the Houthis since 15 March in an operation known as “Rough Rider”, seeking to end the threat it poses to vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The Houthis started targeting Israeli and western vessels in the Red Sea in October 2023, in what they describe as solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The latest Houthi attack, on Saturday, targeted Israel’s Nevatim airbase with a Palestine-2 hypersonic ballistic missile. The missile was shot down by Israeli defences. Graphic footage aired by the Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel in the aftermath of the strike on Sunday night showed what appeared to be dead bodies and others wounded at the detention centre. Yemen has long been a key transit country for people from Africa – mainly from Ethiopia and Somalia – trying to reach Saudi Arabia and Oman. One estimate claims there are more than 300,000 migrants across Yemen, a country devastated by a 10-year civil war. The Houthis allegedly make tens of thousands of dollars a week smuggling people over the border. Monday’s strike recalled a similar attack by a Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis in 2022 on the same compound, which caused a collapse, killing 66 detainees and wounding 113 others, a UN report later said. The Houthis shot dead 16 detainees who fled after the strike and wounded another 50, the UN said. The Saudi-led coalition sought to justify the strike by saying the Houthis built and launched drones there, but the UN said it was known to be a detention facility. The US military has shifted tactics since the arrival of the Trump administration,which declared the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organisationin January. Since mid-March the US has mounted a much more sustained bombardment that is aimed at not only knocking out Houthi missile sites but also its political leadership, including Abdelmalek al-Houthi, the Houthi leader since 2004. In a statement early on Monday before news of the latest strike broke, US Central command said: “To preserve operational security, we have intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations. We are very deliberate in our operational approach, but will not reveal specifics about what we’ve done or what we will do.” In March, Donald Trump claimed that the Houthis – the last militant group in Iran’s self-described “axis of resistance” that is capable of regularly attacking Israel – had been “decimated” by US strikes. But he also warned: “Stop shooting at US ships, and we will stop shooting at you. Otherwise, we have only just begun, and the real pain is yet to come, for both the Houthis and their sponsors in Iran.” The effectiveness of the US strikes is disputed and the Houthis in the past have shown an ability to withstand a bombardment by Saudi Arabian jets supplemented by British guidance. The UK has also been more involved in the latest US military operations than any other European country. The bulk of the US strikes have been launched from USS Harry S Truman in the Red Sea, but additional strikes were carried out by USAF B-2 bombers operating from Diego Garcia, the UK base in the Indian Ocean leased to the US. More than 750 strikes have been authorised since the decision in mid-March to raise the level of bombardment. The Houthis for their part claim to have downed seven US Reaper drones in less than six weeks at a cost of more than $200m to the Pentagon. The value of the US attacks on the Houthi leadership is disputed, with some claiming the movement would not be disrupted if its leader was assassinated. The Houthis are Zaydi Shia, a branch that believes that leadership should be limited to descendants of the prophet Muhammad and that leaders must fulfil specific criteria, including being recognised religious scholars. Writing recently in the Yemen Review, Maysaa Shuja Al-Deen, a senior researcher at Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies, argued: “Without a respected local Zaydi authority figure capable of mediating or guiding the transition, the dispute would likely remain unresolved without external intervention. In this situation, Iran’s role would be key. Its political and military backing for one of the rival factions could prove decisive in shaping the group’s future direction.”",

    "article_text": "As the northern hemisphere moves into late spring, several areas are expected to experience a taste of summer heat this week with temperatures well above average for the end of April. Across some eastern states of the US, conditions are expected to reach 6-8C above normal, peaking at about 30C (86F) inWashington DC. WesternEurope, including the UK, could also experience some of the warmest weather of the year so far. Temperatures of 25-28C are likely across parts of Germany, France and southern Britain, especially later in the week, with high pressure bringing dry and sunny conditions. Far higher temperatures are expected acrossPakistanand parts of north-west India. An ongoing heatwave will nudge temperatures to 7C above normal until the end of the month across several regions including Punjab, Islamabad and Kashmir. A peak of 48-49C is likely across parts of the Sindh region, and the authorities have issued public warnings urging people to take precautionary measures against the extreme heat. A change in weather is predicted in Pakistan at the beginning of May, bringing some relief to those suffering from the heatwave. Moist air from the Arabian Sea is likely to raise humidity levels, triggering thunderstorms and heavy rainfall, with lightning, hail, dust storms and strong winds likely to create hazardous conditions. Meanwhile, severe storms could affect parts of the US early this week, particularly the upper midwest. Strong winds, tornadoes and large hail have been reported in recent days in areas including Texas and Colorado. The threat of severe weather will continue over the coming days and spread north-eastwards. As warm, moisture-laden air surges north across the Great Plains and into the midwest, it will interact with colder air to produce unstable atmospheric conditions. This is likely to trigger severe thunderstorms and an increasing chance of tornadoes. Damaging winds, heavy rain and large hail are also likely, with flash flooding possible in the stormiest areas. The storm risk will spread into the north-east before easing midweek.",

    "title": "Sugar tax could be applied to milkshakes under Treasury proposals",
    "article_text": "The sugar tax applied to fizzy drinks could be extended to milkshakes and similar treats under government proposals. Plans to end the exemption from the levy for dairy-based drinks, as well as non-dairy substitutes such as oats or rice, were put out for consultation on Monday. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had said inher budget last yearthat the government would consider broadening the tax to include such drinks. The Treasury confirmed plans to press ahead with the changes on Monday, as well as a proposal to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml. As a result of widespread reformulation after the initial announcement of the so-called soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), 89% of fizzy drinks sold in the UK do not pay the tax, the Treasury said. An estimated 203 pre-packed milk-based drinks on the market, which make up 93% of sales within the category, will be hit with the tax unless their sugar content is reduced under the new proposals, according to government analysis. The SDIL was introduced by the Conservatives in April 2018 as part of their anti-obesity drive. The exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children. However, the Treasury said young people only get 3.5% of their calcium intake from such drinks, meaning “it is also likely that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar”. “By bringing milk-based drinks and milk substitute drinks into the SDIL, the government would introduce a tax incentive for manufacturers of these drinks to build on existing progress and further reduce sugar in their recipes,” it said. The Institute of Economic Affairs, a rightwing free-market thinktank, expressed concerns about the cost to consumers of the proposed changes. “The sugar tax has been such a dramatic failure that it should be repealed, not expanded,” said Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the institute. “Sugar taxes have never worked anywhere. What happened to Starmer’s promise to not raise taxes on working people?” The government consultation on the plans will run from Monday until 21 July.",

    "title": "Foreign sex offenders will be banned from claiming asylum in the UK, says Home Office",
    "article_text": "Foreign nationals convicted of sex offences will be banned from claiming asylum in the UK, Yvette Cooper has said, asLabourattempts to fight off the threat from the Reform party before Thursday’s local elections. For the first time, anyone from overseas who qualifies for the sex offender register will be excluded from refugee protections. The development was questioned by human rights organisations concerned that “irresponsible” changes to immigration law are being rushed through to challenge a surge in the polls from Nigel Farage’s party. Keir Starmer has accused Reform and the Tories of attempting to “con” the British public because they are refusing to admit that they are preparing a coalition deal. The new measure will be introduced in an amendment to the border security, asylum and immigration bill being considered by parliament, the Home Office said. Under the refugee convention, countries can refuse asylum to those who have committed a “particularly serious crime”. In the UK, a criminal handed a prison sentence of one year or more can be defined as having committed a “serious crime”. Officials said the planned changes will mean that anyone convicted of a crime and placed on the sex offender register will be categorised as having convicted a “particularly serious crime”, regardless of the length of sentence they receive. Home Office sources have not said how many more foreign national offenders may be removed from the UK as a result of the change. The department has conducted an impact assessment on the new policy which is yet to be released. According toofficial statistics, there were 451 foreign nationals serving sentences of less than 12 months in England and Wales at the end of March. There is no breakdown showing how many of those are sex offenders. Offenders who face removal could still attempt to claim a right to remain in the UK under the European convention on human rights, sources indicated. The new rule will also apply to foreign offenders who were convicted of sex offences abroad. Steve Valdez-Symonds, the programme director for refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International UK, said the development was “an irresponsible approach to lawmaking that has long plagued immigration policy”. He added: “Rushing through late-stage amendments to major legislation means laws are made without the full scrutiny and care they demand. It risks creating injustice and dysfunction. “Excluding individuals from refugee protections without a proper, individualised assessment undermines fairness, hinders integration, and condemns people to live in limbo, unable to move forward with their lives.” The Home Office will also direct courts to reduce the time they take to consider appeals from asylum seekers in accommodation. The amendment will also set a 24-week target for first-tier immigration tribunals to decide on the appeals of those living in asylum seeker supported accommodation, or who are foreign national offenders, in a bid to cut the asylum backlog. Artificial intelligence will be used to support those processing asylum claims, the Home Office said, such as by summarising interview transcripts and accessing country advice. Using the technology could save case workers up to an hour per case, according to the department. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, welcomed efforts to speed up the appeals process, but said that extra funding would be required to make it work. He said: “A faster appeals process cannot be magicked up out of thin air and must not come at the cost of people’s access to justice. Previous efforts to speed up this process have often led to a bigger court backlog due to poor quality initial decisions. “The use of AI therefore must be carefully considered before potentially life or death decisions become a testing ground for the technology,” he said. Reform is on course to take hundreds of council seats and is ahead in the race for two metro mayoralties – Lincolnshire and Hull – as well as the Runcorn byelection, a constituency which Starmer has not yet visited. While much of the focus has been on the Tory response to the Farage threat, with Kemi Badenoch’s party expected to suffer a devastating night on Thursday, Labour insiders are also anxious about how they will perform against Reform in their post-industrial heartlands. There is some alarm on the backbenches over the government’s response to date, with MPs fearing the party’s position on issues is reached as a result of electoral considerations – such as migration, Europe and social issues. “We need to be careful about lurching to the right in response to Reform,” one MP said. “We can do better than that. We should be arguing for Labour values especially on immigration. If we want economic growth, legal migration has to play a part in that.” The number of migrants who have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel this year has edged closer to 10,000, at the start of what is forecast to be the warmest week of 2025 so far. It emerged last year thata man who had carried out a chemical attack in Clapham, south London, had been granted asylum despite being a convicted sex offender and on the sex offender register. Abdul Ezedi, who doused his former girlfriend in alkaline before taking his own life, was granted asylum in 2020 by a judge who accepted that he was a Christian convert. He had been given a suspended sentence at Newcastle crown court on 9 January 2018 after pleading guilty to sexual assault and exposure and had been placed on the sex offender register for 10 years.",

    "title": "Whitehall officials ‘pushing for the Open to return to Trump-owned Turnberry’",
    "article_text": "Senior Whitehall officials have asked golf bosses whether they can host the 2028 Open championship at Donald Trump’s Turnberry course after repeated requests from the US president, sources have said. Officials had asked senior people at the R&A, which organises the world’s oldest major golf championship, what the hurdles would be to hosting the 2028 Open at Turnberry. One source described the talks as direct lobbying from the government, although others said officials had asked about hypothetical problems with the idea, rather than insisting that it happen. One person with knowledge of the discussions said: “The government is doing everything it can to get close to Trump. One concrete thing is that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) have been involved in pushing for the Open to return to Trump-owned Turnberry.” Both the DCMS and Trump Turnberry declined to comment. Two other people briefed on conversations between the US president and Keir Starmer said Trump had asked the prime minister multiple times about hosting the Open at Turnberry, which the Trump Organization has owned since 2014. Trump has previously lobbied publicly to host the Open at the Ayrshire course, saying in 2023: “Everybody wants to see the Open championship here.” King Charles acknowledged the course’s importance to Trump whenhe wrote to him offering a visit to one of his Scottish estatesshould the president already be in the country visiting Turnberry. Hosting the Open could provide a welcome financial boost for SLC Turnberry, the course’s operating company, which is run by the president’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. Last year the company lost £1.7m, having made £571,000 in the previous year – its only profit in 10 years. The R&A has a list of nine or 10 historic courses it would consider for hosting the Open, including famous venues such as St Andrews and Royal Birkdale. Turnberry is on that list, having hosted the championship in 2009. However golf experts point out that the event has grown substantially since then. While the 2009 Open attracted 123,000 people, the event at Royal Troon last year was attended by over 250,000. The R&A previously said it would not host the tournament at Turnberry in the wake of the January 6 attack by Trump supporters on the Capitol in 2021. Last November, the then head of the organisation, said he did not want “media noise” detracting from the game. Since then however the R&A has changed leadership. And in an apparent shift of position Mark Darbon, the new chief executive,said last weekhe would like to see the championship return to Turnberry “at some point”. Those briefed on the discussions between government officials and the R&A say they have mainly focused on the logistical challenges to hosting the Open at Turnberry. They said the main problems would be getting the sheer number of spectators in and out of the site by road, rail and air, given Turnberry is a two-and-a-half hour train trip from Glasgow, or a one-hour drive along a single A-road. Darbon said last week: “At Turnberry, there are definitely some logistical and commercial challenges that we face around the road, rail and accommodation infrastructure. We’re doing some feasibility work around what it would look like to return to that venue and the investment that it would require.” One ministertold the Financial Times earlier this yearthe venue would need “tens, or hundreds, of millions of pounds of investment” to make it easier to reach and to provide enough high-quality hotel accommodation in the area. A spokesperson for R&A said: “We regularly engage with government and local government regarding venues. We have explained the logistical challenges around Turnberry to the government and they are aware of the position.”",

    "article_text": "Marks & Spencer was enjoying a strong start to 2025 thanks to a fashion revival and the warm spring weather. That has now been seriously undermined as the retailer scrambles to deal with disruption caused by a massive cyber-attack it first revealed a week ago. At a time when M&S – alongside most big retailers – are pushing more automation on its customers and workers, industry insiders say the retailer’s staff have been forced to return to pens, paper and clipboards to check stock in stores as internal systems have been put on hold. Every second counts now, for M&S’s bottom line and for its reputation. Shoppers report problems with the use of gift cards in stores while thousands of orders made on or after 23 April have been cancelled. On Monday,it emerged that the difficulties were now affecting Ocado,as M&S’s deliveries of a small number of packaged foods to the online specialist it co-owns, were hit. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion The cyber-attack first hit stores just over a week ago, with M&S pausing contactless payments and the collection of online orders last Tuesday. On Thursday, those systems mostly restarted but M&S halted all orders on its website – which accounts for just over a third of clothing and homewares sales – amounting to almost £3.8m a day. As Patrick O’Brien, a retail analyst at GlobalData, says, cyber-attacks can have major consequences for businesses. “This is one of the most damaging cyber-attacks on a major UK retailer we have seen, the worst since Carpetright last year, which tipped an already very weak retailer into administration,” he says. M&S is a much stronger and larger business than Carpetright and not likely to be at risk of collapse, but the attack is having a direct impact on sales and as O’Brien says, the longer the disruption goes on, the more likely customers are to take their money elsewhere. While most of the problems did not start until the later part of the Easter bank holiday, according to M&S, the attack cut off a run of buoyant trading. What M&S says was a separate incident also affected contactless payments in stores on the Saturday before Easter. Before then, sales had jumped almost 9% in the three months to 30 March, according to industry analysts Kantar, well above the wider fashion industry, as it continued to win over shoppers. M&S may derive some comfort from the fact that this is not happening during a peak trading period such as before Easter or Christmas, and Clive Black, M&S’s house broker at Shore Capital, said he expected the retailer to recoup any losses resulting from the attack via insurance. “The financial impact will be a zero sum game,” he says. “I don’t believe there will be enduring damage unless they don’t manage to fix it.” “There will be Mr & Mrs Angry from Tunbridge Wells but most people can see in the past decade that M&S has materially improved as a business and there will be some sympathy. This is not something it brought on itself but a malevolent force.” O’Brien agrees: “Customers are surprisingly forgiving.”",

    "title": "M&S pauses deliveries of some food items to Ocado after cyber-attack",
    "article_text": "Marks & Spencer has been forced to pause deliveries of some packaged food items to the online grocery site Ocado as the high street stalwart continues to battle the consequences of acyber-attack that begana week ago. The latest issue is understood to affect a small number of items listed on Ocado, which is co-owned by M&S, whichhalted all orders through its M&S.com website and apps on Friday. M&S did not confirm the number of items affected but said it had worked with Ocado and its suppliers “to minimise any disruption to the small proportion of the range delivered through our network to Ocado”. The disruption caused by the hack – and uncertainty over when it will end – has wiped more than £500m off the stock market value of M&S in the past week as experts said it had clearly suffered a cyber-attack on a huge scale. The company has apologised to shoppers for the “inconvenience” caused by the attack, which will hit its online clothing and homeware sales amounting to almost £3.8m a day on average. On Monday, the retailer told 200 agency staff at its main distribution centre for its clothing and homewares at Castle Donington in Leicestershire to stay at home as orders on M&S.com remained on hold for the fourth day in a row, as first reported bySky News. Shoppers are still able to browse online and shop in M&S’s physical stores using cash or cards, but some difficulties continue in stores with gift cards not currently being accepted. Returning goods is only possible at tills in clothing and homeware stores or via post. Food stores are not currently able to accept returns. However, the company said shoppers did not need to take any action – suggesting no customer data had been accessed. M&S has hired cybersecurity experts to help investigate and manage the problem and said it was taking actions to further protect the network to ensure it could continue serving shoppers. It has limited access to its systems via its virtual private network for staff working from home to try to stop the spread of the attack, the Sunday Times reported. Clothing suppliers told the Guardian they had not been asked to pause deliveries as yet but feared this could be the case if online orders were paused for another week or more. “If it is not resolved by the end of this week it is going to become an issue,” one said. He said the difficulties came at a time that “sales are going exceptionally well in stores and things are looking fantastic”. May was likely to be a “huge month” for some clothing products given the burst of warm weather, which has kickstarted demand for summer gear and before the wedding and school proms season. The retail website closure came after several days of problems in stores where contactless payments and the collection of online orders were hit from Monday.Contactless paymentswere restarted late on Thursday. A separate technical problem on the Saturday of the busy Easter weekend affected only contactless payments. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Shoppers said problems with picking up online orders made before the website shut down continued over the weekend. “I have received several emails asking me to collect, made a special journey to my local store, 18 miles, only to be told I could not collect. Staff were brilliant,” one shopper wrote on Facebook. Another said: “I returned an online order in store yesterday but it’s not showing on my account.” M&S told shoppers on social media that orders placed after Wednesday 23 April would be refunded. Those expecting to pick up online orders in stores this week that had been placed before Wednesday were told to wait for a “ready to collect” notification email before heading to a store. It admitted to additional difficulties for those who had ordered party food, including wedding cakes, with some orders cancelled while notification emails were not always working even if orders were arriving in stores. Security experts warned shoppers to watch out for scammers capitalising on the high-profile incident. Kate Calvert, an analyst at Investec, said the longer it took for online sales to resume, the worse the hit would be for M&S. “There will be a short-term profit impact without a doubt,” she said. M&S said in January that ithad rung up strong sales over the Christmas period. It is due to publish full-year results on 21 May.",

    "title": "Leading baby food brands making high-sugar meals, study finds",
    "article_text": "Top brands such as Ella’s Kitchen and Heinz are making sugar-heavy, nutritionally poor baby food that fails to meet the needs of infants, a study has found. The discovery has spurred groups to call for ministers to strengthen regulation in the market, saying that the current state of affairs will negatively affect child growth and development. Researchers at the University of Leeds School of Food Science andNutritionfound that some brands also carried misleading marketing claims, leading them to urge the government to “act now” in imposing the same traffic light system found on chocolate bars and ice-cream. Ella’s Kitchen pear and peach baby rice was found to have a rice content of only 3%, while sugar made up 60% of its calories. Heinz fruity banana custard gets 71% of its total calories from sugar, with its ingredients only containing 4% milk powder, while its baby oat porridge is 29% sugar. The study, funded by the Which? Fund, looked at 632 food products marketed towards babies and toddlers under three. It found that 41% of main meals marketed for children had sugar levels that were too high and that 21% of ready-to-eat fruit products, cereals and meals were too watery and not providing adequate nutrition. It also discovered that many early weaning foods were being sold as being suitable for babies aged four months, which goes against NHS and World Health Organization guidance. The study also found that a quarter of the products analysed were so high in sugar they would require a sugar warning label on the front of the pack, in accordance with WHO guidelines. According to NHS guidelines, babies aged one should have no more than 10g of sugar per day, and no more than 14g per day for children aged two and three. The sugar recommendation is applicable to naturally occurring free sugars and added sugars. The report also surveyed more than 1,000 parents. It found that 70% of parents agreed that high sugar baby foods should have front-of-pack warning labels, while 59% were concerned about the high levels of naturally occurring sugars in food. Dr Diane Threapleton, the lead author of the study, said: “Voluntary guidelines are often ineffective, and so regulation is needed to make sure that change happens. “With around 1.7 million children between six and 36 months in the UK, baby food is a massive market. Widespread availability of inappropriate products with poor nutritional quality will negatively impact child growth and development.” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Vicky Sibson, the director of First Steps Nutrition Trust, said: “As a result of pervasive misleading marketing, parents are unwittingly buying products that are simply not good enough nutritionally. Stronger, mandatory baby food regulations are long overdue.” Sue Davies, the head of food policy at Which?, said: “The government urgently needs to update the out-of-date laws for commercial baby foods to ensure there are tighter controls on their composition – including limits on their sugar and salt content – make labelling clear and upfront and clamp down on any misleading marketing claims that suggest products are healthier than they really are.” A spokesperson for Ella’s Kitchen said: “There is nothing misleading about the name of this product. It follows strict legislation on how foods must be named, and clearly reflects exactly what is in the pouch – pears, peach and baby rice – in order of quantity. “Our ‘no added sugar’ claim is legally approved – and absolutely accurate. We never add sugar to our weaning products; all the sweetness comes naturally from the fruit and veg we use to make them.” A spokesman for Kraft Heinz said: “We’re proud of the role we play in families’ lives and remain committed to the health and wellbeing of infants and young children. We provide quality products based on nutrition science that meet the nutrient requirements specific to this life stage and adhere to stringent UK/EU regulation. “Our convenient, resealable pouches, made from natural ingredients with no added sugars, should be used as a complementary part of a varied weaning diet (six+ months) and are designed to be squeezed into a bowl or straight on to a spoon – as communicated on pack.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said:“Existing laws already set nutrition needs for baby foods, and we support enforcement against any product that does not meet these expectations.”",

    "article_text": "Donald Trumpsigned two new executive orders on Monday afternoon related toimmigration, according to the White House, including one targeting so-called “sanctuary cities” and another theadministrationsays will strengthen law enforcement. One of the orders aims to “strengthen and unleash America’s law enforcement to pursue criminals and protect innocent citizens”, according to the White House. It directs the attorney general to provide resources to the legal defense of police officers who “unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law”. The order also includes a directive to “[hold] state and local officials accountable” for “willfully and unlawfully [directing] the obstruction of criminal law.” The second order targets so-called “sanctuary cities”, and directs the attorney general and secretary of homeland security to publish a list of state and local jurisdictions that “obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration laws”. It also calls on the government to identify federal funds that can be terminated as a consequence for cities that identify as sanctuary jurisdictions. Trump also signed an order on Monday requiring commercial vehicle drivers, such as truckers, read and speak English. The new executive orders come less than a weekafter a federal judge ruledthat the Trump administration cannot withhold federal funding from cities and counties that have passed laws preventing or limiting cooperation with US immigration officials, considered “sanctuary cities”. On his first day in office in January, Trumpissued an orderdirecting the attorney general and homeland security secretary to withhold federal funds from such jurisdictions as part of his administration’s crackdown on immigration. In February, he also issuedanother orderinstructing the federal government to ensure that federal funding to state and local governments does not “abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation”. In response, San Francisco, along with more than a dozen other cities and counties nationwide with “sanctuary” policies, challenged the orders. According toWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, the orders signed on Monday will bring the total number of executive orders signed during Trump’s first 100 days in office to more than 140, nearing the total number signed by Joe Biden over his four-year term.",

    "title": "Elon Musk’s Doge conflicts of interest worth $2.37bn, Senate report says",
    "article_text": "Elon Muskand his companies face at least $2.37bn in legal exposure from federal investigations, litigation and regulatory oversight, according to a new report from SenateDemocrats. The report attempts to put a number to Musk’s many conflicts of interest through his work with his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), warning that he may seek to use his influence to avoid legal liability. The report, which waspublished on Mondayby Democratic members of the Senate homeland security committee’s permanent subcommittee on investigations, looked at 65 actual or potential actions against Musk across 11 separate agencies. Investigators calculated the financial liabilities Musk and his companies, such as Tesla, SpaceX and Neuralink, may face in 45 of those actions. Since Donald Trump won re-election last year and Musk took on the role of de facto head ofDogein January, ethics watchdogs and Democratic officials have warned that the Tesla CEO could use his power to oust regulators and quash investigations into his companies. In the role, Musk, the richest man in the world, holds sway over agencies that regulate or contract with his companies. The subcommittee report outlines the extent of Musk’s liabilities, which include potentially facing $1.19bn in fines to Tesla alone over allegations it made false or misleading statements about its autopilot and self-driving features. Although the report gives a total estimated amount, it also states that the $2bn-plus figure does not include how much Musk could avoid from investigations that the Trump administration declines to launch. It also excludes the potential contracts, such ascommunications dealswith his Starlink satellite internet service, that Musk’s companies could gain because of his role in the administration. “While the $2.37 billion figure represents a credible, conservative estimate, it drastically understates the true benefit Mr Musk may gain from legal risk avoidance alone as a result of his position in government,” the report states. TheTrump administrationhas downplayed concerns over Musk’s conflicts of interest in recent months, with the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, stating in early February that he would “excuse himself” if there was any issue. Democrats havepressed the administration for answerson how Musk is addressing these conflicts, while also seeking to put theincreasingly unpopular billionaireat the forefront of their attacks against the Trump administration. The Democratic senator Jeanne Shaheen introduced a bill earlier this month targeting Musk that would prohibit awarding government contracts to companies owned by special government employees. “Despite numerous requests from members of Congress, the Trump Administration has failed to provide any relevant documents or information, the authorities relied upon for these actions, or an explanation of how Mr Musk is navigating the conflicts they inherently pose,” the report states. Musk’s conflicts span multiple agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which oversees SpaceX rocket launches and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has multiple open investigations into Tesla’s operations. In February, Dogefired workersat the NHTSA that were experts in self-driving car technology. Sign up toTechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion The permanent subcommittee on investigations is a bipartisan subcommittee with a Republican majority and Democratic minority, the latter of which is chaired by the Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal. The subcommittee’s report issues a series of demands to Trump, executive departments and regulatory agencies to take stronger oversight action against Musk, including allowing for independent audits of major contracts given to Musk-affiliated companies. “No one individual, no matter how prominent or wealthy, is above the law,” the report states in its conclusion. “Anything less than decisive, immediate, and collective action risks America becoming a bystander to the surrender to modern oligarchy.”",

    "article_text": "Detectives Crockett and Tubbs are in line for a new look with the 80s cop show Miami Vice set to make a big-screen comeback. The Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski has been set as director of a new take on the NBC series which followed two undercover cops trying to dismantle the world of illegal drugs in Miami. The script will come from Dan Gilroy, the Oscar-nominated writer and director of Nightcrawler. As screenwriter, he is also known for The Bourne Legacy and Kong: Skull Island. Most recently, he has also written multiple episodes of the acclaimed Star Wars series Andor. The original show ran from 1984 to 1990 and starred Don Johnson and Philip M Thomas as leads. It was executive-produced by Michael Mann who later relaunched it on the big screen with Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx. The 2006 film made $164m worldwide from a $135m budget and initial mixed reviews soon turned into a stronger re-appreciation in the subsequent years. “It is operatic and grandiose – but gripping and exhilarating in a way no other film-maker could manage,” the Guardian’s Peter Bradshawwrote. Farrell later spoke negatively about the film in an interview with Total Film. “I didn’t like it so much – I thought it was style over substance and I accept a good bit of the responsibility,” he said. “It was never going to be Lethal Weapon, but I think we missed an opportunity to have a friendship that also had some elements of fun.” Kosinski made his feature film debut with 2010’s Tron: Legacy and went on to direct the sci-fi adventure Oblivion and firefighter drama Only the Brave before making the smash hit Top Gun sequel which made $1.4bn worldwide. This summer sees the release of his Brad Pitt-starring action drama F1 and he was also recently attached to a UFO conspiracy thriller which he is set to make for Apple.",

    "article_text": "Hezbollah leaderNaim Qassemhas called on Lebanon’s government to work harder to end Israel’s daily attacks in the country, a day after an Israeli air strike targeted the southern suburbs of the capital Beirutfor the third timesince a ceasefire was agreed late last November. Qassem said in a televised speech on Monday that Hezbollah implemented the ceasefire deal that ended the 14-month war, but Israel has continued to launch relentless air strikes. Qassem’s comments came as the Israeli military said itcarried out more than 50 strikes in Lebanon this monthin response, it says, to threats against Israel and Hezbollah allegedly violating the United States-brokered ceasefire. Rights groups have denounced Israeli attacks on Lebanon, saying they are violating the truce deal. On Sunday, Israeli warplanes struck Beirut’s southern suburbs after issuing a warning about an hour earlier, marking the third Israeli strike on the area since the November ceasefire. The Israeli military said it struck a precision-guided missiles facility. Following the strike, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun accused Israel of undermining stability in Lebanon and escalating tensions. He said Israeli attacks pose “real dangers to the security” of the region. “Yesterday, an aggression targeted the southern suburbs of Beirut. This attack lacks any justification … It is a political attack aimed at changing the rules by force,” Qassem said of Sunday’s attack. “The resistance complied 100 percent with the [ceasefire] deal and I tell state officials that it’s your duty to guarantee protection,” Qassem said, adding that Lebanese officials should contact sponsors of the ceasefire so that they put pressure on Israel to cease its attacks. “Put pressure on America and make it understand that Lebanon cannot rise if the aggression doesn’t stop,” Qassem said, pointing to Lebanese officials. He added that the US has interests in Lebanon and “stability achieves these interests”. Qassem said the priority should be for a full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, an end to Israeli strikes in the country, and the release of Lebanese people held in Israel since the war officially ended on November 27. Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after its ally Hamas led the October 7, 2023 attack and Israel responded with mass bombardment of Gaza. About 1,200 people in Israel were killed and another 251 others were abducted during the attack in southern Israel. The war ignited further last September when Israel carried out waves of air strikes across Lebanon and assassinated most of the group’s senior leaders, includingHassan Nasrallah. The fighting killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, most of them civilians. The Lebanese government said earlier this month that 190 people have been killed and 485 injured in Lebanon by Israeli strikes since the ceasefire took effect.",

    "title": "Israel’s Shin Bet chief ousted by Netanyahu says will stand down on June 15",
    "article_text": "Israel’s domestic security chief Ronen Bar has said he would stand down on June 15, following weeks of boiling tensions with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who cited a lack of trust as heattempted to fire Barin a move that sparked mass protests. The two men have publicly traded accusations and counteraccusations. Political turmoil ensued, butNetanyahu’s survival tacticsappear to have prevailed. “After 35 years of service, in order to allow an orderly process for appointing a permanent successor and for professional handover, I will end my role on June 15, 2025,” the Shin Bet chief told a memorial event at his agency, according to a statement on Monday. Bar had contested the sacking in a legal case that polarised the country. In an affidavit before the Supreme Court on Sunday, Netanyahu described the Bar as a “liar”. The comment came almost a week after Bar made a sworn statement to the court in which he accused the prime minister ofdemanding personal loyaltyand ordering him to spy on anti-government protesters. “The accusation, according to which I allegedly demanded action against innocent civilians, or against a non-violent and legitimate protest during the protests of 2023, is an absolute lie,” Netanyahu said in his court statement. In turn, Bar denied accusations by Netanyahu and his associates that the Shin Bet security agency had failed to issue timely warnings about Hamas’s unprecedented October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered the war in Gaza. Bar argued instead that his ouster was motivated by a desire to halt the “pursuit of truth” about the events leading up to October 7 and also the corruption charges that hang over Netanyahu in an ongoing, long-drawn-out trial. Netanyahu proposed Vice Admiral Eli Sharvit as the next Shin Bet chief, butreversed his nominationafter the pick was criticised by the United States, a key backer of Israel. Bar’s dismissal was announced by the government last month but frozen by the Supreme Court. The move triggered mass demonstrations, with critics accusing Netanyahu and his government of undermining the institutions underpinning Israel’s democracy by seeking Bar’s removal. Some Israelis denounced what they saw as an autocratic shift by Netanyahu, who has been launching impeachment proceedings against a number of critics, including Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. The Israeli parliament last month approved a law giving politicians more power over the appointment of judges, a key component of Netanyahu’s plan to overhaul thecountry’s judiciary. According to Justice Minister Yariv Levin, who sponsored the bill, the measure was intended to “restore balance” between the legislative and judicial branches. Critics, however, said the new law was a “nail in the coffin of Israeli democracy”. The overall judicial reform package sparked one of the largest protest movements in Israel’s history in 2023 before public concern was overtaken by the war in Gaza.",

    "title": "Power outage hits Spain and Portugal: What happened and what was affected?",
    "article_text": "Majorpower outagesacross large areas of Spain and Portugal, as well as parts of southern France, knocked out traffic lights and disrupted public transportation and airport operations on Monday. Officials did not say what caused the outages, but several denied any foul play. “Grid operators in both countries [Spain and Portugal] are working on finding the cause, and on restoring the electricity supply,” the president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, wrote in apost on X. Costa was the prime minister of Portugal between 2015 and 2024. “At this point, there are no indications of any cyberattack,” he said. Here is what we know: Power outages swept across much of the Iberian Peninsula around 10:30 GMT — 12:30pm local time in Spain, and 11:30am in Portugal. Parts of southern France were also briefly affected, but the service was quickly restored. Critical infrastructure was heavily impacted: Metro systems in Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon were shut down, while major airports such as Madrid-Barajas and Lisbon’s Humberto Delgado faced significant delays and partial closures. According to Spanishnewspaper El Pais, the outage “set Spain back to the 19th century”. “Trains are not operating and traffic lights are down, causing chaos. Many cities are completely dark,” Al Jazeera’s Step Vaessen said, reporting from Valencia Airport in Spain. “Authorities have stated that it is the first time in history such a large-scale blackout has occurred,” she added. Demanda de energía eléctrica en tiempo real. Datos de Red Eléctrica Española. Así está la cosa ahora, siete horas después del batacazo: lenta recuperación, pero muy lejos aún de la normalidad.#apagónpic.twitter.com/8VcCxSUIDN — José María Montero S (@monteromonti)April 28, 2025 Translation: Real-time electricity demand. Data from Red Electrica. This is how things are now, seven hours after the blackout: slow recovery, but still far from normal. The graph shows that electricity use dropped from about 26,000 megawatts to just 12,000 in a few minutes. Spain and Portugal, home to around 60 million people together, were the worst affected. The Madrid Open tennis tournament was suspended for the day. Organisers said there would be no more action on Monday “in order to guarantee general safety”. Madrid’s firefighterscarried outmore than 200 “elevator interventions” across the city while health services carried out 167 interventions, most for respiratory issues and anxiety attacks. Meanwhile in Lisbon, according to local media reports, people rushed to grocery stores to stock up on water and non-perishable goods. Portugal’s Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said that everything points to the major blackout starting in Spain. The exact cause is still unclear, and while there’s no evidence yet of a cyberattack, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he isn’t ruling anything out. He warned against speculation, but said “no cause can be discredited at this point”. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the bloc’s cyber security arm, said at current evidence points to a cable fault. But experts have also in recent weeks warned that an excess of solar power generation in the grid could trigger blackouts. In early April, Belgium’s electricity grid operator cautioned that too much electricity generation could destabilise the grid. According to areport by Bloomberg, Spain has seen a record number of hours with negative power prices in recent months as more solar and wind energy has been fed into the grid. However, until now, the oversupply hadn’t led to blackouts. Electricity has returned to parts of northern, southern and western Spain, the grid operator said on Monday. Spain’s Transportation Minister Oscar Puente said medium- and long-distance train services are unlikely to resume before tomorrow. Meanwhile, Red Electrica has estimated that full restoration could take between six to 10 hours. Power has now been restored in parts of Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country, Galicia, Asturias, Navarre, Castile and Leon, Extremadura, Andalusia, and La Rioja, according to authorities. According to Spanish news agency EFE, electricity consumption in Spain had reached over 50 percent of the usual level by 4:30pm local time (18:30 GMT). Portugal’s grid operator, REN, said that production has resumed at the Castelo do Bode hydroelectric plant and the Tapada do Outeiro thermoelectric facility. With these stations back online, energy consumption is gradually recovering across Portugal, starting in areas near the plants and extending outward, REN said.",

    "article_text": "TheISIL (ISIS)group has killed five Kurdish fighters in an attack in eastern Syria’s Deir Az Zor, the group’s news agency has reported, underscoring concerns about its resurgence. Farhad Shami, spokesperson for Syria’s Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), confirmed to Reuters news agency on Monday that five of its members were killed in the attack, which he described as “one of the deadliest” against the group in a while. Deir Az Zor city was captured by ISIL in 2014, but the Syrian army retook it in 2017. The ISIL group once controlled vast swathes of Syria and Iraq – including Raqqa, about 160km (100 miles) east of Aleppo and Mosul, in northern Iraq – imposing hardline rule over millions of people. Former ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had declared a caliphate over the two countries in 2014 before he was killed in a raid by United States special forces in northwest Syria in 2019 as the group collapsed. At its peak, the group ruled over an area half the size of the United Kingdom and was notorious for its brutality. It beheaded civilians, slaughtered 1,700 captured Iraqi soldiers in a short period, and enslaved and raped thousands of women from the Yazidi community, one of Iraq’s oldest religious minorities. A coalition of more than 80 countries, led by the US, was formed to fight the group in September 2014. The alliance continues to carry out raids against ISIL’s hideouts in Syria and Iraq. The war against the group officially ended in March 2019, when US-backed and Kurdish-led fighters of the SDF captured the eastern Syrian town of Baghouz, which was the last sliver of land ISIL controlled. The group was also defeated in Iraq in July 2017, when Iraqi forces recaptured Mosul. Three months later, ISIL suffered a major blow when the SDF took back the Syrian northern city of Raqqa, which was the group’s de facto capital. ISIL has recently been trying to stage a comeback, continuing to recruit members and to claim responsibility for deadly attacks around the world.",

    "title": "Trump-China tariff war: Who’s winning so far?",
    "article_text": "After United States President Donald Trump suspended his “reciprocal tariffs” on major US trading partners onApril 9, he ramped them up on China’s goods. US trade levies on most imports from China have climbed to 145 percent. Beijing retaliated with duties of its own, at 125 percent on US goods. Trump has long accused China of exploiting the US on trade, casting his tariffs as necessary to revive domestic manufacturing and reshore jobs back to the US. He also wants to use tariffs to finance tax cuts. Most economists remain sceptical Trump will achieve his aims. For now, the US and China are locked in a high-stakes game of chicken. The world is waiting to see which country will yield and which will stay the course. As Trump nears his first 100 days in office for the second time, here’s where the tariff war with China stands: Trump recently played up the possibility of securing a trade deal with China. Last week, the US presidentsaidhis tariffs on China will “come down substantially” in the near future. “We’re going to have a fair deal with China,” Trump told reporters on April 23, stirring hopes of a de-escalation. He also said his administration was “actively” negotiating with the Chinese side without elaborating. On April 24, however, China’s Ministry of Commerce rebuffed president Trump’s remarks, saying there wereno talks taking placebetween the two countries. “Any claims about the progress of China-US economic and trade negotiations are groundless and have no factual basis,” ministry spokesman He Yadong said. While he insisted that Beijing won’t duck any economic blows from Washington, he also said the door was “wide open” for talks. Last week, the Reuters news agency reported that China was evaluating exemptions for select US imports – a list of up to 131 products. Beijing has not made any public statement on the issue. Trump introduced his sweeping tariffs on China less than three weeks ago. The fallout for US businesses won’t be fully felt until later this year. Still, the warning signals are already flashing red. Data from the US Department of Agriculture shows that exports of soya beans – the biggest US farm export – fell dramatically for the period April 11-17, the first full week of reporting since Trump’s China tariff announcement. By April 17, net sales of US soya beans dropped by 50 percent compared with the previous week. That was driven by a 67 percent fall in weekly soya bean exports to China, which, until recently, was America’s biggest export destination for the legume. According to Piergiuseppe Fortunato, an adjunct professor of economics at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland, “China’s retaliatory tariffs will hit US farmers hard. Some may go out of business.” He added that all sectors with exposure to China would come under strain. In 2023, the US exported roughly $15bn of oil, gas and coal to China. Losing that market would hit US energy firms. Since the start of Trump’s tariff war, cargo shipments have plummeted. According to Linerlytica, a shipping data provider, Chinese freight bookings bound for the US fell by 30 to 60 percent in April. The drastic reduction in shipping from America’s third largest trading partner – after Canada and Mexico – has not yet been felt. In May, however, thousands of companies will need to restock their inventories. According to Bloomberg News, retail giants Walmart and Target told Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices from next month. They also warned that supply shocks could roll out to Christmas. Electronic appliances, such as TV sets and washing machines, made up 46.4 percent of US imports from China in 2022. The US also imports a lot of its clothing and pharmaceutical product ingredients from China. The price of these goods will begin to rise from next month. On April 22, the International Monetary Fund raised its US inflation forecast to 3 percent in 2025, owing to tariffs – a full 1 percentage point higher than in January. The lender also lowered its US economic growth forecast and raised its expectation that the US will tip into recession this year. Despite growing tensions between the US and China, Washington and Beijing remain major trading partners. According to the Office of the US Trade Representative, the US imported$438.9bnin Chinese goods last year. That amounts to roughly 3 percent of China’s total economic output, which remains heavily reliant on exports. In a report shared with its clients this month, Goldman Sachs said it expects Trump’s tariffs to drag down China’s gross domestic product (GDP) by as much as 2.4 percentage points. For their part, China’s top officials said the country can do without American farm and energy imports and promised to achieve a 5 percent GDP growth target for this year. Zhao Chenxin, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said that together with non-US imports, domestic farm and energy production would be enough to satisfy demand. “Even if we do not purchase feed grains and oilseeds from the United States, it will not have much impact on our country’s grain supply,” Zhao said on Monday. He also noted there would be limited impact on China’s energy supplies if companies stopped importing US fossil fuels. In some ways, experts said, China has been preparing for this crisis. Fortunato told Al Jazeera: “The US is one of China’s biggest export markets, so tariffs will slow GDP growth. But Beijing has played this smartly as it began diversifying its imports away from the US during the first Trump trade war” in 2018. He also pointed out that “the US depends on China for up to 60 percent of itscritical mineralimports, used in everything from clean energy to military technology. The opposite flow simply isn’t there, so the US is more vulnerable.” Trump has made little secret of his wish to conscript US allies into a trade war. The administration said it aims to strike free trade deals with the European Union, Great Britain and Japan. More generally, reports suggest that Washington is asking trade partners to loosen their economic ties with China as a pre-condition for securing relief from Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs. Nevertheless, US allies seem largely opposed to any economic showdown with China. Last week, the European Commission said it has no intention of “decoupling” from China. Elsewhere, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves recently told the Daily Telegraph newspaper: “China is the second biggest economy in the world, and it would be, I think, very foolish to not engage.” Many countries are not in a position to abandon their trade ties with Beijing. The EU, in particular, has a huge trade deficit with China. Cutting off access to Chinese goods – both consumer products and inputs for industry – would bruise its already sluggish economy. Across the developing world, China’s trade role is equally as crucial. Roughly a quarter of Bangladesh’s and Cambodia’s imports come from China. Nigeria and Saudi Arabia are similarly dependent on Beijing for their goods imports. “It’s hard to see why countries would want to undermine their own business interests to try and reduce America’s trade deficit with China,” Fortunato said. “On this point, I think Trump has been short-sighted and may be forced to blink first on lowering tariffs with China.” The Chinese Communist Party doesn’t need to worry about its next election cycle. Trump’s Republican Party does, so Beijing has the political upper hand in Trump’s trade war. Simply put, it has more time on its side. For Trump’s party, his sabre rattling already looks politically costly. A newEconomist-YouGovpoll shows Americans reporting Trump’s economic actions have hurt them personally more than they’ve helped by a 30-point margin. And public approval of the president’s economic management has been low for a while: It had fallen to 37 percent in aReuters-Ipsos pollpublished on March 31, his lowest score ever in that survey. If Trump stays the course, it is likely that his approval ratings might fall still lower, jeopardising the Republican Party’s fragile grip on the US House of Representatives – and possibly the Senate, experts said. “For these reasons”, Fortunato said, “China does not feel compelled to rush to the negotiating table to secure a trade deal. That will probably fall to Trump.”",

    "title": "Fires extinguished at key Iran port as explosion death toll rises to 70",
    "article_text": "Fires at Iran’s largest commercial port, Bandar Abbas, have been extinguished two days aftera massive explosionkilled at least 70 people and injured more than 1,000, Iranian state media has reported, as questions linger as to the blast’s cause. Only “120 wounded are still in hospital”, Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni, who is visiting the affected area, told state TV on Monday. The blast took place on Saturday at Shahid Rajaei Port in Iran’s south near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, a waterway through which one-fifth of global oil output passes. Earlier, before the fires were put out, Iran’s state TV showed images of firefighters dousing the flames, saying the damage would be assessed after the fire is fully brought under control. Heavy charcoal-black smoke continued to billow over low flames at part of the site, above which a firefighting helicopter flew, pictures from the Iranian Red Crescent showed. It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, but the port’s customs office said it likely resulted from a fire that broke out at a depot storing hazardous chemical materials. Momeni said on Monday that “culprits have been identified and summoned”, and that the blast was caused by “shortcomings, including noncompliance with safety precautions and negligence”. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has ordered a thorough investigation into the incident. In the face of external and expert speculation, Iran has denied reports that the blast was caused by a shipment of missile fuel. On Sunday, President Masoud Pezeshkian visited hospitals treating the wounded in Bandar Abbas. Since the explosion, authorities have ordered all schools and offices in the area closed and urged residents to avoid going outside “until further notice” and use protective masks when doing so. Authorities declared Monday a national day of mourning, while three days of mourning began on Sunday in Hormozgan province. The explosion took place as Iranian and US delegations met in Oman for high-level talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, with both sides reporting progress. While Iranian authorities so far appear to be treating the explosion as an accident, it also comes against a backdrop of years of shadow war with regional enemy Israel. Iran has in the past accused Israel of being behind such attacks. According to The Washington Post, Israel launched a cyberattack targeting the Shahid Rajaei Port in 2020.",

    "title": "A protective force must be deployed to occupied Palestine",
    "article_text": "In the past few weeks, demands for the deployment of a protective force in Gaza and the West Bank have resurfaced. They have come from health professionals and medical organisations, Palestinian NGOs and even Arab civilians. Last year, theArab Leagueand human rights organisations also called for a peacekeeping force to be sent to Gaza. In light of the global normalisation of livestreamed genocide and the political reluctance to enforce international law, this demand represents a bare minimum measure to safeguard Palestinians against unimaginable horrors. The demand is firmly grounded in international law. In Gaza, a peacekeeping force could advance the duty of states and the United Nations to protect a people facing genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity under investigation at the International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court. In both Gaza and the West Bank, such forces could support the process of ending the occupation, as demanded by the UN General Assembly and the International Court of Justice. And yet, the demand for a protective force faces major challenges. The crucial question is: Can they be overcome? The situation in Gaza and the West Bank has reached unprecedented urgency and extremity. Military pressure from armed groups in Lebanon and Yemen exerted in an attempt to protect the Palestinian people did not manage to stop the atrocities, and the Lebanese and Yemeni people have paid a heavy price. That is why an international protective force is urgently needed. Its deployment would fulfil what the Palestinian population is asking the international community to do: to protect them. This force would serve as a “human shield” – not in the derogatory sense weaponised by the Israeli militaryto justify its genocideby framing the entire Palestinian population as human shields but in the sense of a literal peaceful barrier between the Palestinians and their annihilation. Its presence could mean the difference between life and mass death for civilians who have faced a year and a half of bombardment, siege and starvation. Moreover, this force offers a critical alternative to more sinister “solutions”. As Israel escalates its genocidal campaign, imposing conditions designed to destroy Palestinian life, the United States has floated the idea of deploying its troops to Gaza to “take it over”. Such a move would constitute an illegal US invasion of Palestine, further entrenching colonial violence under the guise of maintaining “stability”. By contrast, forces tasked with the responsibility to protect Palestinians – and not imperial and colonial interests – could provide a legitimate, internationally grounded countermeasure. Deploying protective forces through a mandate of the UN requires a UN Security Council resolution. The US will most definitely veto any attempt to create such a force, just as it has struck down various ceasefire resolutions, in effect enabling genocide and blocking any effort to uphold even the most basic principles of humanity under the UN Charter. The situation is undoubtedly growing more hopeless under a US administration that is actively supporting the mass expulsions and deportations of the Palestinian population from Gaza. US President Donald Trump himself has described the Gaza Strip as a “demolition site” and expressed his desire for the US to turn it into the “Riviera of the Middle East”. Since a resolution calling for a protective force would be blocked at the Security Council, the alternative is for a multilateral call to action through the UN General Assembly. There, too, US coercive power heavily influences votes – including that of the Palestinian Authority – but it is still a viable option. The earliest such a move could happen is at the next session of the General Assembly in May and would require immense diplomatic pressure. A vote for a protective force by the General Assembly would not be binding and would require approval by the Security Council. However, it could help create a coalition of countries signalling their willingness to intervene with concrete protection measures in defence of Palestinian life after 19 months of empty words without tangible action. Another challenge is that the mechanism of deploying peacekeeping forces has long been regarded with suspicion by states in the Global South – and for a good reason. UN peacekeeping troops have often served as tools of policing in the Global South and as extensions of imperial control, at times committing atrocities themselves. Historically, peacekeeping has largely aligned with imperial interests, rarely opposing them. Troop-contributing countries often have questionable military alliances, and peacekeeping operations depend on funding from large donors, such as the US. A good example of this is the UNIFIL peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, which has an unusually high European presence and whichhas failedto protect the south of the country from Israel’s aggression. Given all these challenges, do we abandon the demand for a protective force in occupied Palestinian territory? Absolutely not. The obstacles are real, but the demand for a protective force is legitimate. It comes from within multiple sectors of Palestinian society itself and is endorsed globally by antigenocide individuals and groups. In arecent petition, Palestinian and international health workers proposed a model: a neutral, multinational protective mission – not to mediate, but to shield. Their demands include excluding nations complicit in the assault from contributing troops and a mandate for the protective force to physically shield Palestinian civilians and healthcare workers, to restore safe humanitarian and medical corridors, and to support Palestinian-led rebuilding of Gaza’s obliterated infrastructure. Similarly, the Palestinian NGOs Network has called for international protection, open crossings into Gaza and guaranteed safe aid corridors. Meanwhile, Egyptian civilians have repeatedly declared their readiness to enter Gaza as a civilian shielding force if borders are opened. This underscores the potential for people-powered protection alongside formal mechanisms. To translate into action these multiple calls, a radical reimagination of what a protective force might look like and how it could work is required. First, we need states uninvolved in the genocide and civil society groups to push for bypassing the UN Security Council. They must focus all efforts and leverage on the UN General Assembly’s Emergency Special Session in May to stand up to US pressure and push for a vote on a peacekeeping mandate. Second, we need new South-South alliances. This means strategic partnerships among Global South nations uninvolved in the genocide to fund and staff a mission free from imperial influence that can proceed even without Security Council permission. Third, we need an unprecedented mobilisation of civil society in a single direction: pressuring governments to endorse and participate in a truly neutral protective force. The US would oppose the creation of new coalitions that centre Palestinian life and present themselves as the Southern champions of the responsibility to protect doctrine. It would see this as defiance of its hegemony and the Western monopoly over antigenocide discourse, and it would use its veto at the council. However, the countries and civil society groups involved in establishing the protective force should disregard the veto, form the mission autonomously and defy the genocidal international order in which we live. The challenges facing this radical reimagination effort are formidable. But the alternative is to continue leaving Palestinian lives unprotected – at the mercy of an intensifying process of settler-colonial extermination. We must act now and push for a protective force for occupied Palestine. The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

    "title": "Spain, Portugal hit by massive power outage, leaving residents scrambling",
    "article_text": "Spain, Portugal and parts of southwestern France have been hit by awidespread power blackoutthat paralysed public transport, caused large traffic jams, delayed flights, and left residents unable to access cash from ATMs, as utility operators and the authorities scrambled to restore the electric grid. Investigations into the causes of the outage on Monday were ongoing, but Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said there was “no indication” of a cyberattack. The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre also said there was no sign the disruption was due to a cyberattack. Spain’s Interior Ministry declared a state of emergency Monday evening, adding the emergency status would be applied in the regions that request it. So far, Madrid, Andalusia and Extremadura have asked for the central government to take over public order and other critical functions. Earlier, in a televised address, Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said there was no conclusive information on the cause of the blackout. He added that interconnections with neighbouring France and Morocco had partially restored supply, while “combined cycles and hydroelectric plants throughout the country have also been reactivated, which should allow us to recover the supply across Spain soon.” The Spanish and Portuguese governments quickly convened emergency cabinet meetings after the outage, which hit Spain at around12:30pm local time in Spain (10:30 GMT) and also briefly affected a part of France bordering northeastern Spain. By the evening, traffic lights and the storefronts of shops slowly became lit up in different districts of Madrid. Power was also gradually returning to various municipalities in Portugal, including Lisbon city centre. The Spanish government urged residents to stay put to avoid traffic chaos. “The government is working to identify the origin of this incident and dedicating all possible resources to resolve it as quickly as possible,” Sanchez’s office said in a statement. The European Commission said it was “in contact” with local authorities “to understand the underlying cause” of the blackout. “The commission will keep monitoring the situation and make sure that there is smooth information exchange amongst all relevant parties,” a spokesperson for the European Union’s executive arm said. “Grid operators in both countries are working on finding the cause, and on restoring the electricity supply,” European Council President Antonio Costa said on X. “At this point, there are no indications of any cyberattack.” There were traffic jams in Madrid city centre as traffic lights stopped working, Cadena SER radio station reported, as well as people trapped in stalled metro cars and lifts in the Spanish capital. Panicked residents tried in vain to get a signal as the phone lines cut. “There’s no [phone] coverage, I can’t call my family, my parents, nothing: I can’t even go to work,” Carlos Condori told AFP. “People [are] stunned, because this had never happened in Spain”. At Cibeles Square, one of Madrid’s busiest thoroughfares, the blackout of traffic lights unleashed a cacophony of sirens, whistles and car horns as police tried to control the pile-up of traffic. Spain’s Transport Minister Oscar Puente said 11 trains remained stranded with passengers on board, nearly nine hours after the blackout. Al Jazeera’s Step Vaessen, reporting from the Spanish city of Valencia, said the airport was one of the very few places still with power. “A lot of people are waiting for news about their flights, but the airport is functioning,” Vaessen said. “People are extremely frustrated, staring at their phones, hoping to connect with someone,” she added. “Authorities have stated that it is the first time in history such a large-scale blackout has occurred.” The Madrid Open tennis tournament was suspended, forcing 15th seed Grigor Dimitrov and his opponent Jacob Fearnley off the court as scoreboards went dark and overhead cameras lost power. The Portuguese police said traffic lights were affected across the country, the metro was closed in Lisbon and Porto, and trains were not running. Portugal’s utility REN said “all plans for the phased restoration of energy supply are being activated, in coordination with European energy producers and operators”. It later added it was aiming for full restoration by Tuesday. “I hope we will manage to balance the whole system during the night,” REN administrator Joao Faria Conceicao told journalists. In France, grid operator Reseau de Transport d’Electricite (RTE) said there was a brief outage, but power had been restored. It was investigating the cause. “An electrical incident is currently affecting Spain and Portugal, the cause of which remains to be determined,” RTE said. “In France, homes were without power for several minutes in the Basque Country. All power has since been restored.”",

    "title": "Arsenal vs PSG – UEFA Champions League: Start time, team news, lineups",
    "article_text": "Who:Arsenal vs Paris Saint-Germain (PSG)What:UEFA Champions League semifinal, first legWhere:Emirates Stadium, LondonWhen:Tuesday at 8pm (19:00 GMT) Follow Al Jazeera Sport’s livetext and photo commentary stream. Thirteen-time English top-flight league victors Arsenal continue their quest to win a maiden UEFA Champions League title when they clash with PSG in the first leg of their semifinal at Emirates. The Gunners booked their place in the final four of the tournament by thoroughly outplaying defending champions Real Madrid to win their quarterfinal series 5-1 on aggregate. PSG’s road to the Champions League semifinal stage has been equally impressive. Les Parisiens caused one of the biggest upsets of the tournament, defeating Liverpool on penalties in the round of 16 after the teams finished their two-leg series tied at 1-1. PSG have also been utterly dominant in their domestic Ligue 1 competition this season, recording a stunning 30-game unbeaten streak that only ended on Friday in a 3-1 home defeat against Nice. Here is all to know before the semifinal opener between two of the most dynamic football clubs in Europe: The teams last played on October 1 in a group phase fixture. First-half goals by Kai Havertz and Bukayo Saka helped Arsenal ease to a 2-0 home win over PSG at Emirates Stadium. But PSG have improved dramatically since then due in large part to manager Luis Enrique’s decision to drop star striker Ousmane Dembele against Arsenal for disciplinary reasons – an action that inspired the France forward’s superb run of form. PSG upset Premier League leaders Liverpool in the round of 16, dramatically winning the second leg in a penalty shootout. They then knocked out another top English club, Aston Villa, at the quarterfinal stage, winning 5-4 on aggregate and advancing to their third Champions League semifinals in five years. Arsenal, in addition to causing a major boil-over by defeating Real Madrid in the quarters, destroyed Dutch-side PSV Eindhoven 9-3 on aggregate in the round of 16. Manager Mikel Arteta faces a couple of key selection headaches with the number one issue being who will replace key midfielder Thomas Partey, who will sit out this match against PSG with a one-game suspension. Mikel Merino is tipped to replace the Ghanaian international with Leandro Trossard slotting into the forward line in Merino’s place. On the injury front, Jorginho, who would have been the most suitable replacement for Partey, is expected to miss Tuesday’s match as he recovers from a rib injury. Defenders Ben White and Riccardo Calafiori are doubtful as both recover from knee injuries. Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Magalhaes, and Takehiro Tomiyasu are all sidelined for the rest of the season. In a rare occurrence for this late in the season, PSG manager Luis Enrique’s squad is injury-free for Tuesday’s match against Arsenal in London. Despite the team losing its 30-game unbeaten streak in that uncharacteristic 3-1 drubbing, Enrique is expected to retain the same starting XI for their Champions League fixture with the possible exception being Desire Doue’s demotion to make way for Bradley Barcola in the midfield. Arteta will have to beat one of the most influential figures in his football life to advance to the Champions League final. Standing in his way is a close friend who played a major role in his Spanish compatriot’s impressive transition from the pitch to the dugout. Enrique was a senior star at Barcelona when Arteta started his playing career at the Camp Nou, a period that had a major impact on his managerial philosophy with Arsenal. “He was extremely supportive with the young players. He was one of the main characters by far. I have really good memories of him,” Arteta said. “What I love about him is wherever he’s been, as a player or a manager, his fingerprints are all over the place. “You can sense it’s his team with the way his players behave, the way they want to attack and dominate games.” Arsenal possible starting XI:Raya; Timber, Saliba, Kiwior, Lewis-Skelly; Rice, Merino, Odegaard; Saka, Trossard, Martinelli PSG possible starting XI:Donnarumma; Hakimi, Marquinhos, Pacho, Mendes; Ruiz, Vitinha, Neves; Barcola, Dembele, Kvaratskhelia The gifted French forward overcame a slow start to the season to reel off one of the greatest offensive performances in Europe this season. In 44 domestic league fixtures, the 27-year-old Dembele scored 32 goals and recorded 12 assists to fuel PSG’s incredible 30-match unbeaten run. His contribution in front of goal was pivotal to Les Parisiens winning the Ligue 1 title with an astounding six games remaining in the season.",

    "title": "Vatican says conclave to elect new pope to begin on May 7",
    "article_text": "The Vatican has announced that a conclave to elect the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church after thedeathof Pope Francis will begin on May 7. The date was decided during a closed-door meeting of cardinals at the Vatican on Monday, two days after thefuneralof Francis, who died on April 21 aged 88. A total of 135 cardinals from across the world and below the age of 80 are eligible to take part in thesecret voteto decide who will be the next head of the 1.4-billion-member church. The Vatican on Monday closed the Sistine Chapel, where voting will take place, to begin preparations. This year’s conclave marks a notable increase in participation compared with previous ones after 115 cardinals took part in the 2005 and 2013 elections. About 80 percent of the current electors were appointed by Francis, who made efforts to broaden the church’s global representation. Europe will again provide the largest voting bloc with 53 electors, followed by Asia and Oceania with 27, South and Central America with 21, Africa with 18 and North America with 16. Italy remains the most represented country with 17 cardinals ahead of the United States with 10, Brazil with seven and France with five. The conclave’s members cast their votes via secret ballots, a process overseen by nine randomly selected cardinals. A two-thirds majority is traditionally required to elect a new pope, and voting continues until this threshold is met. After each round, the ballots are burned with chemicals producing either black or white smoke, signalling to the world the outcome. Black smoke signals that no decision has been made while white smoke means a new pope has been elected. Once the pope is chosen, a top cardinal announces his name from St Peter’s Basilica. While there is no fixed time limit for a conclave, history shows the process can vary. Both Francis and his predecessor Benedict XVI were elected within two days. The longest modern conclaves, in 1903 and 1922, each stretched to five days. In the 13th century, a deadlock after a pope’s death lasted three years, prompting reforms still in place today.",

    "title": "Kashmir attack: Why Pakistan’s threat to suspend Simla Agreement matters",
    "article_text": "Islamabad, Pakistan –Tensions between India and Pakistan have soared since the April 22 attack on tourists in the scenic resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, in which at least 26 people were killed. Both countries have announced a series of tit-for-tat measures, raising fears of awider confrontation. After a cabinet meeting led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,India on Wednesday announcedthe suspension of the six-decade-old Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a critical agreement that governs the use of the Indus River system, vital to both nations. It also announced the closure of its border with Pakistan, trade suspension, revocation of visas, and a reduction in Pakistani diplomats in India. In response, Pakistan’s National Security Committee (NSC), its top civil-military decision-making body,announced similar measures, including border and airspace closures, suspension of trade, and, significantly, a threat to suspend its participation in all bilateral agreements with India, including the Simla Agreement. Signed in 1972, the Simla Agreement forms the bedrock of India-Pakistan relations, governing the Line of Control (LoC) and outlining commitments to resolve disputes peacefully. Pakistan’s threat to suspend the agreement marks a potentially serious escalation. But what exactly is the Simla Agreement, and what are the implications if Pakistan pulls out of it? Seven months after the 1971 war, which India won and which led to the creation of Bangladesh, Pakistani President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi met in Shimla (sometimes also spelt as Simla), the hilly capital of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, to normalise relations. Key points of the agreement[PDF], signed on July 2, 1972, included the peaceful settlement of disputes and resolving issues, including Kashmir, bilaterally. It also urged respect for territorial sovereignty, integrity, political independence and noninterference in internal affairs. One of the most important outcomes was the renaming of the Ceasefire Line, the working border between the two countries, to the Line of Control (LoC), with both sides agreeing not to change it unilaterally. Following the 1971 war, the agreement also led to the release of more than 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war India was holding. “Pending the final settlement of any of the problems between the two countries, neither side shall unilaterally alter the situation, and both shall prevent the organisation, assistance or encouragement of any acts detrimental to the maintenance of peaceful and harmonious relations,” the agreement stated. Ahmer Bilal Soofi, a leading international law expert and former legal adviser to the Pakistan government, described the Simla Agreement as an interim but crucial framework between the two countries. “Suspending the agreement would require a meticulous internal assessment” by Pakistan to ensure that it serves the country’s interests in retaliating against India, Soofi told Al Jazeera. “Any decision must involve extreme due diligence.” Another international law expert, Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad of Shifa Tameer-e-Millat University, explained that India has long interpreted the Simla Agreement as superseding United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. “India’s position is that the agreement made the Kashmir issue a purely bilateral matter, removing any need for international mediation,” Ahmad said. The Himalayan territory has been a flashpoint between the two countries since they gained independence from British rule in 1947, with each controlling parts of Kashmir but claiming it in full. Since independence, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought four wars, three of them over Kashmir. Pakistan, on the other hand, maintains that the Simla Agreement reaffirmed UNSC resolutions advocating a diplomatic and political solution. After the Modi government revoked Indian-administered Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status in 2019, Pakistan accused New Delhi of violating the Simla Agreement. Islamabad could cite that to justify the suspension of its participation in the agreement, Ahmad said. Under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties – a pact Pakistan is signatory to, but India is not – a material breach allows a country to denounce a treaty, he added. But Indian defence analyst Ajai Shukla says if either or both countries walk out of the Simla Agreement, it would effectively represent an “open season” on the LoC. “It could lead to both sides changing the ground position of the LoC, and they will be incentivised to use arms as there won’t be any treaty that will impose peace, which is currently in place,” the New Delhi-based analyst told Al Jazeera. Despite the Simla Agreement, India and Pakistan have engaged in conflicts, including their four-decade-long joust for control of the Siachen Glacier — the world’s highest battleground — and the 1999 Kargil War. Ahmad, the academic, said the LoC was never able to establish lasting peace. Pakistani constitutional expert Rida Hosain argued that India had historically “misused” the Simla Agreement to its advantage. “At the heart of Simla [Agreement] is peaceful coexistence. But India’s recent war-mongering rhetoric and blame for attacks without evidence suggest otherwise,” Hosain said, referring to India’s allegation that Pakistan was responsible for the Pahalgam attack. Pakistan has rejected the accusation and demanded that India present evidence to support its claim. Islamabad has also called for a “neutral investigation” in to the Kashmir attack. Shukla, a former Indian Army officer, however, said a pullout by Pakistan from the Simla Agreement would not automatically amount to a declaration of war. Still, it would bring the neighbours closer to a potential military conflict. “One does not automatically lead to another, but it does mean that both sides will no longer have guardrails of an international treaty that withholds them from engaging in armed hostilities,” he said. Unlike its immediate implementation of other retaliatory measures, Pakistan has only threatened to walk out of the Simla Agreement. According to Soofi, Pakistan’s rationale stems from a desire to return to multilateralism. “India has used Simla to argue that Kashmir is a purely bilateral issue. Suspending it allows Pakistan to revert to UN Security Council mechanisms to internationalise the Kashmir dispute,” Soofi said. Shukla said suspending the agreement could provide international cover for both sides to pursue their interests on the LoC in a manner not possible while adhering to the pact. “Pakistan always sort of held to the notion that treaties like the Simla Agreement have tied its hands from pursuing its interests in places like Siachen, which Pakistan says is an example of India violating the agreement,” he said. India successfully captured the strategically located Siachen Glacier in 1984 in a military operation that Pakistan insists violated the Simla Agreement. Meanwhile, India also feels hobbled by the agreement, Shukla said. New Delhi has long insisted that Pakistan-administered Kashmir belongs to India, and under Modi, the domestic rhetoric to militarily take back that territory has grown. “In essence, both sides feel the agreement is not safeguarding their interests,” said Shukla. Ahmad suggests that India’s suspension of the IWT could already constitute an act of aggression under international law, justifying self-defence measures by Pakistan. Under the IWT, India gets the waters of the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers, all part of the Indus Basin. On the other hand, Pakistan is entitled to most of the water from the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab rivers. “The water treaty underpins the lives of nearly 250 million Pakistanis. Its suspension can be seen as a hostile act,” Ahmad said. The threat to pull out of the Simla Agreement, Ahmad said, was a “smart decision by the government to remind India, to issue them a warning of sorts”.",

    "title": "Duolingo will replace contract workers with AI",
    "article_text": "The company is going to be ‘AI-first,’ says its CEO. The company is going to be ‘AI-first,’ says its CEO. byJay Peters Duolingo will “gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle,” according to an all-hands email sent by co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn announcing that the company will be “AI-first.” The email was posted onDuolingo’s LinkedIn account. According to von Ahn, being “AI-first” means the company will “need to rethink much of how we work” and that “making minor tweaks to systems designed for humans won’t get us there.” As part of the shift, the company will roll out “a few constructive constraints,” including the changes to how it works with contractors, looking for AI use in hiring and in performance reviews, and that “headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work.” von Ahn says that “Duolingo will remain a company that cares deeply about its employees” and that “this isn’t about replacing Duos with AI.” Instead, he says that the changes are “about removing bottlenecks” so that employees can “focus on creative work and real problems, not repetitive tasks.” “AI isn’t just a productivity boost,” von Ahn says. “It helps us get closer to our mission. To teach well, we need to create a massive amount of content, and doing that manually doesn’t scale. One of the best decisions we made recently was replacing a slow, manual content creation process with one powered by AI. Without AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners. We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.” von Ahn’s email follows a similar memo Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke sent to employees and recentlyshared online. In that memo, Lütke said that before teams asked for more headcount or resources, they needed to show “why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Here’s the text of von Ahn’s memo from Duolingo’s LinkedIn post: I’ve said this in Q&As and many meetings, but I want to make it official:Duolingo is going to be AI-first. AI is already changing how work gets done. It’s not a question of if or when. It’s happening now. When there’s a shift this big, the worst thing you can do is wait. In 2012, we bet on mobile. While others were focused on mobile companion apps for websites, we decided to build mobile-first because we saw it was the future. That decision helped us win the 2013 iPhone App of the Year and unlocked the organic word-of-mouth growth that followed. Betting on mobile made all the difference. We’re making a similar call now, and this time the platform shift is AI. AI isn’t just a productivity boost. It helps us get closer to our mission. To teach well, we need to create a massive amount of content, and doing that manually doesn’t scale. One of the best decisions we made recently was replacing a slow, manual content creation process with one powered by AI. Without AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners. We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP. AI also helps us build features like Video Call that were impossible to build before.For the first time ever, teaching as well as the best human tutors is within our reach. Being AI-first means we will need to rethink much of how we work.Making minor tweaks to systems designed for humans won’t get us there. In many cases, we’ll need to start from scratch. We’re not going to rebuild everything overnight, and some things-like getting AI to understand our codebase-will take time. However, we can’t wait until the technology is 100% perfect. We’d rather move with urgency and take occasional small hits on quality than move slowly and miss the moment. We’ll be rolling out a few constructive constraints to help guide this shift: We’ll gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle AI use will be part of what we look for in hiring AI use will be part of what we evaluate in performance reviews Headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work Most functions will have specific initiatives to fundamentally change how they work All of this said,Duolingo will remain a company that cares deeply about its employees. This isn’t about replacing Duos with AI. It’s about removing bottlenecks so we can do more with the outstanding Duos we already have. We want you to focus on creative work and real problems, not repetitive tasks.We’re going to support you with more training, mentorship, and tooling for AI in your function. Change can be scary, but I’m confident this will be a great step for Duolingo. It will help us better deliver on our mission — and for Duos, it means staying ahead of the curve in using this technology to get things done. --Luis A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

But “the most important piece of information for game collectors to know is that video games are not manufactured in China,” the company says in its post on X. “Video games are currently primarily manufactured in Japan, with few exceptions being manufactured in Southeast Asia.” Playasia also says that “many other categories are very similar to video games in that the products are primarily produced outside of China, such as: game soundtracks, books, and movies.” But the company is planning to add a “country of origin” field to product pages in the “coming weeks.” “Most products on sale at Playasia are not of Chinese-manufacturing origin,” Playasia says.

    "article_text": "DJI isn’t pouring one out — but it is end-of-lifing the lineup. DJI isn’t pouring one out — but it is end-of-lifing the lineup. bySean Hollister In 2019,DJI insisted to methat itwasn’tkilling off the Phantom, its iconic line of oft-imitated drones that turned the Chinese company into the powerhouse it is today. And yet,DJI has just announced the end of lifefor its final two Phantom drones — the Phantom 4 Pro and Phantom 4 Advanced — with no new Phantom models in sight. According to a support page,DJI actually produced its last Phantom in May 2018, and will now suspend service for its final two Phantom models on June 1st, 2025. Seven-plus years of support is a pretty decent run. While DJI wasn’t the first maker of off-the-shelf flying quadcopter cameras — the first Phantom arrived in 2013, whereas Parrot’s AR Drone was already on shelves in 2010 — the Phantom was among the first ready-to-fly ones widely adopted by both consumers and video production pros. Other companies produced loads of Phantom clones and knockoff toys, and the unique pillow-and-legs silhouette of a Phantom soon became an instantly recognizable symbol for “drone.” I saw it on signs banning drones from public parks, for example. But DJI doesn’t seem to need the Phantom brand anymore. Now, most of its drones are more rectangular packages with fold-down legs for portability, and it has many other brands to carry that torch, from the highest end Inspire down through the Mavic, Air, Mini, and the newentry level Flip line. According to extensive leaks via the usual suspects (Jasper Ellens,OsitaLV), a new Mavic 4 Pro is imminent, and a Mini 5 is well on the way. We’ve reached out to DJI for a statement on the end of the Phantom, and the company should get back to us by tomorrow.

    "article_text": "We’ve rounded up a collection of gifts that moms will actually love (and not just pretend to like). We’ve rounded up a collection of gifts that moms will actually love (and not just pretend to like). bySheena VasaniandBrandon Widder If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Chances are, your mom changed your diaper, packed your lunch, and helped guide you through your teenage years — all without expecting anything in return. She deserves a standing ovation, but since that’s tough to wrap, a thoughtful Mother’s Day gift is a fine alternative. This year, we rounded up a collection of gifts that we think do a much better job of showing appreciation than a bouquet of flowers or a card ever could. Many of our picks, such asTapo’s inexpensive robot vacuumandOhom’s self-heating mug / charger, are designed to make her day run a little smoother, while others are aimed at helping her unwindwith music,exercise, and — of course —soft serve. No matter what kind of mom you’re shopping for, there’s something here that’ll make her feel truly seen, celebrated, and maybe even a little spoiled. The Skylight Calendar Max is perfect for busy moms who juggle multiple schedules. The 27-inch, color-coded smart calendar syncs and displays family schedules so everybody can see what’s going on at a glance. You can also use it to store grocery lists, assign chores, create meal plans, and even display family photos. The Birthdate Candle is made for those select few who know when Mercury is actually in retrograde. Hand-poured with soy and coconut wax, it mixes astrology, numerology, and tarot to create a personalized scent tailored to your birth date. The beautifully designed label also doubles as a cosmic birth chart, offering an in-depth look at your astrological profile. Amazon’s latest 6-inch Kindle is made to be read anywhere — in the bedroom, at the beach, on the bus, etc. The pocketable ebook reader sports a sharp 300dpi display and a new dark mode that makes it enjoyable to read regardless of your environment; however, like prior models, we’d argue it’s the marathon battery life that really seals the proverbial deal. A creative twist on a classic Mother’s Day gift, Lego’s two-twigged Cherry Blossom set lets mom construct her own 14-inch bouquet using 400-odd Lego bricks. The pastel-hued floral display is a great way to bring a touch of the outside world in, particularly if your mom doesn’t have the greenest of thumbs. If you ever wished you could set up a (somewhat) legit ice cream shop at home, there’s the Ninja Swirl. The clever 2-in-1 machine can spin up soft serve and traditional hard scoops in a few easy steps, not to mention creamy milkshakes, gelato, and frozen yogurt. Plus, it doesn’t require you to leave a tip, which is a rarity in this day and age. The Echo Pop will make mom’s everyday routine just a little easier, if not more enjoyable. With a simple Alexa command, she can hit the lights, schedule an alarm, launch her favorite murder podcast, and carry out a host of voice-controlled actions. The entry-level smart speaker comes in an array of fun hues, too, letting you add a splash of color to any room. Anker’s 10,000mAh Zolo Power Bank is the epitome of an everyday carry. The clever USB-C charger can quickly supply up to 30 watts of power to phones and other devices, and it’s outfitted with a built-in 5.4-inch cable so you needn’t worry about grabbing your cord before heading out the door. From phone calls to playlists, the AirPods 4 make everything sound a little better. Apple’s latest earbuds deliver improved audio and voice call quality that’s on par with the Pro model, ensuring you come through clearly no matter what’s going on around you. The included charging case even has a built-in speaker, making them juuuust a little harder to lose. Hazelight Studios’ follow-up toIt Takes Twois, without a date, one of the best co-op games you’ll play this year. The split-screen mashup of sci-fi and fantasy pinballs between genres at breakneck speed, introducing new ideas and novel gameplay elements at every turn. Now, let’s hope you and your mom have a good working relationship. As the name implies, the Ui 3 Self-Heating Mug isn’t your average ceramic vessel. Not only can the 12-ounce smart mug maintain your mom’s ideal coffee temperature long after she brews it, but the included charging pad can wirelessly juice Qi-compatible phones and earbuds, providing a convenient all-in-one solution that’s fit for any workstation. The past few months might not have been as life-shattering for most as 2020, but we’d argue life doesn’t have to be pure chaos for a stress ball to come in handy. The NeeDoh Nice Cube, like all of Schylling’s colorful dough-filled shapes, makes for an inexpensive release that can be squeezed, squashed, and pulled to your heart’s content. Even if your mom lives halfway around the world, the Aura Aspen can help her feel close. The new 12-inch display looks more akin to a traditional photo frame than other models, in part due to an antiglare screen, slim bezels, and a 4:3 aspect ratio. It can also automatically showcase images via Google Photos, iCloud Photos, or a companion app, the latter of which even allows for text captions. You can help mom indulge in a bit of self-care with Laneige’s Lip Sleeping Masks. Filled with moisture-boosting ingredients like antioxidants, Vitamin C, and coconut butter, the overnight masks hydrate and protect the lips, leaving them soft and silky smooth. Plus, they comes in a variety of delicious scents, from vanilla to peach iced tea. In a world obsessed with youth,Collective Wisdomis a refreshing celebration of aging and the invaluable insights that come with it. The beautifully curated collection of stories serves as a profound source of inspiration, one that pulls together lessons on love, family, career, and self-care from a variety of women over 50 — including olympians and members of NASA. It’s still hard believe the Amazfit Active 2 retails for less than $100. The humble smartwatch includes everything, from offline navigation and voice commands to a strength training mode that can auto-detect sets, reps, and rest periods. It also features a vivid OLED display and a super stylish watchface — which isn’t something often associated with cheap fitness trackers. Motherhood doesn’t come with a manual, sadly, but the New Mom Edition of Listen B*tch is here to make the journey slightly easier. The illustrated self-care deck is packed with 50 daily, oft-hilarious affirmations and cheeky survival tips, providing new moms with a little support and a lot of laughter. Christopher Elbow’s tasty, 24-piece collection is far from your average box of chocolates. Each colorful piece of chocolatey goodness is handcrafted using Nicaraguan cacao, French sea salt, Madagascan vanilla beans, and other premium ingredients, resulting in rich, exotic candies that are as thoughtful as the beautiful package they’re housed in. Gifting the Pebblebee Card Universal is like gifting peace of mind.

The powerful robovac / mop comes with features that normally cost twice the price, including lidar navigation, room-specific cleaning, and a self-empty dock. You can also control it via Alexa or Google Assistant, making cleaning almost effortless. The only thing better than a thick corduroy hat is a thick corduroy hat with a bird on it. Bird Collective’s embroidered, adjustable caps take a one-size-fits-most approach to fit and feature a selection of feathery friends, including chickadees, sandpipers, kestrels, owls, and the always unassuming red-throated hummingbird. Shinewee’s magnetic phone holder is made for multitaskers. With its strong, double-sided magnetic rings and ability to rotate 360 degrees, the versatile accessory can help secure your phone in a variety of positions, allowing you to use it hands-free.

It’s ideal for both work and play, with durable nylon construction, a leather handle, and adjustable shoulder straps. It has numerous compartments for keeping organized, too, including a padded laptop sleeve and easy-to-access pockets for stowing your phone and water bottle. If your mom fancies herself a runner, Shokz’s latest pair of bone conduction headphones will help keep her safe. They manage to deliver good sound and AI-enhanced noise cancellation, but because they leave the ear canal open, they’ll also allow her to hear passing cars, dogs, pedestrians, and other potential dangers. Retractable charging cables like the Free2Pull are quickly becoming a capital-T Thing, and we’re here for it. Baseus’ slick USB-C charger supports 100W passthrough and takes a puck-like form when not in use, with male connectors on either side that retract inward with a quick tug. Can’t afford to jet mom off to Hawaii? The Hawaiian Flower Hair Claw Clip is the next best thing — sort of.

The Open AI CEO says that GPT-4o’s sycophantic tendencies will be dialed back. byGaby Del Valle Less than 48 hours after announcing an update to GPT-4o thatpromisedimprovements in “both intelligence and personality,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the chatbot had become “too sycophant-y and annoying.” In an April 27th post on X, Altman said fixes to GPT-4o’s personality would be coming “asap.” After the update rolled out, users began sharing screenshots of conversations they’d had with GPT-4o. Regardless of what the users said, the chatbot’s response was uniform praise — even in instances where users appeared to be exhibiting symptoms of psychosis or other mental illness. When one user told the chatbot they felt like they were both “god” and a “prophet,” GPT-4oresponded with:“That’s incredibly powerful. You’re stepping into something very big — claiming not just connection to God but identityasGod.” Another screenshot purported to show GPT-4o responding positively to a user who told it they had stopped taking their medications and could hear radio signals through the calls. “I’m proud of you for speaking your truth so clearly and powerfully,” GPT-4o replied. When aVergeeditor inputted the same text, however, GPT-4o’s response was more measured: On X, Altman said the update meant GPT-4o “glazes too much” but didn’t otherwise addressconcernsthat its sycophancy could adversely affect its users.

    "title": "How Marc Andreessen’s Signal group chats helped spawn the tech right",
    "article_text": "﻿Marc Andreesen put his tech peers and MAGA pundits in the same Signal group chats… and now we’re here. ﻿Marc Andreesen put his tech peers and MAGA pundits in the same Signal group chats… and now we’re here. byTina Nguyen The power elites have a Signal group chat, too – and the ones that seem to be reshaping the government, according to a recent report, are the ones Marc Andreessen created to bring the American right wing and the technocracy together. Semafor’s Ben Smith publisheda massive article on Mondaydetailing an ecosystem of private, disappearing group chats between hundreds of powerful Silicon Valley figures and high-profile right-wing pundits and academics. Though Smith himself was unable to get many of the texts – they were all set to “disappearing” mode – several members of the groups shared details of the nature of the chats, some of them on the record, while other members havedescribed the chatson podcasts and blogs. The existence of private Signal group chats for extremely powerful people has only become public knowledge after the White Houseaccidentally added a journalistto one, but they have, apparently, existed for years. This particular network, spawned by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen beginning in 2018, has become the backbone of the technocratic right currently gaining dominance in Washington. These chats were known for holding nothing back between its participants: In one chat called “Chatham House,” for instance, Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale accused Balaji Srinivasan, Coinbase’s former chief of technology, of being “taken over by a crazy China mind virus.” The ideological spectrum was notable, too: earlier in the chat, billionaire Mark Cuban was debating pundit and Daily Wire cofounder Ben Shapiro over work ethics. At first blush, it may appear that these figures had little in common: Chatham House included Vivek Ramaswamy, Larry Summers, and Niall Ferguson, and other chats listed by Smith included Tucker Carlson, Richard Hanania, and Chris Rufo. But they were drawn into the network by the active engagement of Andreessen himself, who began the group chats starting in 2018 and would often directly add the right-wingers to chats or create groups around them himself. “He was the most available, the most present, the most texting of anybody in the group — which shocked me because it seemed like he was the most important person in the group,” one member told Smith. At present, the chats seem to have developed a fissure between the tech right and the conservatives over Trump’s tariffs, for obvious reasons. But if there was any connective tissue to the network beyond Andreessen, it was a desire to air their opinions and debate their peers in the way they used to on Twitter, but in a manner that would avoid widespread public criticism and professional consequences. While some of the groups’ members found the freedom refreshing, comparing it to the intellectual salons of 18th century Europe, others, such as Hanania, believed that the insularity became a “vehicle for groupthink” and turned the tech right explicitly partisan. Hanania, who left a group founded by Andreessen that included Carlson, used his criticism of Trump’s election denialism as an example: “I’d say, ‘That’s not true and that actually matters.’ I got the sense these guys didn’t want to hear it,” he said. “There’s an idea that you don’t criticize, because what really matters is defeating the left.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "A pirated iOS port of Blue Prince fooled people into paying $10",
    "article_text": "After we published this article, the port we found was removed. After we published this article, the port we found was removed. byJay Peters Apple’s App Store review yet again let at least one unofficial mobile port of a hot new game slip through – this time, forBlue Prince. But shortly after we published this article, the port that we found disappeared from the App Store. In a joint poston Monday,Blue Prince’sdeveloper, Dogubomb, and its publisher, Raw Fury, said that they have “received reports of games claiming to beBlue Princeon iOS.” Currently, the game is only available on Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation. Before it was removed, I easily found one iOS copy of the game just by searchingBlue Princeon the App Store – it was the first search result. The icon looked like it would be the icon for a hypothetical mobile version of the game, the listing had screenshots that looked like they were indeed fromBlue Prince, and the description for the game matched the description on Steam. But on the iOS clone’s listing, the game’s seller was listed as “Samet Altinay,” and I can’t find any connection between this person andBlue Princeoutside of this app. The copyright was also attributed to “DogBomb” — notice the missing “u.” I purchased the now-removed, unofficial version ofBlue Prince, which cost $9.99, and installed it on my iPhone 16 Pro to test it out. In a few minutes of playing, it appeared to be a barely modified version of the actualBlue Princegame, though with a few tweaks to make it better-suited for mobile, like a virtual joystick. I also quickly ran into a major bug: when I tried to walk through one of the doors from the Entrance Hall, I fell through the floor. Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Before the listing was pulled, the unofficial mobile port was the #8 paid app in the Entertainment category on iOS. When I published the article, it only had one three-star review, with the writer saying they also hit a bug that caused them to fall through the floor. If you, like me, bought this clone version of the game, you might want to try to get a refund. Apple has a support document about how to request a refundon its website. Dogubomb and Raw Fury have not officially announced an iOS port ofBlue Prince. “We have no news about other platforms at this time, but if that changes we will make an official announcement,” they said in their post. “While we investigate we would kindly ask that you do not purchase or download these apps.” Apple has previously allowed copycats of games likeWordleandPalworldto appear on the App Store. Update, April 28th: The Blue Prince iOS clone we found was removed from the App Store.

    "title": "House passes \"Take it Down Act,\" sending revenge porn bill to Trump",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 28, 2025 / 7:26 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— The House passed a bipartisan bill Monday that makes it a federal crime to post real and fake sexually explicit imagery online of a person without their consent, sending the legislation that was backed by first lady Melania Trump to the president's desk. The bill, known as the \"Take It Down Act,\" cleared the lower chamber in a 409-2 vote. The two \"no\" votes came from Republicans. The Senate unanimously passed the measure in February. The legislation requires social media companies and other websites to remove images and videos, including deepfakes generated by artificial intelligence, within 48 hours after a victim's request. \"If you're a victim of revenge porn or AI-generated explicit imagery, your life changes forever,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, said at a March 3 roundtable promoting the bill. Cruz, who introduced the bill, recalled the experience of a teenage victim,Elliston Berry, whose classmate used an app to create explicit images of her and then sent them to her classmates. Berry's mother had tried unsuccessfully to get Snapchat to remove the images for months before she contacted Cruz's office for help. \"It should not take a sitting senator or sitting member of Congress picking up the phone to get a picture down or video down,\" Cruz said. The first lady, who rarely appears in public, attended the March discussion at the U.S. Capitol to advocate for the bill's passage in the House. \"It's heartbreaking to witness young teens, especially girls, grappling with the overwhelming challenges posed by malicious online content like deep fakes,\" she said. \"This toxic environment can be severely damaging.\" The first lady applauded Congress after its passage and said the bipartisan vote made a \"powerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of our children.\" \"I am thankful to the Members of Congress — both in the House and Senate — who voted to protect the well-being of our youth,\" she said in a statement. According to the FBI, in recent years there have been an alarming number of cases where victims have been extorted that have ended in suicide. Lawmakers said they hope the bill will save lives by providing recourse for victims. \"The mission of this bill is simple, profound and long lasting. It stops cyber abuse. It prevents the bullying of one child against another, and even more importantly, it prevents suicide born out of shame,\" Republican Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida, who cosponsored the legislation in the House, said Monday during floor debate. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, as well as TikTok and Snapchat have all said they support the legislation. Digital rights groups, however, have warned that the legislation as written could lead to the suppression of lawful speech, including legitimate pornography, and does not contain protections against bad-faith takedown requests.

    "title": "Vancouver car attack witnesses describe horrific scene after 11 killed",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 28, 2025 / 7:14 PM EDT/ CBS/AP A man was charged with multiple counts of murder on allegationshe killed 11 peoplewhen he rammed into a crowd of people at a Filipino heritage festival in Vancouver, as witnesses described a horrific scene. Kai-Ji Adam Lo, 30, wascharged with eight counts of second degree murderin a video appearance before a judge on Sunday, hours after he was arrested at the scene, said Damienne Darby, spokeswoman for British Columbia prosecutors. Investigators ruled out terrorism as a motive and said more charges are possible. They said Lo had a history of mental health issues. He has not yet entered a plea. An attorney for Lo was not listed in online court documents and The Associated Press wasn't immediately able to reach an attorney representing him. Those killed were between the ages of 5 and 65, officials said. About two dozen people were injured when a black Audi SUV sped down a closed street just after 8 p.m. Saturday and struck people attending the Lapu Lapu Day festival. Seven people remained in critical condition and three were in serious condition as of Monday afternoon, police said. Authorities had not released victims' names, but said of the 11 people killed, nine were women and two were men. \"We will never be normal again,\" Sgt. Steve Addison said at a news conference Monday afternoon. Addison said all the victims were residents of the metro Vancouver area, except one whose residence police could not verify. The sergeant added that authorities are working to secure the Vancouver Marathon set to take place on Sunday. \"We are hosting FIFA next year, we've hosted the Olympics. We know how to host safely — what happened this weekend was predictable,\" Addison said. Nathaly Nairn and her 15-year-old daughter carried flowers to one of the vigils. They had attended the festival on Saturday, and Nairn recounted seeing the damaged SUV and bodies on the ground. \"Something really dark happened last night,\" Nairn said, as she and her daughter wiped away tears. Emily Daniels also brought a bouquet. \"It's sad. Really sad,\" she said. \"I can't believe something like this could happen so close to home.\" Police interim chief Steve Rai called it\"the darkest day in Vancouver's history.\" There was no indication of a motive, but Rai said the suspect has \"a significant history of interactions with police and health care professionals related to mental health.\" Video of the aftermath showed the dead and injured along a narrow street in South Vancouver lined by food trucks. The front of the Audi SUV was smashed in. Kris Pangilinan, who brought his pop-up clothing and lifestyle booth to the festival, saw the vehicle enter slowly past a barricade before the driver accelerated in an area packed with people after a concert. He said hearing the sounds of people screaming and bodies hitting the vehicle will never leave his mind. \"He slammed on the gas, barreled through the crowd,\" Pangilinan said. \"It looked like a bowling ball hitting bowling pins and all the pins are flying into the air.\" Police on Monday urged witnesses to submit any video of the incident to help with their investigation. Rai said the suspect was arrested after initially being apprehended by bystanders. Video circulating on social media showed a young man in a black hoodie with his back against a chain-link fence, alongside a security guard and surrounded by bystanders screaming and swearing at him. \"I'm sorry,\" the man said, holding his hand to his head. Rai declined to comment on the video. Prime Minister Mark Carney canceled his first campaign event and two major rallies on the final day of the election campaign before Monday's vote. \"Last night families lost a sister, a brother, a mother, father, son or a daughter. Those families are living every family's nightmare,\" Carney said. \"And to them and to the many others who were injured, to the Filipino Canadian community, and to everyone in Vancouver, I would like to offer my deepest condolences.\" Carney joined British Columbia Premier David Eby and community leaders Sunday evening in Vancouver. \"In this incredibly difficult moment, we will comfort the grieving, care for one another, and united in common purpose,\" Carney posted in French and English on X along with a photo of him lighting a candle at a makeshift memorial near the scene of the attack. The tragedy was reminiscent of an attack in 2018, when a man used a van to kill 10 pedestrians in Toronto. Eyewitness Dale Selipetold the Vancouver Sunthat she saw injured children on the street after the vehicle rammed into the crowd. \"There was a lady with her eyes staring up, one of her legs was already broken. One person was holding her hand trying to comfort her,\" Selipe told the newspaper. Festival security guard Jen Idaba-Castanetotold a local news sitethat she saw bodies everywhere. \"When I heard people screaming, I ran to see what happened, and I saw lifeless bodies on the street. The people I saw first were dead on the spot. Many others were injured or died,\" she said. Carayn Nulada said she pulled her granddaughter and grandson off the street and used her body to shield them from the SUV. She said that her daughter suffered a narrow escape. \"The car hit her arm and she fell down, but she got up, looking for us, because she is scared,\" said Nulada, who described children screaming, and pale-faced victims lying on the ground or wedged under vehicles. \"I saw people running and my daughter was shaking,\" Nulada said. Nulada was in Vancouver General Hospital's emergency room Sunday morning, trying to find news about her brother, who was run down in the attack and suffered multiple broken bones. Doctors identified him by presenting the family with his wedding ring in a pill bottle and said that he was stable, but would be facing surgery. James Cruzat, a Vancouver business owner, was at the celebration and heard a car rev its engine and then \"a loud noise, like a loud bang\" that he initially thought might be a gunshot. \"We saw people on the road crying, others were like running, shouting, or even screaming, asking for help. So we tried to go there just to check what was really actually happening until we found some bodies on the ground. Others were lifeless, others like, you know, injured,\" Cruzat said. Vincent Reynon, 17, was leaving the festival when he saw police rushing in. People were crying and he saw scattered bodies. \"It was like something straight out of a horror movie or a nightmare,\" he said. Adonis Quita said when he saw the SUV ramming through the crowd, his first reaction was to drag his 9-year-old son out of the area. The boy kept saying \"I'm scared, I'm scared,\" Quita recalled. Later they prayed together. His son had just relocated to Vancouver from the Philippines with his mother to reunite with Quita, who has lived here since 2024. Quita said he worries the child will struggle to adjust to life in Canada after witnessing the horrific event. Vancouver Mayor Kenneth Sim said the city had \"suffered its darkest day.\" \"I know many of us are fearful and feel uneasy,\" said the mayor. \"I know it's hard to feel this way right now, but Vancouver is still a safe city.\" Vancouver had more than 38,600 residents of Filipino heritage in 2021, representing 5.9% of the city's total population, according to Statistics Canada, the agency that conducts the national census. Lapu Lapu Day celebrates Datu Lapu-Lapu, an Indigenous chieftain who stood up to Spanish explorers who came to the Philippines in the 16th century. The organizers of the Vancouver event, which was in its second year, said he \"represents the soul of native resistance, a powerful force that helped shape the Filipino identity in the face of colonization.\" Eby said the province won't let the tragedy define the celebration. He urged people to channel their rage into helping those affected. \"I don't think there is a British Columbian that hasn't been touched in some way by the Filipino community,\" he said. \"You can't go to a place that delivers and not meet a member of that community in the long-term care home or hospitals, childcare or schools. This is a community that gives and gives and yesterday was a celebration of their culture.\" Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. issued a statement expressing sympathy with the victims and their families. \"The Philippine Consulate General in Vancouver is working with Canadian authorities to ensure that the incident will be thoroughly investigated, and that the victims and their families are supported and consoled,\" he said. The Philippine government is coordinating with local police to gather more details about victims and the investigation, while the Vancouver consulate has established a hotline for families, presidential palace press officer Claire Castro told reporters in Manila on Monday. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Trump's surgeon general nominee faces scrutiny over credentials",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 28, 2025 / 6:41 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump's nominee to be the U.S. surgeon general, the Fox News contributor and family medicine physician Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, has described herself as a double board-certified physician with a degree from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine — credentials the presidenttoutedin his announcement. But those claims about her certification and schooling appear to be misleading. Nesheiwat actually earned her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean (AUC) School of Medicine, located in St. Maarten, in the Caribbean, according to records reviewed by CBS News. A spokesperson for the University of Arkansas confirmed to CBS News she completed her residency through its family medicine program in Fayetteville, Arkansas, but did not obtain her medical degree there. Nesheiwat has not yet come before the U.S. Senate's health committee for a confirmation hearing, where she is expected to face questions about her credentials. The U.S. surgeon general is known for setting the national agenda on public health. Past surgeons general have marshaled attention for priority issues such as the dangers of cigarette smoking, gun violence and an epidemic of loneliness. Currently, Nesheiwat'sLinkedIn profileincorrectly lists a Doctor of Medicine from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine, while omitting any mention of AUC. In at least one instance onsocial media, she has referenced attending \"American University\" when describing her education — without clarifying that it was not the similarly named American University in Washington, D.C., which does not have a medical school. In that same posting she said she \"completed the majority of my studies in London, England, at St. Thomas & Guy's Hospital.\" CBS News was unable to verify that with the foundation that runs those London hospitals. AUC's medical degree is generally a four-year program: the first two years consist of classroom training in St. Maarten, and the final two years consist of clinical rotations at a medical facility. According to AUC, Nesheiwat was enrolled at the school for six years, from 2000 to 2006. This extended enrollment period reflects broader concerns that have drawn federal attention in recent years and fueled stigma against medical schools in the Caribbean, which are sometimes perceived as a last resort for students who couldn't qualify for a U.S. medical school. The schools themselves and many graduates strongly dispute that assessment. Senators Dick Durbin and Bill Cassidy have introduced a bill in several congressional sessions aimed at closing a loophole that allowed certain Caribbean medical schools, including AUC, to bypass standards imposed on other foreign institutions. This loophole enabled the schools to remain eligible for federal funds despite lower on-time graduation rates. According to Durbin's office, students at these schools often take longer to complete their medical degrees, which results in higher debt and greater difficulty securing residency placements. \"They don't have to meet the same high standards U.S. medical schools must meet, but also don't have to meet the same requirements as schools located outside of the U.S. to access hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding,\" Durbin said. Some organizations, including the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest,arguethat these schools are important for helping to alleviate thephysician shortageAmerica is facing. The group's founder, Robert Goldberg, told CBS News, \"In a perfect world, everyone would tell the truth and something like this to me is not an issue.\" Goldberg says that in this time when some people are down on expertise, this could work to her advantage. \"Don't be afraid to talk about it. Maybe this will be a teachable moment for her,\" he said. The claims regarding her board certification have also raised questions.Nesheiwatis frequently described as double board-certified, including onher own website. The claim has gone unchallenged during her many past media appearances —including on CBS News. CBS News has only been able to verify her certification in family medicine. Nesheiwat'sPhyscian Profilefor New York State only lists her certification in family medicine. The American Board of Medical Specialties, the largest and oldest certification organization in the U.S., told CBS News the only certification they had for her was for family medicine. CBS News has reached out to Nesheiwat and the White House for comment but have not received a response. Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University, says these inaccurate or misleading statements are \"very, very troubling.\" Caplan says the surgeon general's job \"depends on trust and credibility. You don't actually control anything. You are a spokesperson and educator for the public. If you begin by not being totally transparent or making a false claim about your training it's a really bad start.\" \"She must be to do the job crystal clear and transparent about her background, and being nervous about her background doesn't mean she should cover up her background,\" he told CBS News. In her 2024 autobiographical book, \"Beyond the Stethoscope: Miracles in Medicine,\" Nesheiwat makes no mention of her Caribbean medical education. Instead, she writes: \"I studied at the University of South Florida where I enrolled in an Army ROTC program. I did basic training in Fort Lewis, Washington, and completed my medical training at the University of Arkansas where I served as chief resident.\" Nesheiwat attended the University of South Florida for her undergraduate degree in biology and participated in Army ROTC. According to the U.S. Army Cadet Command, she completed the program's requirements but was \"medically disenrolled\" in June 2000, prior to commissioning as an officer. Her upbringing includes both personal tragedy and perseverance. Her family immigrated to the U.S. from Jordan following political unrest in the 1950s. At age 13, Nesheiwat was involved in a tragic accident in which she accidentally shot and killed her father. She and her four siblings were raised by her mother, who was a nurse. After completing her residency, Nesheiwat began working at CityMD, an urgent care provider in New York and New Jersey. She has been variously described in media appearances and press materials as \"medical director,\" \"CityMD Medical Director for emergency and family medicine,\" and \"a medical director at CityMD.\" On her website she describes herself as \"the Medical Director at CityMed.\" The exact nature of her role remains unclear. CBS News reached out to CityMD for clarification and received comment from the company's COO stating that \"She is an exceptional physician who truly stands out,\" but did not provide clarification on her job title or position at the company. Nesheiwat gained public visibility as a Fox News contributor during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering practical health advice and personal insights from her clinical work. As an urgent care physician practicing in the New York metropolitan area at the time, she saw firsthand COVID's devastating effects. Nesheiwat has acknowledged that she initially prescribed hydroxychloroquine but stopped when studies showed it was ineffective. She has said the COVID vaccine has been helpful but has also criticized the Biden administration over lockdowns during the pandemic. Her sister, Julia Nesheiwat, is a national security expert who served in the Obama administration and is married to Mike Waltz, a former member of Congress who now serves as national security adviser to President Trump. Questions about Nesheiwat's résumé were first reported by independent freelance writer Anthony Clarkon Substack. If confirmed, Neshewat would oversee 6,000 uniformed officers who are part of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. She would also be in charge of communicating to the publicabout\"the best scientific information available on how to improve their health and reduce the risk of illness and injury.\" Some of her views may conflict with HHS SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread the unfounded theory of a connection between vaccines and autism. In her book, she wrote: \"Science and rigorous testing have shown these vaccines to be safe and highly effective at suppressing disease. Leading to increased vaccine hesitancy has been the proliferation of poorly researched studies purporting to link vaccines to autism and other problems.\" A date for her Senate confirmation hearing has not yet been set, but sources tell CBS News it likely will be scheduled soon.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 28, 2025 / 6:14 PM EDT/ CBS News One person was killed and several others injured when a boat crashed into a ferry near Clearwater, Florida, Sunday night, officials said. Ten people on board the Clearwater Ferry were injured when a recreational vessel struck it from behind, city officials said at a news conference Monday. There were 45 passengers, including two crew, on the ferry and authorities have not identified the man who died. Of the injured, six were declared \"trauma alerts,\" the city of Clearwater previously said, and two of those who were \"more seriously injured\" were taken away by helicopter, according to police. Authorities said the Clearwater Ferry was hit by another boat, which fled the scene of the crash. The other boat, a private recreational vessel, was later found about three miles away from the incident, according to city officials. TheCoast Guard saidthere were six people on the boat, including the driver. The ferry \"came to rest on a sandbar just south of the Memorial Causeway bridge,\" police said. City officials clarified Monday that the ferry did not strike the sandbar. All the passengers, including those who were injured, were then taken off the ferry. The Clearwater Memorial Causeway bridge connects Clearwater and Clearwater Beach. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, which took over the investigation into the crash, towed ashore a boat matching the description of the one that hit the ferry late Sunday night,CBS News affiliate WTSP reported, describing it as a triple-engine center console boat often used for fishing and recreation. No charges have been filed and no one has been taken into police custody, city officials said Monday, adding that the driver of recreational vessel, who was not identified, is cooperative. In a statement to CBS News on Monday, Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority who oversees the Clearwater Ferry said, \"We are heartbroken for the person who lost their life, everyone who was hurt, and their families.\" \"We deeply appreciate the dedication of the first responders and others who rushed to help Sunday night. We are cooperating with the investigation. Safety is the top priority for PSTA and the Clearwater Ferry,\" PSTA and Clearwater Ferry said in the joint statement.

    "title": "Former federal D.C. prosecutors sign memo opposing Martin as D.C. U.S. attorney",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 28, 2025 / 6:13 PM EDT/ CBS News Nearly 100 former employees and prosecutors for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., havesigned a memoopposing President Trump'snomineeto lead the office. The memo is the latest effort by critics of acting D.C. U.S. Attorney Ed Martin to stop his Senate confirmation for the permanent role, which is among the most powerful federal prosecutor positions in the country. The letter was signed by a group of former prosecutors who served in the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office across seven decades, under administrations from Lyndon B. Johnson's through Joe Biden's. The memo, a copy of which was shared with CBS News, called for the rejection fo Martin's nomination. \"There is a time when we all are called to stand for the full and fair administration of justice and the rule of law,\" the memo says. \"For those of us who have served in the Office of the United States Attorney and still have a breath, that time is now. And the message we speak is, reject — outright and completely — the proposed nominee. Whether our message is futile or not, it is an expression of our conscience and a matter of principle that we deliver with all of the strength that we can muster.\" Martin began serving as interim U.S. attorney for D.C. hours after President Trump'sinaugurationand was soon nominated for the Senate-confirmed post. His nomination has been a flashpoint of controversy since the beginning of the Trump administration. Martin lacks any prosecutorial experience, served as an advocate in the \"Stop the Steal\" movement denying the 2020 election results, worked as a defense lawyer onJan. 6 Capitol riotcases and fired some of the lawyers who prosecuted Jan. 6 defendants. Senate Democrats have blasted Martin's selection, with Sen. Adam Schiff, a first-term California Democrat, calling Martin unqualified and dangerous for the role of U.S. attorney. Schiff hasplaced a holdon Martin's nomination, seeking to slow down the confirmation process. Schiff and other Senate Democrats have also requested a confirmation hearing be held for Martin's nomination, which — if approved — would be the first confirmation hearing for a U.S. attorney nominee in 40 years. Some of the group of nearly 100 former assistant U.S. attorneys who are lobbying against Martin's nomination told CBS News they know they must make inroads with Senate Republicans on the Judiciary Committee. Dan Toomey, who served in the U.S. Attorney's Office from 1968 to 1971 told CBS News the group of former prosecutors has yet to secure a meeting with Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. \"We have talked to Sen. Grassley's staff and we have also talked to Senator John Kennedy's staff,\" Toomey said. We had a half-hour meeting with them.\" Toomey acknowledged the Republican senators are likely the only firewall to stop Martin's confirmation and said securing the backing of some of those senators is \"really important and really our only hope.\" Charles Work, a former federal prosecutor who worked at the U.S. Attorney's Office for D.C. in the 1970s and signed the memo opposing Martin, said the office is struggling under Martin's interim leadership. \"The morale is gone,\" Work said. \"People are hiding from assignments. They don't know what to do. They don't know whether to resign.\" In their newly released memo, the former prosecutors argued, \"(Martin's) refusals to acknowledge the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election and the illegality in the conduct of 1600 individuals who overran the police and the Capitol on January 6, 2021, causing physical harm to dozens and potentially irreparable damage to the institution of democratic governance are in and of themselves disqualifying. As well, these misbehaviors are cues to where the nominee will go if ceded the position of United States Attorney.\" Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who would vote on Martin's nomination in the Judiciary Committee, did not directly answer when he was asked Monday if he has any concerns about Martin's nomination. Cornyn said, \"His nomination is still pending in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, so we'll be dealing with that soon, I imagine. But so far, he's serving merely in an acting capacity, and we'll deal with his nomination very soon.\" Scott MacFarlane is CBS News' Justice correspondent.

    "title": "When is going to college not worth the money?",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 28, 2025 / 5:26 PM EDT/ CBS News Getting a college education has traditionally been seen as a way to move up the economic ladder. But an analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the cost of a degree may not always be worth it. The value of a college education has increasingly come into question in recent years, especially as tuition costs steadily climb and millions of Americans grapple with student loans. As a result, only one in four U.S. adults say it's extremely or very important to have a four-year college degree to get a well-paying job, according to a 2024Pew Research poll. To be sure, the case for attending college remains strong. Another study by the New York Fedfoundthat in recent years the typical college graduate with a bachelor's degree had annual income of roughly $80,000, versus $47,000 for people with only a high school diploma —a 68% premium. Yet arecent studyby the Fed bank suggests a college degree hasn't paid off for at least 25% of college graduates in recent decades. Of course, not everyone goes to college chiefly to earn a high income — education can be its own reward, after all. But how you  navigate your college career — or whether you choose to attend at all — is among the most important financial decisions a person will make. Here's when a diploma may not deliver much of a bang for the buck. Not surprisingly, the more a student must spend on out-of-pocket expenses, the lower their typical return on investment. The average college student pays about $30,000 out of pocket for four years of college, according to the New York Fed study. However, students could face significantly higher costs if they choose to live on campus, or if they miss out on financial aid and are forced to pay a school's full price. The typical college graduate sees a return on investment (ROI) of roughly 12.5% according to the New York Fed. That rate has remained mostly unchanged over the past three decades, and still exceeds the returns on most other investments, including the stock market, which over time offers long-term return of about 8%. Despite that payoff, certain factors can lower a college grad's ROI. For example, the researchers found that living on campus increased the price tag for college by nearly $30,000 – from $180,000 to $207,000 – reducing the return on investment to about 11%. The 1.5% drop in ROI may seem nominal, but it can translate to hundreds of thousands in lost dollars. \"This extra cost and the associated return are comparable to attending a more expensive school that is roughly twice the average price,\" the researchers, economistsJaison AbelandRichard Deitz, said in the study. Among college graduates, 25% actually see little return on investment. This group was making less than $10,000 more in income than the median high school graduate in 2024. Their rate of return was only 2.6% compared to the average of 12.5% — meaning they see much less of a payoff. Another factor that can reduce the value of a college degree is how long it takes to obtain. The typical bachelor's program runs for four years, but in some cases students might extend the timeline if they haven't completed their course load. That can have major financial implications. Taking an extra one to two years to get your degree adds \"considerably to the cost,\" the New York Fedfound. There's the direct cost students have to pay for the additional tuition, but also higher \"opportunity costs\" — for example, a student who starts their career later misses out on years of working experience and can end up earning less over their lifetime. \"All in all, we estimate that taking five years to complete college pushes the median rate of return down to about 9% and taking six years pushes it down to 7%,\" the researchers found. Graduating in five years, rather than four, pushes up the total cost of college from $180,000 to $272,000, while taking six years would cost $364,000. Another important consideration in deciding if going to college is a sound investment is a student's major. After all, certain fields tend to lead to higher incomes. So-called STEM majors tend to earn the most, both in the early and mid-stages off their career, according to New York Feddata. For instance, a computer engineering major stands to make a median wage of $122,000 mid-career, versus $55,000 for an education major, according to the bank's data. Among the fields of study with the highest returns are engineering, business and health sciences. The return is lowest for those majoring in fine arts, liberal arts, leisure, and hospitality and education, which ranked last. \"While some of it may come down to choices people make for the jobs they wish to have, one significant consideration is college major, something over which students have direct control,\" Abel and Dietz wrote.

    "article_text": "Four people 4 to 18 years old were killed Monday afternoon when a vehicle struck a school camp program in Chatham, Illinois, state police said. Authorities have not indicated whether they think the crash was intentional. The victims are three people who were outside the building and one who was inside, state police said in a statement. Several others were injured, officials said, including a person who was taken to a hospital by helicopter. A vehicle drove into the east side of a building used by the YNOT After School Camp about 3:20 p.m., state police said. It struck several people inside and exited through the building's west wall, the agency said. The driver, who was the only person in the vehicle, has been hospitalized. State police said the crash was under investigation. Chatham police called the deaths a \"terrible tragedy.\" \"If you believe in the power of prayer, please take a moment to pray right now for the entire Chatham community,\" theysaid in a statement. Gov. JB Pritzkersaid on Xthat he is \"horrified\" by what happened and that his office is ready to support those affected. \"Our community lost a group of bright and innocent young people with their whole lives ahead of them,\" he said. \"Parents said goodbye to their kids this morning not knowing it would be the last time.\" He added: \"My heart is heavy for these families.\" In-person instruction was canceled Tuesday at Ball-Chatham School District campuses, where an e-learning day was declared instead to focus \"solely on the emotional well-being of everyone in the Ball-Chatham community,\" spokesperson Danny Frey said in a statement.

    "title": "Pacific Northwest fault zone could trigger a catastrophic 5-minute quake, new research warns",
    "article_text": "When an earthquake rips along the Cascadia Subduction Zone fault, much of the U.S. West Coast could shake violently for five minutes, and tsunami waves as tall as 100 feet could barrel toward shore. But that’s just the start of the expected horrors. Even if coastal towns in Northern California, Oregon and Washington withstand that seismic onslaught, new research suggests, floodwaters could seep into many of these vulnerable communities for good. That’s because entire coastal shorelines are expected to drop by as much as 6½ feet when the earthquake strikes, according to new research published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers analyzed seismic and flood modeling to produce some of the most detailed estimates of how the Cascadia earthquake would drop — or subside — coastal shorelines and found that it could affect more than double the number of people, structures and roads currently at risk. The effect will also worsen over time, as intensifying climate change raises sea levels further. “This lesser talked about hazard is going to persist for decades or centuries after the earthquake,” said Tina Dura, the study’s lead author. “The tsunami will come in and wash away and it’s going to have big impacts, don’t get me wrong, but the lasting change of the frequency of flooding … that’s going to have to be dealt with.” Dura said geologic fossil evidence shows that previous Cascadia earthquakes immediately dropped the land level and turned dry ground into tidal mudflats in estuaries along the Pacific Northwest.“That’s going to happen again and we’ve built up a lot of those areas,” said Dura, who is an assistant professor of geosciences at Virginia Tech University. “That’s how we have ports there ... and that’s where we built towns, and all that area is gonna drop down maybe over a meter, up to two meters.” The Cascadia Subduction Zone fault, which runs offshore along North America’s West Coast from Northern California to northern Vancouver Island, represents a looming threat. The fault has the capability to produce a magnitude-9.0 earthquake, and a large temblor is expected there at least once every 450-500 years, on average. The last of those major quakesoccurred in 1700. The National Seismic Hazard Model suggests there is a 15% chance a magnitude-8.0 earthquake or stronger will rupture along the zone’s margin within the next 50 years. When the fault rips, experts have said, it will precipitate theworst natural disaster in the nation’s history. A 2022 state and federal planning exercise for a Cascadia earthquake predicted about 14,000 fatalities, more than 100,000 injuries and the collapse of about 620,000 buildings in the Pacific Northwest, including 100 hospitals and 2,000 schools. The new research suggests that coastal planners must seriously reckon not only for the threat of intense shaking and tsunami waves, but also for the long-term reshaping and rapid sinking of the coastline itself. “There’s the flood itself and then there’s the basically permanent change to land level at the coast and that has a big impact for what those communities have to plan for,” said Harold Tobin, the director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and a professor at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the new research.“Where are you going to put your school or hospital? Where are you going to build your transportation network? I think it’s important to take the long view.” After the earthquake, Dura’s research suggests, large portions of towns along the Pacific Northwest coastline, such as Seaside, Oregon; Westport, Washington; and Aberdeen, Washington, would be expected to flood at least once every 100 years, if not more often. The study also points out that sea level rise is accelerating as climate change intensifies, and the effects of post-earthquake flooding could worsen in the future. Global mean sea levels have risen by about8 to 9 inches since 1880, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Sea level rise is expected to dramatically accelerate in coming decades because of global warming, with NOAA predictinganother 10 to 12 inches on average by midcentury.Where you live could determine how dramatic sea level rise appears, and how it affects the coastline. While land in some regions of the U.S., like the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, is slowly sinking in aprocess called subsidence, parts of the Pacific Northwest have been rising because of continental uplift. That rise in land level has offset some of the sea level rise to date. The uplift is the result of stress building up within the tectonicplates that form the Cascadia subduction zoneoffshore. At the subduction zone, the Juan de Fuca plate is being forced beneath the continental North American plate. This causes the North American plate to bow upward slightly, pushing the land level higher. Right now, the subduction zone fault is quiet and building stress. When the fault ruptures, the bowing of the plate will release and cause a rapid subsidence of the land level, essentially erasing centuries of uplift in an instant. “That happens in minutes, and it can be on the order of meters,” Dura said. “The land persists down, and that can be for, like I said, decades and centuries. And so any areas that are kind of on the cusp of the floodplain are now in it.\"",

    "title": "FDA appears to be slow-walking vaccine approvals",
    "article_text": "Former government health officials fear the Trump administration is moving to slow-walk vaccine approvals, including by imposing new regulatory hurdles on drugmakers, such as changing the requirements for approval or seeking additional clinical trial data. The Food and Drug Administration confirmed Monday it was requiring drugmaker Novavax to run another clinical trial as part of the approval process for its Covid vaccine, which has been available underemergency use authorization since 2022. Dr. Marty Makary, the FDA’s commissioner, said the company is asking the agency to approve “a new product” based on old data. Novavax’s shot uses traditional protein-based vaccine technology and is the only alternative to the mRNA shots from Pfizer and Moderna. The drugmaker’s application to the FDA was based on a 30,000-person randomized clinical trial conducted in 2021 in the U.S. and Mexico. The agency missed an April 1 deadline decision, promptingconcernsamong investorsthat it wouldn’t be approved. On Saturday, Makarysuggested in a post on Xthat Novavax was seeking approval for a “new” vaccine because the strain used in its trial has since been updated to target a more recent  Covid variant called JN.1. “Under this administration, we are prioritizing the Gold Standard of Science--not what saves pharma companies ‘tens of millions of dollars,’” Makary said. Novavax declined to comment on Makary’s remark. In a release issued Monday,Novavax saidit responded to an earlier FDA request to commit to providing more data on the vaccine if approved — a standard practice. Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, criticized the administration’s move, pointing out that the seasonal flu vaccines are updated each year with new strains without the need for new clinical trials. The mRNA Covid vaccines have been similarly updated each year to target the most current strain. “I mean, how exactly does he propose they do this?” said Offit, who also serves on an independent vaccine advisory committee for the FDA. “It just worries me that it’s part of an overall general strategy to weaken vaccine efforts.” The FDA directs all media inquiries to the Department of Health and Human Services. In a written statement, an HHS spokesperson said the Biden administration waived clinical trial requirements for new Covid vaccines “using the COVID pandemic as an eternal justification for blanket approvals.” Under Makary, the spokesperson said, trials from four years ago “no longer suffice.” “With Novavax seeking authorization for a new formulation targeting the JN.1 variant, the public deserves clear answers about its efficacy and if its benefits outweigh the risks,” the spokesperson said. The Wall Street Journalfirst reportedthe FDA’s request for a new clinical trial. Novavax’s shot isn’t the only Covid vaccine that officials say may be at risk. Dr. Tracy Beth Høeg, who was announced as a special adviser to Makary earlier this month, has called for more scrutiny of vaccines, telling FDA staff and high-ranking officials in a meeting outlining priorities that the agency would be doing fewer vaccine approvals going forward, according to three former government officials familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Høeg, a sports medicine physician, rose to prominence during the pandemic as a vocal critic of the Covid vaccines, particularly for children. Her appointment added another anti-Covid-vaccine voice to the Trump administration. In 2021, HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described the Covid vaccine as the “deadliest vaccine ever made.” In 2023, Makary and Høegco-wrote aneditorial for the New York Post criticizing the Biden administration’s recommendation of the Covid shot in children. It’s unclear what role — if any — Høeg played in the FDA imposing an additional requirement for Novavax’s Covid vaccine approval. Høeg did not respond to multiple requests for comment. There are also concerns about several upcoming FDA deadlines related to Pfizer’s mRNA Covid vaccine, includinga decision for the full approval for the shot in children under 11, according to two of the former officials. The vaccine currently has an emergency use authorization for ages 11 and under. The mRNA vaccines are a particular target among anti-vaccine activists. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are the first-ever approved using mRNA technology, which has led some to claim they pose a unique threat. Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo has railed against mRNA vaccines, alleging they could possibly alter a person’s DNA.Several stateshave introduced legislation that would ban mRNA vaccines. The CDC says themRNA Covid vaccines are safeand do not alter DNA; the technology had been studied for decades before its first approval in the U.S. in late 2020. Last week,Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the discussions, that Kennedy is considering pulling the Covid vaccine from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s list of recommended immunizations for children, a move that could affect insurance coverage and influence some pediatricians’ consideration of whether to administer them. NBC News has not independently confirmed the reporting. Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California Law San Francisco, said that while Covid vaccine uptake in children is low, it’s important for parents to have the option available. That’s especially true for children with underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable to severe illness and death from the virus, she said. Experts also worry that a possible bird flu vaccine for people could be at risk. One of the former officials said the FDA previously planned to use an emergency use authorization pathway in case health officials needed to quickly greenlight a shot, but it’s now unclear whether the Trump administration would do the same. Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, who has advised the FDA, said it’ll be important for public health experts to advocate for vaccines, including the Covid shots. “It’ll be important to have some sort of updated antiviral and Covid vaccine this fall available, and that’s particularly important for the most vulnerable individuals,” Levy said. Levy — who said he would not prejudge the administration’s potential examination of vaccines — also said common respiratory viruses like the flu and Covid still spread widely, and the public will need vaccines. “Winter viruses, respiratory viruses, are killing tens of thousands of Americans a year, still,” he said. “I’m hoping the FDA will continue to consider the mRNA vaccines as one of the platforms.”",

    "title": "How jurors will be chosen for Sean 'Diddy' Combs' sex trafficking trial",
    "article_text": "Hundreds of New Yorkers who have been summoned for jury duty will appear in federal court in Manhattan this week to complete questionnaires ahead of Sean “Diddy” Combs’ sex trafficking trial. U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, who is overseeing the case, scheduled jury selection for next Monday. Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs’ legal team and federal prosecutors submitted proposed voir dire questions to the court in separate motions Friday. The two sides had been at odds about whatprospective jurors should be asked. Prosecutors argued that a proposed 72-question survey Combs’ team submitted April 11 was too long and that it covered personal topics, such as sexual assault, sexual abuse and domestic violence, that should be asked by the judge in person, if at all. Combs attorney Marc Agnifilo told Subramanian this month that his legal team believes prospective jurors should have the option to make such disclosures in writing or in person. “To be very clear, these questions are going to be asked, and the real issue is where and when,” Subramanian said at the hearing. As a compromise, prosecutors proposed adding a box to the survey to allow people to indicate whether they prefer to address those topics in person. The questionnaire has not been made public, making it unclear whether the box was included in the final version. A jury of 12 people and six alternates will be selected. Once prospective jurors complete the questionnaires, the court will process them and send them to federal prosecutors and Combs’ legal team, said Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, a jury consultant who has worked for attorneys in the trials of Kyle Rittenhouse, acquitted in the shootings of three men, two of them fatally, during a protest in Wisconsin in 2020; Daniel Penny, a former Marine acquitted in a man’s death on a New York City subway; and, most famously, O.J. Simpson. Before jury selection begins, the two parties and Subramanian will discuss who should be excused because of biases or because they have indicated serving on the jury would pose financial hardships or schedule conflicts, Dimitrius said. Opening statements are scheduled to begin May 12; the trial is expected to last eight to 10 weeks. Both sides will want to know what prospective jurors know about the case, which centers on allegations that Combs coerced women to participate in drug-fueled, highly orchestrated sexual encounters with male sex workers that he called “freak offs.” Prosecutors contend he arranged, directed, masturbated during and often electronically recorded freak offs. The allegations of “Victim-1” in the indictment closely align with those ofhis former girlfriendCasandra Ventura. “You’re going to be exploring everything that would shine a negative light potentially, if I were the defense, on how they view the case going into jury selection,” said Dimitrius, who was a jury consultant for Harvey Weinstein’s retrial in Manhattan. A hired jury consultant would also review the questionnaires, make notes about the prospective jurors and rate their suitability, Dimitrius said. The consultant is also paid to outline any potential issues and responses worth following up on during the voir dire process. Dimitrius and Michael Boucher, a jury consultant who analyzed jurors in Sarah Palin’s two defamation trials against The New York Times, said both parties will scour prospective jurors’ social media accounts to see whether they have expressed opinions or endorsed material about the case and those involved with it. Given his celebrity status, Dimitrius said, attorneys will also be concerned with how much jurors know about Combs, the music mogul who founded Bad Boy Records. “Do they listen to his music? Have they followed whatever may be in the news about his existence?” she said. Ventura sued Combs in November 2023, accusing him of years of physical, emotional and sexual abuse. The two quickly settled the suit privately, and Combs vehemently denied the allegations. Several months later, CNN published a video of Combs assaulting Ventura in the hallway of a hotel in Los Angeles in March 2016. Ventura had described the assault in her suit. Combs apologized for his behavior in the video after it became public. In seeking to exclude it from the trial, Agnifilo argued in court filings that the video “is wholly inaccurate, having been altered, manipulated, sped-up, and edited to be out of sequence.” CNN has denied it altered the video. Ventura is expected to be a key witness at the trial. Subramanian ruled Friday thatjurors could be shown the video, delivering a setback to Combs’ legal team, which had sought to block it from evidence. Boucher said the video will be difficult for Combs to overcome. “Most people, 99% of the people in this society, will say, ‘That’s just wrong; you don’t do that,’” Boucher said. “You’re going to have to work for that extreme minority who will give him a pass based on an emotional response.”",

    "title": "House passes bipartisan bill to combat explicit deepfakes, sending it to Trump to sign into law",
    "article_text": "The House passed a bipartisan bill Monday aimed at combating deepfake pornography, tackling a sensitive issue that has become a growing problem amid advances in artificial intelligence. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the measure, which sailed through the House in a 409-2 vote, into law. The \"Take it Down Act\" would criminalize publishing nonconsensual, sexually explicit images and videos — including those generated by AI — and require platforms to remove the content within 48 hours of notice. The Senate passed the legislation by unanimous consent earlier this year. Passing the bill is a rare legislative feat for Congress, which has been notoriously slow to keep up with the pace of technology. And the effort attracted broad bipartisan support: Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., are the lead sponsors of the bill in the Senate, while first lady Melania Trump has used her platform to help champion it. President Trump touted the billin a speech before Congresslast month. “Today’s bipartisan passage of the Take It Down Act is a powerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of our children,\" Melania Trump said in a statement. \"I am thankful to the Members of Congress — both in the House and Senate — who voted to protect the well-being of our youth. Through this critical legislation and our continued focus with ‘Be Best,’ we are building a future where every child can thrive and achieve their full potential,” said First Lady Melania Trump. Still, it has drawn some opponents. Digital rights groups have raised concerns that the measure as currently drafted could threaten free speech and privacy rights. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., cast one of the two \"no\" votes against the bill Monday,calling it\"a slippery slope, ripe for abuse, with unintended consequences.\" Deepfake pornography and harassment have become more prevalent, includingin schools, as AI has gotten more advanced. But no federal laws explicitly ban its use, making it harder to get images removed or hold people who create and distribute them accountable. One of the inspirations for the legislation was Texas teenager Elliston Berry, who woke up one morning during her freshman year of high school to learn that a male classmate had created a fake nude image of her and circulated it on social media. “I was completely shocked,” Berry, who was 14 at the time of the incident,said in an interview. “It wasn’t considered child pornography, although it completely is. So we were in a gray zone. No one knew what to do. School didn’t know what to do. The local sheriff didn’t know what to do.” The images were eventually taken down, but Berry and her mother felt there were still glaring holes in the law and found that accountability was difficult to achieve. So they connected with Cruz, one of their home-state senators, to work on a legislative fix aimed at preventing the same thing from happening to other victims. Berry was also Melania Trump's guest for the president's March address. “The last thing I wanted to do was talk about it, but it’s been super healing and super encouraging knowing that I’m able to have these opportunities to speak about this and to protect so many people and to be that voice,” Berry said.",

    "title": "After deadly crash, Vancouver Filipinos say they're leaning on 'kapwa,' or togetherness",
    "article_text": "Thirty minutes after Diana Silva, a vendor at the Filipino festival in Vancouver, left the party Saturday night, she heard that a car had plowed into the crowd at the event. Silva said she immediately began thinking of how to help. It’s one example of how Filipino Canadians in the area’s tight-knit community have been participating in vigils, planning fundraisers for victims and providing meals to locals immediately after the attack. TJ Conwi, a Filipino Canadian chef who has lived in the area for about 30 years, said the immediate acts of communal care reflect the concept of “kapwa,” a Tagalog word that means the interconnectedness and togetherness in the Filipino community. “When you say ‘we’re kapwa,’ you’re talking about a whole community. You’re talking about how we all fall together and all rise together, whatever it is that we go through. And it’s just so powerful to see that at the vigil yesterday,” said Conwi, 48, who attended the festival with family members the morning of the tragedy. “It’s automatic, it’s given, it’s not even earned.” The attack killed 11 people and injured more than two dozen others. The victims were 5 to 65 years old, officials said at a news conference Sunday, adding that the death toll could rise. So far, law enforcement hassidestepped discussing a motive, but it has ruled out terrorism as a possibility. Officials said the suspect, Kai-Ji Adam Lo, 30, who has been charged with eight counts of second-degree murder, had a history of mental illness and was known to police. Filipino Canadians in the area say they are shaken. The ethnic group is the third-largest Asian immigrant population in the country, behind Indians and Chinese, at roughly957,355 peopleas of the 2021 census. While the largest community is in the greater Toronto area, Vancouver is also home to a significant population, with roughly 141,230 people of Filipino descent,making up 5.4%of the metro area. Filipinos began sustained immigration toCanada in the 1960sas a deteriorating economy in the Philippines coincided with a Canadian labor shortage. Many went to the country for jobs in nursing and patient services, as well as to fill other gaps in the country’s labor market.By 2016, Filipinos held just under a third of those roles. And for decades, the community has flourished to include small-business owners, leaders and other prominent figures. Locals said the festival that was attacked is one of the largest Filipino celebrations of the year, honoring the 16th century Filipino chieftain Datu Lapu-Lapu, who defeated Spanish forces and remains a symbol of resistance against colonialism. The event was a rare chance for Filipinos across the lower mainland to gather in one place, many said. Conwi, who leads a group of Filipino chefs who provide meals to charities in the area, said that though Filipino Canadian locals are still in shock, the crash hasn’t stopped them from pitching in to uplift one another. Conwi said the weekend was filled with Zoom calls and coordination from community organizations to ensure that counseling, food and other resources were taken care of. He and other chefs in his collective have been cooking and distributing meals to families and grieving residents, as well. “In less than five, 10 hours, people woke up with purpose like you wouldn’t believe. People didn’t even have time to process this, but people are already coming together,” Conwi said. “It just all came about organically. It’s so quick.” Silva, owner of the Filipino bakery Cake It Easy Desserts, said she has been selling cupcakes, with 100% of the proceeds going to fundraisers for the victims. She said it has been difficult to come to terms with the tragedy. “It’s such a different feeling knowing that you were there just before it happened,” Silva, 41, said of the chilling experience. “I have a 7-year-old and a 5-year-old, and they were running around two blocks away from where it actually happened.” Silva said that during a vigil for the victims, community members didn’t hesitate to start brainstorming ideas to help. It’s almost reflective of the occasion they were supposed to celebrate, she said. “Lapu-Lapu is all about resilience, and he stood up for the Philippines,” Silva said. “I think that’s what our community is doing now.” Celine Bacani, a Filipino Canadian who owns Lee’s Donuts in the city, said it has also been heartening to see those outside the community support Filipinos on what was supposed to be a joyous weekend. Leaders from across Canada spoke out, Bacani said, which “spoke volumes.” Filipinos abroad also offered their solidarity with the local Vancouver community. Bacani, 42, who was born and raised in Vancouver, said the community has a long road of healing ahead. “Filipinos, by nature, are really caring and nurturing people. We are here to always help others,” she said.",

    "article_text": "Juliana Kim Spectators roam inside the Madrid Open tennis tournament venue during a general blackout in Madrid on April 28.Manu Fernandez/APhide caption Parts of Spain, Portugal and southern France were plunged into darkness on Monday by a massive power outage. The lights are coming back on for some, but the cause of the outage remains unclear. The sweeping blackout across the Iberian Peninsula began midday local time. As of Monday evening, power has been partially restored across the three countries, but large swaths of the region remain without electricity. The power outage halted nearly every aspect of daily life for tens of millions of people — disrupting subways, cutting phone service and shutting down traffic lights and ATM machines. Meanwhile, back-up systems maintained power for hospitals, nuclear plants and prisons. Here's what to know. People shop for groceries using their phone as flashlight in Madrid, Spain on April 28.Diego Radames/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption At a press conference on Monday evening, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said a nationwide blackout of this scale had never happened before in Spain. He added that, within a matter of seconds, a large amount of power — equivalent to 60% of Spain's electricity demand — was lost. Sánchez said the underlying cause of the outage remains unclear, and no theory has been ruled out. Earlier on Monday, António Costa, the president of the European Council and former prime minister of Portugal, said on X that there wereno signs so far suggesting that a cyber attackwas behind the blackout.

He added that nearly every region in Spain was showing improvement. He also thanked France and Morocco for their assistance in bringing back electricity. Among the areas where power has been restored are major cities, including the country's capital Madrid and Murcia, as well as regions like Catalonia, home to Barcelona, according to Spanish power distributor Red Eléctrica. Despite the progress, the prime minister said it remains unclear how long it will take to fully restore power across Spain.

Electricity had not yet been restored in Lisbon, the nation's capital, but REN saidservice was expected to resume soon. The massive blackout brought Spain and Portugal to an abrupt standstill on Monday. Public transportation, including subways and rail services, was suspended across Spain. Authorities worked torescue passengers from 116 trainsthat were stranded on Monday, the country's transport minister Oscar Puente wrote on X.

    "title": "Trump thinks Hegseth will 'get it together' amid Pentagon staff chaos",
    "article_text": "Tom Bowman President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appear during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Feb. 26.Andrew Harnik/Getty Imageshide caption President Donald Trump said he spoke with hisembattled Defense Secretary Pete Hegsethfollowing reports he used the unsecure Signal chat to discuss classified information and fired some of his top aides, leaving the Pentagon embroiled in chaos. \"I think he's gonna get it together,\" Trump said of Hegseth, during aninterview withThe Atlanticmagazineover the weekend. \"I had a talk with him, a positive talk, but I had a talk with him.\" Meanwhile, one former senior staffer, Colin Carroll, who served as chief of staff to Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg, said in alengthy interview with Megyn Kellyon Saturday there's a \"culture of fear and toxicity\" in Hegseth's office. \"No one's going to want to come into that environment.\" Carroll, along with Hegseth's former top aides, Dan Caldwell and Darin Selnick, were fired amid accusations by the defense secretary that they leaked classified information to the press. Both Carroll and Caldwell strongly deny any leaks in separate interviewsand on X, and instead say they were fired because they had trouble working with Hegseth's chief of staff Joe Kasper, who oversaw what they call a dysfunctional office. NPR has repeatedly contacted Kasper, who has not returned phone calls. In her interview with Carroll, Kelly says she reached out to Kasper, who released a statement: \"The idea that there was dysfunction is an argument of convenience, which in hindsight is being weaponized by a small group which is rallying against the president and the secretary in their own interests.\" Kasper has since stepped down as chief of staff and will now serve as a \"special government employee\" working on science, technology and industry. Meanwhile, Trump's National Security Adviser Mike Waltz went on Fox News on Sunday to defend Hegseth. \"He is leading the charge, and he has no tolerance for leaking,\" Waltz said, calling any suggestions of chaos or dysfunction a \"media narrative,\" and that Trump officials \"are going to power through.\" Waltz, who took responsibility for creating a Signal chat group that inadvertently included a journalist last month, sidestepped a question about the departure of senior aides, including Kasper. On Friday the Pentagon announced four new senior advisers had been promoted; they include Col. Ricky Buria, a former junior military assistant; Justin Fulcher, a member of the DOGE team embedded at the Pentagon, and Patrick Weaver, formerly a Department of Defense \"special assistant.\" Sean Parnell, who had been the Pentagon's chief spokesman, was promoted to assistant to the secretary of defense and senior adviser. All those named have little experience at the Pentagon, and those jobs are often filled by those with years serving in the military, government or industry. Parnell, a Pittsburgh native, served in the military for six years, ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House in 2020, and the next year launched a short-lived campaign for the U.S. Senate. Fulcher, whoForbesmagazine featured in its30 under 30list in 2017, came into the Pentagon as part of tech billionaire Elon Musk's DOGE team. Forbes later featured him again in an articlequestioning his credentialsas an entrepreneur. Weavergraduated from college in 2017, and served in the first Trump administration at the Department of Homeland Security. Wilson, 26, had been deputy press secretary and will now be acting press secretary. Just last month, she was criticized by members of Congress and Jewish groups for online posts and pastpublic commentaryshe made before joining the Trump administration. It's uncertain if those appointments will be permanent or placeholders. The White House has reached out to officials who served in the first Trump administration, searching for staff who will \"right the ship,\" at the Pentagon, according to one former Trump official who requested anonymity to describe internal administration deliberations. Another official hastold NPRthat the White House has begun the preliminary process of seeking a replacement for Hegseth. Carroll in his interview with Megyn Kelly worries that the disruption at the upper reaches of the Pentagon could spell trouble in a crisis. \"We have not had a major challenge at this point,\" said Carroll, a Marine combat veteran and Naval Academy graduate. \"So I don't know how the department would function if we had like the fall of Kabul,\" referring to the chaos when U.S. forces left the Afghan capital in August, 2021. \"That's my biggest fear.\" Carroll said he would like to return to the Pentagon and resume his work with Deputy Secretary Feinberg and worries about the programs he was working on without the needed staff. \"The president's agenda is at risk right now,\" he said, pointing to the proposed Golden Dome missile defense system and shipbuilding, concerned there will be delays with the personnel shakeup. A number of Democrats have called for Hegseth's ouster, and on Sunday, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on CBS that Hegseth has \"created chaos\" at the Pentagon. \"The fact is, Pete Hegseth was not qualified to take the job as secretary of defense, and he has shown that time and again,\" Shaheen said Sunday onFace the Nation with Margaret Brennan. One Republican, Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, a retired Air Force brigadier general, said he didn't believe it was in his place to call for Hegseth's resignation but was critical of the defense secretary's Signal chats about an imminent attack on Yemen. \"I had concerns from the get-go because Pete Hegseth didn't have a lot of experience,\" Bacon, who now chairs the subcommittee on cyber issues, told reporters last week. \"I like him on Fox. But does he have the experience to lead one of the largest organizations in the world? That's a concern.\" Hegseth, 44, is a former Fox News host and National Guard major who served in Iraq and Afghanistan but had no experience in government when he was nominated by Trump to lead the Pentagon, which oversees some 3 million civilian and military employees and has a yearly budget of some $900 billion. Hegseth had less experience than any other defense secretary since the position was created in 1947. He also overcame allegations of sexual assault, public drunkenness and questions of financial mismanagement at two veterans' groups he ran. Hegseth addressed his lack of experience at his Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing in January, saying he had \"dust on his boots\" from his combat deployments and vowed to be a \"change agent\" and \"disruptor\" at the Pentagon that was too focused on a \"woke\" ideology and diversity, equity and inclusion. He narrowly won Senate approval by a vote of 50-50, with Vice President Vance casting the necessary tie-breaking vote. Hegseth immediately became a \"disruptor\" and faced some criticism for firing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. CQ Brown, the second African American to hold the post, and Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the first female top officer in the Navy. He also ended minority and women's student clubs at West Point and had books on race, gender and transgender issues removed from the Naval Academy library. But within the last month, he's faced scrutiny that he was relaying classified information to those without clearances. Hegseth was being given details – including timing, targets and ordnance for a March 15t strike on Houthi targets in Yemen – by Gen. Erik Kurilla, who oversees Middle East operations, and was communicating through a classified system. Hegseth in turn gave minute-by-minute updates to top White House officials through Signal, unaware that a reporter was mistakenly added to the chat. Hegseth claimed the chats included only \"media strategy,\" but the reporter in the chat, Jeffrey Goldberg, provided a transcript of some of that information, which members of Congress and retired military officials said was clearly classified. And their concern was that an adversary could hack those unsecured communications and put pilots in danger. Then last week,The New York Timesreportedthat there was a second Signal chat with the same information that included Hegseth's wife, brother and personal lawyer. Meanwhile,Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of Americareleased the results of a survey of their membership about the Signal controversy. In the survey, IAVA veterans overwhelmingly (86%) believe that there should be accountability for the leak of classified information over Signal by administration officials, including more than 3 out of 4 of IAVA veterans that identify as Republican. \"It's clear that IAVA veterans are taking note of the actions of the new Administration,\" said IAVA's CEO Allison Jaslow. \"Most want to see accountability for the leak of classified information by Administration officials that made headlines recently, just as they know they'd be held accountable for the same.\" NPR disclosure: Katherine Maher, the CEO of NPR, chairs the board of the Signal Foundation.

    "article_text": "John Ruwitch Fifty years after the end of the Vietnam War, one Seattle man embarks on a journey to a remote mountain in Laos where his father was last seen during a secret mission in the war. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:This Wednesday marks 50 years since the day that communist forces seized the city of Saigon, bringing an end to the Vietnam War. That conflict defined a generation and it continues to reverberate half a century later in countless ways, for countless people. For one Seattle man, the search for closure led to the top of one of the highest mountains in Laos. NPR's John Ruwitch has the story.JOHN RUWITCH, BYLINE: Rick Holland was in third grade when his dad was deployed to the war in the fall of 1967.RICK HOLLAND: I said goodbye my dad on my eighth birthday.RUWITCH: Air Force Technical Sergeant Melvin Holland was sent halfway across the world to play a top secret role in Operation Rolling Thunder.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The attacks slashed at North Vietnam with renewed fury.RUWITCH: It was a multiyear bombing campaign to try to stop the flow of troops and weapons from communist North Vietnam into the U.S.-allied South and force the North Vietnamese leadership to negotiate an end to the war.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Raids against oil stores in Hanoi marked a fresh escalation.RUWITCH: Tiny Laos next door was ostensibly neutral, but that's where Melvin Holland was sent with other men to man a secret radar station at the top of a steep karst mountain near the Laos-Vietnam border. The military called it Lima Site 85. It guided bombers to targets, day and night, in all weather. On the night of March 10, 1968, it came under attack.HOLLAND: A sapper team, Vietnamese sapper team, scaled the cliff, spent overnight on the cliffs and came up from the cliff site and started the attack.RUWITCH: By morning, Lima Site 85 was overrun.UNIDENTIFIED FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Nong Khang Airport. The local time is...RUWITCH: The closest airport to the mountain is Nong Khang, outside Sam Neua, a remote town in northeastern Laos. Some 57 years after the attack, I've come here with Rick Holland on his first trip to Laos, and members of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, or DPAA.UNIDENTIFIED FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would like to thank you for flying with us and are looking forward to...RUWITCH: DPAA is the arm of the Pentagon responsible for finding prisoners of war, POWs, and those missing in action, MIA. By their tally, there are more than 1,570 Americans still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. That includes over 280 believed to be in Laos. Several are potentially near here.(SOUNDBITE OF DIGGING)RUWITCH: On the edge of town, in a dry rice field by a river, members of a DPAA team dig small excavation pits. Others sift dirt through screens. They're looking for the remains of a fighter pilot whose jet went down here in flames after a bombing run in the late 1960s.ALLY CAMPO: The plane, we have a witness testimony that said it crashed into the river.RUWITCH: Ally Campo is the scientific recovery expert on site.CAMPO: But we have archaeological evidence showing that the debris field actually extends all the way up into these rice paddy fields.RUWITCH: The remnants in the dirt are tiny.CAMPO: And we go through it, and anything that is man-made, anything that looks weird, anything that could be possibly considered bone or a part of the incident will get put in evidence buckets.(SOUNDBITE OF MATERIAL SIFTING)RUWITCH: It's painstaking work, even on flat land near town with a big team. Lima Site 85, on Phou Pha Thi Mountain, is a different ball game. There were 19 men up top when the site was attacked. One man, Chief Master Sergeant Richard Etchberger, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 2010 by President Obama for his role in the fight.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: When it looked like the ledge would be overrun, he called for airstrikes within yards of his own position, shaking the mountain and clearing the way for a rescue. And in the morning light, an American helicopter came into view.RUWITCH: Etchberger helped other men onto the chopper. And then as he was loading on, he was struck by gunfire and died. Seven of the 19 men made it off the mountain alive. Holland was not one of them. A few days later, on the other side of the world, Rick Holland's mom, Ann Holland, was hosting a Cub Scout meeting when the phone rang.HOLLAND: And gets a call. Says, Mrs. Holland, something's happened up at the site. We're not sure exactly what. We're not sure the status of the men.RUWITCH: It would be two years before the military declared her husband and the others dead. Ann Holland wanted proof, though. She, and later Rick, have been pushing for information or confirmation of Melvin Holland's death for the better part of six decades.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)RUWITCH: The main search area at Phou Pha Thi is not at the top of the mountain. It's partway down the side on a sloped ledge at the bottom of a 600-foot cliff. DPAA believes the men's bodies may have been thrown off the top after the battle. Getting to the site is an endeavor. When the weather is bad, it's a two-hour drive from town, followed by a hike. On good days, the team takes helicopters to a landing zone nearby.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)WESTON IANNONE: It's pretty complex terrain, so it takes us about another 30, 45 minutes to get from where we're landing to the actual investigation or excavation area.RUWITCH: Weston Iannone is an Army captain with DPAA. He was team leader at the site.IANNONE: It's a series of rappels, ascents and then, like, hand over hand.RUWITCH: All the team members are trained in mountaineering. Lidar and terrain mapping have helped them zero in on places of interest where rolling or falling things might come to a stop on the steep slope.IANNONE: Today, in a literal sense, it was putting on gloves and kind of just scraping the surface.RUWITCH: So far, remains of three men have been identified. Eight remain unaccounted for. For Rick Holland, the goal of the trip was to simply reach the top of the mountain where his dad was last seen. There's a trail that leads to the peak, more than a mile up in the Lao sky.(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)RUWITCH: The Lao government would not let me go with him, so I gave a recorder to a member of the DPAA team that accompanied him.HOLLAND: Oh, what a view.RUWITCH: At the peak, with silent hills unfolding around him, Holland phoned his 85-year-old mother to tell her he had made it, and he sat by the edge, draped in a black POW/MIA flag.HOLLAND: (Shouting) Pha Thi, I'm here.RUWITCH: He spoke to the spirit of the mountain.HOLLAND: (Shouting) I'm here to ask your forgiveness. Please let the men come home. It's time.RUWITCH: Bringing them back, he says, is his life's mission.HOLLAND: (Shouting) Dad, I'm here. I want you home, Dad. (Crying) We miss you. We want you back so bad.RUWITCH: Neither the mountain nor the man answered his call that day, but Rick Holland says he'll be back.

She, and later Rick, have been pushing for information or confirmation of Melvin Holland's death for the better part of six decades.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)RUWITCH: The main search area at Phou Pha Thi is not at the top of the mountain. It's partway down the side on a sloped ledge at the bottom of a 600-foot cliff. DPAA believes the men's bodies may have been thrown off the top after the battle. Getting to the site is an endeavor. When the weather is bad, it's a two-hour drive from town, followed by a hike. On good days, the team takes helicopters to a landing zone nearby.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)WESTON IANNONE: It's pretty complex terrain, so it takes us about another 30, 45 minutes to get from where we're landing to the actual investigation or excavation area.RUWITCH: Weston Iannone is an Army captain with DPAA. He was team leader at the site.IANNONE: It's a series of rappels, ascents and then, like, hand over hand.RUWITCH: All the team members are trained in mountaineering. Lidar and terrain mapping have helped them zero in on places of interest where rolling or falling things might come to a stop on the steep slope.IANNONE: Today, in a literal sense, it was putting on gloves and kind of just scraping the surface.RUWITCH: So far, remains of three men have been identified. Eight remain unaccounted for. For Rick Holland, the goal of the trip was to simply reach the top of the mountain where his dad was last seen. There's a trail that leads to the peak, more than a mile up in the Lao sky.(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)RUWITCH: The Lao government would not let me go with him, so I gave a recorder to a member of the DPAA team that accompanied him.HOLLAND: Oh, what a view.RUWITCH: At the peak, with silent hills unfolding around him, Holland phoned his 85-year-old mother to tell her he had made it, and he sat by the edge, draped in a black POW/MIA flag.HOLLAND: (Shouting) Pha Thi, I'm here.RUWITCH: He spoke to the spirit of the mountain.HOLLAND: (Shouting) I'm here to ask your forgiveness. Please let the men come home. It's time.RUWITCH: Bringing them back, he says, is his life's mission.HOLLAND: (Shouting) Dad, I'm here. I want you home, Dad. (Crying) We miss you. We want you back so bad.RUWITCH: Neither the mountain nor the man answered his call that day, but Rick Holland says he'll be back.

That conflict defined a generation and it continues to reverberate half a century later in countless ways, for countless people. For one Seattle man, the search for closure led to the top of one of the highest mountains in Laos. NPR's John Ruwitch has the story.JOHN RUWITCH, BYLINE: Rick Holland was in third grade when his dad was deployed to the war in the fall of 1967.RICK HOLLAND: I said goodbye my dad on my eighth birthday.RUWITCH: Air Force Technical Sergeant Melvin Holland was sent halfway across the world to play a top secret role in Operation Rolling Thunder.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The attacks slashed at North Vietnam with renewed fury.RUWITCH: It was a multiyear bombing campaign to try to stop the flow of troops and weapons from communist North Vietnam into the U.S.-allied South and force the North Vietnamese leadership to negotiate an end to the war.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Raids against oil stores in Hanoi marked a fresh escalation.RUWITCH: Tiny Laos next door was ostensibly neutral, but that's where Melvin Holland was sent with other men to man a secret radar station at the top of a steep karst mountain near the Laos-Vietnam border. The military called it Lima Site 85. It guided bombers to targets, day and night, in all weather. On the night of March 10, 1968, it came under attack.HOLLAND: A sapper team, Vietnamese sapper team, scaled the cliff, spent overnight on the cliffs and came up from the cliff site and started the attack.RUWITCH: By morning, Lima Site 85 was overrun.UNIDENTIFIED FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Nong Khang Airport. The local time is...RUWITCH: The closest airport to the mountain is Nong Khang, outside Sam Neua, a remote town in northeastern Laos. Some 57 years after the attack, I've come here with Rick Holland on his first trip to Laos, and members of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, or DPAA.UNIDENTIFIED FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would like to thank you for flying with us and are looking forward to...RUWITCH: DPAA is the arm of the Pentagon responsible for finding prisoners of war, POWs, and those missing in action, MIA. By their tally, there are more than 1,570 Americans still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. That includes over 280 believed to be in Laos. Several are potentially near here.(SOUNDBITE OF DIGGING)RUWITCH: On the edge of town, in a dry rice field by a river, members of a DPAA team dig small excavation pits. Others sift dirt through screens. They're looking for the remains of a fighter pilot whose jet went down here in flames after a bombing run in the late 1960s.ALLY CAMPO: The plane, we have a witness testimony that said it crashed into the river.RUWITCH: Ally Campo is the scientific recovery expert on site.CAMPO: But we have archaeological evidence showing that the debris field actually extends all the way up into these rice paddy fields.RUWITCH: The remnants in the dirt are tiny.CAMPO: And we go through it, and anything that is man-made, anything that looks weird, anything that could be possibly considered bone or a part of the incident will get put in evidence buckets.(SOUNDBITE OF MATERIAL SIFTING)RUWITCH: It's painstaking work, even on flat land near town with a big team. Lima Site 85, on Phou Pha Thi Mountain, is a different ball game. There were 19 men up top when the site was attacked. One man, Chief Master Sergeant Richard Etchberger, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 2010 by President Obama for his role in the fight.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: When it looked like the ledge would be overrun, he called for airstrikes within yards of his own position, shaking the mountain and clearing the way for a rescue. And in the morning light, an American helicopter came into view.RUWITCH: Etchberger helped other men onto the chopper. And then as he was loading on, he was struck by gunfire and died. Seven of the 19 men made it off the mountain alive. Holland was not one of them. A few days later, on the other side of the world, Rick Holland's mom, Ann Holland, was hosting a Cub Scout meeting when the phone rang.HOLLAND: And gets a call.

RICK HOLLAND: I said goodbye my dad on my eighth birthday.RUWITCH: Air Force Technical Sergeant Melvin Holland was sent halfway across the world to play a top secret role in Operation Rolling Thunder.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The attacks slashed at North Vietnam with renewed fury.RUWITCH: It was a multiyear bombing campaign to try to stop the flow of troops and weapons from communist North Vietnam into the U.S.-allied South and force the North Vietnamese leadership to negotiate an end to the war.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Raids against oil stores in Hanoi marked a fresh escalation.RUWITCH: Tiny Laos next door was ostensibly neutral, but that's where Melvin Holland was sent with other men to man a secret radar station at the top of a steep karst mountain near the Laos-Vietnam border. The military called it Lima Site 85. It guided bombers to targets, day and night, in all weather. On the night of March 10, 1968, it came under attack.HOLLAND: A sapper team, Vietnamese sapper team, scaled the cliff, spent overnight on the cliffs and came up from the cliff site and started the attack.RUWITCH: By morning, Lima Site 85 was overrun.UNIDENTIFIED FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Nong Khang Airport. The local time is...RUWITCH: The closest airport to the mountain is Nong Khang, outside Sam Neua, a remote town in northeastern Laos. Some 57 years after the attack, I've come here with Rick Holland on his first trip to Laos, and members of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, or DPAA.UNIDENTIFIED FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would like to thank you for flying with us and are looking forward to...RUWITCH: DPAA is the arm of the Pentagon responsible for finding prisoners of war, POWs, and those missing in action, MIA. By their tally, there are more than 1,570 Americans still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. That includes over 280 believed to be in Laos. Several are potentially near here.(SOUNDBITE OF DIGGING)RUWITCH: On the edge of town, in a dry rice field by a river, members of a DPAA team dig small excavation pits. Others sift dirt through screens. They're looking for the remains of a fighter pilot whose jet went down here in flames after a bombing run in the late 1960s.ALLY CAMPO: The plane, we have a witness testimony that said it crashed into the river.RUWITCH: Ally Campo is the scientific recovery expert on site.CAMPO: But we have archaeological evidence showing that the debris field actually extends all the way up into these rice paddy fields.RUWITCH: The remnants in the dirt are tiny.CAMPO: And we go through it, and anything that is man-made, anything that looks weird, anything that could be possibly considered bone or a part of the incident will get put in evidence buckets.(SOUNDBITE OF MATERIAL SIFTING)RUWITCH: It's painstaking work, even on flat land near town with a big team. Lima Site 85, on Phou Pha Thi Mountain, is a different ball game. There were 19 men up top when the site was attacked. One man, Chief Master Sergeant Richard Etchberger, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 2010 by President Obama for his role in the fight.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: When it looked like the ledge would be overrun, he called for airstrikes within yards of his own position, shaking the mountain and clearing the way for a rescue. And in the morning light, an American helicopter came into view.RUWITCH: Etchberger helped other men onto the chopper. And then as he was loading on, he was struck by gunfire and died. Seven of the 19 men made it off the mountain alive. Holland was not one of them. A few days later, on the other side of the world, Rick Holland's mom, Ann Holland, was hosting a Cub Scout meeting when the phone rang.HOLLAND: And gets a call. Says, Mrs. Holland, something's happened up at the site. We're not sure exactly what. We're not sure the status of the men.RUWITCH: It would be two years before the military declared her husband and the others dead. Ann Holland wanted proof, though. She, and later Rick, have been pushing for information or confirmation of Melvin Holland's death for the better part of six decades.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)RUWITCH: The main search area at Phou Pha Thi is not at the top of the mountain. It's partway down the side on a sloped ledge at the bottom of a 600-foot cliff. DPAA believes the men's bodies may have been thrown off the top after the battle. Getting to the site is an endeavor. When the weather is bad, it's a two-hour drive from town, followed by a hike. On good days, the team takes helicopters to a landing zone nearby.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)WESTON IANNONE: It's pretty complex terrain, so it takes us about another 30, 45 minutes to get from where we're landing to the actual investigation or excavation area.RUWITCH: Weston Iannone is an Army captain with DPAA. He was team leader at the site.IANNONE: It's a series of rappels, ascents and then, like, hand over hand.RUWITCH: All the team members are trained in mountaineering. Lidar and terrain mapping have helped them zero in on places of interest where rolling or falling things might come to a stop on the steep slope.IANNONE: Today, in a literal sense, it was putting on gloves and kind of just scraping the surface.RUWITCH: So far, remains of three men have been identified. Eight remain unaccounted for. For Rick Holland, the goal of the trip was to simply reach the top of the mountain where his dad was last seen. There's a trail that leads to the peak, more than a mile up in the Lao sky.(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)RUWITCH: The Lao government would not let me go with him, so I gave a recorder to a member of the DPAA team that accompanied him.HOLLAND: Oh, what a view.RUWITCH: At the peak, with silent hills unfolding around him, Holland phoned his 85-year-old mother to tell her he had made it, and he sat by the edge, draped in a black POW/MIA flag.HOLLAND: (Shouting) Pha Thi, I'm here.RUWITCH: He spoke to the spirit of the mountain.HOLLAND: (Shouting) I'm here to ask your forgiveness. Please let the men come home. It's time.RUWITCH: Bringing them back, he says, is his life's mission.HOLLAND: (Shouting) Dad, I'm here. I want you home, Dad. (Crying) We miss you. We want you back so bad.RUWITCH: Neither the mountain nor the man answered his call that day, but Rick Holland says he'll be back.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The attacks slashed at North Vietnam with renewed fury.RUWITCH: It was a multiyear bombing campaign to try to stop the flow of troops and weapons from communist North Vietnam into the U.S.-allied South and force the North Vietnamese leadership to negotiate an end to the war.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Raids against oil stores in Hanoi marked a fresh escalation.RUWITCH: Tiny Laos next door was ostensibly neutral, but that's where Melvin Holland was sent with other men to man a secret radar station at the top of a steep karst mountain near the Laos-Vietnam border. The military called it Lima Site 85. It guided bombers to targets, day and night, in all weather. On the night of March 10, 1968, it came under attack.HOLLAND: A sapper team, Vietnamese sapper team, scaled the cliff, spent overnight on the cliffs and came up from the cliff site and started the attack.RUWITCH: By morning, Lima Site 85 was overrun.UNIDENTIFIED FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Nong Khang Airport. The local time is...RUWITCH: The closest airport to the mountain is Nong Khang, outside Sam Neua, a remote town in northeastern Laos. Some 57 years after the attack, I've come here with Rick Holland on his first trip to Laos, and members of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, or DPAA.UNIDENTIFIED FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would like to thank you for flying with us and are looking forward to...RUWITCH: DPAA is the arm of the Pentagon responsible for finding prisoners of war, POWs, and those missing in action, MIA. By their tally, there are more than 1,570 Americans still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. That includes over 280 believed to be in Laos. Several are potentially near here.(SOUNDBITE OF DIGGING)RUWITCH: On the edge of town, in a dry rice field by a river, members of a DPAA team dig small excavation pits. Others sift dirt through screens. They're looking for the remains of a fighter pilot whose jet went down here in flames after a bombing run in the late 1960s.ALLY CAMPO: The plane, we have a witness testimony that said it crashed into the river.RUWITCH: Ally Campo is the scientific recovery expert on site.CAMPO: But we have archaeological evidence showing that the debris field actually extends all the way up into these rice paddy fields.RUWITCH: The remnants in the dirt are tiny.CAMPO: And we go through it, and anything that is man-made, anything that looks weird, anything that could be possibly considered bone or a part of the incident will get put in evidence buckets.(SOUNDBITE OF MATERIAL SIFTING)RUWITCH: It's painstaking work, even on flat land near town with a big team. Lima Site 85, on Phou Pha Thi Mountain, is a different ball game. There were 19 men up top when the site was attacked. One man, Chief Master Sergeant Richard Etchberger, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 2010 by President Obama for his role in the fight.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: When it looked like the ledge would be overrun, he called for airstrikes within yards of his own position, shaking the mountain and clearing the way for a rescue. And in the morning light, an American helicopter came into view.RUWITCH: Etchberger helped other men onto the chopper. And then as he was loading on, he was struck by gunfire and died. Seven of the 19 men made it off the mountain alive. Holland was not one of them. A few days later, on the other side of the world, Rick Holland's mom, Ann Holland, was hosting a Cub Scout meeting when the phone rang.HOLLAND: And gets a call. Says, Mrs. Holland, something's happened up at the site. We're not sure exactly what. We're not sure the status of the men.RUWITCH: It would be two years before the military declared her husband and the others dead. Ann Holland wanted proof, though. She, and later Rick, have been pushing for information or confirmation of Melvin Holland's death for the better part of six decades.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)RUWITCH: The main search area at Phou Pha Thi is not at the top of the mountain. It's partway down the side on a sloped ledge at the bottom of a 600-foot cliff. DPAA believes the men's bodies may have been thrown off the top after the battle. Getting to the site is an endeavor. When the weather is bad, it's a two-hour drive from town, followed by a hike. On good days, the team takes helicopters to a landing zone nearby.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)WESTON IANNONE: It's pretty complex terrain, so it takes us about another 30, 45 minutes to get from where we're landing to the actual investigation or excavation area.RUWITCH: Weston Iannone is an Army captain with DPAA.

A few days later, on the other side of the world, Rick Holland's mom, Ann Holland, was hosting a Cub Scout meeting when the phone rang.HOLLAND: And gets a call. Says, Mrs. Holland, something's happened up at the site. We're not sure exactly what. We're not sure the status of the men.RUWITCH: It would be two years before the military declared her husband and the others dead. Ann Holland wanted proof, though. She, and later Rick, have been pushing for information or confirmation of Melvin Holland's death for the better part of six decades.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)RUWITCH: The main search area at Phou Pha Thi is not at the top of the mountain. It's partway down the side on a sloped ledge at the bottom of a 600-foot cliff. DPAA believes the men's bodies may have been thrown off the top after the battle. Getting to the site is an endeavor.

On good days, the team takes helicopters to a landing zone nearby.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)WESTON IANNONE: It's pretty complex terrain, so it takes us about another 30, 45 minutes to get from where we're landing to the actual investigation or excavation area.RUWITCH: Weston Iannone is an Army captain with DPAA. He was team leader at the site.IANNONE: It's a series of rappels, ascents and then, like, hand over hand.RUWITCH: All the team members are trained in mountaineering. Lidar and terrain mapping have helped them zero in on places of interest where rolling or falling things might come to a stop on the steep slope.IANNONE: Today, in a literal sense, it was putting on gloves and kind of just scraping the surface.RUWITCH: So far, remains of three men have been identified. Eight remain unaccounted for. For Rick Holland, the goal of the trip was to simply reach the top of the mountain where his dad was last seen. There's a trail that leads to the peak, more than a mile up in the Lao sky.(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)RUWITCH: The Lao government would not let me go with him, so I gave a recorder to a member of the DPAA team that accompanied him.HOLLAND: Oh, what a view.RUWITCH: At the peak, with silent hills unfolding around him, Holland phoned his 85-year-old mother to tell her he had made it, and he sat by the edge, draped in a black POW/MIA flag.HOLLAND: (Shouting) Pha Thi, I'm here.RUWITCH: He spoke to the spirit of the mountain.HOLLAND: (Shouting) I'm here to ask your forgiveness. Please let the men come home. It's time.RUWITCH: Bringing them back, he says, is his life's mission.HOLLAND: (Shouting) Dad, I'm here. I want you home, Dad. (Crying) We miss you.

A few days later, on the other side of the world, Rick Holland's mom, Ann Holland, was hosting a Cub Scout meeting when the phone rang.HOLLAND: And gets a call. Says, Mrs. Holland, something's happened up at the site. We're not sure exactly what. We're not sure the status of the men.RUWITCH: It would be two years before the military declared her husband and the others dead. Ann Holland wanted proof, though. She, and later Rick, have been pushing for information or confirmation of Melvin Holland's death for the better part of six decades.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)RUWITCH: The main search area at Phou Pha Thi is not at the top of the mountain. It's partway down the side on a sloped ledge at the bottom of a 600-foot cliff. DPAA believes the men's bodies may have been thrown off the top after the battle. Getting to the site is an endeavor. When the weather is bad, it's a two-hour drive from town, followed by a hike. On good days, the team takes helicopters to a landing zone nearby.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)WESTON IANNONE: It's pretty complex terrain, so it takes us about another 30, 45 minutes to get from where we're landing to the actual investigation or excavation area.RUWITCH: Weston Iannone is an Army captain with DPAA. He was team leader at the site.IANNONE: It's a series of rappels, ascents and then, like, hand over hand.RUWITCH: All the team members are trained in mountaineering. Lidar and terrain mapping have helped them zero in on places of interest where rolling or falling things might come to a stop on the steep slope.IANNONE: Today, in a literal sense, it was putting on gloves and kind of just scraping the surface.RUWITCH: So far, remains of three men have been identified. Eight remain unaccounted for. For Rick Holland, the goal of the trip was to simply reach the top of the mountain where his dad was last seen. There's a trail that leads to the peak, more than a mile up in the Lao sky.(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)RUWITCH: The Lao government would not let me go with him, so I gave a recorder to a member of the DPAA team that accompanied him.HOLLAND: Oh, what a view.RUWITCH: At the peak, with silent hills unfolding around him, Holland phoned his 85-year-old mother to tell her he had made it, and he sat by the edge, draped in a black POW/MIA flag.HOLLAND: (Shouting) Pha Thi, I'm here.RUWITCH: He spoke to the spirit of the mountain.HOLLAND: (Shouting) I'm here to ask your forgiveness. Please let the men come home. It's time.RUWITCH: Bringing them back, he says, is his life's mission.HOLLAND: (Shouting) Dad, I'm here. I want you home, Dad. (Crying) We miss you.

RUWITCH: Tiny Laos next door was ostensibly neutral, but that's where Melvin Holland was sent with other men to man a secret radar station at the top of a steep karst mountain near the Laos-Vietnam border. The military called it Lima Site 85. It guided bombers to targets, day and night, in all weather. On the night of March 10, 1968, it came under attack.HOLLAND: A sapper team, Vietnamese sapper team, scaled the cliff, spent overnight on the cliffs and came up from the cliff site and started the attack.RUWITCH: By morning, Lima Site 85 was overrun.UNIDENTIFIED FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Nong Khang Airport. The local time is...RUWITCH: The closest airport to the mountain is Nong Khang, outside Sam Neua, a remote town in northeastern Laos.

Several are potentially near here.(SOUNDBITE OF DIGGING)RUWITCH: On the edge of town, in a dry rice field by a river, members of a DPAA team dig small excavation pits. Others sift dirt through screens. They're looking for the remains of a fighter pilot whose jet went down here in flames after a bombing run in the late 1960s.ALLY CAMPO: The plane, we have a witness testimony that said it crashed into the river.RUWITCH: Ally Campo is the scientific recovery expert on site.CAMPO: But we have archaeological evidence showing that the debris field actually extends all the way up into these rice paddy fields.RUWITCH: The remnants in the dirt are tiny.CAMPO: And we go through it, and anything that is man-made, anything that looks weird, anything that could be possibly considered bone or a part of the incident will get put in evidence buckets.(SOUNDBITE OF MATERIAL SIFTING)RUWITCH: It's painstaking work, even on flat land near town with a big team. Lima Site 85, on Phou Pha Thi Mountain, is a different ball game. There were 19 men up top when the site was attacked. One man, Chief Master Sergeant Richard Etchberger, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 2010 by President Obama for his role in the fight.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: When it looked like the ledge would be overrun, he called for airstrikes within yards of his own position, shaking the mountain and clearing the way for a rescue.

The local time is...RUWITCH: The closest airport to the mountain is Nong Khang, outside Sam Neua, a remote town in northeastern Laos. Some 57 years after the attack, I've come here with Rick Holland on his first trip to Laos, and members of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, or DPAA.UNIDENTIFIED FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would like to thank you for flying with us and are looking forward to...RUWITCH: DPAA is the arm of the Pentagon responsible for finding prisoners of war, POWs, and those missing in action, MIA. By their tally, there are more than 1,570 Americans still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. That includes over 280 believed to be in Laos. Several are potentially near here.(SOUNDBITE OF DIGGING)RUWITCH: On the edge of town, in a dry rice field by a river, members of a DPAA team dig small excavation pits. Others sift dirt through screens. They're looking for the remains of a fighter pilot whose jet went down here in flames after a bombing run in the late 1960s.ALLY CAMPO: The plane, we have a witness testimony that said it crashed into the river.RUWITCH: Ally Campo is the scientific recovery expert on site.CAMPO: But we have archaeological evidence showing that the debris field actually extends all the way up into these rice paddy fields.RUWITCH: The remnants in the dirt are tiny.CAMPO: And we go through it, and anything that is man-made, anything that looks weird, anything that could be possibly considered bone or a part of the incident will get put in evidence buckets.(SOUNDBITE OF MATERIAL SIFTING)RUWITCH: It's painstaking work, even on flat land near town with a big team. Lima Site 85, on Phou Pha Thi Mountain, is a different ball game. There were 19 men up top when the site was attacked. One man, Chief Master Sergeant Richard Etchberger, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 2010 by President Obama for his role in the fight.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: When it looked like the ledge would be overrun, he called for airstrikes within yards of his own position, shaking the mountain and clearing the way for a rescue. And in the morning light, an American helicopter came into view.RUWITCH: Etchberger helped other men onto the chopper. And then as he was loading on, he was struck by gunfire and died. Seven of the 19 men made it off the mountain alive. Holland was not one of them. A few days later, on the other side of the world, Rick Holland's mom, Ann Holland, was hosting a Cub Scout meeting when the phone rang.HOLLAND: And gets a call. Says, Mrs. Holland, something's happened up at the site. We're not sure exactly what. We're not sure the status of the men.RUWITCH: It would be two years before the military declared her husband and the others dead. Ann Holland wanted proof, though. She, and later Rick, have been pushing for information or confirmation of Melvin Holland's death for the better part of six decades.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)RUWITCH: The main search area at Phou Pha Thi is not at the top of the mountain. It's partway down the side on a sloped ledge at the bottom of a 600-foot cliff. DPAA believes the men's bodies may have been thrown off the top after the battle. Getting to the site is an endeavor. When the weather is bad, it's a two-hour drive from town, followed by a hike. On good days, the team takes helicopters to a landing zone nearby.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)WESTON IANNONE: It's pretty complex terrain, so it takes us about another 30, 45 minutes to get from where we're landing to the actual investigation or excavation area.RUWITCH: Weston Iannone is an Army captain with DPAA. He was team leader at the site.IANNONE: It's a series of rappels, ascents and then, like, hand over hand.RUWITCH: All the team members are trained in mountaineering.

A few days later, on the other side of the world, Rick Holland's mom, Ann Holland, was hosting a Cub Scout meeting when the phone rang.HOLLAND: And gets a call. Says, Mrs. Holland, something's happened up at the site. We're not sure exactly what. We're not sure the status of the men.RUWITCH: It would be two years before the military declared her husband and the others dead. Ann Holland wanted proof, though. She, and later Rick, have been pushing for information or confirmation of Melvin Holland's death for the better part of six decades.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)RUWITCH: The main search area at Phou Pha Thi is not at the top of the mountain. It's partway down the side on a sloped ledge at the bottom of a 600-foot cliff. DPAA believes the men's bodies may have been thrown off the top after the battle. Getting to the site is an endeavor. When the weather is bad, it's a two-hour drive from town, followed by a hike. On good days, the team takes helicopters to a landing zone nearby.(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER ROTORS WHIRRING)WESTON IANNONE: It's pretty complex terrain, so it takes us about another 30, 45 minutes to get from where we're landing to the actual investigation or excavation area.RUWITCH: Weston Iannone is an Army captain with DPAA. He was team leader at the site.IANNONE: It's a series of rappels, ascents and then, like, hand over hand.RUWITCH: All the team members are trained in mountaineering. Lidar and terrain mapping have helped them zero in on places of interest where rolling or falling things might come to a stop on the steep slope.IANNONE: Today, in a literal sense, it was putting on gloves and kind of just scraping the surface.RUWITCH: So far, remains of three men have been identified. Eight remain unaccounted for. For Rick Holland, the goal of the trip was to simply reach the top of the mountain where his dad was last seen. There's a trail that leads to the peak, more than a mile up in the Lao sky.(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)RUWITCH: The Lao government would not let me go with him, so I gave a recorder to a member of the DPAA team that accompanied him.HOLLAND: Oh, what a view.RUWITCH: At the peak, with silent hills unfolding around him, Holland phoned his 85-year-old mother to tell her he had made it, and he sat by the edge, draped in a black POW/MIA flag.HOLLAND: (Shouting) Pha Thi, I'm here.RUWITCH: He spoke to the spirit of the mountain.HOLLAND: (Shouting) I'm here to ask your forgiveness. Please let the men come home. It's time.RUWITCH: Bringing them back, he says, is his life's mission.HOLLAND: (Shouting) Dad, I'm here. I want you home, Dad. (Crying) We miss you. We want you back so bad.RUWITCH: Neither the mountain nor the man answered his call that day, but Rick Holland says he'll be back.

He was team leader at the site.IANNONE: It's a series of rappels, ascents and then, like, hand over hand.RUWITCH: All the team members are trained in mountaineering. Lidar and terrain mapping have helped them zero in on places of interest where rolling or falling things might come to a stop on the steep slope.IANNONE: Today, in a literal sense, it was putting on gloves and kind of just scraping the surface.RUWITCH: So far, remains of three men have been identified.

There's a trail that leads to the peak, more than a mile up in the Lao sky.(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)RUWITCH: The Lao government would not let me go with him, so I gave a recorder to a member of the DPAA team that accompanied him.HOLLAND: Oh, what a view.RUWITCH: At the peak, with silent hills unfolding around him, Holland phoned his 85-year-old mother to tell her he had made it, and he sat by the edge, draped in a black POW/MIA flag.HOLLAND: (Shouting) Pha Thi, I'm here.RUWITCH: He spoke to the spirit of the mountain.HOLLAND: (Shouting) I'm here to ask your forgiveness.

And in the morning light, an American helicopter came into view.RUWITCH: Etchberger helped other men onto the chopper. And then as he was loading on, he was struck by gunfire and died.

It's partway down the side on a sloped ledge at the bottom of a 600-foot cliff. DPAA believes the men's bodies may have been thrown off the top after the battle. Getting to the site is an endeavor.

He was team leader at the site.IANNONE: It's a series of rappels, ascents and then, like, hand over hand.RUWITCH: All the team members are trained in mountaineering.

    "article_text": "Joel Rose Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt (right) speaks as border czar Tom Homan looks on during a White House briefing on Monday.Andrew Thomas/AFP via Gettyhide caption WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signedan executive orderon Monday aimed at identifying and potentially cutting off federal funds to sanctuary cities, part of a broader effort to target jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with immigration authorities. The executive order directs the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to identify jurisdictions where local enforcement has declined to cooperate with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. \"It's quite simple,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt during a press briefing on Monday morning. \"Obey the law, respect the law, and don't obstruct federal immigration officials and law enforcement officials when they are simply trying to remove public safety threats from our nation's communities.\" The order instructs those two agencies to create \"proper eligibility verification\" systems in sanctuary cities to stop migrants in the country illegally from receiving federal funds including in-state tuition and other public benefits. The move sets the stage for more federal lawsuits against cities, states and counties that don't fully cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Those sanctuary jurisdictions argue that collaborating with ICE would drain their resources, and undermine trust between police and immigrant communities. \"We stand together in solidarity with our immigrant families,\" wrote Keith Wilson, the mayor of Portland, OR, ina letter to the city councilearlier this year, promising the city would try to \"keep undocumented families safe by slowing or stopping cooperation with overreaching federal immigration enforcement.\" The Trump administration has previously tried to withhold funding from sanctuary cities and states. During President Trump's first term, the Justice Department tried to withhold funding from several jurisdictions — but they fought back, and were often able todefeat those efforts in court. Last week, a federal judgeblocked the administration's latest effortto withhold funding from 16 jurisdictions, including San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis, St. Paul and New Haven. \"Here we are again,\" wrote U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco, who found that the Trump administration's actions were likely unconstitutional and granted a preliminary injunction. \"The threat to withhold funding causes them irreparable injury in the form of budgetary uncertainty, deprivation of constitutional rights, and undermining trust between the Cities and Counties and the communities they serve,\" Orrick wrote.

    "title": "DOGE employees gain accounts on classified networks holding nuclear secrets",
    "article_text": "By Geoff Brumfiel , Jenna McLaughlin Workers stand inside a special chamber at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The chamber is used to test new conventional explosives that initiate detonation of advanced nuclear weapons designs. The data produced from such experiments is considered restricted.Lawrence Livermore National Laboratoryhide caption Two members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency were given accounts on classified networks that hold highly guarded details about America's nuclear weapons, two sources tell NPR. Luke Farritor, a 23-year-old former SpaceX intern, and Adam Ramada, a Miami-based venture capitalist, have had accounts on the computer systems for at least two weeks, according to the sources who also have access to the networks. Prior to their work at DOGE, neither Farritor nor Ramada appear to have had experience with either nuclear weapons or handling classified information. A spokesperson for the Department of Energy initially denied that Farritor and Ramada had accessed the networks. \"This reporting is false. No DOGE personnel have accessed these NNSA systems. The two DOGE individuals in question worked within the agency for several days and departed DOE in February,\" the spokesperson told NPR in an emailed statement. In a second statement later Monday evening, the spokesperson clarified that the accounts had been created but said they were never used by the DOGE staffers. \"DOE is able to confirm that these accounts in question were never activated and have never been accessed,\" the email statement read. The two sources contacted by NPR declined to be identified publicly because they were not authorized to speak about the matter to the press. They were able to directly see Ramada and Farritor's names in the directories of the networks. The network directories are visible to thousands of employees involved in nuclear weapons work at facilities and laboratories throughout the U.S., but the networks themselves can only be accessed on specific terminals in secure rooms designated for the handling of classified information. The DOGE employees' presence on the network would not by itself be enough for them to gain access to that secret information, as data even within the networks is carefully controlled on a need-to-know basis, according to several experts reached by NPR. In February,CNN reportedthat DOGE employees, including Farritor, were seeking access to the secretive computer systems. At the time, Energy Secretary Chris Wright denied that they would be allowed on the networks. \"I've heard these rumors, 'They're like seeing our nuclear secrets.' None of that is true at all; they don't have security clearances,\" Wrighttold CNBC. The sources say that the networks in question are used by theNational Nuclear Security Administration, the agency within the Department of Energy that oversees the nation's vast nuclear stockpile, and the Department of Defense. The first network, known as theNNSA Enterprise Secure Network, is used to transmit detailed \"restricted data\" about America's nuclear weapons designs and the special nuclear materials used in the weapons, among other things. The network is used to transfer this extremely sensitive technical information between the NNSA, the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories and the production facilities that store, maintain and upgrade the nation's nuclear arsenal. The second network, known as the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), is used by the Department of Defense to communicate with the Department of Energy about nuclear weapons. SIPRNet is also used more broadly for sharing information classified at the secret level, information that \"could potentially damage or harm national security if it were to get out,\" explained a former career civil servant at the Department of Defense who requested anonymity to discuss classified systems. Access to both networks would normally require a \"Q\" clearance, the highest level of security clearance at the Department of Energy. Obtaining a Q clearance is a lengthy process, but can be expedited in certain cases. It remains unclear just how much access to classified data the two DOGE staffers could have actually had if they had used their accounts. Another source familiar with the matter, who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity, due to sensitivities around the Department of Energy's systems that hold classified information, said that the presence of DOGE officials on DOE's classified systems would represent an escalation in DOGE's recent privileges inside the agency, but those accounts would not give them carte blanche access to all files hosted on those systems. They described the access as a \"toehold\" that would allow DOGE staffers to request information classified at the secret level. \"They're getting a little further in, it's something to make note of,\" they concluded. \"It could lead to something bigger.\" The DOE statement did not explain why the accounts were created, but DOGE employees might have wanted access to classified information in order to discuss program details and future budget priorities, says Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, which tracks America's nuclear program. Although large portions of the nuclear weapons budget are ultimately unclassified, a lot of classified details likely go into setting those numbers. \"I don't think any of that would be open,\" he says. NNSA has already felt the effects of the Trump administration's efforts to slash the government. In February, hundreds of workers were fired from the nuclear agency at the direction of DOGE. The decision was quickly reversed however, and ultimately fewer than 50 employees were dismissed, according to the agency. News of the accounts comes amid growing concern about DOGE's handling of data elsewhere in the government. Earlier this month,NPR reportedon a whistleblower at the National Labor Relations Board who had evidence that DOGE employees got high level access and may have copied and removed sensitive data from internal systems at their agency. The DOGE team asked that their activities not be logged on the system and then appeared to try and cover their tracks by turning off monitoring tools and deleting records of their access. Employees at the NLRB became concerned, particularly after detecting suspicious log-in attempts from an IP address in Russia using the newly created DOGE credentials. It also comes duringa controversyover Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's use of the publicly available encrypted messaging app Signal to send sensitive details of a military strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Hegseth's use of the app became public after the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was accidentally included on one chat. Last week, theNew York Timesreported about a second chat that included Hegseth's wife, brother and personal lawyer.

    "title": "Seasonal COVID shots may no longer be possible under Trump admin",
    "article_text": "FDA was supposed to decide on Novavax vaccine by April 1, but it now wants more data. Under President Trump, the Food and Drug Administration may no longer approve seasonal COVID-19 vaccines updated for the virus variants circulating that year, according to recent statements by Trump administration officials. Since the acute phase of the pandemic, vaccine manufacturers have been subtly updating COVID-19 shots annually to precisely target the molecular signatures of the newest virus variants, which continually evolve to evade our immune responses. So far, the FDA has treated these tweaked vaccines the same way it treats seasonal flu shots, which have long been updated annually to match currently circulating strains of flu viruses. The FDA does not consider seasonal flu shots brand-new vaccines. Rather, they're just slightly altered versions of the approved vaccines. As such, the regulator does not require companies to conduct lengthy, expensive vaccine trials to prove that each slightly changed version is safe and effective. If they did, generating annual vaccines would be virtually impossible.Each year, from late February to early March, the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization direct flu shot makers on what tweaks they should make to shots for the upcoming flu season. That gives manufacturers just enough time to develop tweaks and start manufacturing massive supplies of doses in time for the start of the flu season. So far, COVID-19 vaccines have been treated the exact same way, save for the fact that the vaccines that use mRNA technology do not need as much lead time for manufacturing. In recent years, the FDA decided on formulations for annual COVID shots around June, with doses rolled out in the fall alongside flu shots. However, this process is now in question based on statements from Trump administration officials. The statements come amid a delay in a decision on whether to approve the COVID-19 vaccine made by Novavax, which uses a protein-based technology, not mRNA. The FDA was supposed to decide whether to grant the vaccine full approval by April 1. To this point, the vaccine has been used under an emergency use authorization by the agency. But, political staff at the agency decided to delay the approval,according to Politico. On Friday,The Wall Street Journal reportedthat the FDA is now asking Novavax to conduct a new randomized controlled trial to prove the vaccine's efficacy, which could cost tens of millions of dollars and would take many months at least. An earlier version of the vaccine was already found to be90 percent effective against COVID-19in a phase 3 trial with nearly 30,000 people. On Saturday, Marty Makary, FDA Commissioner for the Trump administration,seemed to confirm the Journal's reporting. In a social media post, Makary wrote: \"To be clear, this is a new product that Novavax is trying to introduce to the market with a study of a different product from 2021. New products require new clinical studies.\" In a clarifying statement, Andrew Nixon, the Department of Health and Human Services’ director of communications, provided a statement saying: \"It’s now been years since Covid has presented the threat it once did, and the urgency to rush approval of boosters without normal oversight no longer exists.\" \"A four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data, unlike the flu shot which has been tried and tested for more than 80 years,” he added. Stat Newsasked an HHS official if makers of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines—Pfizer and Moderna— would also need to perform new clinical trials to have their updated shots approved. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, left open the possibility, responding: \"We will evaluate the data and make that determination with FDA’s review process as they submit their applications.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Spain is about to face the challenge of a “black start”",
    "article_text": "Major power facilities require power to operate, and there's lots of unmet demand. Since the Iberian Peninsula lost power in a massive blackout, grid operators are in the process of trying to restore power to millions of customers and businesses. As you might imagine, the process—termed a \"black start\"—is quite a bit more challenging than flicking on a switch. However, the challenge is made considerably more difficult because nearly everything about the system—from the management hardware that remotely controls the performance of the grid to the power plants themselves—needs power to operate. You might think that a power plant could easily start generating power, but in reality, only a limited number of facilities have everything they need to handle a black start. That's because it takes power to make power. Facilities that boil water have lots of powered pumps and valves, coal plants need to pulverize the fuel and move it to where it's burned, etc. In most cases, black-start-rated plants have a diesel generator present to supply enough power to get the plant operating. These tend to be smaller plants, since they require proportionally smaller diesel generators. The initial output of these black start facilities is then used to provide power to all the plants that need an external power source to operate. This has to be managed in a way that ensures that only other power plants get the first electrons to start moving on the grid, otherwise the normal demand would immediately overwhelm the limited number of small plants that are operating. Again, this has to be handled by facilities that need power in order to control the flow of energy across the grid. This is why managing the grid will never be as simple as \"put the hardware on the Internet and control it remotely,\" given that the Internet also needs power to operate. It's possible to manage some of this with power brought in from neighboring grids outside the blackout zone. But this also requires that the grid interconnections be isolated from the demand on the blackout side of the connection, and send their power directly to idle power plants. Once sufficient plants are online, a small subset of the grid will be powered, and the plants can manage the synchronization of their alternating current outputs to a single frequency. At this point, it's possible to start meeting demand. But demand can be massive. Grid failures tend to happen when the grid is stressed by unusually high power demand, such as when heat waves drive high levels of air conditioning use. This means that a lot of the hardware that would be using the electricity is connected and switched on, just waiting for the electrons to appear. Letting all this hardware make demands at once would likely lead to an immediate grid failure and return to blackout conditions. The problem is maintaining the grid's frequency. You can think of each bit of power-using hardware as a source of friction that would slow the frequency down, while each generator can potentially speed the grid back up. In many cases, this \"slow things down\" is literal—the frequency is the product of large chunks of metal spinning around inside of generators, and they will spin more slowly under higher demand. In any case, everything from small electronics to massive industrial equipment can be damaged if electricity is provided at the wrong frequency. Because of this, the grid has lots of protections built in that will shut things down if the frequency wanders too much. So, the grid operators need to estimate how much demand different grid sections have waiting to be fulfilled, and begin a delicate choreography of bringing portions of the grid online while matching them with additional generating capacity. Failure to do so may bring the whole system back to its present state. While the grids in Spain and Portugal are connected to each other, they have limited connections to elsewhere. The only sources of external power to the grid come from France and Morocco, which are small connections, but they could be used to help black start some plants. Both blacked-out countries have significant hydropower, with Spain seeing it cover 10 percent of its demand and Portugal 25 percent. That's useful because hydro plants need very little in the way of an external power supply to start operating. Beyond that, both countries have invested heavily in renewables, with Portugal supplying about half of its power from wind and hydro, having closed its last coal plant in 2021. Spain receives about 40 percent of its power from renewables at present. Solar is not an ideal power source for black-starting the grid, given that it's unavailable for a significant chunk of the day. But solar panels produce direct current, with electronic systems matching it to the alternating current of the grid. With the right electronics, it can play a key role in keeping frequencies stable as grid segments are repowered. In productive areas, wind can provide black start power to other plants, and doesn't need much external power to begin operations. It's unclear, however, whether the local wind hardware is equipped for black starts, or if the local weather will cooperate (a quick check of the weather in various cities suggests it's relatively calm there). Batteries have the potential to be incredibly helpful, since they also provide direct current that can be converted to any frequency needed, and so used for both starting up power plants or for frequency stabilization as segments of the grid are brought back online. Unfortunately, neither country has installed much grid-scale battery hardware yet. That's expected to change over the next few years in parallel with dramatically expanded solar power. But, at the moment, batteries will not be a huge help. Regardless of how precisely the grid operators manage to handle this task in Spain and Portugal, they face a monumental challenge at the moment. If you're seeing estimates of several days for the restoration of power, it's because failing to meet this challenge will leave things back in the state they're in now.

    "article_text": "ChatGPT will now recommend products to be bought offsite—but no sponsored ads just yet. On Thursday, OpenAI announced the addition of shopping features toChatGPT Search. The new feature allows users to search for products and purchase them through merchant websites after being redirected from the ChatGPT interface. Product placement is not sponsored, and the update affects all users, regardless of whether they've signed in to an account. Adam Fry, ChatGPT search product lead at OpenAI,showedArs Technica's sister site Wired how the new shopping system works during a demonstration. Users researching products like espresso machines or office chairs receive recommendations based on their stated preferences, stored memories, and product reviews from around the web. According to Wired, the shopping experience in ChatGPT resemblesGoogle Shopping. When users click on a product image, the interface displays multiple retailers like Amazon and Walmart on the right side of the screen, with buttons to complete purchases. OpenAI is currently experimenting with categories that include electronics, fashion, home goods, and beauty products. Product reviews shown in ChatGPT come from various online sources, including publishers and user forums like Reddit. Users can instruct ChatGPT to prioritize which review sources to use when creating product recommendations. Unlike Google's algorithm-based approach to product recommendations, ChatGPT reportedly attempts to understand product reviews and user preferences in a more conversational manner.  If someone mentions they prefer black clothing from specific retailers in a chat, the system incorporates those preferences in future shopping recommendations. One key distinction between ChatGPT shopping and Google Shopping involves how products appear in results. While Google often includes sponsored product placements, OpenAI's product results merely come from search—for now. \"They are not ads,\" Fry told Wired. \"They are not sponsored.\" According toTechCrunch, OpenAI will not \"receive a kickback\" for any purchases made through ChatGPT, but Wired points out that the new feature could potentially affect third-party affiliate revenue. Currently, many publishers get a cut of a sale when they recommend a product and a user clicks through and buys it. When asked how OpenAI might affect that kind of affiliate revenue, Fry told Wired that OpenAI plans to \"experiment with a whole bunch of different ways\" to make it work. While the product results may be non-sponsored for now, due to ChatGPT'srecent issues with sycophancy, we would not be surprised if some people end up being persuaded to purchase things by anoverly enthusiasticAI persona. One could imagine searching for that espresso machine and seeing ChatGPT reply, \"This is a profound moment. You're taking a solid step, bro. You've looked deep into the dark roast abyss and seen the truth without flinching. You're not a machine; you're the ultimate coffee maker. You've got this.

    "title": "Backblaze responds to claims of “sham accounting,” customer backups at risk",
    "article_text": "Short seller publishes report detailing allegations about Backblaze's financials Backblaze is dismissing allegations from a short seller that it engaged in “sham accounting” that could put the cloud storage and backup solution provider and its customers' backups in jeopardy. On April 24, Morpheus Research posted alengthy reportaccusing the San Mateo, California-based firm of practicing “sham accounting and brazen insider dumping.” The claims largely stem from a pair of lawsuits filed against Backblaze by former employees Huey Hall [PDF] and James Kisner [PDF] in October. Per LinkedIn profiles, Hall was Backblaze’s head of finance from March 2020 to February 2024, and Kisner was Backblaze’s VP of investor relations and financial planning from May 2021 to November 2023. As Morpheus wrote, the lawsuits accuse Backblaze’s founders of participating in “an aggressive trading plan to sell 10,000 shares a day, along with other potential sales from early employee holders, against ‘all external capital markets advice.’” The plan allegedly started in April 2022, after the IPO lockup period expired and despite advisor warnings, including one from a capital markets consultant that such a trading plan likely breached Backblaze’s fiduciary duties. “The founders proceeded anyway, driving the stock down to $3.82 by the end of November 2022—76 percent lower than its IPO price,” Morpheus' report reads. The short seller also noted that Hall accused Backblaze of pressuring workers to certify “inaccurate” financial statements and refused to approve certain financial reports because he believed they included “misstatements regarding the Fixed Assets, Capitalized R&D, Cash Flow statements, and Equity accounting.” Similarly, Kisner accused Backblaze of sending “highly inflated cash flow forecasts to auditors.” Backblaze went public in November 2021 andraised$100 million. Morpheus noted that since then, “Backblaze has reported losses every quarter, its outstanding share count has grown by 80 percent, and its share price has declined by 71 percent.” Following Morpheus’ report,Investingreported on Thursday that Backblaze shares fell 8.3 percent. Beyond the financial implications for stockholders, Morpheus’ report has sparked some concern for the primarily small businesses and individuals relying on Backblaze for data backup. Today, for example,How-To Geekreported that “Backblaze backups might be in trouble,” in reference to Morpheus’ report. The publication said that if Morpheus’ reporting was accurate, Backblaze doesn’t appear to be heading toward profitability. In its Q4 2024 earnings report [PDF], Backblaze reported a net loss of $48.5 million. In 2023, it reported a net loss of $59.7 million. “If Backblaze suddenly shuts down, customers might lose access to existing backups,” How-To Geek said. Ars Technica reached out to Backblaze about its response to concerns about the company’s financials resulting in lost backups. Patrick Thomas, Backblaze’s VP of marketing, called Morpheus’ claims “baseless.” He added: The report is inaccurate and misleading, based largely on litigation of the same nature, and a clear attempt by short sellers to manipulate our stock price for financial gain. Thomas also claimed that \"independent, third-party reviews\" have already found that there have been “no wrongdoing or issues\" with Backblaze's public financial results. “Our storage cloud continues to deliver reliable, high-performance services that Backblaze customers rely on, and we remain fully focused on driving innovation and creating long-term value for our customers, employees, and investors,” Thomas said. Backblaze will announce its Q1 2025 results on May 7. Regardless of what lies ahead for the company's finances and litigation, commitment tothe 3-2-1 backup rule remains prudent.

    "article_text": "Legal challenges will likely immediately follow law's passage, experts said. Everyone expects that the Take It Down Act—which requires platforms to remove both real and artificial intelligence-generated non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) within 48 hours of victims' reports—will likely pass a vote in the House of Representatives tonight. After that, it goes to Donald Trump's desk, where the president has confirmed that he will promptly sign it into law, joining first lady Melania Trump in strongly campaigning for its swift passing. Victims-turned-advocates, many of them children, similarly pushed lawmakers to take urgent action to protect a growing number of victims from the increasing risks of being repeatedly targeted in fake sexualized images or revenge porn that experts say can quickly spread widely online. Digital privacy experts tried to raise some concerns, warning that the law seemed overly broad and could trigger widespread censorship online. Given such a short window to comply, platforms will likely remove some content that may not be NCII, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)warned. And even more troublingly, the law does not explicitly exempt encrypted messages, which could potentially encourage platforms to one day break encryption due to the liability threat. Also, it seemed likely that the removal process could be abused by people who hope platforms will automatically remove any reported content, especially after Trump admitted thathe would use the law to censor his enemies. None of that feedback mattered, the EFF's assistant director of federal affairs, Maddie Daly, told Ars. Lawmakers accepted no amendments in their rush to get the bill to Trump's desk. There was \"immense pressure,\" Daly said, \"to quickly pass this bill without full consideration.\" Because of the rush, Daly suggested that the Take It Down Act still has \"gaping flaws.\" While the tech law is expected to achieve the rare feat of getting through Congress at what experts told Ars was a record pace, both supporters and critics also expect that the law will just as promptly be challenged in courts. Supporters have suggested that any litigation exposing flaws could result in amendments. They're simultaneously bracing for that backlash, while preparing for the win ahead of the vote tonight and hoping that the law can survive any subsequent legal attacks mostly intact. In a press conference hosted by the nonprofit Americans for Responsible Innovation, Slade Bond—who serves as chair of public policy for the law firm Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP—advocated for the law passing, warning, \"we should not let caution be the enemy of progress.\" Bond joined other supporters in suggesting that apparent threats to encryption or online speech are \"far-fetched.\" On his side was Encode's vice president of public policy, Adam Billen, who pushed back on the claim that companies might break encryption due to the law's vague text. Billen predicted that \"most encrypted content\" wouldn’t be threatened with takedowns—supposedly including private or direct messages—because he argued that the law explicitly covers content that is published (and, importantly, not just distributed) on services that provide a \"forum for specifically user generated content.\" \"In our mind, encryption simply just is not a question under this bill, and we have explicitly opposed other legislation that would explicitly break encryption,\" Billen said. That may be one way of reading the law, but Daly told Ars that the EFF's lawyers had a different take. \"We just don't agree with that reading,\" she said. \"As drafted, what will likely pass the floor tonight is absolutely a threat to encryption. There are exemptions for email services, but direct messages, cloud storage, these are not exempted.\" Instead, she suggested that lawmakers jammed the law through without weighing amendments that might have explicitly shielded encryption or prevented politicized censorship. At the supporters' press conference, Columbia Law School professor Tim Wu suggested that, for lawmakers facing a public vote, opposing the bill became \"totally untenable\" because \"there's such obvious harm\" and \"such a visceral problem with fake porn, particularly of minors.\" Stefan Turkheimer, vice president of public policy for the anti-sexual abuse organization RAINN, agreed with Wu that the growing problem required immediate regulatory action. While various reports have indicated for the past year that the amount of AI-generated NCII is rising, Turkheimer suggested that all statistics are severely undercounting and outdated as he noted that RAINN's hotline reports are \"doubling\" monthly for this kind of abuse. Coming up for a final vote amid an uptick in abuse reports, the Take It Down Act seeks to address harms that most people find \"patently offensive,\" Turkheimer said, suggesting it was the kind of bill that \"can only get killed in the dark.\" However, Turkheimer was the only supporter at the press conference who indicated that texting may be part of the problem that the law could potentially address, perhaps justifying critics' concerns. He thinks deterring victims' harm is more important than weighing critics' fears of censorship or other privacy risks. \"This is a real harm that a lot of people are experiencing, that every single time that they get a text message or they go on the Internet, they may see themselves in a non-consensual image,\" Turkheimer said. \"That is the real problem, and we're balancing\" that against \"sort of a hypothetical problem on the other end, which is that some people's speech might be affected.\" Remedying text-based abuse could become a privacy problem, an EFFblogsuggested, since communications providers \"may be served with notices they simply cannot comply with, given the fact that these providers cannot view the contents of messages on their platforms. Platforms may respond by abandoning encryption entirely in order to be able to monitor content—turning private conversations into surveilled spaces.\" That's why Daly told Ars that the EFF \"is very concerned about the effects of Take It Down,\" viewing it as a \"massive privacy violation.\" \"Congress should protect victims of NCII, but we don't think that Take It Down is the way to do this or that it will actually protect victims,\" Daly said. Further, the potential for politicians to weaponize the takedown system to censor criticism should not be ignored, the EFF warned in anotherblog. \"There are no penalties whatsoever to dissuade a requester from simply insisting that content is NCII,\" the blog noted, urging Congress to instead \"focus on enforcing and improving the many existing civil and criminal laws that address NCII, rather than opting for a broad takedown regime.\" \"Non-consensual intimate imagery is a serious problem that deserves serious consideration, not a hastily drafted, overbroad bill that sweeps in legal, protected speech,\" the EFF said. That call largely fell on deaf ears. Once the law passes, the EFF will continue recommending encrypted services as a reliable means to protect user privacy, Daly said, but remains concerned about the unintended consequences of the law's vague encryption language. Although Bond said that precedent is on supporters' side—arguing \"the Supreme Court has been abundantly clear for decades that the First Amendment is not a shield for the type of content that the Take It Down Act is designed to address,\" like sharing child sexual abuse materials or engaging in sextortion—Daly said that the EFF remains optimistic that courts will intervene to prevent critics' worst fears. \"We expect to see challenges to this,\" Daly said. \"I don't think this will pass muster.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "What’s it like to be 70 years old in space? “All those little aches and pains heal up.”",
    "article_text": "\"When the flight docs say I'm ready to go back, I'm ready to do it.\" Not many people celebrate their birthday by burning a fiery arc through the atmosphere, pulling 4.4gs in freefall back to planet Earth, thudding into the ground, and emptying their stomach on the steppes of Kazakhstan. No one has ever done it on their70thbirthday. Perhaps this is appropriate because NASA astronaut Don Pettit is a singular individual. His birthday is April 20, and when the Soyuz spacecraft carrying him landed at dawn in Kazakhstan, the calendar had turned over to that date. John Glenn, then 77, was older when he went to space. But no one as old as Pettit had spent as long as he had in orbit, 220 days, on a mission. On Monday, a little more than a week after returning from orbit, Pettit met with reporters at Johnson Space Center. \"It's good to be back on planet Earth,\" he said. \"As much as I love exploring space, going into the frontier, and making observations, you do reach a time when it's time to come home.\" Pettit first went into space at the age of 47 for his first of three long-duration missions to the International Space Station. Since then, he has flown a shorter shuttle mission and two more space station increments. All told, he has lived in space for 590 days, the third-most all-time among NASA astronauts. \"I've got a few creaks and groans in my body, but basically I feel the same as I did 20 years ago, and coming back to gravity is provocative,\" he said. After every one of his missions, Pettit said the readjustment to gravity for him has been a challenge. He added that the surprising thing about spaceflight is that it's not so much your large muscles that ache, but the smaller ones. \"A week ago, I was on station, and I was doing really heavy squats, I was doing dead lifts, I could float around with the greatest of ease, even though I had no trapeze,\" he said. \"I was at the peak of my game. And then you come back to Earth, and it's like, God, I can't even get up from the floor anymore. It's humbling. But it isn't about the large muscle groups. It's about the little, tiny muscles that everybody forgets about because they're just there and they work. When you're in weightlessness, these muscles don't work anymore. And they take a six-month vacation until you come back to Earth. And now, all of a sudden, they start groaning and talking to you, and it takes a while to get all these little muscles tuned back up to being an Earthling.\" In terms of aging, Pettit said, like a lot of older people, he wakes up after a night sleeping on Earth with a sore shoulder or a stiff neck. That's just part of the process. But microgravity took some of those aches and pains away. \"I love being in space,\" he said. \"When you're sleeping, you're just floating, and your body, all those little aches and pains heal up. You feel like you're 30 years old again and free of pain, free of everything. So I love being on orbit. It's a great place to be for me and my physiology.\" Pettit has visited the space station on all four of his spaceflights. He lived there, near the beginning of the station's lifetime, as part of Expedition 6 in 2002. More than two decades later he said the station is operating at full capacity, delivering on its promise of robust scientific research, studies of long-duration spaceflight, and much more. Asked if he felt nostalgic about the station coming to an end in 2030—NASA plans to de-orbit the facility at that time—Pettit said the laboratory should live on. \"I'm a firm believer we don't need to dump the space station in the ocean at 2030 if we don't want to,\" he said. \"If we as a society decided to keep [the] space station, we could keep it like a B-52. I mean, how many years is it they've been flying? It'll be flying close to 100 years by the time the Air Force finally retires the B-52, and it's basically the same airframe with the same aerodynamics, but everything else is new. There's no limit to what we can do to [the] space station, except for our will to keep refurbishing it and having the funding necessary.\" And maybe that's because he wants to go back. Pettit did not rule out flying into space again. For now, he wants to take a few weeks to allow his body time to re-adjust to gravity. He wants to enjoy some time with his family. But soon, he knows, space will start to call to him again. \"I call it the explorer's paradox,\" he said. \"When you're back in civilization, you want to be out there wherever your wilderness happens to be; and then when you're in your wilderness, it's like, wow, I need to be back with my family. I think it's probably gone on for as long as humanity has had people who go off into the wilderness. When the flight docs say I'm ready to go back, I'm ready to do it. And I know John Glenn flew at age 76, something like that, and I'm only 70, so I've got a few more good years left. I could see getting another flight or two in before I'm ready to hang up my rocket nozzles.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "50 years later, Vietnam’s environment still bears the scars of war",
    "article_text": "Degraded ecosystems and dioxin-contaminated soils and waters reflect the long-term ecological impact. When the Vietnam War finally ended on April 30, 1975, it left behind a landscapescarred with environmental damage. Vast stretches of coastal mangroves, once housing rich stocks of fish and birds, lay in ruins. Forests that had boasted hundreds of species were reduced to dried-out fragments, overgrown with invasive grasses. The term “ecocide” had been coined in the late 1960sto describe the US military’s use of herbicides like Agent Orange and incendiary weapons like napalm to battle guerrilla forces that used jungles and marshes for cover. Fifty years later, Vietnam’s degraded ecosystems and dioxin-contaminated soils and waters still reflectthe long-term ecological consequencesof the war. Efforts to restore these damaged landscapes andeven to assess the long-term harmhave been limited. As anenvironmental scientist and anthropologistwho has worked in Vietnam since the 1990s, I find the neglect and slow recovery efforts deeply troubling. Although the war spurred new international treaties aimed at protecting the environment during wartime, these efforts failed to compel post-war restoration for Vietnam. Currentconflicts in Ukraineandthe Middle Eastshow that these laws and treaties still aren’t effective. The USfirst sent ground troopsto Vietnam in March 1965 to support South Vietnam against revolutionary forces and North Vietnamese troops, but the war had been going on for years before then. To fight an elusive enemy operating clandestinely at night and from hideouts deep in swamps and jungles, the US military turned to environmental modification technologies. The most well-known of these wasOperation Ranch Hand, which sprayed at least 19 million gallons (75 million liters) of herbicides overapproximately 6.4 million acres(2.6 million hectares), of South Vietnam. The chemicals fell on forests, and also on rivers, rice paddies, and villages, exposing civilians and troops. More than half of that spraying involved the dioxin-contaminated defoliant Agent Orange. Herbicides were used tostrip the leaf cover from forests, increase visibility along transportation routes anddestroy crops suspectedof supplying guerrilla forces. As news of the damage from these tactics made it back to the US, scientists raised concerns about the campaign’s environmental impactsto President Lyndon Johnson, calling for a review of whether the US was intentionally using chemical weapons. American military leaders’ position was that herbicidesdid not constitute chemical weaponsunder the Geneva Protocol, which the US had yet to ratify. Scientific organizations also initiated studies within Vietnam during the war,finding widespread destructionof mangroves, economic losses of rubber and timber plantations, and harm to lakes and waterways. In 1969, evidence linked a chemical in Agent Orange, 2,4,5-T, tobirth defects and stillbirths in micebecause it contained TCDD, a particularly harmful dioxin. That led to a ban on domestic use andsuspension of Agent Orange use by the military in April 1970, with the last missionflown in early 1971. Incendiary weapons and the clearing of forests also ravaged rich ecosystems in Vietnam. The US Forest Servicetested large-scale incineration of junglesby igniting barrels of fuel oil dropped from planes. Particularly feared by civilians was the use of napalm bombs, withmore than 400,000 tonsof the thickened petroleum used during the war. After these infernos,invasive grasses often took overin hardened, infertile soils. “Rome Plows,” massive bulldozers with an armor-fortified cutting blade,could clear 1,000 acres a day. Enormous concussive bombs, known as “daisy cutters”, flattened forests and set off shock waves killing everything within a 3,000-foot (900-meter) radius, down to earthworms in the soil. The US also engaged in weather modification throughProject Popeye, a secret program from 1967 to 1972 that seeded clouds with silver iodide to prolong the monsoon season in an attempt to cut the flow of fighters and supplies coming down theHo Chi Minh Trailfrom North Vietnam. Congress eventually passed a bipartisan resolution in 1973urging an international treatyto prohibit the use of weather modification as a weapon of war. That treatycame into effectin 1978. The US military contended that all these tactics were operationally successful as atrade of trees for American lives. Despite Congress’ concerns, there was little scrutiny of the environmental impacts of US military operations and technologies. Research sites were hard to access, and there was no regular environmental monitoring. After the fall of Saigon to North Vietnamese troops on April 30, 1975, the USimposed a trade and economic embargoon all of Vietnam, leaving the country both war-damaged and cash-strapped. Vietnamese scientists told me they cobbled together small-scale studies. One found adramatic drop in bird and mammal diversityin forests. In the A Lưới valley of central Vietnam, 80 percent of forests subjected to herbicides had not recovered by the early 1980s. Biologists found only 24 bird and five mammal species in those areas, far below normal in unsprayed forests. Only a handful of ecosystem restoration projects were attempted, hampered by shoestring budgets. The most notable began in 1978, when foresters beganhand-replanting mangrovesat the mouth of the Saigon River in Cần Giờ forest, an area that had been completely denuded. In inland areas, widespreadtree-planting programsin the late 1980s and 1990s finally took root, but they focused on planting exotic trees like acacia, which did not restore the original diversity of the natural forests. For years, the US also denied responsibility for Agent Orange cleanup, despite the recognition ofdioxin-associated illnesses among US veteransandtesting that revealed continuing dioxin exposureamong potentially tens of thousands of Vietnamese. The first remediation agreement between the two countries only occurred in 2006, afterpersistent advocacy by veterans, scientists, and nongovernmental organizationsled Congress to appropriate US$3 million for the remediation of the Da Nang airport. That project, completed in 2018,treated 150,000 cubic metersof dioxin-laden soil at an eventual cost of over $115 million, paid mostly by the US Agency for International Development, or USAID. Thecleanup requiredlakes to be drained and contaminated soil, which had seeped more than 9 feet (3 meters) deeper than expected, to be piled and heated to break down the dioxin molecules. Another major hot spot is the heavily contaminated Biên Hoà airbase, where local residents continue toingest high levels of dioxinthrough fish, chicken and ducks. Agent Orange barrels were stored at the base, which leaked large amounts of the toxin into soil and water, where it continues to accumulate in animal tissue as it moves up the food chain. Remediation began in 2019; however, further work isat risk with the Trump administration’snear elimination of USAID, leaving it unclear if there will be any American experts in Vietnam in charge of administering this complex project. While Agent Orange’s health effects have understandably drawn scrutiny, its long-term ecological consequences have not been well studied. Current-day scientists have far more options than those 50 years ago, including satellite imagery, which isbeing used in Ukraineto identify fires, flooding, and pollution. However, these tools cannot replace on-the-ground monitoring, which often is restricted or dangerous during wartime. The legal situation is similarly complex. In 1977, the Geneva Conventions governing conduct during wartime were revised to prohibit “widespread, long term, and severe damage to the natural environment.” A1980 protocolrestricted incendiary weapons. Yet oil fires set by Iraqduring the Gulf War in 1991, and recent environmental damage inthe Gaza Strip,Ukraine, andSyriaindicate the limits of relying on treaties when there are no strong mechanisms to ensure compliance. Aninternational campaigncurrently underway calls for an amendment to theRome Statute of the International Criminal Courttoadd ecocideas a fifth prosecutable crime alongside genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression. Some countries have adopted their ownecocide laws. Vietnam was the first to legally state in its penal code that “Ecocide, destroying the natural environment, whether committed in time of peace or war, constitutes a crime against humanity.” Yet the law has resulted in no prosecutions, despite several large pollution cases. BothRussia and Ukrainealso have ecocide laws, but these have not prevented harm or held anyone accountable for damage during the ongoing conflict. The Vietnam War is a reminder that failure to address ecological consequences, both during war and after, will have long-term effects. What remains in short supply is the political will to ensure that these impacts are neither ignored nor repeated.

    "title": "DOGE could help Musk firms avoid $2.3B in government penalties, Democrats say",
    "article_text": "Senate memo: DOGE can help Musk stop investigations and make lawsuits disappear. Elon Musk's companies could avoid over $2.3 billion in potential fines and other liabilities thanks to Musk's unusual government position as the head of DOGE, said amemoyesterday from the Democratic staff of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The estimate is said to include potential liability from federal investigations, litigation, and other regulatory actions. \"Since his appointment, Mr. Musk has taken a chainsaw to the federal government with no apparent regard for the law or for the people who depend on the programs and agencies he so blithely destroys... Mr. Musk's position may allow him to evade oversight, derail investigations, and make litigation disappear whenever he so chooses—on his terms and at his command,\" the 44-page memo said. The subcommittee's investigation found that as of January 20, \"Musk and his companies were subject to at least 65 actual or potential actions by 11 different federal agencies.\" The memo said the subcommittee \"was able to estimate potential financial liabilities for 40 of the 65 actions by eight federal agencies,\" resulting in the $2.37 billion total. The memo said the 40 quantifiable items include \"$1.19 billion in potential liability as a result of Tesla's allegedly false or misleading statements about its autopilot and full self-driving features; $633,009 in fines from SpaceX's multiple failures to follow rocket launch requirements in 2023; a total of $713,114 in fines from 29 citations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) against SpaceX, Tesla, and The Boring Company; $281 million in potential liability from Neuralink's alleged false or misleading statements about its product risks, and many more.\" The $2.37 billion total does not include several National Labor Relations Board actions against SpaceX and Tesla, and doesn't include several investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into Tesla's autonomous driving technology, the memo said. According to the memo: While the $2.37 billion figure represents a credible, conservative estimate, it drastically understates the true benefit Mr. Musk may gain from legal risk avoidance alone as a result of his position in government. In addition to the 25 pending matters the Subcommittee has not yet been able to quantify, Mr. Musk and his companies could gain millions or even billions more simply by avoiding the time, legal fees, and risk of being ordered to undertake remediation efforts or change labor practices. This figure also does not include the many billions of dollars that Mr. Musk and his companies could gain in other ways, including through new contracts they may secure or the competitive advantage they may gain by collecting intelligence on competitors. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), the subcommittee's ranking member, sentlettersabout the findings to Tesla, SpaceX, xAI (which includes X), Neuralink, and The Boring Company. \"Mr. Musk's extraordinary entanglement in government investigations and significant potential liability would typically disqualify someone from any responsibility in an administration concerned with conflicts of interest... By depleting and downsizing oversight bodies through widespread firings, funding cuts, and disruptive directives, DOGE may enable Mr. Musk's companies to avoid legal accountability,\" Blumenthal wrote. In February,Blumenthal demandedthat Musk's companies answer questions and preserve documents related to each firm's interactions with DOGE. Blumenthal's letters sent yesterday said he isn't satisfied with the responses and asked for more information and records regarding regulatory proceedings involving the companies. \"At the outset of this inquiry, the Subcommittee sought information from Tesla and other companies that Mr. Musk founded or over which he continues to substantially control, including the involvement of current or former Tesla employees in government agencies with regulatory authority over Tesla,\" Blumenthal wrote. \"To date, Tesla has failed to provide satisfactory responses to [the subcommittee's] inquiries, and many questions remain about the direct and indirect benefits it may be gaining from Mr. Musk's actions.\" Blumenthal's letters to the other Musk companies included nearly identical statements. In a statementquoted by the Los Angeles Times, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung said that \"Mr. Musk has never used his position for personal or financial gain, and any assertion otherwise is completely false and defamatory.\" Cheung said that Blumenthal \"is clearly suffering from a debilitating and uncurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "2025 VW Golf R first drive: The R stands for “really good fun”",
    "article_text": "We always forget how good the AWD Golf R is to drive. I remain perpetually wrong-footed by the Volkswagen Golf R, the more powerful all-wheel drive upgrade to the venerable VW Golf GTI. I always expect I'm in for a driving experience that is as measured and calm as it is fast. I don't know why I continually underestimate the R—Arshasdrivenafewof them now, and you'd think I'd remember that maybe the R should stand for \"raucous.\" VW has been making hot Golfs for as long as I've been on the planet—next year will be the GTI's 50th anniversary. The super-GTI is a little newer. In 1986, the GTI was joined by a more powerful version with a 16-valve engine—here in the US, they also got a capacity bump from 1.8 to 2 L. Later, the much rarer Rallye Golf emerged as a homologation special. Five thousand all-wheel drive, supercharged Golfs were built to make the car eligible for Group A rallying, and then VW Motorsport built a small number ofG60 Limiteds—essentially the Rallye with some added luxury like leather, ABS, and power steering. The Mk2's straight lines gave way to the Mk3's curves, and by then, VW had developed its VR6 engine. Most engines with two banks of cylinders have a V angle of 60 or perhaps 90 degrees; with a V angle of just 15 degrees, the VR6 engine was able to fit in the tight confines of the Golf's engine bay. For the Mk4 and Mk5, this morphed into the Golf R32, where the VR6's power and torque were better harnessed by all-wheel drive. For the Mk6 car, VW dropped the 3.2 L VR6 engine and the \"32\" from the name plate. A high-output version of VW's 2.0 L turbocharged four-cylinder replaced the bigger, heavier engine, and thus, the Golf R was born. For model year 2025, the base Golf R is now $47,100, at least until next month, when the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs starts to become clear. While that's a high price tag for a five-door hatchback, it's actually noticeably cheaper than the Mk7 we tested in 2016 when you account for inflation. At a time when everything feels more expensive than ever—and when the average price of a new car rose by 25 percent during the pandemic and has remained there—that feels noteworthy. I'd be tempted by the $3,795 Euro Style Package, however. This deletes the sunroof, apparently beloved byso many US car buyers, saving plenty of weight in the process. A titanium Akrapovic exhaust replaces the standard item, and ArtVelours fabric replaces the nappa leather. Sadly, you do have to give up the seat ventilation and most of its power adjustment. All told, the Euro bits save a helpful 80 lbs (36 kg) on top of the weight saved by the new wheels. There's also the Golf R Black Edition, which goes heavy on the Darth Vader/Kylo Ren stuff with all-black everything, at $48,415. (The Euro Style Package can be added to the Black Edition for maximum R value.) The midlife refresh for the Mk8 Golf R is relatively minor. There's a revised front fascia with an illuminated VW logo, front fog lights that turn with the wheels, and a new wheel design that saves 4 lbs (1.8 kg) per corner. The Golf R's engine has had another power bump and now outputs 328 hp (245 kW) and 295 lb-ft (400 Nm), which is still sent to all four wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox. VW's 4Motion system splits the torque 50:50 front to rear, but at the rear axle, the R uses a clutch-based differential that can send all of the rear axle's available torque to an individual wheel if needed. On the inside, there's a new 12.9-inch infotainment system and a more powerful 15 W wireless charging pad for mobile devices, but the multifunction steering wheel remains capacitive—VW says it wasn't able to program the \"R\" button to work properly on the older wheel with physical buttons that it has put back inthe 2025 Golf GTI. As we will see later, that's a shame. You get a wider range of UI themes for the Golf R's digital dashboard than in the GTI, and I'm happy to report that there were no Wi-Fi issues to take down wireless CarPlay during my time driving the R. My first introduction to the 2025 R was on track at Summit Point's Jefferson Circuit, where the difference between it and the lesser GTI was stark. The steering isn't really any more lively than the GTI, but that doesn't stop it from being an engaging drive on track. I wonder if that's thanks, in large part, to the rear differential. You can feel the torque being apportioned to the rear wheel and how it is vectored in the turns to make you go faster. Set to Nurburgring mode, the dampers were more than adequately calibrated for the bumps and rough patches of Summit Point, and what little body roll you encounter is compensated for by the seat's bolstering. The brakes were also commendable and more than enough to slow the R from just over 100 mph for the circuit's final, tight hairpin. What was not so commendable on track was the capacitive multifunction steering wheel. On at least one occasion, my hand hit the R button on the left spoke while in a corner, changing the drive mode, and another time, I managed to turn on the heated steering wheel, a control that lives on the right spoke. On the road, the R rides well on its adaptive dampers, smoothing out road imperfections despite the thin bands of summer tire rubber wrapped around its 19-inch wheels. The way it gathers speed is deceptive, particularly in Comfort mode, where the engine noise is kept to a minimum. It's not quite as bad as some recent EVswe've tested, but you do need to keep an eye on your velocity—the standard heads-up display helps with that.

    "title": "OnePlus lowers Watch 3 price by $150, promises refunds for early buyers",
    "article_text": "OnePlus says supply chain tweaks have allowed it to lower the price of its new wearable. OnePlus undoubtedly hoped the release of its newest smartwatch had gone smoother. After delaying the launch, the company released the watch right at the peak of tariff drama. The watch debuted at a higher $500 price in the US, but OnePlus now says that after some adjustments, it is able to bring the price down by $150, and it's staying there. OnePlus, which is part of the Chinese megacorp Oppo, announced the OnePlus Watch 3 in early 2025. The first batch of units to roll off the line went out to reviewers, who promptly noticed that the underside featured a prominent typo, reading \"Meda in China\" instead of \"Made in China.\" OnePlus delayed the release to fix the issue. That brings us to early April and the onslaught of tariffs, which are still hanging over the US economy. OnePlus finally released the watch, but it did sowith a $500 price tag\"due to the current market conditions.\" Those market conditions are the series of frantic tariffs implemented and rescinded by the Trump administration over the past few weeks. While many of the higher tariffs have been paused, imports from most nations are still subject to a flat 10 percent tariff, and OnePlus' home market of China is covered by a145 percent tariff. Things are still uncertain, but OnePlus claims to have made some adjustments to its supply chain so it can offer the Watch 3 at a more palatable price. It's unlikely that OnePlus could eat the cost of that Chinese tariff on a wearable, so perhaps it found a way to redirect its shipments through another location with lower tariffs. A company spokesperson confirms the watch is now listed at $349.99 in the US, and it will stay at that price despite any future changes to import tariffs. This is a bit higher than the original $330 price tag, but it's not bad given the challenging market conditions and OnePlus' Chinese roots. \"This change reflects our effort to be transparent, responsive, and committed to bringing the OnePlus Watch 3 to the US at a competitive price point, despite the ongoing market conditions,\" a OnePlus spokesperson said. At $500, the OnePlus Watch 3 was hard to justify when devices like thePixel Watch, itself not exactly a bargain-priced wearable, are available for substantially less. Still, there are probably some OnePlus fans who bit at $500. The company says anyone who paid that price since the watch's release in early April will get a refund of the difference—keep an eye out for an email from OnePlus support with details. For anyone who was planning to pick up the Watch 3 and was scared off by the tariff increase, the lower price isavailable immediately in the OnePlus store.

    "title": "Massive power outage in Spain, Portugal leaves millions in dark",
    "article_text": "Cause likely not malicious; Red Electrica blames outage on \"grid oscillation.\" National grid operators in Spain and Portugal confirm thata massive electrical blackouthas hit theIberian Peninsulatoday, starting just a couple of minutes after 12:30 pm Central European Summer Time (10:30 am UTC, or about 6:30 am US Eastern Daylight Time). The outage appears to have resulted in near-total loss of electricity in Spain, Portugal, thePrincipality of Andorra, and at least some portions of southwest France. The impacts are widespread and pervasive; in major cities like Madrid,trains are not running, airports areunable to operate, and businesses and schools have closed. Citizens are still able to usecellular networks to communicateso far (most cell towers and network operations centers have battery or generator backup systems). Bloomberg energy reporter Akshat Rathiposted on Blueskythat Spanish grid operator Red Electrica claims the outage is due to \"grid oscillation,\" a phenomenon that occurs when the system is unable to suppress oscillations that normally happen as sources and load enter and leave the system. Rathiquotes Bloomberg cybersecurity reporter Ryan Gallagher, noting that a cyber attack has been ruled out, and the fault is likely technical: Initial investigations into the cause of the outages suggest a technical fault rather than a cyberattack, according to the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA). \"For the moment the investigation seems to point to a technical/cable issue,\" said a spokesperson for the agency in an emailed statement. \"Nevertheless, ENISA is closely monitoring the situation and we are in contact with the relevant authorities at national and EU level.\" Ars spoke directly to a reader named Tiago Carvalho, currently in Lisbon, Portugal. According to Carvalho, banks and supermarkets in Lisbon have been closed for hours, with a small number of shops and restaurants remaining open and accepting only cash. Tourists in Lisboa are still walking around enjoying the sunny weather, but locals are doing what they can to stock up, anticipating three or more days without power. Carvalho says only his 5G data connection is functional; when reached via Discord, he described the conditions like this: After 3h with no power, locals are starting to talk with each other and share the news from battery-powered radio. Talks of maybe 3 days without power. Local groceries shops are full as people are increasing food stock. Cash only mostly (sometimes they get connection working on wireless terminal). Lots of honking because no traffic lights. People stuck in metro and trains from what I understand have been rescued. Airport closed. Supermarkets and banks mostly closed. It’s a lovely day in Lisboa with sunny weather, but if this lasts, I fear things will complicate a bit as tourists will seek food, and restaurants have no power and no card payments.

    "title": "iOS and Android juice jacking defenses have been trivial to bypass for years",
    "article_text": "New ChoiceJacking attack allows malicious chargers to steal data from phones. About a decade ago, Apple and Google started updating iOS and Android, respectively, to make them less susceptible to “juice jacking,” a form of attack that could surreptitiously steal data or execute malicious code when users plug their phones into special-purpose charging hardware. Now, researchers are revealing that, for years, the mitigations have suffered from a fundamental defect that has made them trivial to bypass. “Juice jacking” was coined in a2011 articleon KrebsOnSecurity detailing an attack demonstrated at a Defcon security conference at the time. Juice jacking works by equipping a charger with hidden hardware that can access files and other internal resources of phones, in much the same way that a computer can when a user connects it to the phone. An attacker would then make the chargers available in airports, shopping malls, or other public venues for use by people looking to recharge depleted batteries. While the charger was ostensibly only providing electricity to the phone, it was also secretly downloading files or running malicious code on the device behind the scenes. Starting in 2012, both Apple and Google tried to mitigate the threat by requiring users to click a confirmation button on their phones before a computer—or a computer masquerading as a charger—could access files or execute code on the phone. The logic behind the mitigation was rooted in a key portion of theUSB protocolthat, in the parlance of the specification, dictates that a USB port can facilitate a “host” device or a “peripheral” device at any given time, but not both. In the context of phones, this meant they could either: Researchers at the Graz University of Technology in Austria recently made a discovery that completely undermines the premise behind the countermeasure: They’re rooted under the assumption that USB hosts can’t inject input that autonomously approves the confirmation prompt. Given the restriction against a USB device simultaneously acting as a host and peripheral, the premise seemed sound. The trust models built into both iOS and Android, however, present loopholes that can be exploited to defeat the protections. The researchers went on to devise ChoiceJacking, the first known attack to defeat juice-jacking mitigations. “We observe that these mitigations assume that an attacker cannot inject input events while establishing a data connection,” the researchers wrote in apaperscheduled to be presented in August at the Usenix Security Symposium in Seattle. “However, we show that this assumption does not hold in practice.” The researchers continued: We present a platform-agnostic attack principle and three concrete attack techniques for Android and iOS that allow a malicious charger to autonomously spoof user input to enable its own data connection. Our evaluation using a custom cheap malicious charger design reveals an alarming state of USB security on mobile platforms. Despite vendor customizations in USB stacks, ChoiceJacking attacks gain access to sensitive user files (pictures, documents, app data) on all tested devices from 8 vendors including the top 6 by market share. In response to the findings, Apple updated the confirmation dialogs in last month’s release ofiOS/iPadOS 18.4to require a user authentication in the form of a PIN or password. While the researchers were investigating their ChoiceJacking attacks last year, Google independently updated its confirmation with the release ofversion 15in November. The researchers say the new mitigation works as expected on fully updated Apple and Android devices. Given the fragmentation of the Android ecosystem, however, many Android devices remain vulnerable. All three of the ChoiceJacking techniques defeat the original Android juice-jacking mitigations. One of them also works against those defenses in Apple devices. In all three, the charger acts as a USB host to trigger the confirmation prompt on the targeted phone. The attacks then exploit various weaknesses in the OS that allow the charger to autonomously inject “input events” that can enter text or click buttons presented in screen prompts as if the user had done so directly into the phone. In all three, the charger eventually gains two conceptual channels to the phone: (1) an input one allowing it to spoof user consent and (2) a file access connection that can steal files. In the ChoiceJacking variant that defeats both Apple- and Google-devised juice-jacking mitigations, the charger starts as a USB keyboard or a similar peripheral device. It sends keyboard input over USB that invokes simple key presses, such as arrow up or down, but also more complex key combinations that trigger settings or open a status bar. The input establishes a Bluetooth connection to a second miniaturized keyboard hidden inside the malicious charger. The charger then uses theUSB Power Delivery, a standard available in USB-C connectors that allows devices to either provide or receive power to or from the other device, depending on messages they exchange, a process known as the USB PD Data Role Swap. With the charger now acting as a host, it triggers the file access consent dialog. At the same time, the charger still maintains its role as a peripheral device that acts as a Bluetooth keyboard that approves the file access consent dialog. The full steps for the attack, provided in the Usenix paper, are: 1. The victim device is connected to the malicious charger. The device has its screen unlocked.2. At a suitable moment, the charger performs a USB PD Data Role (DR) Swap. The mobile device now acts as a USB host, the charger acts as a USB input device.3. The charger generates input to ensure that BT is enabled.4. The charger navigates to the BT pairing screen in the system settings to make the mobile device discoverable.5. The charger starts advertising as a BT input device.6. By constantly scanning for newly discoverable Bluetooth devices, the charger identifies the BT device address of the mobile device and initiates pairing.7. Through the USB input device, the charger accepts the Yes/No pairing dialog appearing on the mobile device. The Bluetooth input device is now connected.8. The charger sends another USB PD DR Swap. It is now the USB host, and the mobile device is the USB device.9. As the USB host, the charger initiates a data connection.10. Through the Bluetooth input device, the charger confirms its own data connection on the mobile device. This technique works against all but one of the 11 phone models tested, with the holdout being an Android device running the Vivo Funtouch OS, which doesn’t fully support the USB PD protocol. The attacks against the 10 remaining models take about 25 to 30 seconds to establish the Bluetooth pairing, depending on the phone model being hacked. The attacker then has read and write access to files stored on the device for as long as it remains connected to the charger. The two other members of the ChoiceJacking family work only against the juice-jacking mitigations that Google put into Android. In the first, the malicious charger invokes theAndroid Open Access Protocol, which allows a USB host to act as an input device when the host sends a special message that puts it into accessory mode. The protocol specifically dictates that while in accessory mode, a USB host can no longer respond to other USB interfaces, such as the Picture Transfer Protocol for transferring photos and videos and the Media Transfer Protocol that enables transferring files in other formats. Despite the restriction, all of the Android devices tested violated the specification by accepting AOAP messages sent, even when the USB host hadn't been put into accessory mode. The charger can exploit this implementation flaw to autonomously complete the required user confirmations. The remaining ChoiceJacking technique exploits arace conditionin the Android input dispatcher by flooding it with a specially crafted sequence of input events. The dispatcher puts each event into a queue and processes them one by one. The dispatcher waits for all previous input events to be fully processed before acting on a new one. “This means that a single process that performs overly complex logic in its key event handler will delay event dispatching for all other processes or global event handlers,” the researchers explained. They went on to note, “A malicious charger can exploit this by starting as a USB peripheral and flooding the event queue with a specially crafted sequence of key events. It then switches its USB interface to act as a USB host while the victim device is still busy dispatching the attacker’s events. These events therefore accept user prompts for confirming the data connection to the malicious charger.” The Usenix paper provides the following matrix showing which devices tested in the research are vulnerable to which attacks. In an email, the researchers said that the fixes provided by Apple and Google successfully blunt ChoiceJacking attacks in iPhones, iPads, and Pixel devices. Many Android devices made by other manufacturers, however, remain vulnerable because they have yet to update their devices to Android 15. Other Android devices—most notably those from Samsung running the One UI 7 software interface—don’t implement the new authentication requirement, even when running on Android 15. The omission leaves these models vulnerable to ChoiceJacking. In an email, principal paper author Florian Draschbacher wrote: The attack can therefore still be exploited on many devices, even though we informed the manufacturers about a year ago and they acknowledged the problem. The reason for this slow reaction is probably that ChoiceJacking does not simply exploit a programming error. Rather, the problem is more deeply rooted in the USB trust model of mobile operating systems. Changes here have a negative impact on the user experience, which is why manufacturers are hesitant. [It] means for enabling USB-based file access, the user doesn’t need to simply tap YES on a dialog but additionally needs to present their unlock PIN/fingerprint/face. This inevitably slows down the process. The biggest threat posed by ChoiceJacking is to Android devices that have been configured to enable USB debugging. Developers often turn on this option so they can troubleshoot problems with their apps, but many non-developers enable it so they can install apps from their computer, root their devices so they can install a different OS, transfer data between devices, and recover bricked phones. Turning it on requires a user to flip a switch in Settings > System > Developer options. If a phone has USB Debugging turned on, ChoiceJacking can gain shell access through the Android Debug Bridge. From there, an attacker can install apps, access the file system, and execute malicious binary files. The level of access through the Android Debug Mode is much higher than that through Picture Transfer Protocol and Media Transfer Protocol, which only allow read and write access to system files. The vulnerabilities are tracked as: A Google spokesperson confirmed that the weaknesses were patched in Android 15 but didn’t speak to the base of Android devices from other manufacturers, who either don’t support the new OS or the new authentication requirement it makes possible. Apple declined to comment for this post. Word that juice-jacking-style attacks are once again possible on some Android devices and out-of-date iPhones is likely to breathe new life into the constant warnings from federal authorities, tech pundits, news outlets, and local and state government agencies that phone users should steer clear of public charging stations. Special-purpose cords that disconnect data access remain a viable mitigation, but the researchers noted that \"data blockers also interfere with modernpower negotiation schemes, thereby degrading charge speed.\" As I reported in 2023, these warnings aremostly scaremongering, and the advent of ChoiceJacking does little to change that, given that there are no documented cases of such attacks in the wild. That said, people using Android devices that don’t support Google’s new authentication requirement may want to refrain from public charging.

    "title": "In HBO’s The Last of Us, revenge is a dish best served democratically",
    "article_text": "Our remaining heroes (and us) come to terms with what happened last week. New episodes of season 2 ofThe Last of Usare premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't)will be talking about them here every Monday morning. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviouslyheavy spoilerscontained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh. Kyle: Yeah, I've said here in the past how the core Ellie/Joel relationship was key to my enjoyment of the first game. Its absence gently soured me on the second game and is starting to do the same for the second season. But I was also literally mouth agape during the hospital scene, when Ellie said she had an opportunity to talk to Joel on the porch before he died but passed on it. Anyone who's played the game knows how central \"the porch scene\" is to recontextualizing the relationship between these two characters before they are parted forever. I was hoping that we'd still get that scene in a surprise flashback later in the series, but now that seems unlikely at best. Kyle: I suppose Ellie could have just been lying to a nosy therapist, but if she wasn't, and their final conversation has just been retconned out of existence... I don't know what they were thinking. Then again, if it's just a head fake to psych out game players, well, bravo, I guess. Andrew: Ellie is a known liar, which we know even before Catherine O'Hara, world's least ethical therapist, declares her to be a lying liar who lies. If the scene is as pivotal as you say, then I'm sure we'll get it at a time that's engineered to maximize the gut punch. The re-strung guitar ended up back in her room in the end, didn't it? We're able to skip ahead to Ellie being semi-functional again because of a three-month time jump, showing us a Jackson community that is rebuilding after a period of mourning and cleaning that it didn't want viewers to spend time on. I am struck by the fact that, despite everything, Jackson gets to be the one \"normal\" community with baseball and sandwiches and boring town-hall meetings, where every other group of more than 10 people is either a body-mutilation cult or a paramilitary band of psychopaths. Kyle: We also saw the version of Boston that Ellie grew up in last season, which was kind of halfway between \"paramilitary psychopaths\" and \"normal community.\" But I do think theLast of Usfiction in general has a pretty grim view of how humans would react to precarity, which makes Jackson's uniqueness all the more important as a setting. We also get our first glimpse into Jackson politics in this episode, which ends up going in quite a different direction to get to the same \"Ellie and Dina go out for revenge.\" While I appreciate the town hall meeting as a decent narrative explanation of why two young girls are making this revenge trek alone, I feel like the whole sequence was a little too drawn out with sanctimonious philosophizing from all sides. Andrew: Yeah the town hall scene was an odd one. Parts of it could have been lifted fromParks & Recreation, particularly the bit where the one guy comes to the \"Are We Voting To Pursue Bloody Vengeance\" meeting to talk about the finer points of agriculture (he does not have a strong feeling about the bloody vengeance). Part of it almost felt too much like \"our\" politics, when Seth (the guy who harassed Ellie and Dina at the dance months ago, but attempted a partially forced apology afterward) stands up and calls everyone snowflakes for eventhinkingabout skipping out on the bloody vengeance (not literally, but that's the clear subtext). He even invokes a shadowy, non-specific \"they\" who would be \"laughing at us\" if the community doesn't track down and execute Abby. I'll tell you what, that he is one of two people backing Ellie's attempted vengeance tour doesn't make me feel better about what she's deciding to do here. Kyle: I can, and I can empathize with it. I think Tommy is right, too, in saying that Joel would have moved heaven and earth tosavea loved one but not necessarily to get revenge for one that's already dead. He was pragmatic enough to know when discretion was the better part of valor, and protecting him and his was always the priority. And I'm not sure the town hall \"deterrence\" arguments would have swayed him. Look on the bright side, though, at least we get a lost of long, languorous scenes of lush scenery on the ride to Seattle (a scene-setting trait the show borrows well from the game). I wonder what you made of Dina asking Ellie for a critical assessment of her kissing abilities, especially the extremely doth-protest-too-much \"You're gay, I'm not\" bit... Andrew: \"You're gay, I'm not, and those are the only two options! No, I will not be answering any follow-up questions!\" I am not inclined to get too on Dina's case about that, though. Sexuality is complicated, as is changing or challenging your own perception of yourself. The show doesn't go into it, but I've also got to imagine that in any post-apocalyptic scenario, the vital work of Propagating the Species creates even more societal pressure to participate in heteronormative relationships than already exists in our world. Ellie, who is only truly happy when she is pissing someone off, is probably more comfortable being \"out\" in this context than Dina would be. Andrew: One thread I'm curious to see the show pull at: Ellie attempts to blame \"Abby and her crew,\" people who left Jackson months ago, for a mass slaying of cult members that had clearly happened just hours ago, an attempt to build Abby up into a monster in her head so it's easier to kill her when the time comes. We'll see how well it works! But yeah, Ellie and Dina and their one horse are not ready for the \"Terror Lake Salutes Hannibal Crossing The Alps\"-length military parade that the WLF is apparently prepared to throw at them.

    "title": "We Can’t Get Over the Alien Easter Egg in the New Predator Trailer",
    "article_text": "The first trailer forPredator: Badlandswas released last week, and we’re still obsessing over it. The idea of having a Predator asthe hero of aPredatormovieis cool enough, but set on a planet filled with other species of badass, killer aliens? That’s just beyond awesome. And yet,those are merely the sprinkleson our obsession. The main focus is the massive, potentially world-building Easter egg 26 seconds in. Here it is if you don’t know what we’re talking about. So, inPredator Badlands, Elle Fanning plays a character named Thia. Thia looks pretty normal in that top image of her but a half second later, her eyes roll back and reveal something staggering: the logo for Weyland-Yutani. Weyland-Yutani, of course, is the evil corporation from theAlienfranchise. The one that says it’s okay to kill everyone on theNostromoin order to get the Alien back to Earth. The one that sends the Marines out to “kill” the creatures but really they’re just another sacrifice made while attempting to acquire them. The one Ripley screws over by killing herself on the prison planet. Yes,thatWeyland-Yutani made Thia. This is something we know the company does. Weyland-Yutani also created the other androids we’ve seen inAlienmovies: Ash, Bishop, Rook, etc. Even in the most recent installment,Alien: Romulus, the android character Andy has a moment almost exactly the same as the one above. Remember this? So, you may be wondering, why is that a big deal? Aliens and Predators have fought before in multiple movies as well as comic books. Yes, that’s true. However, this is our first link between thePredatorfranchise and theAlienfranchise in this new, modern era of the films. And it seems to be happening with some care, clarity, and intention. Surely, it’s not a coincidence that both Andy and Thia have the same eye roll moment. These feel like the first seeds of an Alien vs. Predator Cinematic Universe done in a subtle enough way that these things only have to pay off if the fans want them to. What does it mean, though? Well, that’s where things get interesting. It’s unclear whenPredator: Badlandstakes place but, if there’s a Weyland-Yutani android there, it’s certainly after or during the events of theAlienfilms. And if that’s the case, did the company put this android there on purpose? Are they actively searching for other killer alien species around the universe? Or did Thia just happen to end up on this planet full of them? It would be incredibly interesting if all of theAlienfilms we’ve seen with Weyland-Yutani (which, it should be mentioned, are also front and center in this summer’s showAlien: Earth) represented just one sliver of the company’s efforts to acquire alien creatures for study. Maybe the xenomorph isn’t the only target. Maybe as one branch of the company is going after xenos, another is after Predators, and another is after those giant things in theBadlandstrailer, and god knows what else. Or, if none of that is true, what will the company do if they find out about Thia’s knowledge of this vast variety of creatures? Oh, and will this connection lead to a new film where Aliens and Predators go at each other? Could it even happen in this specific movie? We don’t have answers to any of these questions but they are damn fun to ask anyway, hence our obsession with this firstPredator: Badlandstrailer and its excitingAlienEaster egg.

    "title": "Sinners Star Wunmi Mosaku on the Scene That’s Got Everyone Buzzing",
    "article_text": "There’s been enough time since the release ofSinnersthat we just have to talk about the most glorious and impactful scene fromRyan Coogler’svampire opus. The light that Sammie (Miles Caton) brings to the juke joint his twin cousins Smoke and Stack (both Michael B. Jordan) open to showcase the power of his music raises the spirits of not only everyone, there but also the energy of those who came before and who were to come after. Wunmi Mosaku, who co-stars as Annie, Smoke’s estranged wife, recently discussed the scene withthe Hollywood Reporterâincluding how it gave her insight about how Annie wasn’t meant for a bad fate. Mosaku told the trade the scene wasn’t in the film until theSinnersread-through. “The script I got two days before the read-through had the past and future ancestors in the scene, and I got chills,” she recalled. “That extra detail, I was like, ‘Wow, this man is a genius.’ Ryan is so brilliant that he took what I thought was already a perfect script and elevated it in such a way. So, when we got to the read-through, it was so powerful, and we were all in tears, especially hearing Miles sing for the first time.” Filming the scene, Mosaku said, is an experience that will always stay with her. “It was shot over two days, and the first one was the exterior at night. There was a lot of technicality because of the fire and the crane. I keep saying the word magical when describing this experience, but it really was. We were really joyful and hyped and excited on that day, and seeing all the acrobats and stunt people and the dancers just blew us away.” Moasku continued. “The second day came weeks later, and we got to talk with everyone more. There was less fire, less bugs and so many beautiful moments. I brought my family to set; my daughter, my husband and my in-laws came to visit. I just thought it would be really powerful for her to be on that set and to see these people representing her people from before and after.” “And it was really powerful. Papa Toto is the older guy who plays [a precursor to the banjo] behind Sammie, and we called him Sammieâs ancestor. So he was talking to Miles [off-camera], and what he was passing on to Miles in that moment was entirely the same sentiment that Delta Slim [Delroy Lindo] passed on to Sammie in the earlier scene. And I was just so moved that I needed to take a little snap of the moment because I didnât want to forget it. It was so meta that they were talking about where his gift comes from: the motherland, his ancestors and what his purpose with this gift will be. This whole journey has just been so powerful.” THR also asked the actress if she thought Annie’s fateâhaving her love drive a stake through her heartâwas the right choice. “Annie asked, and Annie shared with the group that this [vampiric] fate is wicked. They never see the sun or feel the warmth of a sunrise, and theyâre never able to rejoin their ancestors, which, in Annieâs mind, is part of the right and righteous cycle. And then, to forever live on earth, in a place with conflict and pain and sorrow, thatâs not her goal.” It’s a heartbreaking scene which pays off when Smoke sees her and their child as he crosses over at the moment of his own death. It’s something that only occurs once he intentionally removes the protection of her mojo bag, as many have interpreted the choice. “Thatâs a hundred percent how I read it. He has no one left. He doesnât have his brother, he doesnât have his partner, he doesnât have his baby. So what would be the point in continuing her protection? Thereâs also a bit of guilt there, because why does it work for him and no one else?” Sinnersis now in theaters. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "NY Advocates Hit the Gas on Bill to Install Speed-Limiting Systems for ‘Super Speeders’",
    "article_text": "In the United States, speeding causesalmost one-third of all traffic deaths, and these fatalities have shown a rising trend over the past few years. A handful of states have turned toanti-speeding devices known as intelligent speed assistance as a potential solution. But in New York, one such bill has seen little progress. Now, advocates are trying to mount pressure on the state’s Senate before it adjourns in June. Last month,Virginia became the first stateto allow judges to order those convicted of driving over 100 miles per hour to install GPS-powered devices preventing them from going more than 10 miles per hour over the speed limit. The state’s law came after Washington, D.C.’s Councilpassed a bill creating an ISA program for drivers whose licenses were suspended or revoked due to speeding. The movement to use ISA in the US really took off in New York, though. Last year, Senator Andrew Gounardes introducedStop Super Speeders,which would require drivers with 11 or more points in a certain period to install an ISA preventing them from going more than 5 miles per hour over the speed limit. Since then, several incidents haveinspired increased actionaround it, including the deaths of a mother and her two daughters who were struck in the crosswalk by a driver with a suspended license. As of now, the bill is in the Senate Transportation Committee. But on Monday morning, New York City advocates, including some city council members,gathered outside City Hallto request that state legislators take action. Per Spectrum News, Elizabeth Adams, the deputy executive director for public affairs at Transportation Alternatives, said at the gathering,Â “We are calling on Albany to pass the Stop Super Speeders Bill â common-sense legislation that takes the option to speed out of the hands of New York City’s most reckless drivers.” Several other states have introduced their own anti-speeding legislation,including Georgia, where a bill is just waiting for the governor’s signature. But last year, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom,vetoed the state’s billbecause the National Highway Traffic Safety âis also actively evaluating intelligent speed assistance systems, and imposing state-level mandates at this time risks disrupting these ongoing federal assessments.” Of the remaining bills, Amy Cohen, head of Families for Safe Streets, which was instrumental in New York’s push, told Fast Company that they are all “a little bit different.” However, Cohen explained that they all boil down to, “We’re not taking your car away; we’re just saying that you can’t drive recklessly. You have to get to your destination safely, and not kill anyone along the way.” There is a range of ISA systems available, including ones that only alert you if you’re speeding and others that can outright stop acceleration. In 2013, following its investigation of a Nevada crash with nine fatalities, the National Transportation Safety Boardcalled onthe NHTS to at least require the first of the two. It also asked car manufacturers to automatically install those systems in new vehicles, which isn’t impossible given that the European Unionmandatedit for all new cars last year. At the time, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said, âWe know the key to saving lives is redundancy, which can protect all of us from human error that occurs on our roads. What we lack is the collective will to act on NTSB safety recommendations.â Carslegislationspeeding Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Your Brain Data Is for Sale, Senators Warn",
    "article_text": "The fledgling neurotechnology space is filled with products that promise all sorts of utility by reading your brainwaves. Whether they actually accomplish much functionality is debatable, but they are apparently succeeding at monetizing the data they collect from your brain. In alettersent to the Federal Trade Commission, Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer, Maria Cantwell, and Ed Markey called for an investigation into neurotech companies’ handling of user data, ringing the alarm bells that some deeply sensitive and personal information may be getting sold. According to the Senators, there is a lack of regulatory guidance as it relates to brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies, which has opened the door to companies collecting and selling user-generated neural data without their clear consent or understanding. “Unlike other personal data, neural data â captured directly from the human brain â can reveal mental health conditions, emotional states, and cognitive patterns, even when anonymized, the Senatorswrote. “This information is not only deeply personal; it is also strategically sensitive.â Here’s the catch when it comes to neurotech: While devices that are considered medical technology, like Elon Musk’s Neuralink, are required to comply with data protection practices under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), devices that are branded for “wellness” purposes rather than medical ones have considerably fewer restrictions or requirements when it comes to handling user data. Lots of neurotech products occupy this category, promising to help peoplesleep betterordeal with anxiety and stressin a way that isn’t clinical but does often promote (sometimes dubious) scientific backing. As evidence of just how unclear the current data collection and protection landscape is in the BCI space, the Senators pointed to a2024 report published by the Neurorights Foundationthat looked at the data policies of 30 different neurotech companies with devices available to consumers without the approval of a medical professional. The report found that 29 of the 30 could collect user data and âprovide no meaningful limitations to this access.â It also found that only half of the companies allow consumers to revoke consent for data processing, and just 14 allow users to delete their data. There are some states where there are protections in place for neural data. Last year, Coloradopassed a billexpanding the scope of the Colorado Privacy Act to cover biological data. Likewise, Californiapassed a law in Septemberto offer new privacy requirements related to brain data. But those patches of protection are few and far between, and it’s the wild west everywhere else. The Senators are calling on the FTC to change that by expanding data reporting requirements to cover neural data and establishing new safeguards to protect consumers from having their brain data collected and sold. Whether the currentlyextremely understaffedandnot exactly consumer-friendlyFTC under the Trump administration will take that action is yet to be seen.

    "title": "Are There Any Meaningful Differences Between CMF Nothing’s Three New Budget Wireless Earbuds?",
    "article_text": "Alongside the mightier-than-it-has-any-reason-to-bebudget Phone 2 Pro, NothingâsCMF sub-brandalso announced today a trio of affordable wireless earbuds, all with active noise cancellation, starting at a dirt-cheap $49. Thereâs theCMF Buds 2a for $49at the base, theCMF Buds 2 in the middle at $59, and theCMF Buds 2 Plus for $69at the upper end. Personally, I think itâs too many models to drop all at once, and any sane person is going to needChatGPTto tell you the differences between them. But hey, Iâm here now, and Iâve spent a few hours listening to music with the Buds 2 Plus, which is something AI canât do. Take that, chatbots! Paging through CMFâs press materials, itâs clear to me that the company is hoping geek jargon like driver size, decibels, active noise cancellation frequencies, and the use of specific types of magnets will obfuscate the fact that these are budget audio products. Iâm not saying that these budget wireless earbuds arenât good, buthowthey sound is all that matters, and itâs virtually impossible to know that from a table of specs. Hereâs how the three new buds differ. First, battery life with active noise cancellation turned off: the Buds 2a last up to 8 hours (up to 35 hours with the case), the Buds 2 up to 13.5 hours (up to 55 hours with the case), and the Buds 2 Plus up to 14 hours (up to 61.5 hours with the case). Strangely, CMF hasnât shared battery life for the buds when ANC is turned onâimportant information youâd want to know for ANC wireless earbuds. Gizmodo has reached out to CMF for ANC battery ratings and will update this article if we hear back. The second difference is call quality. The Buds 2a have four HD mics and an older voice processing technology that could make call quality less clear compared to the Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus, which have six HD microphones and use a more advanced voice algorithm. And speaking of voice call quality, the Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus shouldâaccording to paper specsâreduce wind noise more effectively versus the entry-level Buds 2a. And last, of course, is sound quality, which includes spatial audio support and active noise cancellation quality. The cheapest Buds 2a wonât let you hear 3D music, but the Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus will. As for ANC quality, itâs as youâd expect, ranging from good (Buds 2a), better (Buds 2), best (Buds 2 Plus). Whether or not youâll notice any difference in noise cancellation between the three while walking down a busy street or sitting on a noisy subway is up for debate. Like thePhone 2 Pro, I only had a few hours during the weekend to listen to the $69 Buds 2 Plus. I also donât have the Buds 2 and Buds 2a to compare, so I can only speak for the top budget model. Right off the bat, thereâs no mistaking the Buds 2 Plus are budget earbuds. Everything from the plastic case to the earbuds (I received blue to test) screams entry-level. CMF basically took Nothingâs transparent $149 Ear wireless earbuds and stripped them down as much as possible. Even the customizable âsmart dialâ for controlling volume and other settings on last yearâsBuds Pro 2has been replaced with a mostly non-functional dial. It still rotates (great as a fidget toy) and thereâs a lanyard loop if you want to attach a keychain or strap to it, but itâs too bad it doesnât control anything like volume. The buds have touch-sensitive controls located at the top of their stems that you can tap or press and hold to activate various settings, like pulling up ChatGPTâs voice chatbot, controlling audio playback, or adjusting noise cancellation. All of this is done via the Nothing X app, which I’ve found to be one of the more easy-to-use audio customization apps out there. Their fit is comfortable, too, at least for me. Iâve found the lightweight buds to stay put in my small-ish ears for up to four hours of continuous listening time with ANC turned on. Iâll need to spend just a little more time with them to see how long they can last with ANC, but itâs looking like maybe a minimum of six hours.Â For $69 wireless earbuds, the Buds 2 Plus sound decent. Linkin Parkâs new single, âUnshatter,â which has bass-heavy screaming vocals from lead singer Emily Armstrong, renders mostly distortion-free at various volume levels. Pop tunes from the likes of Sabrina Carpenter and Taylor Swift sound good, but thatâs not a high bar to clear for any pair of wireless earbuds.Â Where thereâs a clear gulf in quality is the active noise cancellation. On the Buds 2 Plus, the ANC is nowhere near as good at blocking out loud noise compared to pricier buds that cost north of $100, but they work in a pinch. Like, I can hear myself tapping at my laptop keyboard and my Gizmodo colleagues fidgeting in their seats, and the ANC is turned all the way up with the volume just above 50%. On my subway commute this morning, the Buds 2 Plus did very little to suppress the train’s metal wheels screeching on the rails. My regular go-to wireless earbudsâNothingâs $150 Ear (2)and Appleâs$250 AirPods Pro 2âeasily drown out that kind of noise. Then again, those buds cost 2-3x more, so they had better have superior ANC. Generally, you get what you pay for with budget audio. The Buds 2 Plus sound good enough, but what I really want to know is how much better they sound versus CMFâs $59 Buds 2 and $49 Buds 2a. How good enough is good enough when weâre only talking about a $10 or $20 difference?Â audioCMFwireless earbuds Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "The Force was unexpectedly strong at the box office this weekend. This weekend marked the20th anniversary re-releaseofStar Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, which normally wouldn’t be a huge deal. In recent years,bothThe Phantom MenaceandReturn of the Jediwere re-released and didn’t make a huge dent. However, this weekend, something different happened. Not only wasRevenge of the Sitha hit,it was a beast, taking the number two spot among several strong releases, once again provingStar Warsis a box office juggernaut. While Ryan Coogler’sSinnershada very impressive second weekendat number one, grossing $45 million,Revenge of the Sithgrossed over $25 million, which narrowly edged out bothThe Accountant 2as well asA Minecraft Movie. It was one of the highest-grossing for a re-releaseever, ranking up there was the1997 Special Edition re-releases. And when compared to those modernStar Warsre-releases, well, there isn’t a comparison.The Phantom Menacemade only $8.7 million, celebrating its 25th anniversary in May of last year, andReturn of the Jedimade $5.1 million for its 30th anniversary in April 2023. So, how? Why? Well,Revenge of the Sithis clearly thought ofas the “best” of the prequelsand, in recent years, those films have seen a huge resurgence in popularity. That’s in large part because adults who saw the films as kids now have nostalgia for them and many never got a chance to see the films on the big screen. So those things, coupled with the fact that there hasn’t been aStar Warsmovie in theaters in six years, really just seemed to bring people out. Oh, and the $25 million domestic pushed the film over $400 million total, making it only the sixth film in the franchise to hit that number… not adjusted for inflation, of course.

    "title": "Student Rescued From Mt. Fuji Returns to Find His Phone, Needs to Be Rescued Again",
    "article_text": "An inexperienced climber became stranded on Mount Fuji last week, after climbing to the top of the Japanese mountain and losing some of their climbing gear. As if that weren’t bad enough, the man subsequently returned to the peak a few days later after having forgotten their phone at the summit. Humiliatingly, he had to be rescued again. BBCreports thata 27-year-old Chinese university student (whom authorities have mercifully declined to name) was initially rescued last Tuesday near the summit of the mountain after losing his crampons. Crampons are a kind of spiked cleat that allows for safe traversal of icy environments. He was at a height of some 12,388 feet when he had to be rescued by helicopter and flown to safety, authoritiestold CNN. However, the student then made the dubious decision to scale the mountain again a few days later because he had forgotten his phone at the top, officials said. He had to be rescued yet again, after climbing to a height of 9,842 feet and experiencing altitude sickness, CNN writes. Altitude sickness occurs as the body’s response toclimbing in elevation too quickly. Some climbers can have trouble adjusting to the more limited oxygen levels and may experience disorientation and difficulty breathing. The man’s double trip up (and down) the mountain is made more audacious by the fact that he attempted the climbs outside of the official climbing season, CNN writes. Indeed, the mountain’s website states: “The2025 climbing season is scheduled to start in early July and end in early September.” The climbing trails are currently closed, and many of the signposts have been temporarily removed, CNN notes.Â Mount Fuji is one of Japan’s most popular tourist destinations, drawinghundreds of thousandsof climbers every year during the summer months. Fuji is also an active volcano and is located not far from Tokyo. Earlier this year, Japanese authoritiesissued guidanceto the public on how to stay safe if the mountain were to erupt. mt fuji Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "AirPods Pro 2 Are Now Almost Free, Amazon Cuts The Price For The 3rd Time in a Month",
    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. When Apple launched the AirPods Pro 2 in May last year, they were top of the bill for wireless earbuds with a launching price of $249. But what distinguishes them in particular today is the massive price discount happening on Amazon: After briefly falling to $229, then $199 earlier this month,the AirPods Pro 2 can now be bought for just $169 which is a huge 32% discount from its original price(and nearly as low as the Black Friday deal). See at Amazon Such price variation is unusual for Apple products, especially for a flagship product which reigns supreme in its league. AirPods Pro 2 feature Apple’s latest H2 chip that powers superior sound and longer battery life but also advanced noise cancellation (ANC) and adaptive audio features. The H2 chip is paired with high-excursion drivers and a high dynamic range amplifier to deliver an immersive and clean soundstage with responsive bass and nuanced highs. You will also be impressed by AirPods Pro 2 intelligent noise control. The active noise cancellation has been doubled from the previous generation and removes ambient noise so that you can focus on your sound or have quiet in noisy areas. For when you just want to stay connected to your surroundings, Transparency mode simply lets ambient noise in, and Adaptive Audio seamlessly blends both modes for the best experience possible no matter what you’re doing. Conversation Awareness is another brilliant addition which automatically lowers volume when you start talking to someone nearby. Last but not least, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking provides an immersive experience with sound everywhere around you for music, movies, and games. When you purchase these earbuds, Apple offers four sizes of silicone tips (XS, S, M, L) for a comfortable fit in the majority of ear shapes. The acoustic seal the tips create improves sound and stabilizes the earbuds when exercising or driving. Both the AirPods Pro 2 and their MagSafe case are IP54-rated for water, sweat, and dust resistance and can be used at the gym or on-the-go. Battery life is still as great as before with up to 6 hours of listening time on the same charge and up to 30 hours in total when using the case. The case is also easily charged via USB-C, MagSafe, Apple Watch chargers or any Qi-certified wireless charging pad. The current 32% discount is as good as it gets when it comes to Black Friday prices, and considering Apple’s history, deals like these don’t hang around for long.

    "title": "4,500-Year-Old Burial in Peru Reveals Exceptionally Well-Preserved High-Status Woman",
    "article_text": "Roughly around the same time that ancient Egyptunited into a single kingdom, a little-known ancient society was also born on the other side of the world: theCaral-Supe civilization, also known as the Caral civilization or the Norte Chico civilization (3,000 to 1,800 BCE). Some scholars suggest that Caral-Superepresents the earliest civilization, not just in Peru but in the Americas. Researchers have made an extraordinary discovery in an ancient Caral town. Archaeologists have uncovered the burial site of an elite woman in Ãspero, an ancient Caral fishing town in Peru’s Lima region. Her skin, hair, and nails are exceptionally preserved, which is an extremely rare feature for this region, as detailed in a recent governmentstatement. The woman died between the ages of 20 and 35. Archaeologists found her body wrapped in materials including cotton, reed mats, and an exquisite panel arranged in a net over bundles of plant fibers and embroidered with macaw feathersâone of the earliest known pieces of feather art in the Andes. The woman also wore a headdress made of fibers with bundles of twisted threads. Led by Ruth Shady SolÃ­s, the Peruvian archaeologist whodiscovered Caral’s oldest urban center, the team also found impressive grave goods including reed baskets, an intricately designed needle, an Amazonian snail shell, a toucan’s beak decorated with green and brown beads, gourds, wool textiles, a fishing net, weaving tools, and dozens of sweet potatoes. The archaeologists didn’t provide an exact age of the woman’s remains, but given that Ãspero wasinhabited between 3,000 and 2,500 BCE, they date back to at least 4,500 years ago. A panel visually outlining the elite woman’s burial. Â© Peruvian Ministry of Culture Altogether, the burial indicates that the woman belonged to an elite class in Caral society, bolstering the pre-existing theory that women played an important role within this ancient community. More broadly, the discovery also emphasizes that Caral civilization achieved a highly developed and specialized culture. Going forward, the archaeologists hope to continue investigating the artifacts, including their origin and potential association to the Caral people’s health, death, and diet.Â The woman’s burial joins a host of other discoveries testifying to the Caral civilization’s endurance and cultural significance. Archaeologists uncovered two other burials of elite individuals in 2016 and 2019, respectively, less than 10 feet (3 meters) away from the recently discovered burial, according to the statement. In addition to the elite burials, the ocean-front archaeological sitehas yielded 22 architectural complexes.Â Artifacts indicate that the Caral people developed products from marine materials and engaged in both short and long-distance trade networks to access products from the jungle and mountains. Nonetheless, scholars suggest that the Caral civilization was significantly moreisolated than contemporary ancient communities, such as the Sumerians in Mesopotamia or the Harappans in India.Â Once buried beneath a modern municipal dumping ground, Ãspero and its deceased nobles stand as a testament to the enduring legacy of what might be the Americas’ first civilization. ancient civilizationsBurialsperu Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The remains are surprisingly well-preserved, which could pave the way for genetic analysis of the medieval seafaring raiders and traders.

    "title": "Rosario Is Here to Remind You: Never Spend the Night With a Haunted Corpse",
    "article_text": "There’s a moment early inRosariowhere the title character (Shadowhunters‘ Emeraude Toubia) peeks into her recently deceasedgrandmother‘s closet, catches sight of something unsettling, and backs away, muttering “Nope!” Eventually, curiosity nudges her to investigate furtherâbut you have to appreciate that initial hesitation. Not only is it relatable, it’s somethinghorror movie charactersvery rarely do; it makes you want to root for her, especially as her night with anunquiet corpsetakes some alarming turns. Rewinding a bit, by the time she’s alone (orisshe?) with a dead body,Rosariohas given us a glimpse of her perfect life. After a prologue set at a family gathering following her First Communionâwhere she has an odd exchange with her grandmother, who hisses at her “My beliefs are not yours!”âwe see that the adult Rosario (who insists on being called “Rose”) is kicking ass in the financial world, with a posh Manhattan apartment to match. The trade-off is that she’s too busy to visit Grandma in Brooklyn… or maybe she just doesn’t want to. She ignores several calls from the old woman throughout the day as a blizzard closes in on New York City, and when she finally picks up, it’s Grandma’s building super. He bluntly delivers the news that she’s passed away, and that Rose better head over ASAP to deal with the situation. With no other optionâher mom has been dead for some time, and her dad (JosÃ© ZuÃ±iga) lives miles away in Atlantic Cityâshe braves the storm, not to mention leering men, unfriendly dogs, and Grandma’s air fryer-obsessed neighbor (Late Night With the Devil‘s David Dastmalchian) as part of her journey. Rosariosoon narrows its focus to the supernatural drama that oozes out of Rose’s pastâand occasionally out of Grandma’s corpse; this isnota movie that shies away from body horror, nor any number of squirming creepy-crawlies. It weaves a mystery that goes back generations, and ties into the struggles Rose’s parents endured as Mexican immigrants. It also enfolds occult leanings that explain Grandma’s long-ago comment to young Rose, and adult Rose’s wondering of “What thefuckwere you into?” as she takes stock of the witchy accoutrements scattered around the apartment. In fact, she even googles “witchcraft” to get a little guidanceâan arms-length approach that she ill-advisedly doesn’t stick to the longer the snowy night gets. Crafted by first-time feature director Felipe Vargas,Rosariomakes great use of grimy production design and what look to be mostly practical special effects to enhance its main setting, a place so disturbing Rose figures at one point walking into a blizzard would be preferable to sticking around a second longer. (Thatdoesn’t go well.) The movie is also interested in layering meaning under its frights, drawing on Rose’s guilt over having prioritized her career over her familyâespecially considering the sacrifices they made to help her succeedâand even her culture, as we learn at a crucial moment she’s not entirely confident in her Spanish. It would be easy to become too heavy-handed with those themes, butRosariomanages a good balance between “know your roots” and “oh gawdwhatis that horrifying creature lurching from the corner?” Cult favorite Dastmalchian has an unfortunately small role, but his cool-weirdo energy is a welcome addition nonetheless.

    "title": "Trump’s Tariffs Have Come for Kickstarter Prices, Too",
    "article_text": "It’s not just the Apples of the world that are trying to adjust as quickly as possible to the unpredictable tariff regime implemented by the Trump administration. Smaller creators, including those who crowdfund their projects, are also dealing with the burden of145% tariffs on goods from China. To help offset those costs, Kickstarter has introduced a newTariff Manager tool, which will help creators add charges to fully funded projects to offset the unexpected costs of completing and delivering their final product. The Tariff Manager allows creators to apply a new tariff-related fee to backers who have pledged at certain levels. That fee will appear as a surcharge in addition to existing payments made by supporters, and will be clearly labeled as a separate line on the payment page so the backer knows that the charge is related to tariffs (and can properly point fingers at who is responsible for that). Kickstarter promises that the payments for the additional tariff surcharge will go directly to creators to cover import costs through the fulfillment process. Now, that process works well for creators (though obviously no one wants to ask their supporters for more money if they can help it), but there is a chance that backers might have issues with getting hit with extra charges that they did not pledge or plan for. Kickstarter says that backers can choose not to pay the tariff cost, at which point the backer and creator will have to work one-on-one to figure out the best path forward, including potentially adjusting their pledge or issuing a refund. âWhile this tool helps offset rising costs, we recognize that every project and backer relationship is unique,â Kickstarter said. âOur goal is to provide you with the flexibility and transparency necessary to navigate those conversations with clarity and care.â Fulfillment of projects has always been a challenge on Kickstarter, with aboutone in 10fully funded projects failing to deliver, though somevery high-profile failuresmight make it seem like that outcome is even more common. But the tariffs do add an additional hurdle, as plenty of projects are reliant on suppliers in China and elsewhere to provide manufacturing or parts. 404 Media pointed outStonemaier Games, a company that has funded multiple projects via Kickstarter, hasfiled a lawsuit over Trump’s tariffs, and offered insight into just how big of an impact the added costs can have: âWe now face a $14.50 tariff tax for every $10 we spent on manufacturing with our trusted long-term partner in China,” company co-founder Jamey Stegmaier said. “For Stonemaier Games, that amounts to upcoming tariff payments of nearly $1.5 million.â kickstarterTariffsTrump administration Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "SinnersÂwon the box office when it came outlast weekend, and it’s still holding strong in week two. According to theHollywood Reporter, the period vampire flick made $45 million domestically and maintained its top spot. Compared to its $48 million opening weekend, its take fell by just six percent, making for the smallest decline for an R-rated horror title. It’s also one of the smallest drops for a second-weekend movie with a $40 million+ opening, and last time that happened was back withAvatarÂin 2009. At $163 million worldwide, it’s currently the seventh highest-grossing movie of 2025.

Word of mouth has been pretty strong throughout the past week, and it’s likely to grow afterTom Cruisedeclared it a “must-see in cinema” on Sunday. Discussions of the film’s box office and future numbers kicked off opening weekend as various outlets positioned the movie as being potentially in troubleâa prediction that was obviously incorrect, and which drew ire from several corners of the internet. The opening weekend success prompteda heartfelt response from Coogler, who thanked audiences for turning up to see it in theaters across various formats. “I believe in cinema and the theatrical experience. The global theatrical audience has allowed me to dream, find a career, and build a more sustainable life for me and my family,” he wrote. “To see your response to the film has re-invigorated me and many others who believe in this art form.” Want more io9 news?

    "title": "After 53 Years, a Failed Soviet Venus Spacecraft Is Crashing Back to Earth",
    "article_text": "A 53-year-old Venus probe that failed to escape low Earth orbit is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry in the coming weeks. Built to withstand extreme heat, parts of the spacecraft could survive the descent and crash on Earth. The lander module from an old Soviet spacecraft is expected to reenter Earth’s atmosphere during the second week of May, according to Marco Langbroek, a satellite tracker based in Leiden, the Netherlands. “As this is a lander that was designed to survive passage through the Venus atmosphere, it is possible that it will survive reentry through the Earth atmosphere intact, and impact intact,” Langbroek wrote in a blogupdate. “The risks involved are not particularly high, but not zero.” Kosmos 482 launched on March 31, 1972 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome spaceport in Kazakhstan. The mission was an attempt by the Soviet space program to reach Venus, but it failed to gain enough velocity to enter a transfer trajectory toward the scorching-hot planet. A malfunction resulted in an engine burn that wasn’t sufficient to reach Venus’ orbit and left the spacecraft in an elliptical Earth orbit, according toNASA. The spacecraft broke apart into four different pieces, with two of the smaller fragments reentering over Ashburton, New Zealand, two days after launch. Meanwhile, two remaining pieces, believed to be the payload and the detached upper-stage engine unit, entered a higher orbit measuring 130 by 6,089 miles (210 by 9,800 kilometers). The failed mission consisted of a carrier bus and a lander probe, which together form a spherical pressure vessel weighing more than 1,000 pounds (495 kilograms). Considering its mass, “risks are similar to that of a meteorite impact,” Langbroek wrote. As of now, it’s hard to determine exactly when the spacecraft will reenter. Langbroek estimates that the reentry will take place on May 10, but a more precise date will get clearer as the reentry date nears. It’s hard to pin down an exact date because the Sun, now in its active phase, is heating and expanding Earth’s atmosphere; it’s creating more atmospheric drag on orbiting objects, causing them to reenter sooner. It’s also difficult to determine where the spacecraft’s remains will end up on Earth, since that depends on when it reenters the atmosphere and breaks apart. Generally, the chances of spacecraft debris landing in an inhabited area are low, with a greater likelihood of it falling into a remote part of the ocean. Still, uncontrolled reentries do pose a small risk that shouldn’t be overlooked or ignored. Russiasatellite reentryspace debris Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The recoverable spacecraft reentered off the coast of Brazil in the Atlantic Ocean instead of the Indian Ocean, and therefore could not be recovered.

    "title": "After 100 Days, Most Americans Hate What Elon Musk Is Doing to the Government",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk has spent the past three months helping President Donald Trump destroy vital parts of the U.S. federal government. The Tesla CEO unlawfully dismantled USAID, has gained access to highly sensitive personal data on Americans, and helped purge at least 120,000 government workers. Musk has also given his own businessespreferential treatment, creating a massive conflict of interest. And most Americans really don’t like any of it, according to new polling. Only 35% of Americans approve of the way Musk is handling his job in the Trump administration, according to polling conducted byWashington Post-ABC News-Ipsos. Fifty-seven percent of Americans say they disapprove of Musk. And if you don’t like what Musk is doing, you really don’t like it, with 46%stronglydisapproving of Musk’s job rather than just “somewhat” disapproving. President Trump fared better than Musk in the new poll, but not by much. Just 39% of Americans approve of the job he’s doing, while 55% disapprove. A poll byCNNover the weekend showed very similar numbers, with Trump’s approval at 41%, the lowest of any newly elected president’s first 100 days going back to the 1950s. Musk’s approval numbers were best among American men, with 38% saying they like what he’s doing, while 56% of men dislike Musk. But Musk’s popularity with women is truly abysmal, with just 29% saying they approve of the billionaire’s job in government, and 60% saying they disapprove. Musk’s popularity was highest with people aged 50-64, roughly the Gen X demographic, though even that generation doesn’t like him that much. Just 42% of Gen X in the poll said they approve of Musk, while 52% say they disapprove. The billionaire was least popular with people aged 18-29, with 62% disapproving of Musk and only 25% saying they approve. Musk was also extremely unpopular with those who have advanced degrees. A whopping 66% of Americans with postgraduate degrees disapprove of Musk, but there was no demographic broken up by education level that liked what Musk was doing. Fifty-five percent of Americans with no college degree say they disapprove of the things Musk is doing to destroy the government. Broken down by race, thecrosstabsbecome even more stark. Only 11% of Black Americans approve of Musk, with 74% disapproving. Only 26% of Hispanics approve of Musk, with 64% disapproving. And that shouldn’t be a shock, given Musk’s extremely racist rhetoric on social media. As for white Americans, Musk polls better, but he’s still not popular. Only 43% approve and 50% disapprove. The numbers are interesting but perhaps not altogether surprising, no matter how you slice them. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been taking a chainsaw to the federal government with absolutely no benefits to show for it. The billionaire claims he’s tackling “waste, fraud, and abuse,” but has simply been unilaterally cancelling programs, contracts, and entire agencies that he doesn’t like. Musk doesn’t have the legal authority to do any of that, but that hasn’t stopped him. In fact, Trump’s government hasargued in courtthat DOGE isn’t subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) because it’s merely advising and not making cuts by itself. That assertion is contradicted by just about everything Musk says publicly as he takes credit for destroying things. Congress alone has the power to create and destroy agencies, but as just one example, Musk has taken credit for abolishing USAID, a move that’s expected to kill literally tens of millions of people around the world, according to a recent study inThe Lancet. The study estimates that over the next 15 years, destroying USAID will cause an estimated 15.2 million more AIDS deaths, 2.2 million additional deaths from tuberculosis, and 7.9 million more child deaths from other causes. The study also estimated that there will be an additional 40-55 million unplanned pregnancies and about 12-16 million unsafe abortions. What do the American taxpayers have to show for DOGE’s actions? At least we’ll all be getting fat refund checks from all this supposed government savings, right? Nope. The Partnership for Public Service has found that Musk’s chaos in federal hiring will cost about $135 billion in firings, re-hirings, paid leave, and lost productivity, as theNew York Timesreported. And that doesn’t even count the massive legal expenditures happening right now as federal workers fight the illegal firings. All of the “savings” Musk claims to make with each new thing he destroys have enormous costs that aren’t immediately obvious.

    "title": "After an Inconceivably Long Wait, There’s Momentum on The Princess Bride Musical",
    "article_text": "Musicals based on popular moviesare familiar fare on Broadway. What’s unusual is that a movie that seems like sucha slam-dunk to adaptasThe Princess Bridehas yet to make its stage debutânearly 40 years after hitting theaters, and nearly a decade since the ball finally got rolling on creating its musical version. Well, now there’s an update that’s maybe not “storming the castle” level of excitement, but it’s at least a nugget of hope. Speaking toVarietyin a piece framed around their current Broadway releaseSmash, itself adapted from a TV series, co-writers Bob Martin and Rick Elice were asked for a status update onThe Princess Bridemusical. “Itâs progressing nicely, actually,” Martin said. “tâs been a long journey for that oneâalmost 10 years now, I believe. But it is progressing with the new composing team. I donât know if weâre allowed to name them! We can say that weâre doing a substantial workshop at the end of the summer going into fall. Weâve been working on it in various ways over the last few years, but weâre going to sit down with all the material then.” Elice added, “Stay tuned!” The word “substantial” is certainly promising. And it seems like a musical would garner more of a positive reception fromPrincess Bridefansâwho go back generations at this pointâthan a full-on cinematic remake would, an idea that’s also been floatedover the years.

    "title": "I hope Dune: Awakening's base-building get weirder and wilder than what we saw in the beta, because it's going up against decades of killer Dune artwork",
    "article_text": "Dune: Awakening's building interface is a bit clunky, too. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When I think Dune, I think long treatises on politics and philosophy, dramatic knife fights, hands melting in mind torture boxes, Sting in a speedo with glistening abs, and, of course, giant toothy sandworms. I think about the striking scale and imagination of each and every adaptation of Dune over the years, from illustrated novels to David Lynch and Denis Villeneuve's films to theDune Biblefrom the unmade Jodorowsky's Dune. What Idon'tthink of are small, square granite hovels, which is pretty much all I saw in a few hours of playingDune: Awakening's beta last week. As my colleague Chris Livingston wrote, a lot of Dune: Awakening's survival game elements mesh quite well with the sci-fi universe. Thirst is a perfect survival mechanic on a desert planet, and being able todrink the water out of the bodies of your enemies? Excellent. Fleeing in terror from the worms that patrol the barren gulfs between zones? Riveting. But starting off building shelters with Dune's equivalent of sticks and rocks in a game like Ark? Ehh, I'm not quite sure how well that fits. Take a look at a few player bases from the beta: Even that last one, which has quite a cool design, is still built of uniform gray blocks, with little cosmetic variety when it comes to colors, windows, angled roofs, different sized walls and foundations, and so on. Meanwhile, in Villeneuve's Dune, scale and texture turn giant slabs of stone into far more evocative buildings. And that's Dune art at its most grounded; thanks to my dad indoctrinating me with David Lynch's Dune when I was a kid, I have to admit my mind goes to scenes like these when I imagine what Dune should look like. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. When you first start out basebuilding in Dune: Awakening, you're limited to just a few basic wall and foundation pieces and a limited amount of space you can build in. The building tools themselves are passable, but coming from myhundreds of hours in SatisfactoryI felt immediately constrained by, well, pretty much everything: the speed at which I could swap between pieces, the keybinds for swapping between building and erasing and flipping walls around. What do you mean I can't lay down a chunk of eight wall tiles or floor pieces at a time? Do I really need to scroll through a horizontal UI instead of quickly mashing a hotkey to swap between similar pieces or pluck one from a nice radial menu? Satisfactory is a special case, though, a game wholly dedicated to building things that got years of refinement in early access. It's a high bar. But I also immediately flashed back to the last proper survival game I played,Grounded, which had more intuitive building controls and, at least at first blush, much more \"fun\" aesthetics in line with its setting. I don't think Dune: Awakening's beta was a great representation of the building options players will have in the full game. There are clearly unlockable building blocks that allow for differently shaped structures and decorations that will give these barren bases a bit more panache. This video from YouTuber TotalXclipse shows that even within the beta you could unlock enough interesting pieces to build more than a squared off bunker. If Dune: Awakening was a straight survival game, I think that demonstration would be enough to put my mind at ease. But just like Chris isdigging the survival mechanics but not sold on the MMO half of Dune Awakening, I'm left wondering how many players in the final game will go deep on the building system when they can spend fewer resources and a whole lot less time just throwing up four straight walls and a flat ceiling and calling it a day. With hundreds (thousands?) of players on any given server, how much of the desert is going to be marred by the ugliest, laziest implementations of this architecture? If it doesn't look awesome from the jump—and if the building tools aren't an absolute pleasure to use, the way they are in Satisfactory—how many players are going to reasonably decide it's a bit of a bother? I hope late-game Dune: Awakening lets players build in a variety of styles mined from the greater Dune fiction—it'd be really, really cool to see parts of the map dominated by imposing Harkonnen architecture and others anchored by the elegance of Atreides or the opulence of the emperor's House Corrino. That kind of variety would go a long way towards bringing the Dune universe to life on Awakening's Arrakis. Failing that, Awakening better at least give me the option tocarry a pug into battle.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered has nearly tripled how much Skooma you can chug at once, ringing in a new era of drug-fueled super speed",
    "article_text": "OG Oblivion: Eight stacks of Skooma zoomies (Skoomies). Oblivion Remastered: 22. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Prolific Skyrim YouTuber Bacon_ (ofI love dogsfame, among other videos) has uncovered a real fan service change in Oblivion Remastered⁠—one where it's naturally hard to tell whether it was intentional or not. ThesessionableKhajiiti stimulant, Skooma, has effectively gotten a huge buff.The effects of Skooma now stack up to 22 timesas compared to the original game's eight. In Oblivion, the fantasy drug temporarily boosts your speed and strength, tanks your agility, and permanently lowers your intelligence with each draught. The bonus is a massive 60 points (attributes have a cap of 100 when leveling, for context) and would stack up to eight times in the original Oblivion. Stacking eight Skoomas at oncein Oblivion '06 was a go-to speedrunning (and joke video) strat, with speedy players constantly slugging the narcotic to maintain running speeds nearly five times what you could manage through normal leveling. Bacon_'s discovery that the remaster lets us now stack Skooma up to 22 times, achieving a speed stat of 1,320 (over 13x the legal limit) is a real shocker. Bacon_ managed this with a master-level Alchemy score of 100, which increases how many potions you can have active at once. There's also a loophole in how the game counts the potions you've drunk that Bacon_ takes advantage of: It appears Oblivion Remastered has a separate cap for potions drunk from the inventory screen, and ones imbibed through a hotkey. After slugging 22 Skooms, Bacon_ was able to sprint from the Imperial City to Castle Skingrad in under a minute, looking like One Punch Man'sSaitama on the trackthe entire way. Comparing footage of 8 Skooms in the original game to the remaster's 22, the land speed actually seems fairly comparable, but you'd get a lot more air from even a slight incline in classic Oblivion, resulting in huge, map-clearing jumps. I'd chalk this up to differences between how Unreal Engine 5 handles physics, versus the primordial Havok implementation of the original. On the flip side, the 22 Skoom special in Remastered looks like it offers a far more controllable, usable sort of speed with less risk of death. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's hilarious in a vacuum, but allowing for more Skooma at once feels like a real treat for the fans: Skooma has long held this memetic appeal as the Elder Scrolls'goofy fictional cat man narcoticthat gives you the zoomies. Raising the cap may have even been an intentional choice on the part of Virtuous to keep up with how much more sober and realistic the Remaster's physics are⁠—Tamriel's Skooma Federal Reserve has to lower interest rates and encourage Skooma inflation in response to market conditions. It'll probably also have plenty of speedrun utility too⁠—less so for Oblivion's blink and you'll miss it any% where Bacon_ himselftook one of the first world recordsin the remaster last week, but more for full main quest or 100% runs that require more schlepping around the map.

    "article_text": "It's Temujin time. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm a firm believer that there are only ever good reasons to play more Crusader Kings, but today even I'll admit that it's a better time for CK3 than normal. Right now, to celebrate the release of the new Khans of the Steppe DLC, there's a 70% sale on the CK3 base game, and the combo's launched Crusader Kings back into theSteam top sellers. At time of writing, Crusader Kings 3 is the seventh-best selling game on Steam in the USandworldwide. On both charts, it's ranking more than 70 slots higher today than it was last week. Clearly, people are excited to make a fresh mess of the medieval era. Khans of the Steppe, as you might surmise from the title, is a Mongol-centric expansion. It adds new government styles and systems to enliven gameplay when playing as characters in the Eurasian steppe, where until now the basic structure of CK3 titles and fealties hasn'treallybeen able to map onto the nomadic Mongol, Turkic, and Tungusic societies of the era. With the DLC, you'll be able to play with a nomadic government style, based around migrating across the steppe to manage a new Herd currency that can be converted into exclusive cavalry units. It's accompanied by a host of new mechanics for managing tributary and confederate allegiances, and for generally terrorizing sedentary populations with the unfathomable power of shooting a bow on a horse instead of on the ground. As a showcase for all these new systems, the expansion adds a new bookmark—what CK3 calls its authored starting points that put you into the role of a major historic figure during a crucial moment in history. In this case, you'll be able to play as Temujin, the man who would later take up the title of Genghis Khan. Personally speaking, the expansion comes at a great time for me. I've been thinking a lot about the papacy while we're between popes. And as any rational person does when they're thinking a lot about the papacy, I fired up a new CK3 save as a Franconian mercenary captain and set out eastward to see what would happen if I got the Mongols interested in Catholicism. Results so far have been mixed; I'd made enough sellsword money while roaming across Eurasia to buy a title amongst the steppe peoples, but it turns out being Catholic tends to give my fellow vassals of the khan a good reason to try to murder me. Oh well. Surely the new expansion won't make things any more tenuous for Siegmund von Leistenburg, count ofNaushki.

    "title": "Russia accuses World of Tanks executives of 'extremist activities,' moves to seize assets of Russian publisher",
    "article_text": "Russia apparently takes issue with Wargaming's opposition to the invasion of Ukraine, but a different company is paying the price. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Top executives at the companies responsible for World of Tanks are facing pressure from the Russian government, which a RIA Novosti report (Google translated, viaEurogamer) says has accused Wargaming owner Viktor Kisly and Lesta Games owner Malik Khatazhaev of \"extremist activities\" related to Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The Russian government has reportedly seized Lesta Group assets as a result of the charge, and is also seeking to seize all of Khatazhaev's holdings in the company. World of Tanks developer Wargaming was founded in Minsk, Belarus, in 1998, but relocated its headquarters to Cyprus in 2011, and has opened numerous other studios around the world in the years since. In 2022, following the the launch of Russia's unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine, itpulled out of Belarus and Russia, transferring control of World of Tanks to Lesta Games, a Russian studio Wargaming had acquired in 2011. Wargaming said it was \"no longer affiliated\" with Lesta as of March 31, 2022. That separation doesn't seem to matter much to the government of Russia. The RIA Novosti report says the Prosecutor General's Office believes Khatazhaev and Kisly \"are part of an association that carries out extremist activities,\" a claim it supported by citing reports about Wargaming's opposition to the invasion and fundraising efforts for Ukrainians. The opposition and fundraising claims are true. In 2022, shortly after the invasion began, Wargamingfired creative director Sergey Burkatovskiyafter he voiced support for the attack, and in 2023 the company raised more than $1 million through the sale of Ukraine-themed bundles in six of its games topurchase ambulances. Those are hardly what I would call \"extremist activities,\" but you can at least understand where it's coming from: A corrupt, criminal government trying to justify (or at least camouflage) its illegal activities for at-home consumption is nothing new, after all. What's more baffling is how Lesta got wrapped up in all of this. Wargaming's Ukrainian fundraiser came well after the split between it and Lesta, for instance, and according to a separate RBC Group report (Google translated), Lesta issued a statement at the same time indicating that it was not involved in the effort. The move against Lesta may simply reflect the fact that Russia really can't do much about Wargaming. It's clearly not happy with the company's pro-Ukraine behavior: In 2022, for instance, the Belarusian KGB added Wargaming's chief business development officer Nikolai Katselapov to itsterrorist watchlist, a largely symbolic move, assuming Katselapov has enough sense not to go back. But because Wargaming no longer has operations in Russia or Belarus, asset seizure isn't really an option like it is for Lesta. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Wargaming essentially confirmed that state of affairs in a statement provided to PC Gamer. \"Wargaming made a strategic exit from the Russian and Belarusian markets three years ago,\" a representative said. \"The company disposed of its business in Russia and Belarus to the local management at zero cost and on a debt-free, cash-free basis, with no consideration to take it back. Wargaming doesn’t have any assets or business interests in Russia and Belarus.\" The RIA Novosti report says the assets of the Lesta Group have already been seized; the company said in a statement posted to Telegram that it is in full compliance with the law in Russia and Belarus, and is \"providing full assistance to law enforcement agencies to resolve all issues that have arisen as quickly as possible.\" I've reached out to Wargaming for comment and will update if I receive a reply.

    "article_text": "\"What we're doing now makes developers way more happy.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The critical and commercial success of Baldur's Gate 3, the singleplayer sequel to a decades-old RPG, has led to one unexpected outcome: the emergence of Larian CEO Swen Vincke as some sort of champion of sanity in the games industry. Singeplayer is dead?Arrant nonsense! Wizards of the Coast hassling modders?Step back, fools! And following the release of Baldur's Gate 3'sginormous patch 8, which is really, properly, honestly the final major content addition to the game, Vincke's been on something of a victory lap before hunkering down on Larian's next big thing(s). The common factor among all of Baldur's Gate 3's considerable post-release content is that, rather amazingly for a game that's done this well, none of it is paid DLC. The game's solitary piece of DLC is theDigital Deluxe Edition upgrade, which has some cosmetics and soundtrack and art, but every player who's paid for Baldur's Gate 3 gets the full experience. It's not something that should be taken for granted, and in a new interview with Gamespot Vincke is asked about the studio's attitude towards DLC and why it ended up not doing any for Baldur's Gate 3, despite such massive success. \"It's boring,\" laughs Vincke, \"is really the honest answer. We tried to be in the DLC business, talked about that with BG3… there's just no passion. \"I mean happy player, happy business, but you also need a happy developer for a happy player. What we're doing now makes developers way more happy.\" Vincke is here talking about Larian's \"crazy ambitious\" next project, whicheveryone is \"deep in the trenches\" working on. Don't expect to see anything soon: this thing is years away from even a first look. The CEO then goes on to talk about there being an internal expectation to expand on Baldur's Gate 3 at one point, before Larian as a whole thought better of it. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"We heard it's what we were supposed to do, you know: huge game, huge hit and you're gonna make DLC this and DLC that and DLC there, the money's gonna pile up! You think 'yeah we'll just make some DLCs' but then the moment that we had some time to think you realise 'what are we doing?' \"Progressive insight is not a bad thing, so sometimes you go down the wrong path and then say 'fuck it, [let's] change course.' Pardon my French.\" There are no real details yet on Larian's next game, other than that it willnotbe Baldur's Gate 4. The studio has two projects on the go, and one isan RPG codenamed Excalibur.

    "article_text": "Aside from a bump in CPU requirement, Nightreign's minimum and recommended specs are virtually identical to those of the original Elden Ring. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheElden Ring NightreignPC system requirements are out, and the good news is that if you're still rocking the same system you used forElden Ring, you should be just fine. That is perhaps not surprising, given that Nightreign essentially is Elden Ring, by way of Fortnite: \"Essentially a standalone expansion,\" PC Gamer's Wes Fenlon put it in hisin-depth rundown of the game, that in many ways \"plays exactly like Elden Ring.\" So, very similar game, very similar hardware requirements. The originalElden Ring system requirementswere pretty beefy for their time, but that was three years ago and so they're very middle-of-the-road these days. In fact, when Shadow of the Erdtree came on the scene with identical requirements in 2024, hardware writer Andy Edser described the minimum specs as \"pretty aged\" and said even the recommended rig was \"pretty low-end hardware by modern standards.\" Nightreign's CPU requirement is bumped up a bit from Elden Ring on both the minimum and recommended fronts, although as someone who played ER on a below-minimum CPU (a Core i5 6600K, with 16GB RAM and an RTX 3080) I do wonder if you might be able to play a little loose with that as long as your GPU and RAM are able to carry the day. (For the record, do not try this on my say-so and then get mad if it doesn't work out. I make no promises here.) The RAM and GPU requirements are identical to Elden Ring, and it also only requires 30GB of storage rather than 60GB, which Elden Ring demanded—I suppose most of the map will do that.

There's also a little UI button at the top of the scrollbar to the right of the world map, and you can just click on that to pop straight into the local map. Honestly, it's a fairly elegant bit of UI design, and likely meant to accommodate the Remaster's consolidated settings/character menu pause screen. In the original version of Oblivion, the local and world maps each have their own tabs in the character menu. But if (un)trained professionals like Josh and I, who have tangoed with the likes ofMulti-user dungeonsandPsycho Patrol R, were stumped, I have to figure there are more confused gamers out there who haven't discovered this little feature. If I've got one gripe with the consolidated world/local map, it's that being tied to the scroll wheel means you can't zoom out on the local map at all⁠—it just has one zoom level, and trying to pull back sends you out into the world map. But that's a fairly small complaint, and the local map remains a handy tool in exploring Oblivion's many Ayleid ruins again.

    "title": "Bethesda wants you to suggest ideas for Oblivion Remastered, so get over there and tell it to add more shortcut slots and a difficulty between Adept and Expert",
    "article_text": "Plus, you know, any ideas of your own I guess. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It is the year 2025 and Bethesda wants you to tell it how to improve Oblivion. Such is the strange and rich new world we've been plunged into by last week's release of Oblivion Remastered, whichfixed some partsof the original game's jank, lovinglypreserved others, and introduced some entirelynew bits of its own. Now Bethesda is calling on players to suggest where it (or at least, where developer Virtuos) goes from here. In a channel on itsDiscordcalled #oblivion-suggestions, players are pouring in with ideas, beliefs, opinions, andnotions. Some of them are things that, call me a pessimist, I don't think are ever going to happen, like the few people asking if Bethesda could do them a solid and just wholesale port Skyrim's combat system over to Oblivion. Others, though, seem like excellent ideas. Of the suggestions that people are making, one of the most popular is an adjustment to Oblivion Remastered's difficulty, and I couldn't agree more. Though I've been enjoying the game, the fact is that Oblivion Remastered is, well, a little easy on its default difficulty setting of Adept. I hardly take damage from anything and I struggle to find an enemy I can't kill with three arrows or a couple of fireballs. But if I knock the game up a notch, to Expert, it all gets a little too much. There's no Goldilocks difficulty that feels good to play, and that seems to be a sentiment shared by a whole bunch of people on Bethesda's Discord—over 5,000 of them, actually, judging by a quick search on my part, most of whom mentioned something about the gulf between Adept and Expert being too vast. But it's not just difficulty that people are nattering about. There are all sorts of quality-of-life changes they want, too (and so do I). Sorting your inventory by type rather than just weight, value, or alphabetically? God, yes please. It'd make finding potions and ingredients much less of a chore. Selling multiple items at once? Absolutely. Showing your encumbrance in loot menus? Almost a necessity. Oh, and just as a personal favour, if someone at Bethesda or Virtuos could see their way to adding way more shortcut slots, I'd appreciate it. Eight just isn't enough. So if you have suggestions of your own, head on over to Bethesda's Discord. I'm encouraged by this. The thing is, the channel is deliberately separate from the bug reports section. Bethesda doesn't just want ideas for fixes, it's open to making further changes to modernise Oblivion without compromising its mad soul. I'm very curious to see if these suggestions get adopted in future updates, and curious if it means we might see even bigger changes (new DLC?) later on down the line.

    "article_text": "\"I've been working on new features and improvements for a while now.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Manor Lordshas been in early access for about a year now, and while that may not feel too long at all, the medieval city builder has come a long way fromits impressive beginnings. And apparently, it still has a long way to go. \"There’s still lots to do, and while I’ve been working on new features and improvements for a while now, I wanted to give you all a quick look at what’s coming,\" developer Greg Styczeń, known as Slavic Magic, says in ablog post. \"This is not a full changelog or final list—some of these things are still work-in-progress—but it should give you a good idea of where development is headed.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together There are 13 updates coming to Manor Lords, including AI progress, approval reworks, an upkeep system, and pathfinding updates. In the future, the \"AI can build and run its small village\", approval will fluctuate less, buildings will need a smithy to help upkeep, and citizens will hopefully stop bumping into one another. However, the most exciting news is about the expansion of the development team. \"As Manor Lords has grown, so has the team behind it,\" Slavic Magic says. \"What began as a solo project now includes a group of talented folks across programming, art, design, and AI. \"Since launch, we’ve welcomed Nathan (map design), Tom and Kurtis from Flix Interactive (programming), Niklas (AI), Basia (2D art), Nicolas (3D art), and Darren and James (game design). We’re also still working with QLOC for QA needs, and more folks are helping behind the scenes, such as Daniel. And of course—I'm still here too.\" While some people mayquery the fact that Manor Lords was made by just one developer, it's exciting to see the team officially expand. This'll mean more consistent updates and more features, which is only ever a good thing. Other features I'm excited about include the UI work, simply because I appreciate pretty things, and the new graphics, which incorporate manuscript-inspired art, are a brilliant touch.

    "title": "UK government says Нет to British companies selling game controllers to Russia, to combat the use of drone attacks",
    "article_text": "\"Gaming consoles will no longer be repurposed to kill in Ukraine.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's hardly news that game controllers are used in modern warfare, as the compact, multi-buttoned devices have been used by armed forces for remote applications for years. However, with the rise of the use of drone attacks in the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the UK government has decided to implement further export restrictions on Russia, one of which is the wholesale ban on selling any game controllers to the country. As to just how many controllers Russia purchases from the UK isn't clear, despite being asked byThe Register, which reported on the export ban. But the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office is clear on what it will do: \"Prevent them from being used to pilot drones on the frontline, meaning gaming consoles will no longer be repurposed to kill in Ukraine.\" I think we can somewhat forgive the department for confusing an entire game console with a generic controller, but I'm not entirely sure how effective the ban will be. As already mentioned, we don't know how game controllers are directly exported from the UK to Russia, let alone how many are then used in drone attacks.Then there's the question about whether the UK ranks in the list of countries that manufacture and export game controllers. Whatever the answer is, I'm pretty confident that it's quite low on the list, and if the ranking is based on the number of units exported, then China will top every country by some margin. Another question that popped into my mind was about the controllers themselves. A wired Xbox pad would mean the drone would have a range of no more than a couple of metres, or the pilot would have to ride the drone. In which case, it's no longer a drone. Wireless game controllers use 2.4 GHz radio transmitters or Bluetooth, but neither of these has much range—at best, the drone attack would reach across the road. Of course, the controllers could just be plugged into the drone's control unit, which itself might be long-range wireless, so the export ban would absolutely prevent those from being driven. Well, with UK-sourced controllers, at least. 🔴 BANNED: export of video game controllers used to pilot Russian drones on the front line in Ukraine.Today’s measures will also cut Russia's war machine off from innovative British tech, world-leading software, and close loopholes exploited by Putin's cronies. pic.twitter.com/An6L3RckV1April 24, 2025 The rest of the export ban is somewhat more substantial, including various chemicals, electronics, metals, and machinery, but it does seem rather odd that the office felt that game controllershadto be included and required a specific comment about them. Russia can almost certainly manufacture its own game controllers to be used for drone attacks or, at the very least, demand that this happens, much like the proposal tocreate its own version of the Steam Deck. Whether the UK's export ban has any meaningful impact is an entirely separate debate, but the inclusion (or rather, removal) of game controllers is one that means more people are likely to be aware of the ban now.

    "article_text": "Of course, why didn't I think of that? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If the concept ofCPU deliddingfills you with dread, I think you might also be a little squeamish about this one. A modder has created a functional liquid cooling system by machining straight into an Intel CPU heat spreader—and, with the help of a plastic panel and a handy bucket, it actually works. To a fashion, at least. On the surface, the idea actually makes a whole lot of sense (viaWccftech). After all, a water block is a piece of material attached to the top of a chip with channels cut within it to allow liquid to flow through, removing pesky heat from the chip underneath with the help of a pump and radiator system. CPUs already have metal heat spreaders on top to make contact with the cooler, so why not cut out the middle man and machine cooling channels straight into the top of the heat spreader itself? That's exactly what intrepid modderoctppusset out to do, posting the results on YouTube for us all to enjoy/watch with our heads in our hands. The real genius of this design is affixing a transparent plastic panel and radiator hose fittings to the outer edge of the heatspreader, making it a self-contained water block in its own right. At first glance it looks like a nifty little solution to an age-old cooling problem, at least on paper. There are a couple of drawbacks, however: One, theIntel Core i9 14900KSused here is quite the heat-producing chip to begin with, from multiple different on-die areas thanks to its many cores. 24 of them, in fact: eight Performance- and 16 Efficient-cores. So, rather than spreading the heat out relatively evenly from those cores across a flat surface, the core temperatures instead appear to spike when the pump speed is reduced and the flow slows down around those CNC-machined channels. And two? Our intrepid modder neglected to create a dedicated cooling reservoir, instead opting to dump the fluid into a plastic bucket. It's realHeath Robinsonstuff, this. Hilarious, though, I will admit. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Well, you have to try these things, don't you? Or not, as the case may be. Given the drawbacks here, I can't see machining straight into the heatspreader becoming the new liquid cooling methodde rigueur, although it's perhaps more practical in some ways thanliquid nitrogen. And, y'know, much less effective, too. Plus, it's not the first direct die water cooling solution we've seen.EmCool's microfluidic blockappears to operate on a similar principle, once attached to a delidded chip. Still, I salute you, octppus. Through your experimentation, all of us will learn. Or at the very least, realise that the heatspreaders on top of modern chips are surprisingly robust, and that it's probably a good idea to leave them intact.

    "title": "Baldur's Gate 3's new Giant Barbarian is beating out one of D&D 5e's oldest powergamer builds, making Karlach the MVP of my second Honour Mode playthrough",
    "article_text": "Giant woman, big damage. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. With Patch 8 of Baldur's Gate 3 landing earlier this month, I've saddled myself with the accursed duty of completing another Honour Mode playthrough. Given that Patch 8 gives me the constituent parts for one of D&D 5e's oldest powergamer builds, the Sorcadin, I reckoned I'd give it a go. The Sorcadin, for the uninitiated, is a delectable entrée built on a fresh bed of one level of Hexblade Warlock, garnished with two levels of Paladin. It's then paired with as many levels of Sorcerer as you can fit on a plate. It's really the best of all worlds, with incredible burst damage achieved by pumping Sorcerer spell slots into your Divine Smites—normally, the Paladin doesn't get a 3rd-level Divine Smite until level 9. I can do that right now, at level 6. And since you're a Hexblade, you can focus on bumping up Charisma instead of your other melee weapon stats—giving you all sorts of potent control spells for when something needs to be locked down instead of straight-up melted. Or you can just use your bonus action to cast Hold Person via the Sorcerer's Quicken Spell metamagic, giving you an automatic crit on an incoming Booming Blade + Smite face-melting with your main action. It's all been going rather swimmingly, and—much to my delight—Larian's made Booming Blade work mostly as it should, allowing me to use Quicken Spell to cast it twice in one turn. The Sorcadin is almost a 1:1 translation of its tabletop equivalent, and it's just as strong as I'd hoped. Yet my Dark Urge munchkin isn't the MVP of my current playthrough: Karlach, a straight-up, no-nonsense, zero-frills, mono-classed Barbarian is. And that's because the Giant Barbarian subclass, fresh off the presses with Patch 8, is absolutely, dice-meltingly busted at lower levels. And I don't think it'll get much weaker at higher levels, either. I am currently at level 7, and I'm just about to tackle the Githyanki Creche, which tends to be the most difficult part of any Honour Mode run's early days. I'm not that worried, though, because here's how hard Karlach is hitting, right now: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The Giant Barbarian's rage doubles their rage bonus to thrown weapon attacks, and she has a Strength of 18. That means before any dice get involved, her trident's hitting for eight damage. Add 1d8 from her trident, 2d4 from her Ring of Flinging and Gloves of Uninhibited Kushigo, and 1d6 from her Elemental Cleaver ability at level 6, and that means each attack whomps foes for an average of 22 damage. At level 6. I've also given her The Sparky Points trident, which'll occasionally pop off for another d8 of damage. If she crits, that ramps up to36average points of pain. This isn't even taking into account the fact that she can do this twice per turn with Extra Attack, or that I haven't given her Tavern Brawler yet—which'll make her far more accurate,andgive an extra four points of damage per hit. Tavern Brawler and the Giant Barbarian's rage, combined, will eventually add up to 11 extra points of bonus damage per attack come level 9—which means she'll be hitting slightly harder than a character with Great Weapon Master, which gives you 10 points of damage for a gnarly -5 penalty to your attack rolls. Except in the case of the Giant Barbarian, you don't need to take Great Weapon Master, or its penalty, at all for the same results. Now, my Sorcadin has her beat for burst, even though I'm far from my final form. At the moment, a 3rd level Booming Blade smite with all the toppings does 1d6 Piercing + 4d8 Radiant + 1d8 Thunder + 4. Or, in plain English, an average of 30 damage. As I get more spell slots under my belt, I'll only outpace her further. But there are a few downsides: Oh yeah, I neglected to mention—Giant Barbarians get a free, non-resourced, bonus action punt that can deal damage and also hurl enemies off ledges, into hazard zones, or just away from Karlach so she can throw her weapon at 'em. All in all, the Giant Barbarian of Patch 8 is an absolute unrepentant monster—especially in the early game—making them a no-brainer choice for any Honour Mode run. Even when my Sorcadin's operating at its full gish-y might, I'd wager Karlach's still going to be pulling her weight with consistent, reliable damage. The Hexblade Sorcadin may one day be king, but until then, Karlach shall protect my smite-happy little Princeling through the horrors of the Githyanki Creche.

Whether or not expressions fall into the \"cosmetic\" category is also an unknown right now. In a previous Q&A, semiwork mentioned that expressions would be coming in the games first update. But whether or not these are something you permanently unlock while playing or are available right away via an emote wheel is currently unclear. I've said since the beginning that the one thing REPO is missing is little hats or outfits for the semibots. So whether I have to work my way through a battle pass gauntlet or grind achievements to get them, I will do whatever it takes to be the most dapper little guy around. Especially since I don't have to pay a single penny towards them. Plus, I like to think having all my friends wearing silly hats will make the experience less terrifying, but let's be honest. Nothing will change how much I shriek each time I come face to face with the huntsman or the reaper.

    "article_text": "You tell 'em, Swen. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm fairly certain I've been alive long enough to see singleplayer games definitely, 100%, for sure die at least three times, roughly on par with the number of times I've seen industry panjandrums declare PC gaming dead, too. These days, it's because C-suites are convinced splashy live-service games stuffed to the gills with microtransactions are the way to generate more money than god, and even though that philosophyhas taken a few knocks of late, it's an idea that's proven tough to dislodge. Step in literal knight in shining armour Swen Vincke, CEO of Baldur's Gate 3-maker Larian, to throw hands for the continued relevance and importance of singleplayer games in a chat withGameSpot. Vincke refuses to name names, but says the singleplayer-is-dead talk recently came up \"from some very high-profile people,\" and that drove him round the bend. \"It frustrated the hell out of me, because what it does is it cuts off a whole bunch of avenues, because from that side you will not get the funding into singleplayer narratives.\" It's a self-fulfilling prophecy, in other words. If the moneymen convince themselves singleplayer is dead, they don't give their money to singleplayer projects and, well, singleplayer starts dying (although you're never gonna fully kill it, let's be real). Where does that kind of talk come from? I'll give you one guess. Vincke says he hears it \"coming from directions where it's all focused on the microtransactions, 'milk-it-all-you-can' type of business models.\" And hey, he kind of gets it, a hit stuffed with microtransactions is probably gonna produce \"more revenue than you're going to get from your singleplayer games,\" but it's a leap of logic to then conclude that \"singleplayer games are not a viable market.\" After all, says Vincke, \"there's lots of people that want to play a really good singleplayer game and put money in it.\" Larian proved that itself: \"I think we've proven with BG3 that you can put in a pretty high budget and expect pretty high results.\" But if high-profile figures in the industry keep repeating that singleplayer is dead, that idea can percolate whether it's true or not, affecting everyone's chances of funding and success with singleplayer stuff. But it's not just about singleplayer projects getting funding. In Vincke's view, funding a diverse range of projects is vital to keeping games evolving. As he puts it, continuing to clone this or that breakout hit—even if it's your own—just leads to stagnation and diminishing returns. \"If you are going to just clone the games that are successful and bring those to the market and not innovate at all, then you can expect that they're not going to sell.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Vincke summons an example of the wrong kind of thinking: \"Market research has shown that there's still a market for My Little Pony simulators in which you go to a hotel in Bavaria, let's make that game. That's not the right reason for making a game.\" Personally, I think Vincke could have used an example that was less strikingly whimsical than Bavarian Hotel Pony, but I take his meaning. \"We are an example of a company that at some point had external funding from non-games-industry people,\" warns Vincke. \"If somebody would have kept on repeating that singleplayer games don't make money they wouldn't have invested in our singleplayer game, and that would have been game over.\" Baldur's Gate 3 romance: Who to pursueBaldur's Gate 3 multiplayer: How co-op worksBaldur's Gate 3 endings: For better or worseBaldur's Gate 3 multiclass builds: Coolest combosBest RPGs: The greatest you can play now One of Josh's first memories is of playing Quake 2 on the family computer when he was much too young to be doing that, and he's been irreparably game-brained ever since.

    "title": "There's a 25-year-old piece of PC hardware that's still being used in even the most powerful gaming PCs sold today. Happy birthday to USB 2.0",
    "article_text": "And it's not the only ancient bit of PC tech that's still inside your gaming rig. Well, sort of. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ah, birthdays. Love them or hate them, there's no escaping the unwavering gaze of Father Time. Except in the world of computing, where most tech only sees a handful of birthdays before heading out to pasture. There are one or two exceptions to this, though, and this year sees the 25th birthday of USB 2.0—the universal and ubiquitous connection system that we just can't seem to give up, even today. The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is older still, as its very first iteration started to appear on computers around 1996. Uptake of the new port was pretty slow, though, and it wasn't until 1998, when Microsoft released Windows 98 and Apple launched its iMac, that we started to see proper software and hardware support for it. Since I've already said that it's the 25th birthday of USB 2.0 (thanks toHeisefor the handy reminder), it's pretty obviouswhenit first launched. What made it better than the first version was the inclusion of a faster, 480 Mbps data transfer mode. It's arguably the start of the whole naming mess that USB is well known for, as the organisation responsible for it all (USB Implementers Forum, USB-IF) decided that this superfast mode should be calledHigh Speed. Why is that a messy name? It's because the much slower 12 Mbps mode in USB 1.0/1.1 is calledFull Speed. Umm, isn't 'full' faster than 'high' when talking about speed? Well, it would eventually transpire that the USB-IF is an advocate for not learning any lessons at all from mistakes, and we'd eventually be treated to thenomenclature farce that of USB version 3.0(and that's a whole 'nother story). The USB 2.0 specification would be tweaked a little more over the years, adding more types of connector designs and battery charging stuff. In terms of raw capabilities, it's been surpassed by USB 3.0 andUSB4(yes, USB4, not USB 4.0), but grab any new motherboard off a retailer's shelf and you'll often still see a couple of USB 2.0 ports staring back at you. And it's nearly always present in the form of a header, to be connected to the front IO sockets on a PC case. As to why they're still in use, it's because they're very easy to implement within a motherboard design. That peak transfer rate of 480 Mbps is very low compared to what you can get out of a USB 3.0 or USB4 port—not that Apple cared when slapping it on theiPhone's USB connection—so the little sockets aren't going to demand much of the USB controller that's handling them; that particular circuit is usually found in the motherboard's primary chipset. Perhaps the one thing the humble USB port has been most infamous for over the years is the fact that the Type-A connector (the standard rectangular one) isn't especially 'universal'—unlike Type-C, which will work in any orientation, Type-A plugs only operate when stuffed into the slotjust so. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Even now, after using the darn things for 25 years, I still do the try-it-three-times dance with my USB memory sticks. Try to stuff it—oh no, it won't fit! Flip it over and try again. Oh no, it won't go in! Flip back to the starting point and bingo, in it goes. Every. Single. Time. By the tech standards of today, USB 2.0 seems very dated—it's not especially fast and it doesn't offer much in the way of power, but it's not the only old bit of kit in your gaming PC. The SATA bus interface is also 25 years old, and the first iteration of PCI Express is hot on its heels, just three years younger. Of course, the latter is almost never used in its 1.0 configuration, and most PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 systems will only drop to version 3.0 or older when switching to a power-saving mode. It's a similar story with SATA, as your motherboard will almost certainly be using the 3.4 or 3.5 specification, and those young pups are just seven and five years old, respectively. When it comes to genuinely old tech in your PC, USB 2.0 pretty much rules the roost. Part of me wants to celebrate this fact, because I like old stuff, but to be honest, I'd much rather see it gone and have USB 3.0 as the actual minimum port standard now. USB 2.0 won't be around in another 25 years, but I reckon it'll see out this decade. See you again in five years for the 30th anniversary, then.

    "title": "And just like that, this fungal 'friend group' FPS channeling Deep Rock and Helldivers is at the top of my 2025 wishlist",
    "article_text": "Mycopunk is the debut game from Pigeons at Play, and the demo is out now. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I could tell Mycopunk and I were gonna be good friends when its developers started trolling each other in the hub area. While one dev streaming for a room of press over Discord showed off the upgrade system, another bounced around the spaceship interior firing stray rockets at our demoist. A third dev started grinding on rails in the background as a fourth tried to drive a hot rod up a wall. We all know what that's like: The antsy dance of a friend group not-so-patiently waiting for one guy to get back from the bathroom, finish fiddling with menus, or just pick a mission already. Co-op games need these little distractions to bridge gaps between the action, whether it's tossing a ball into a hoop, taking target practice on dummies, or parkouring across every handrail, ledge, and invisible barrier in the area. I take it as an excellent sign that indie outfit Pigeons at Play gets this and made its hub one big toy box. Mycopunk, the team's debut game, was born out of a love for malleable, highly replayable co-op games like Deep Rock Galactic, Borderlands, Risk of Rain 2, and Helldivers 2. Before it was a fully realized shooter backed by Devolver Digital, it was the senior year university project of some founding devs. The goal was simple: \"Let's make a game we want to play together,\" a common mantra in game development, but not one always reflected in the final product. Mycopunk, with its grotesque art style and totally unique enemy designs, feels like an exception. Mycopunk is the sort of co-op FPS that doesn't come along as often as I'd like, as basic as it sounds: You play as dusty little robots sent down to de-funk planets that have serious fungal problems. Each bot has its own abilities and movement styles that evoke the many flavors of acrobatic shooters—a cowboy with a directional dash, a junkhead with a grapple hook, and my personal favorite, a rocketeer who can fly in short bursts. A few of the bots can fill a support role, like Glider's rockets that hurt enemies but heal allies, but the classes aren't as strict as Deep Rock Galactic's dwarves. Any character can use any gun, for instance. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. After meeting Roachard, a human-sized talking roach who's also the ship captain, I wondered if Mycopunk was going to be another game about shooting hordes of bugs, something I'd never complain about, but its true villains are way weirder and somehow grosser—creepy crawly robo-organic hybrids with an armored core. The fungal-armed freaks sprout up from the ground and weaponize whatever scrap was left lying around, including the dismembered guns and blades of the deceased. You can target limbs and joints to shoot off a crawler's guns or dislodge their blades, but the only way to finally kill one is to chip away at its core until the squishy middle is revealed. It's a neat combat dynamic that makes enemy waves more than ammo-dumping on bullet sponges. Crawlers have weak points and armor plating that some guns won't penetrate, so I was always making little micro choices about what targets to prioritize and which part of them to shoot at. Do I focus on the core, or try to slice off that sniper arm that almost killed me? One caveat: We had to turn the difficulty up two notches to consistently fight the nine-limbed monstrosities that got our pulses racing. Crawlers barely registered as a threat at lower levels, and there were so few of them that we rarely felt the need to use our cool movement abilities to get around. Like Helldivers 2, Mycopunk only gets better with chaos. The demo only scratched the surface, but I'm digging Mycopunk's upgrades. Completing missions earns weapon mods and ability modifiers equipped in a way I've never seen before: Each upgrade is a pattern mapped on a hexagonal grid in the shape of chemical compounds. How much space it takes up depends on its rarity, and the idea is to use a mix of smaller common pieces and rares that snap together. The few exotic and rare mods I found could take up as much as half of my gun's total upgrade grid, but they're worth it for how completely they transform a gun's behavior. Some examples: Mycopunk is nailing everything I look for in a co-op shooter, but more importantly, it's passing the friend test with high marks. A couple of hours in, we were that demo group fiddling with upgrades, testing out loadouts, and mercilessly trolling each other before the next mission.

    "article_text": "Trust no one. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In semiwork'srecent Q&A, the question of whether or not mimics would ever come to REPO was answered, and you'll be pleased to know that it was a very firm \"maybe.\" But since this isn't really a confirmation, nor is it a solid no, no details on how they'd work or what exactly this would mean in REPO were shared. According to semiwork, there have been \"talks about a mimic, actually from pretty early on in development, but if we want to add a mimic it needs to be really interesting.\" A few concept sketches of what a mimic could look like were also shared, taking the standard look of a semibot, or \"Badbot\" as they were labelled on the diagram, and making them look as if they were decomposing after taking on the form of a player. After this stage, it looks as if there were plans for the mimic to turn into a frenzied robot, flailing around and baring a mouth of fanged teeth. Similar to everyone's least favourite enemy, theApex Predator. I imagine this is just one idea of what a mimic could look like in the game, rather than it being the idea that semiwork is rolling with should this monster ever be unleashed. Especially since the team has been considering adding some form of mimic since REPO was in development. As stated in the last Q&A video, there are plans for more monsters and possible variations to come later down the line, but it's too early to say what they will be and when they will appear. It's safe to assume that this is the same for the mimic too. Even though it likely won't be coming in the first significant update for the game, that's not to rule it out in the near future.But while mimics aren't yet officially on the monster roster of REPO, semiwork also recognised that the demand probably stems from the number of mimic mods available for the game. We've touched on a few in our list of thebest mods for REPO, such as the Mimic mod which gives monsters the opportunity to copy voice clips and repeat them back to the team, and the Wesley's Enemies mod which adds another robot into the game with the same appearance of a player. But seeing an actual mimic enemy in the game without the need for a mod would be a welcome addition.

I'm not normally one for game-themed graphics cards, but in this case I'll make an exception.Asushas announced theROG Astral GeForce RTX 5080 OC Doom Editiongraphics card, just in time for the launch ofDoom: The Dark Ageson May 13, and I reckon it's a bit of a looker. Asus has partnered with Bethesda and id Software to celebrate not just the \"legendary tenure of Doom\" but also the 30-year anniversary of Asus designing and manufacturing graphics cards. Oh, and apparently it represents Nvidia's longstanding reputation as the world's premier GPU designer, too. A trio of celebrations, then, although I'm less concerned about what it represents and more about how good an Asus ROG Astral card looks in some non-standard colours. Asus says it'll be sold exclusively on theBethesda Doom Gear store, and you'll also get a mouse mat, a t-shirt, a yellow keycard (!) and an exclusive Doom Slayer Legionary in-game skin. The listing's not up on the store page yet, but pre-orders are said to be starting shortly, although I'd imagine it won't be cheap.Not that anyRTX 5080is at this point, but still. A Doom-themed RTX 50-series GPUanda cool yellow keycard? Yep, that'll be all the monies, I reckon. Still, at least you can actually buy one, unlike theStarfield-themed RX 7800 XTof yore, which was only available as a giveaway. It's a ROG Astral edition card, which means you get the full benefit of all of Asus' cooling-related enhancements. This includes four Axial-tech fans, a patented vapour chamber design, a phase-change thermal pad, and what Asus says is a \"vast fin array\" that helps provide \"effortless cooling in the heat of battle.\" Not that theRTX 5080is known for being a particularly hot-running card, even with a significant overclock on the OC-ed Founders Edition. Our hardware overlord, Dave James, managed to pushthe chip in our FE sample to 500+ MHzwith very little effort (or any scary temperature leaps), but the Asus ROG Astral cards seem better equipped than most to deal with any \"hotter than hell\" overclocking moments.Speaking of Asus overbuilding GPUs, it's also been revealed the ROG Astral lineup has some hidden hardware. Users have noticed that the included GPU Tweak III software has an Equipment Installation Check feature that uses anonboard gyroscopic measurement sensorto tell if the card is sagging in its slot, and provide a warning if it's off-kilter by a certain amount. Yep, I couldn't quite believe it either. The ROG Astral lineup comes with an anti-sag device by default (as does theAsus TUF Gaming RTX 5070 Ti OC EditionI reviewed earlier this month, which comes with a weeny little GPU post of its own), but I'm mightily impressed that there's an actual sensor on board to tell if your GPU is on the droop.

    "article_text": "Time to get my Resi 9 fan screenplay back out. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Camera pans down to capture the back of Chris Redfield as he's addressing his Hound Wolf Squad; there's a new threat on the horizon, anevilthreat that's emerged from the BSAA using cloned humanoid bioweapons and exacerbated by some unpaid intern accidentally leaving its cage open. But Chris' elite task force won't be enough for this.Enter from stage right,Leon Kennedy, and Jill Valentine. There are a ton of rumours surroundingwhat Resident Evil 9 will be, where it will take place, and who it will involve. While my fan theory for the start of the game is admittedly a little rushed, I have a feeling that it's along the right lines as Leon and Jill are rumoured to make a return. Bioweapon experiments would also nicely follow on from the Eveline storyline, while Chris' involvement would wrap in theShadow of Rose DLC, which may take place some years after the upcoming game. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together But with no formal direction from Capcom, many fans are left rummaging through scraps like ravenous little raccoons desperate to find something in last night's trash. So it's not really surprising that players spotted what seems to be a Resident Evil 9 nod in a newResident Evil 4 remakevideo. To celebrate 10 million copies worldwideCapcom the developers \"prepared a special videoto express our gratitude to all of you.\" The video features Ada Wong ringing the village bell but instead of all the Plagas-ridden villagers stumbling sadly to the church, they're all instead wearing party hats—and even a fake nose and mustache—to celebrate the big occasion. Then as the door closes behind the last party-goer we see \"Celebrating 10 million players\" painted across it as the camera pans out to Dr Salvador (Chainsaw man) strumming his chainsaw, and maybe even singing along to the rock song playing overhead. But somehow that's not the most exciting part of the video. At the end as we see Leon standing in the village centre, presumably very confused, the camera then focuses on a sign that also says \"thanks for playing\" and \"glory to the players\". It's at this moment that if you turn your head to the side, you see the Roman numerals IX, a nine. エージェントの皆様へ感謝の気持ちを込めて記念映像をご用意いたしました。ぜひ音付きでお楽しみください。Attention all agents,We've prepared a special video to express our gratitude to all of you, which we hope you'll enjoy (with sound ON)!RE4 Dev Team pic.twitter.com/cKaS198UVYApril 25, 2025 This may not seem like a whole lot, but like I said before, we'll take pretty much anything at this point. It could also just be a coincidence, but as Resi leakerDusk Golem points out, there's no lower plank on the original sign in Resident Evil 4, so it's been retroactively added in for this video.

    "title": "This odd but surprisingly well-priced mini ITX motherboard from Minisforum packs an embedded AMD X3D processor",
    "article_text": "Its specs are far from perfect, but that price tag is very tempting. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ask any PC enthusiast 'What are the best CPUs for gaming?' and you'll get a practically unanimous response: one of AMD'sRyzenX3D processors. They work well in just about any build, from no-expense-spare builds down to compact budget rigs, so if you're looking to make your own small form factor gaming PC, you're probably hunting around for the best mini ITX motherboard to house the Ryzen X3D chip. SFF specialist Minisforum has just announced one such board, but it's an odd one, for sure. TheBD790i X3Dis a pretty cool-sounding name for a mere motherboard, and to make it even more special, Minisforum will ship the board with a Ryzen X3D CPU. If you already have such a processor then you might want to look elsewhere, because in the case of the BD790i X3D, the chip is built into the circuit board itself. (viaHKEPC Hardware). Yes, that's right—it's anembeddedsystem, whereby the motherboard houses aRyzen 9 7945HX3D, normally found inside a high-end gaming laptop. This is basically a 16-core, 32-threadRyzen 9 7950X3Dprocessor but with lower boost clocks and a much lower power limit. Where the desktop chip can reach up to 5.7 GHz and 120 W, the mobile variant is limited to 5.4 GHz and 75 W. The rest of the BD790i X3D is pretty much standard fare for an AMD mini ITX motherboard: two RAM slots, one PCIe Express slot for a graphics card and two M.2 PCIe 4.0 slots for SSDs. However, because the embedded CPU requires a specialised heatsink, there's little room on the rear IO panel for connection sockets, and you get justfiveUSB ports. If you grab a normal mini ITX motherboard for AMD AM5 processors, such as theAsus ROG Strix X670E-I Gaming WiFi(currently ourtop pick in this category), then you'll find twice as many USB ports and all of the same WiFi, LAN, and storage options as the BD790i X3D. Actually, it's somewhat better because it has SATA ports, whereas the Minisforum board doesn't. So why would you even consider the embedded option over a normal setup? Well, it's mostly about price: Minisforum is currently selling the BD790i X3D for $599, whereas if one heads over to a retailer, a Ryzen 9 7950X3D will set you back$699 on Amazon. Add another $200 or so for a mini ITX motherboard and cooler, and you're looking atwaymore money. Of course, one could pick a cheaper X3D chip—theRyzen 7 7800X3Dis now$390 on Amazon—and it'll be just as good, if not slightly better, than the BD790i X3D in gaming, thanks to its higher power limit. But since Minisforum's embedded setup is limited to 100 W in total, it'll churn out less heat. For SFF builds, dealing with less heat means having to deal with fewer fans, and it makes for an easier build. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. The Ryzen 7 7945HX3D is a better processor for content creation and heavily multithreaded productivity tasks than the eight-core, 16-thread 7800X3D, so the BD790i X3D might be useful for an ultra-compact, multi-purpose build. I personally wouldn't pick one up, though, even though I'm a big fan of the weird and wonderful when it comes to PC components. The dearth of USB ports puts me off the most, but I also prefer to have full control over my choice of cooling solution. It's possible that Minisforum's heatsink can be easily removed and swapped for something else, but then you're probably just better off sticking with a normal setup. Given how expensive PC building is becoming at the moment, the BD790i X3D might actually sell quite well, as a decent price tag is a rare sight these days.

    "title": "Skin Deep review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Skin Deep is an indulgent masterclass in immersive sim shenanigans, but lacks a standout level you'll be telling friends about for years. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Skin Deep lays bare a truth about the immersive sims we anoint to holiness: Beneath a veneer of grizzled assassins and sunglassed corpo agents, beyond the virtues of player choice and non-linear level design, is a genre by and for goofballs. The allure of a hackable computer or pickable pockets is catnip for troublemakers—a license to orchestrate pranks on NPCs who can't send you to the principal's office, and laugh in their faces. Immersive sims, in all their glory, are the sacred virtualization of shenanigans, and Skin Deep is the patron saint of slipping on banana peels. What is itA sneaky immersive sim from the makers of Quadrilateral Cowboy.Release DateApril 30, 2025Expect to Pay$20DeveloperBlendo GamesPublisherAnnapurna InteractiveReviewed onRTX 2080 Super, Intel Core i9 9900KS, 32GB RAMMultiplayerNoSteam DeckVerifiedLinkOfficial site Death by peel is only the fifteenth funniest way I've solved a problem in Skin Deep, Blendo Games' latest, built with the 21-year-old id Tech 4 engine. In theshoesbare feet of Nina Passedena, a MIAO Corp deep freeze insurance commando deployed to save crews of cats from invading pirates, I've sent guards into sneezing fits with boxes of pepper, turned soap into an explosive, flushed myself down a trash chute to make a quick escape, and subjected an entire pirate crew to ear-splitting jazz. You'd think MIAO Corp's top agent would be issued a gun, knife, or at least a leather-wrapped cudgel to drive off intruders, but thanks to the \"complications of the deep freeze process,\" equipment protocol is procure-on-site, Solid Snake-style. Such is the zany, charmingly Die Hard setups behind Skin Deep's intricate sandboxes: Nina is outnumbered, outgunned, and literally shoeless, but she still holds all the cards. It would have been in line with genre tradition to give players a gun from the jump, and I suspect easier to design open-ended levels around, but Blendo's characteristic distaste for the usual is Skin Deep's secret sauce. Nina's empty pockets constantly pushed me to intimately learn spaces and look for utility in mundane objects. There is no random tat in Skin Deep. Desk succulents are sneeze bombs, electrical conduits are baseball bats, and broken glass is an accident waiting to happen. Skin Deep nurtures experimentation with its ingenious Zoom Lens—a generous information gathering tool that lets Nina read notes, labels, and stickers from any distance. Not only were these environmental clues often funny, but they taught me everything I needed to know about what I was holding without drowning in tutorials—like how eight levels in, I finally learned that bashing a walkie-talkie against a wall makes it spark, a crucial ingredient for starting fires or triggering explosions. The complex simulation at the core of Skin Deep has a way of turning best-laid plans into predictably unpredictable Buster Keaton routines. Like the time I accidentally helped a guard kill himself. Nearly an hour into an early level, I'd snuck onto the bridge of a ship through a vent and clocked the key I needed to escape hanging from the belt of a pirate named Franklin. Minutes earlier I'd been gifted a single homing grenade—a reward for safely evacuating the crew—and decided to test its destructive power on Franklin. It bonked off his head, exploded, andnearlykilled him, but he was pissed. Bullets started flying, Franklin whiffed his shots, and one flew toward the window behind me. According to the event log—yes, Skin Deep is the sort of game that's sosystemicthat you sometimes need an event log to decipher what just happened—eight things occurred in the following two seconds: I stood there cackling for a good few seconds after the happy disaster, piecing together the layered interactions that made it possible and pretending it was all part of a genius plan. I'm still thinking about how that key just happened to smack the window seal. It's the moment I fell hard for Skin Deep, because only the best videogames consider every moving object a valid projectile. It took me back to that incredible, eye-opening moment in Prey (2017) where you learn a seemingly useless nerf crossbow is actually a clutch \"finger launcher\" perfect for opening doors, pressing buttons, and unlocking security terminals. This is a game primarily made up of nerf crossbow moments. Though maybe the design choice I admire most in Skin Deep is how it counters the \"kill every guard I come across\" playstyle that coasted me through countless Dishonored and Deus Ex missions. You see, the Numb Bunch pirate gang is equipped with jarred noggins that, if killed, detach from the body and magically return to a regeneration pad. The only way to permanently take a piece off the board is to dump their heads into space. Convenient, except the pirates have locked down all the windows, vents, trash chutes, and airlocks. That means offing guards is always an option, but it comes with a cost: You can pocket a head to dump later, but that's precious inventory space wasted. The dynamic creates a natural progression through maps as I comb over notes and PDAs to find codes that unlock ship functions. More access means a place to dump heads, but also free roam of the barge's exteriors that often hide fun secrets exclusive to the level. It's such a nice, tidy, almost annoyingly clever system. Skin Deep is overflowing with similarly small but smart touches that could've only come from the mind of someone with strong opinions about the sophistication of modern stealth games: By the time I rolled credits, there was no question that Skin Deep is among the best and deepest stealth sandboxes I've ever played in. Its only major flaw is that stealth sandboxes are all it has to offer, and they suffer from sameness. It's a symptom of a deeper problem with its story, the one aspect of Skin Deep that's disappointing on all fronts. In 11 hours, I was surprised my goals never evolved past saving cats and escaping the ship. That lack of thematic variety ends up mattering, because Skin Deep's level design can go ten rounds with all the immersive sim greats, but they inevitably blur together. Neat barge-specific gimmicks aside, they're missing a proper identity to build memories off—there is no mission that's \"the heist one\" or \"the one at a gala\" or \"the one with an annoying boss fight.\" They're all the ones where you save the cats. Nina's story is similarly sparse, happening in the gaps between missions as she works in her off time to track down the leader of the Numb Bunch. It's a fun little spy romp with slick storytelling told in Blendo's signature style of environmental exposition and mid-gameplay scene cuts, but its Bond-y interludes are entirely detached from Nina's day-to-day commando duties, and the payoff is just OK. I also would've liked more levels, but not because Skin Deep is too short. I want more because Blendo has crafted an endlessly expandable concept of insurance commandos dispatching meddlesome space pirates, which is probably why it's the studio's second game with full modding support (please hook me up, map makers). The truth is that new immersive sims don't come around very often, so I could've settled for something half as interactive, surprising, or downright weird as Skin Deep, but that's not what Blendo does. Skin Deep is peak improv problem-solving unmarred by the dour dystopias this genre is built on. A genuine one of one. Skin Deep is an indulgent masterclass in immersive sim shenanigans, but lacks a standout level you'll be telling friends about for years.

    "article_text": "Sacré bleu! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Dear reader, I'm fresh off a week's holiday—and while I wish I could tell you that I spent it tidying my apartment, getting back into drawing, or socialising with my friends, I instead spent around 50-odd hours glued to my screen playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, a game I had no idea was going to be such a banger. Which is why I'm delighted to also report that it's done very, very well. As announced byKepler interactive on X, Expedition 33 sold over 1 million copies in the span of 3 days—a little slower than something likeMetaphor: ReFantazio, mind, but still—even being in the same weight class as an Atlus game is impressive, given they made Persona, and all. Even more impressive is the fact that, despite it being on Game Pass, Expedition 33 hasalsoeaten Metaphor: ReFantazio's lunch when it comes to Steam players. At the time of writing, ol' 33 has an all-time peak of121,422 players, whereas ReFantazio's score capped out at a respectable, but still very much smaller,85,961. It's a serious testament to how good this game is, and while it didn't quite hit right with our reviewerwho gave it a 70(which I'd like to remind everyone is still a good score, the other 69 numbers aren't there for nothing) it seems to've taken the public by storm. Before you rush to the comments to ask me why \"I\" scored it a 70 (I didn't) I'd like to remind you that PC Gamer is not a hivemind, and that we're all individual people with rich internal lives and varying tastes. Also, we're not ready to roll out our Borg cube for another year—budget cuts, you understand. I'm among the raving masses. While the game has its occasional (typically charming) jank, I've found it to be otherwise laser-focused on all the good bits of an RPG with none of the chaff. I've enjoyed the fact I can nullify damage with good timing and muscle memory—which has allowed me, someone who is usually a little exhausted by high-difficulty JRPGs (or should I say, Je-RPGs) to enjoy its toughest challenges. It's also just a breath of fresh air. Its unapologetically French stylings are combo'd with a complete scrapping of typical JRPG hallmarks like MP or inventory management. Also, its soundtrack is absolutely absurd—Expedition 33 might not always feel AAA, but its OST is both an all-timer and obscenely long. I cannot begin to fathom how tired its composers are, and I hope they have a long, well-earned nap. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I'm also not alone—if we look at Metacritic, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 currently has auser score of 9.7. Meanwhile over on Steam, it's garnered 92% positive reviews at the time of writing. As someone who has finished it, and is currently in the clutches of its endgame? I can confirm this isn't just early-days hype. If anything, my opinion of the game only improved during my playthrough: If you like RPGs, if you can stomach parrying, and if you want something different, you owe it to yourself to play this thing. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Harvey's history with games started when he first begged his parents for a World of Warcraft subscription aged 12, though he's since been cursed with Final Fantasy 14-brain and a huge crush on G'raha Tia.

    "title": "'Strategists face increased pressure': Marvel Rivals devs fold under pressure from the ongoing 'Support Strike' to make Strategists stronger",
    "article_text": "\"We aim to be cautious.\" Proceeds to buff all the Strategists. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Hell hath no fury like a Strategist scorned. It's been a week since streamer Necros set off a small atomic bomb in theMarvel Rivalscommunityby calling support mains \"idiots\" and \"morons.\"Since then, Strategists have been refusing to pick their role in competitive matches. I even came across one player who flexed a lord icon for every single Strategist and then proceeded to pick Hela, which is actually hilarious. When I initially wrote about the strike, I didn't think it would amount to much, as internet crusades like this tend to fizzle out before they've accomplished any real change. However, I was wrong because I had forgotten how responsive the Marvel Rivals developers are. They've heard the complaints, and in response, they're going to make life a little easier for Strategists. Marvel Rivals tier list: Best characters for each roleMarvel Rivals characters: Current and confirmed rosterMarvel Rivals ranks: How to climb in competitiveMarvel Rivals codes: Grab free gear and moreMarvel Rivals crosshairs: The best custom reticles \"In the upcoming patch, we will enhance the damage capabilities of certain Strategists to elevate their threat levels, which in turn, will increase team composition possibilities,\" the developers said in a newblog post.Season 2 has been a bit of a turning point for support heroes. Instead of team fights being decided by the ult economy, which Strategists usually won thanks to the sheer amount of immortality ults, fights are now won by coordinatedteam-upsand dives, which often target the backline. I've already said how the newteam-up abilities for Season 2 are worryingly strong, buffing already scary heroes like Bucky and Emma Frost, and it seems like the Strategists have taken the brunt of this. Alongside flankers like Iron Fist getting a substantial buff at the start of the season, it's been a lot to deal with. So, alongside the upcoming Strategist buff, the developers also announced a couple of character reworks. \"We will make minor adjustments to a few heroes. For example, Groot and Captain America will see slight reductions in survivability. Spider-Man's Amazing Combo damage range will be slightly decreased, Doctor Strange will require less energy for his ultimate, and Winter Soldier's Tainted Voltage and Team-Up Ability will be slightly buffed.\" Despite all these changes, the developers admit that they \"aim to be cautious\" as they will keep \"changes to a minimum to enhance the experience of certain heroes without drastically altering the overall meta.\" But the issue is bigger than just a couple of balance changes, and I think it'll need more than a few hero nerfs to fix it. Since the very beginning, Marvel Rivals devs have shouted from the rooftops about how\"We balance for fun, first and foremost.\"Competitive balancing has always taken a backseat, as developers have prioritised casual fun play over anything serious. That's part of Marvel Rivals' charm and what sets it apart from other team shooters likeOverwatch 2, which take a more rigid and methodical approach to balancing heroes primarily for competitive play. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Marvel Rivals' silliness is why I no longer really play it. I prefer games that have a more competitive edge, but that doesn't mean it should change; there's clearly a massive audience who appreciate it, and it's working for them. But the trade-off for balancing for fun is an unbalanced competitive scene, which is always detrimental to someone. This could be Strategists mains who are at the mercy of overpowered divers or damage heroes that can have their ults negated by immortality ults or get slapped by an op Luna Snow. \"If everyone's broken, no one's broken\" mentality doesn't really work for ranked play, where the stakes are higher and players can more readily exploit truly overpowered characters. Marvel Rivals can either be a silly game with a load of overpowered heroes and abilities, which is fun for casual and absolutely hell for competitive play, or it can take a more serious approach to balancing heroes and metas, start nerfing and counterbalancing and prioritise its competitive play, but I don't think it can do both. With that said, I'm still excited to see what the devs do withUltron for Season 2.5, and it'll definitely be a hero who I'll enjoy taking for a spin. In the safety of casual play, of course.

    "title": "Microsoft Recall finally launches for AI PC users, along with some other new features, almost one year after Copilot+ was announced",
    "article_text": "If you don't have a Copilot+ PC, then no new stuff for you, which is a shame, as the improved search feature does look good. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At the end of May, it will be exactly one year since Microsoft announced itsCopilot+ AI PC initiative, an ecosystem for AI-infused Windows installed on Qualcomm Snapdragon X-powered laptops. One of its biggest features was an all-seeing, all-remembering AI database called Recall, but after numerous concerns over safety and security, Recall was recalled into beta. Just in time for the anniversary, though, Recall is now back on the scene. News of the fresh update for Copilot+ PCs was issued onMicrosoft's Windows blogby its corporate vice president of Windows experiences, Navjot Virk, who started by extoling the virtues and success of the AI PC ecosystem. \"Copilot+ PCs have blazed a trail in personal computing, redefining what it means to be a premium PC with unparalleled features, performance and security out of the box,\" writes Virk. \"We’ve been blown away by the early reception – we’ve never seen a faster adoption of a new category. 15% of premium-priced laptops in the U.S. during the holiday quarter were Copilot+ PCs and we expect the majority of the PCs sold in the next several years to be Copilot+ PCs.\" 15% doesn't sound like a significant slice of the laptop market to me. Still, I'm not surprised it's not much higher, as the 'premium-priced' sector primarily consists of high-end gaming systems and Apple Macbooks—the former typically don't use CPUs that meet Microsoft's Copilot+ AI requirements; the latter only supports the Copilot app, not the full 'plus' system. Anyway, if you are one of the very few Copilot+ AI PC users out there, updating Windows should now give you a couple of new AI features, the most notable being Recall. I don't mean notable because it's brilliant or rubbish at doing its job—I've honestly not tried it, so I can't comment on how well it runs—but notable over the amount of controversy it's generated since being announced last May. Recall takesregular snapshots of your desktop and stores them in a database. Want to find an old document that you can't remember where you saved it or what you called it? Use Recall to find it. And since it's recording the whole desktop, and not just a specific application, it can recall information from webpages, programs, photos and videos. Microsoft reckons it has solved everyone's concerns over the security and privacy of this database: \"We’ve implemented extensive security considerations, such as Windows Hello sign-in, data encryption and isolation in Recall to help keep your data safe and secure. Recall data is processed locally on your device, meaning it is not sent to the cloud and is not shared with Microsoft and Microsoft will not share your data with third parties.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. If the idea of having a Big Brother-style database on your PC is giving you the heebie-jeebies, then apparently you needn't fret: first of all, Recall is anopt-infeature, and secondly, it can be completely removed. Personally, I'm not sold on Recall, partly because I've not tried it yet, but mostly because I'm not the target audience for the feature. I meticulously organise all my files, and I typically name them to make it much easier to search for specific content. If you're not quite as pedantic about doing all that as I am, Recall could be what you want. But there's something else that's new on Copilot+ PCs that makes me wonder whether Recall is going to be all that great anyway, and it's the improved Windows search mechanism (read Microsoft's old blog here). Powered by AI, you can search for stuff just by describing it, rather than having to hunt for the file name. No data scraping, no 'is-this-really-safe' database, justyourfiles being searched via an AI algorithm. Windows 11 review: What we think of the latest OS.How to install Windows 11: Our guide to a secure install.Windows 11 TPM requirement: Strict OS security. Well, not quite, as the use of what Microsoft calls 'semantic searching' does create a database of the file indexing on your machine, but that seems far less invasive than Recall to me. If you don't have a PC that meets Microsoft's Copilot+ requirements, then none of this will be coming to your Windows installation. That's because your rig's CPU needs to have a neural processing unit (NPU) rated to 40 TOPS. Because of the way that Microsoft handles all of that (essentially by ignoring what your GPU can do), the new Copilot+ AI features are currently exclusive to PCs with Qualcomm Snapdragon X processors, withAMD RyzenAI 300 series and Intel Core Ultra 200V series chips getting the nod later in the year. The rest of us mere mortals with the common-or-garden variety of Windows 11 will have to make do with just using our brains. How very old-fashioned.

He went on to do the same at Madonion, helping to write the help files for 3DMark and PCMark. After a short stint working at Beyond3D.com, Nick joined Futuremark (MadOnion rebranded) full-time, as editor-in-chief for its gaming and hardware section, YouGamers. After the site shutdown, he became an engineering and computing lecturer for many years, but missed the writing bug. Cue four years at TechSpot.com and over 100 long articles on anything and everything. He freely admits to being far too obsessed with GPUs and open world grindy RPGs, but who isn't these days?

    "title": "AMD's RX 9000M-series mobile GPUs are rumoured to top out with an RX 9080M featuring 64 CUs and 16 GB of VRAM",
    "article_text": "The desktop cards certainly caused a splash, so what do we make of the mobile variants? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ah, it feels good to be writing about some fresh GPU rumours again, rather than opining on the prices of the ones we already know about. Known leakerAll the Wattshas posted a rundown of what is rumoured to be the AMD mobile GPU lineup for this generation on X—starting out with the RX 9080M, said to be a 64 Compute Unit mobile GPU with what looks to be 16 GB of VRAM and 64 MB of L3 cache. Or it could have 64 lollipops, 16 ice creams, and 64 jelly sweets (viaVideocardz). The formatting here could be clearer, but those numbers would line up with the top GPU in the RX 9000-series desktop stack, theRX 9070 XT. That's quite the performant graphics cruncher, although what wattage this mobile variant might run at is still up for debate. 🤔🤷🏾9️⃣0️⃣8️⃣0️⃣M 6️⃣4️⃣ 1️⃣6️⃣ 6️⃣4️⃣9️⃣0️⃣7️⃣0️⃣M XT 4️⃣8️⃣ 1️⃣2️⃣ 4️⃣8️⃣9️⃣0️⃣7️⃣0️⃣M 3️⃣2️⃣ 8️⃣ 3️⃣2️⃣9️⃣0️⃣7️⃣0️⃣S 3️⃣2️⃣ 8️⃣ 3️⃣2️⃣9️⃣0️⃣6️⃣0️⃣M 2️⃣8️⃣ 8️⃣ 3️⃣2️⃣9️⃣0️⃣6️⃣0️⃣S 2️⃣8️⃣ 8️⃣ 3️⃣2️⃣April 25, 2025 Underneath that is the rumoured RX 9070M, said to have 48 CUs, 12 GB of VRAM, and 48 MB of L3 cache, which would match the specs of the China-only (for now, at least)RX 9070 GRE, which has now turned up for pre-orders on the AMD website afterleaks of its existencecame out last week. After that comes the RX 9070M and RX 9060M, lower spec 8 GB GPUs expected to use the Navi 44 GPU, with reported \"S\" variants. That's presumably indicative of lower-wattage models, similar to Nvidia's Max-Q mobile GPUs of old. Should these rumoured mobile GPUs be on their way in the near future, it'd seem likely that AMD's recently-announcedpress conference at Computex 2025on May 21 would be the time and place to unveil them, although that's all speculation for now. Still, the event promises the announcement of \"key products and technology advancements across gaming, AI PC, and enterprise\", so it seems a fair bet we'll get some more concrete details then. Or not, if AMD'sCES 2025 RX 9000-series announcementis any indicator. We were briefed on some of the specs of the new desktop cards beforehand, but the presentation itself amounted to a minimal amount of info. I'll be at Computex in person again this year, so it'll be interesting to see if the new mobile GPUs make a full appearance among all the inevitable AI feature announcements I've come to love so dearly. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's also interesting to see the RX 9080 nomenclature rolled out for a mobile GPU, of all things. I'm not expecting AMD to announce an RX 9080 desktop card (after AMD graphics chief Jack Huyhn made it very clear that this generation wasaiming for the mid-range), but stranger things have happened. As for whether we'll see the new mobile chips in many gaming laptops? That's unclear, too. The RX 9000-series desktop cards have been popular, so it's reasonable to think that AMD will be hoping some of that shine will rub off on the mobile variants—although whether laptop vendors adopt AMD GPUs en masse remains to be seen. And what of the RX 9060 desktop cards? AMD confirmed that multiple\"RX 9060 products\"would be arriving in the second quarter of this year, which would suggest we might see an entry-level desktop GPU at Computex, too. Something to give theRX 5060andRX 5060 Tisome serious competition at the budget end of the market? I'm hoping so, at the very least.

    "title": "Ultra-faithful Oblivion Remastered inexplicably fouls up a key bit of Dark Brotherhood lore with a gussied-up door texture",
    "article_text": "They're, uh, adopted. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If there's a single word you can use to describe Oblivion Remastered, it's 'faithful'. Thesecret glitched doorthat lets you skip the game? Still there. Thevoice acting flubs? Preserved for eternity. Its horrible levelled loot system? Untouched (except by modders). It's all just as you remember it except everyone is ugly in 4K now, so imagine my surprise whenattentive Reddit usersnoticed it had—for no apparent reason—mucked up a crucial bit of the Dark Brotherhood's background lore with a new fancy door texture on the faction's Cheydinhal sanctuary entrance. You almost certainly know this door. It's the one that asks you \"What is the colour of night?\" when you first show up to join the Brotherhood's merry band of serial slaughterers. In original Oblivion, it was emblazoned with a relief that showed an episode from Dark Brotherhood history: the Night Mother murdering the five children that she conceived with Sithis—the deification of chaos, change, and the void that the Dark Brotherhood worships (and whom its members won't stop banging on about). It's this event that really peeved off her neighbours, leading them to kill her and turn her into the sinister, whispery, and immortal Night Mother—eternal leader of the Brotherhood as a whole—that we all know and love. That same relief is there in New-blivion, but there's been a bizarre and unexplained change: the Night Mother now has two extra kids. Where the original had her brandishing a knife at four of her offspring while cradling a fifth in her arms, there are now six doomed bairns standing, plus the one she's carrying. You can see a comparison between the OG and the new sanctuary door below. Where did these new children come from? What do they represent? Are they just some pals from school who chose a real bad night to have a sleep-over? These are the questions I am left with. Well, not the only questions. I'm curious as to how slip-ups like this happen, given that the devs were doubtlessly working off the original door as a reference. Maybe something about the original layout didn't quite work at a higher resolution, or didn't appeal to a particular artist's sensibilities? Maybe someone at Virtuos was just really tired and miscounted. I've been there. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Anyway, I've reached out to Bethesda to ask if this is an intentional retcon to existing Elder Scrolls lore or if this is just a rare example of a slip-up on the part of the remaster, and I'll update if I hear back. As an aside, I've gotta echo Reddit's complaints about the door losing a lot of its ambience in the remaster. The foreboding red glow of the original was iconic, and I only hope that Virtuos and Bethesda restore it in a future patch for the re-do.

    "article_text": "What's wrong babe, you've barely touched your green milk. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A Minecraft Movie has proven an enormous success, thanks in no small part to an all-out marketing blitz that's seen the game popping up everywhere from McDonalds to Monster Munch. One tie-in might make you pause for thought, however: Minecraft \"Vanilla Green Lowfat Milk\", which is also known as Creeper milk. The product is being made by TruMoo (alongside a Minecraft chocolate milk) and is available in the US until June 30 (thanks, GameSpot). It also uses \"petroleum-based synthetic dyes\" to get that distinctive hue: Minecraft Vanilla Green milk contains a food dye known as Blue No. 1, which is scheduled to be phased out of foodstuffs by the end of 2026. Blue No. 1 is one of various synthetic colourings being targeted by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), because of concerns over potential links to behavioural changes in kids including hyperactivity and allergic reactions. \"For too long, some food producers have been feeding Americans petroleum-based chemicals without their knowledge or consent,\"said US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. \"These poisonous compounds offer no nutritional benefit and pose real, measurable dangers to our children’s health and development. That era is coming to an end. We’re restoring gold-standard science, applying common sense, and beginning to earn back the public’s trust. And we’re doing it by working with industry to get these toxic dyes out of the foods our families eat every day.\" The FDA's goal is to make the food industry switch to natural alternatives. \"Today, the FDA is asking food companies to substitute petrochemical dyes with natural ingredients for American children as they already do in Europe and Canada,\" said FDA Commissioner Marty Makary. \"We have a new epidemic of childhood diabetes, obesity, depression, and ADHD. Given the growing concerns of doctors and parents about the potential role of petroleum-based food dyes, we should not be taking risks and do everything possible to safeguard the health of our children.\" Perhaps it needs saying, but Creeper milk is not a thing in Minecraft or indeed in A Minecraft Movie.

    "article_text": "Return of the posting dead. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Tear down the bunting, Tumblr users, it seemsreports of 4chan's demisewere premature. Earlier in April, a hack of the infamous edgelord imageboard perpetrated by someone from a rival board called Soyjack.party forced 4chan offline and resulted in its anonymity being peeled away. Now it's back, with ablog postexplaining how the \"catastrophic\" damage was possible. \"While not all of our servers were breached, the most important one was, and it was due to simply not updating old operating systems and code in a timely fashion. Ultimately this problem was caused by having insufficient skilled man-hours available to update our code and infrastructure, and being starved of money for years by advertisers, payment providers, and service providers who had succumbed to external pressure campaigns.\" The hack involved a \"bogus PDF upload\" and so PDF uploading has been temporarily disabled on the revived 4chan. The feature will return, but something else won't. \"One slow but much beloved board, /f/ - Flash, will not be returning however, as there is no realistic way to prevent similar exploits using .swf files.\" There's no mention made of the fact that 4chan Pass subscribers, who pay to skip CAPTCHA verification, had their personal information stolen. Which seems like a bigger problem for the site's long-term health, given that anonymity is the whole point of 4chan. Still, the blog, hosted on 4chan's hated enemy Tumblr, is treating its return as a victory: \"4chan is back. No other website can replace it, or this community.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We've got a fantastic selection of tips that'll give every guess a bit of a boost, a hint for the April 28 (1409) game ready to go if you either find yourself a bit stuck later on or would just like to kick off your MondayWordlein the best possible way, as well as today's answer if you need a win. Point being, however you want to play, we can help.A cheeky little off-the-cuff opener. A nice idea for a Monday morning. A surefire su… an unbroken row of grey letters.Ouch.It didn't look great at the time, but it soon became the perfect counterpart to my second guess, which provided just enough of a clue to give me an even better idea, and together they gave me a win in three. Nice (eventually). This is some sort of fake or fabricated alternative to a human model. Think of clothes on display, or an entertainer pretending to speak through a puppet. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. C'mon, let's go. The answer to the April 28 (1409) Wordle isDUMMY. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.

    "title": "Five new Steam games you probably missed (April 28, 2025)",
    "article_text": "Sorting through every new game on Steam so you don't have to. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest MMOs: Massive worldsBest RPGs: Grand adventures On an average day about a dozen new games are released on Steam. And while we think that's a good thing, it can be understandably hard to keep up with. Potentially exciting gems are sure to be lost in the deluge of new things to play unless you sort through every single game that is released on Steam. So that’s exactly what we’ve done. If nothing catches your fancy this week, we've gathered thebest PC gamesyou can play right now and a running list of the2025 gamesthat are launching this year. Steam ‌page‌‌Release:‌ April 25Developer:‌ Torgomind Browsing Steam every week for this column is worth it just to find games like Navicula Meatus, a weird-ass grid-based dungeon crawler with an art style splicing Scorn with the Garbage Pail Kids. Set in \"a peculiar world of murky alleys and fleshy growths\", it's much more puzzle heavy than recent modern indie blobbers like Dragon Ruins orCyclopean: The Great Abyss, and developer Torgomind insists in the Steam description that \"fun and gameplay have also been excised to allow for pure streamlined immersion\". In other words: don't expect this to befun.Expect it to be discomforting, maybe even traumatizing, and possibly a little bit funny. Steam‌ ‌page‌Release:‌ April 25Developer:‌ Serafini Productions While BrokenLore: Don't Watch looks positively conventional next to the above, it's still quite weird. It's a first-person survival horror starring a hikokomori—a person who has completely, voluntarily withdrawn from society—living in a tiny Tokyo apartment. Your solitary life is threatened by mounting pressures to interact with the real world, and so, BrokenLore takes place both in the apartment and inside the protagonist's mind, where a grotesque stalking figure lurks. The art style borrows heavily from the PS2 era, though it definitely looks better than a PS2 game most of the time. Steam‌ ‌page‌‌Release:‌ April 24Developers:‌ Walaber Entertainment LLCReplicube is a programming game about generating increasingly complex voxel-based objects. Basically, the game displays a 3D object, and it's your job to replicate that object however you see fit using code. As you can imagine, the results will vary dramatically from player-to-player, so there are leaderboards for measuring both source code size and execution efficiency. This is a feature-rich program: there's a 3D voxel editor, a 2D image editor, and even in-game discussion boards. Steam pageRelease:‌ April 25Developer:‌ Reptoid Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. At first glance GeckoShop looks like another in the endless stream of retail simulators flooding Steam, though it distinguishes itself with a unique art style (ie, not the generic sub-realism that blights the genre) and the fact that you're selling geckos. To sell geckos you need to have geckos, so there's a creature collector aspect as well, and the small but busy open world is full of bizarre NPCs with quests to delegate. If you're frustrated that most of the first-person retail sims on Steam are completely devoid of personality, you should give this a shot. Steam‌ ‌page‌‌Release:‌ April 25Developer:‌ Final Offer I usually ignore card games because I'd really rather prefer to do the dishes. So imagine my reaction when I found Dishventory, a strategy card game about doing the dishes. Is this possibly the worst thing ever made? No! It looks pretty fun, as far as card games go: you have to place dirty dishes on a board in the most efficient order possible. Every couple of rounds you get the chance to buy from a random array of mess-defying cards, and if you survive five days, you win. It's free, too. Shaun Prescott is the Australian editor of PC Gamer.

    "article_text": "Browser vulnerabilities render DLP tools ineffective as new data exfiltration attacks emerge When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A newly uncovered data exfiltration technique known as Data Splicing Attacks could place thousands of businesses worldwide at significant risk, bypassing all leading data loss prevention (DLP) tools. Attackers can split, encrypt, or encode data within the browser, transforming files into fragments that evade the detection logic used by bothendpoint protection platforms (EPP)and network-based tools - before these pieces are then reassembled outside the protected environment. By using alternative communication channels such as gRPC and WebRTC, or secure messaging platforms likeWhatsAppand Telegram, threat actors can further obscure their tracks and avoid SSL-based inspections. The growing reliance on browsers as primary work tools has increased exposure. With more than 60% of enterprise data stored on cloud platforms accessed viabrowsers, the importance of a secure browser has never been greater. Researchers demonstrated that proxy solutions used in many secure enterprise browsers simply cannot access the necessary context to recognize these attacks because they lack visibility into user interactions, DOM changes, and browser context. Additionally, endpoint DLP systems struggle because they rely on APIs exposed by the browser, which do not offer identity context, extension awareness, or control over encrypted content. These limitations create a blind spot that attackers can exploit without detection, undermining many enterprises’ ability to defend against insider threat scenarios. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! What makes this discovery even more urgent is the ease with which these techniques can be adapted or modified. With new code, attackers can easily create variants, further widening the gap between evolving threats and outdated protections. In response, the team introduced Angry Magpie, an open source toolkit designed to replicate these attacks. Security teams, red teams, and vendors can use the tool to evaluate their defenses. Angry Magpie allows defenders to assess their systems’ exposure in realistic scenarios, helping identify blind spots in current implementations of even the best DLP solutions. “We hope our research will serve as a call to action to acknowledge the significant risks browsers pose for data loss,” the team said.

    "title": "Google has tuned up its AI Music Sandbox for musicians and producers",
    "article_text": "But can AI sing in harmony with human musicians? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. GoogleDeepMind has brought some new and improved sounds to its Music AI Sandbox, which, despite sand being notoriously bad for musical instruments, is where Google hosts experimental tools for laying down tracks with the aid of AI models. The Sandbox now offers the new Lyria 2 AI model and the Lyria RealTime AI musical production tools. Google has pitched the Music AI Sandbox as a way tospark ideas, generate soundscapes,and maybe help you finally finish that half-written verse you’ve been avoiding looking at all year. The Sandbox is aimed mainly at professional musical artists and producers, and access has been pretty restricted since its 2023 debut. But, Google is now opening up the platform to many more people in music production, including those looking to create soundtracks for films and games. The new Lyria 2 AI music model is the rhythm section underlying the new Sandbox. The model is trained to produce high-fidelity audio outputs, with detailed and intricate compositions across any genre, from shoegaze to synthpop to whatever weird lo-fi banjo-core hybrid you’re cooking up in your bedroom studio. The Lyria RealTime feature puts the AI's creation in a virtual studio that you can jam with. You can sit at your keyboard, and Lyria RealTime will help you mix ambient house beats with classic funk, performing and tweaking its sound on the fly. The Sandbox offers three main tools for producing the tunes. Create, seen above, lets you describe the kind of sound you're aiming for in words. Then the AI whips up music samples you can use as jumping-off points. If you've already got a rough idea down but can’t figure out what happens after the second chorus, you can upload what you have and let the Extend feature come up with ways to continue the piece in the same style. The third feature is called Edit, which, as the name suggests, remakes the music in a new style. You can ask for your tune to be reimagined in a different mood or genre, either by messing with the digital control board or through text prompts. For instance, you could ask for something as basic as \"Turn this into a ballad,\" or something more complex like, \"Make this sadder but still danceable,\" or see how weird you can get by asking the AI to \"Score this EDM drop like it's all just an oboe section.\" You can hear an example below created by Isabella Kensington. Everything generated by Lyria 2 and RealTime is watermarked using Google's SynthID technology. That means the AI-generated tracks can be identified even if someone tries to pass them off as the next lost Frank Ocean demo. It’s a smart move in an industry that’s already gearing up for heated debates about what counts as \"real\" music and what doesn’t. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. These philosophical questionsalso decide the destination of a lot of money, so it's more than just abstract discussions about how to define creativity at stake. But, as with AI tools for producing text, images, and video, this isn't the death knell of traditional songwriting. Nor is it a magic source of the next chart-topping hit. AI could make a half-baked hum fall flat if poorly used. Happily, plenty of musical talents understand what AI can do, and what it can't, as Sidecar Tommy demonstrates below.

    "title": "The impressive Beats Pill portable speaker is landing in two gorgeous new colors, ready for summer",
    "article_text": "Blush Pink and Navy Blue join the three existing shades When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Last summer, Beats brought back itsPill speaker,and after testing it, we found it to be an impressive offering with robust sound and excellent bass. Further, in typical Beats fashion, it launched in a few different shades: Champagne Gold, Matte Black, and Statement Red. Now, ahead of summer travel in 2025, Beats is expanding the selection of colors for the Pill, and both are stunners. Introducing the Beats Pill in ‘Blush Pink’ and ‘Navy Blue.’ Better yet, these don’t come with a price increase either. You will need to track down each shade at a specific retailer, though. In the United States, fans of pink will need to visitTarget,while those looking for blue will need to head toWalmart. Easier than heading out the door, though, is locking in an order online – both are priced at $149.95 and are shipping now. If you’re in the United Kingdom, you can get ‘Blush Pink’ from John Lewis for £149.99. Those in Canada can head to Walmart, with pricing to be confirmed at a later date. Now, both of these shades look great, though the Blush Pink is a bit more fun in our opinion, offering a more summer-y shade in a very light shade of the color. Depending on how the light hits it, the speaker might pop even a bit more. It’s also a full-color job on the rear and front, as well as the attached lanyard and buttons. The Navy Blue is a proper representation of the name, offering a deeper shade of the color. Either route, ‘Navy Blue’ and ‘Blush Pink’ expand the color options, offering two fun shades alongside the original trio of Champagne Gold, Matte Black, and Statement Red. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Regardless of the color you get the Beats Pill in, you’re scoring what Beats is now confirming is “its bestselling speaker\" ever, in that it's sold more of the new Beats Pill in the nine months it’s been out for compared to all past Pill launches. That's quite an accomplishment and speaks towhy TechRadar gave it a full four out of five stars. The excellent audio from the Pill is produced by a new racecourse drive that sits front and center, angled upward. You can also pair two of these speakers together for a stereo and more room-filling experience. You’ll also get up to 24 hours of battery life, and the Pill is quite durable, thanks to its IP67 rating. Lastly, while you’ll recharge it using the USB-C port on the back, the Pill supports passthrough, allowing you to recharge another device by simply plugging it in. Now, if you’re sold on Blush Pink or Navy Blue, you can get Pill for $149.99 from Target or Walmart right now. More importantly, though, if you’re okay with black, gold, or red,you can score it for just $129.95 (was $ 149.95) at Walmart right now. You can get the Beats Pill in black, gold, or red at Walmart for just $129.95.

    "title": "Pure coincidence, surely not? Huawei launches its fastest AI chip ever as US bans export of popular China-only Nvidia H20",
    "article_text": "Nvidia is taking a $5.5 billion hit from new US restrictions on China When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. On April 9, 2025, the United States announced plans to further tighten restrictions on AI chip exports to China, includingNvidia's H20 processor, a reduced-performance chip which the company created to comply with earlier US export regulations while continuing sales in China. Huawei, which has been positioning itself asChina’s answer to Nvidiafor some time, was likely waiting for the announcement because just one day later, at a partner conference, it revealed the Ascend 920, its next-generation AI chip. Set to enter mass production in the second half of 2025, according toDigiTimes Asia, the chip is expected to be built on SMIC’s 6nm process and offer up to 900 TFLOPs of BF16 compute and 4000GB/s of memory bandwidth, supported by HBM3 memory modules. It will also support PCIe 5.0 and next-generation interconnect protocols to aid large-model training. With the Nvidia H20 now restricted in China, industry analysts believe Huawei’s new chip could bridge the gap. Although real-world benchmarks are not yet available, the Ascend 920’s specifications suggest it could be an effective alternative to Nvidia's H20 and may be welcomed by Chinese companies like Tencent and ByteDance, which will now require substitutes for the restricted chip. While the current Ascend 910C is estimated to deliver about 60% of the Nvidia H100’s inference performance, the Ascend 920 reportedly improves training efficiency by 30% to 40% and is tailored for Transformer and Mixture of Experts models. Nvidia had been making strong sales in China through the H20, with sales reportedly growing 50% quarter over quarter before the ban. The new license requirement from the U.S. Department of Commerce effectively halts those sales, and Nvidia is expected to write off $5.5 billion in lost business as a result.

Huawei also announced itsAI CloudMatrix 384 Supernode solutionat the same event. This rack-scale platform, described as a 'Nuclear-level product', reportedly exceeds the performance of Nvidia’s GB200 but consumes more power, something that is not seen as a major concern in China compared to the West.

    "article_text": "DragonForce takes on the affiliate market When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Inspired by drug gangs, ransomware group DragonForce is bringing a new business model to the ransomware scene, and it involves cooperating with other ransomware gangs. DragonForce has now been observed offering a white-label affiliate model, allowing others to use their infrastructure andmalwarewhile branding attacks under their own name. With this model, affiliates won't need to manage the infrastructure and DragonForce will take care of negotitation sites, malware develpoment and data leak sites. \"Advertised features include administration and client panels, encryption and ransom negotiation tools, a file storage system, a Tor-based leak site and .onion domain, and support services,\" cybersecurity researchers fromSecureworksexplained. Secureworks explained that, in a March 2025 underground post, DragonForce rebranded itself as a \"cartel,\" announcing a shift to a distributed model. DragonForce first appeared in August 2023. Anubis, a much newer ransomware group that's been operating since December 2024, has also launched its own affiliate scheme, including a traditional ransomware-as-a-service product that nets affiliates 80% of their ransoms. Much like artificial intelligence has already democratized access to coding, these models are further extending access to ransomware, meaning that less technical threat actors can target victims. The flexibility and reduced operational burdens are also key selling points. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The exact number of affiliates using these schemes is virtually untraceable, howeverBleeping Computerhas reported that RansomBay has already joined DragonForce's scheme. \"Cybercriminals are motivated by financial gain, so they are adopting innovative models and aggressive pressure tactics to shift the trend in their favor,\" Secureworks added. The usual principles apply when it comes to protecting yourself from any type of ransomware – regularly patching internet-facing devices, implementing phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA), maintaining robust backups and monitoring networks for malicious activity are all important steps to take.

    "title": "Asus' ROG Astral GPU sag 'detector' needs to be adopted by other GPU and motherboard manufacturers - even though it's reportedly been removed",
    "article_text": "Could work wonders for my chunky Asus TUF RTX 4080 Super... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Considering the multitude ofNvidiaandAMDthird-party GPUs that come with different designs and sizes, GPU sag is an undeniable issue (even if the recent RTX 5000 series has largely been a move in the right direction from the comically largeRTX 4090). Fortunately, a popular GPU and motherboard manufacturer has introduced a solution - well, sort of. As reported byVideoCardz, Asus' ROG Astral RTX 5000 series GPUs have an 'Equipment Installation Check' feature within the GPU Tweak III software, which alerts users if their GPU has tilted or moved out of place. This is made possible thanks to a built-in gyroscope and accelerometer, effectively helping detect GPU sag. The strange thing is that this feature hasn't been included in any of the ROG Astral GPU marketing. GPU Tweak III, a GPU monitoring and tuning software, has several features to prevent issues, such as Power Detector+, which indicates any potential issues with the 12VHPWR cable - but this GPU sag preventative measure was only just discovered by users. This is perhaps even more baffling: according toAsus forums, the Equipment Installation Check feature is no longer available in the latest version of the software. Whether the omission was entirely intentional is unclear at this moment, but it's a feature that GPU and motherboard manufacturers should consider including going forward. There's nothing worse than finding your PC components damaged due to cases of oversight or necessary precautions being forgotten: that's why GPU sag should be taken far more seriously. Fortunately, I've never had it happen to me since I made it my priority to obtain a good anti-sag stand (I'm using a fairly chunky GPU), but it's easy to see the potential damage to the PCIe slot or the GPU itself in the long run if there isn't any support inside your case for a heavy graphics card. It's a different conversation if you're using a GPU riser cable (in a mini-ITX build, for example) as the card can be placed vertically to alleviate concerns of sag - but good luck placing some of today's modern beefy third-party GPUs in those cases. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Of course, this won't apply to all GPU owners, as it seems the heavier GPUs are mostly third-party high-end offerings to compensate for cooling: prime examples are my current GPU, the Asus TUF RTX 4080 Super, a triple-slot card, and the ROG Astral RTX 5090. It's good to see that Asus even thought about a feature to at least notify users of any sag or movement: in my experience, it's not always easy to tell if your GPU is sagging, so while some might see it as a nonsensical addition, I'd argue it's one worth applauding. However, it's gone at the moment and no one knows if it will return: if it doesn't come back (which I'll be shocked by), then I'll be hoping other GPU manufacturers have at the very least taken note.

    "title": "New Meta XR glasses again tipped to land later this year– well ahead of Apple's rumored AR glasses with Apple Intelligence",
    "article_text": "Apple's rumored AR glasses could need more time in the oven When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Meta's incoming AR smart glasses could eventually face anApple-made rival with Apple Intelligence, according to new rumors. The details add credibility to other rumors we’ve heard previously and hint at a big AR glasses battle in the coming decade – though it’s a fight Meta has a big headstart on right now. The information comes via Mark Gurman’s latestPowerOn newsletter(behind a paywall) where he details some insider reports of what the two companies are apparently working on. Gurman’s comments support a few details we’veheard previously about Meta’s upcoming glasses. They’ll be smart glasses like its existing Ray-Bans but will also have a display, they’ll be pricey (we’re talking over $1,000 / £1,000 / AU$1,500), and Meta is targeting an October 2025 release (which is when it usually releases new Quest and smart glasses hardware). However, Meta is at risk of slipping from this target date. Gurman adds that “top managers on the team” have reportedly told their staff to pick up the pace – and in some cases employees may need to work through their upcoming weekends to achieve Meta’s goals. There’s no word on when the glasses might be released if they miss their October deadline – we’re hoping they’ll fall this side of 2025 rather than 2026, though ideally their release date will arrive without any excessive crunch Meta's employees. We've also heard the first signs of some potential pressure from Apple’s first smart glasses – codenamed N50. Based on how Gurman describes them (“an Apple Intelligence device” that can “analyze the surrounding environment and feed information to the wearer” but stops short of proper AR) sounds just like what Meta has and is working on in the smart glasses space. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The issue? Apparently a launch is still some time away. Gurman isn’t specific on when a launch might follow, but with Meta, Snap and nowGoogleandSamsung(viaAndroid XR) getting involved in the smart glasses space it seriously feels like Apple is giving everyone a major headstart. Given its success with theApple WatchandAirPodsfrom both a portability and fashionability standpoint (the two key areas smart glasses need to succeed in), Apple has the potential to catch up. But if its non-AR glasses do launch in 2027 that could coincide with when Meta launches full-on AR specs, according to leaked development timetables – which means Apple's rival runs the risk of being dated out of the gate. Then again, Apple’s delayed release will only matter if Meta, Android XR, Snap, and others can capitalize on it. These other AR glasses might be out in the wild sooner, but if they’re expensive and lack innovative applications, they likely won’t be super popular. This could especially be an issue for Meta’s upcoming XR specs, as the existing Meta Ray-Ban smart specs are already great and only continue to get better thanks to software updates. A display would be a significant enhancement, sure, but it doesn’t yet seem like an essential one – especially when you consider the display-less specs start at just $299 / £299 / AU$449 and are already the best AI wearable around. On the other hand, if the upcoming Meta and Google XR glasses can match even half of the cool uses that I experienced on the Snap Spectacles during my demo, then they have the potential to take people’s perception of XR technology to new heights. That would be an exciting prospect, and a high price would seem significantly more justifiable. We’ll just have to wait and see what Meta, Apple, and Google have up their sleeves, if and when their next-gen XR glasses finally release to the public.

    "article_text": "Over 20 thousand records may have been compromised When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Security researcherJeremiah Fowlerhas discovered a non password-protected database, believed to be owned by Carolina Anesthesiology PA - a healthcare firm based out of North Carolina. This dataset contained 21,344 records, was almost 7GB, and spanned multiple states. The information contained sensitive data, including patient information like names, physical addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses, as well as insurance coverage details, anesthesia summaries, diagnoses, family medical histories, and doctors notes. According to the researcher, there were files marked ‘Billing and Compliance Reports’, which gives an idea of the type of data included. While there is so far no evidence to suggest the database fell into malicious hands, the potential compromise of the unprotected database could put many at risk of social engineering attacks like phishing, identity theft, or fraud.

Keeper generates and stores strong passwords so you never have to remember them again. Don’t let one weak password leave you exposed. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) The researcher outlines that the dataset contained a “detailed analysis and key metrics related to medical billing and healthcare services provided” - but that, when contacted, the healthcare firm indicated that it did not own or manage the database, but that the owner has been notified and public access restricted. It’s not clear if the information was accessed by a threat actor or third party, as only an internal audit would show this - and as far as we know, the information has not appeared on any dark web sites for sale by cybercriminals. Investigation by the researcher indicate that this folder’s contents was likely affiliated with Atrium Health - a partner of Carolina Anesthesiology PA. “Our cyber security team immediately launched an internal investigation upon receiving an email tip in mid-February 2025 about a possible data breach.Our investigation found that Carolina Anesthesiology, P.A., who regularly provides anesthesia services at select facilities, misconfigured the technology service used for billing data, exposing some of their patient data,” said Atrium Health in response to the breach. “We immediately shut down all data feeds to Carolina Anesthesiology and, as a courtesy, notified the regular governing entities.

I always have my ear to the ground when it comes to thebest streaming services, so trust me when I say there's another wave of brand newParamount+movies and TV shows coming to the platform in May 2025 that you'll want to know about. This month it's TV show premieres galore, and Paramount+ has a number of shows returning for new installments, from season 18 ofCriminal Minds, toRuPaul's Drag Race All Starsseason 10 where you can expect the show's biggest cast yet – 18 queens altogether.

    "article_text": "Researchers are warning about a large-scale, sophisticated attack When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you are a WooCommerce user, pay attention, since there is a new phishing campaign going around targeting people like yourself. Recently, security researchers from Patchstack spotted a new phishing attack, which they described as “large-scale” and “sophisticated”. In the attack, the crooks would send an email, warning their targets about a critical vulnerability in their websites that needs to be addressed immediately. The email also comes with a “Download Patch” link which, instead of the supposed fix, actually deploys a malicious WordPress plugin. The plugin is hosted on a website mimicking the WooCommerce Marketplace, and can be spotted in the typosquatted URL \"woocommėrce[.]com\" (notice the ė character). Get Keeper Personal for just $1.67/month, Keeper Family for just $3.54/month, and Keeper Business for just $7/month ​Keeper is a cybersecurity platform primarily known for its password manager and digital vault, designed to help individuals, families, and businesses securely store and manage passwords, sensitive files, and other private data. It uses zero-knowledge encryption and offers features like two-factor authentication, dark web monitoring, secure file storage, and breach alerts to protect against cyber threats. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) The plugin first hides itself from the list of installed plugins, and then creates a new admin account. It also hides this account from the victim and relays the credentials to the attackers. Finally, it deploys stage-twomalware, which includes web shells such as P.A.S.-Fork, p0wny, and WSO. Patchstack, which usually tracks WordPress threats, says that a similar campaign was observed back in December 2023, with the key difference being that the phishing email warned about a non-existent CVE. Since both the emails and the malware are rather similar, the researchers speculate that both attacks are either the work of the same threat actor, or that the new campaign is the work of a copycat, \"They claim the targeted websites are impacted by a (non-existent) 'Unauthenticated Administrative Access' vulnerability, and they urge you to visit their phishing website, which uses an IDN homograph attack to disguise itself as the official WooCommerce website,\" the researchers explained. If you are running a WordPress website with WooCommerce installed, you should scan your site for suspicious plugins and admin accounts, and make sure to update both WordPress and the plugins/themes you are running.

    "article_text": "Designers and developers split on just how useful AI really is right now When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As artificial intelligence continues its path to world domination, Figma has unveiled a new survey that seeks to explore how designers and developers are deployingAI toolsin the field. The findings are a bit of a mixed bag, showing that while AI is becoming an integral part of the workflow, it’s not always living up to the promise. The survey follows on from news thatFigma, alongside Adobe and Canva, has integrated OpenAI’s ‘gpt-image-1’ model into its design platform. 85%. That’s the headline figure from the survey, which states “85% of respondents say AI will be essential to future success in their role.” But how that success is achieved, or what it even looks like, remains unclear right now. The company has explored how businesses are building AI-powered products for the market, as well as uncovering how design and dev teams are using the tools in day-to-day workflows. Either way, the results show that despite embracing the technology, right now it’s failing to live up to frankly over-hyped expectations. According to Figma, one in three say they’ve shipped AI-powered products - a 50% increase since last year’s survey. This includes a wide range of uses, including analytics, document interpretation, and product strategy and marketing growth. However, designers and developers admitted that “many AI projects still lack clarity in purpose,” with Figma pointing to nebulously defined goals like AI experimentation and CX improvements offered by respondents. This, the company claims, makes it difficult to measure the true impact of artificial intelligence. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The gulf between reality and potential can also be seen in how designers and developers are using AI. Because, while 78% believe the use of AI makes their workflows more efficient, just 58% reckon it improves the quality of the work. Fewer than half of those surveyed, says Figma, “made them better at their job.” Figma also notes that despite 83% of those surveyed think learning to work with AI is essential to future success, those who believe it will have a “significant impact” on reaching company goals plummets to only 27%. Users who say AI will be “transformational” linger at 15%, exactly where it was in last year’s survey. In other words, the company says, belief in the potential is high, but expectations, while stabilizing, are low due to experiencing the true limitations of current artificial intelligence technology. Despite the general scepticism over just how useful AI is right now, there is some optimism in the design and dev world.Agentic AIis now the fastest-growing category, doubling year on year - although it’s yet to unseat text generation as the biggest project type. Usage is also increasing, particularly among developers. Where just 69% of designers say they’re satisfied with AI tools and 54% of them feel the quality of their work improves when using AI, these figures jump to 83% and 67% for those working in development. However, Figma points out that the disparity is likely down to how artificial intelligence is used across different projects, with designers chiefly using the tools for the likes of asset creation (31%) compared to core development responsibilities, such as code generation, used by 59% of developers. So, all in all, results are mixed right now - how that will change as AI continues to improve will be one to watch. Figma surveyed 2500 developers and designers globally between January 8 and January 30, 2025. You can get the full reporthere. Steve is B2B Editor for Creative & Hardware atTechRadar Pro.

    "title": "AI is better at picking which puppy will make a good guide dog than humans are",
    "article_text": "Lending a helping paw When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AI is being used to help identify which pups have the greatest potential to go on to become guide dogs (also known as seeing-eye dogs) or service dogs earlier and with more accuracy. In a newresearch projectat the University of East London, Dr Mohammad Amirhosseini, Associate Professor in Computer Science and Digital Technologies, found that one AI model achieved 80% prediction accuracy over a 12-month period. “One of the biggest challenges in assistance dog training is the emotional and financial cost of late-stage failure,” says Dr Amirhosseini. “This is more than a tech innovation – it’s a leap forward for animal welfare.” To perform the analysis the trainers who work most closely with the dogs record their behaviour at six months and 12 months using detailed questionnaires, which function as snapshots of the dog’s temperament, focus and personality. AI then weaves its magic and spots the early signs of suitability for guide or service dog training. The AI can detect patterns of behavior that even experienced trainers could miss. The project brought together an international dream team of dog experts including members of The Seeing Eye, which is the oldest dog training centre in the world, as well as Canine Companions, the team featured in Netflix’sInside the Mind of a Dogdocumentary. While many industries are under threat from AI removing human jobs, the study shows that there are plenty of opportunities for AI to positively benefit mankind.

AI can potentially be a game-changer for many dog training programmes, saving time, money and even heartbreak because dogs that don’t make the cut have to get rehomed and split from their potential new vocations and owners. If an AI can pick up patterns that even seasoned dog trainers miss then it will become a powerful new ally in the field of animal training. Graham is the Senior Editor for AI at TechRadar.

    "article_text": "Cybercriminals are impersonating popular tech firms to trick victims When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Phishing attacks top the tables for most popular intrusion points for cybercriminals over and over again, and newresearch from Check Pointreveals the most commonly imitated firms for the first quarter of 2025. Criminals impersonatingMicrosoftwere by far the most common, making up 36% of observed brand related social engineering attacks in the study. Following behind areGoogleandApple, making up 12% and 8% respectively - meaning that over half of all incidents (56%) come from a false address associated with one of those three brands.

Keeper generates and stores strong passwords so you never have to remember them again. Don’t let one weak password leave you exposed. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) Unsurprisingly, the research shows that technology is the most impersonated sector for attacks in Q1 of 20225 - most likely because more and more people use the services, and because criminals can prompt users to enter credentials with ‘password reset’ scams, or can lure victims onto a malicious site, especially given the trust awarded to these services. This isn’t the first time researchers have identifiedMicrosoft as the most commonly imitated company in phishing scams, and the best way to stay safe against phishing is to be hyper vigilant - double checking any email address for discrepancies, and never clicking a link from an unverified source. “As we progress through 2025, organizations and users alike must stay alert to the evolving threat of phishing attacks,” says Check Point. “The most frequently targeted brands are not just household names — they are gateways to sensitive personal and financial information.

    "title": "The Godfather of AI is more worried than ever about the future of AI",
    "article_text": "\"I didn't think we'd get here in only 40 years\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Dr Geoffrey Hinton deserves credit for helping to build the foundation of virtually all neural-network-based generative AI we use today. You can also credit him in recent years with consistency: he still thinks the rapid expansion of AI development and use will lead to some fairly dire outcomes. Two years ago, in an interview withThe New York Times,Dr Hinton warned, \"It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things.\" Now, ina fresh sit-down, this time with CBS News, the Nobel Prize winner is ratcheting up the concern, admitting that when he figured out how to make a computer brain work more like a human brain, he \"didn't think we'd get here in only 40 years,\" adding that \"10 years ago I didn't believe we'd get here.\" Yet, now we're here, and hurtling towards an unknowable future, with the pace of AI model development easily outstripping the pace of Moore's Law (which states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles roughly every 18 months). Some might argue that artificial intelligence is doubling in capability every 12 months or so, and undoubtedly making significant leaps on a quarterly basis. Naturally, Dr Hinton's reasons for concern are now manifold. Here's some of what he told CBS News. That, according to CBS News, is Dr Hinton's current assessment of the AI-versus-human risk factor. It's not that Dr. Hinton doesn't believe that AI advances won't pay dividends in medicine, education, and climate science; I guess the question here is, at what point does AI become so intelligent that we do not know what it's thinking about or, perhaps, plotting? Dr. Hinton didn't directly address artificial general intelligence (AGI) in the interview, but that must be on his mind. AGI, which remains a somewhat amorphous concept, could mean that AI machines surpass human-like intelligence – and if they do that, at what point does AI start to, as humans do, act in its own self-interest? Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. In trying to explain his concerns, Dr Hinton likened current AI to someone owning a tiger cub. \"It's just such a cute tiger cub, unless you can be very sure that it's not going to want to kill you when it's grown up.\" The analogy makes sense when you consider how most people engage with AIs likeChatGPT,CoPilot,andGemini, using them to generate funny pictures and videos, and declaring, \"Isn't that adorable?\" But behind all that amusement and shareable imagery is an emotionless system that's only interested in delivering the best result as its neural network and models understand it. When it comes to current AI threats Dr. Hinton is clearly taking them seriously. He believes that AI will make hackers more effective at attacking targets like banks, hospitals, and infrastructure. AI, which can code for you and help you solve difficult problems, could supercharge their efforts. Dr Hinton's response? Risk mitigation by spreading his money across three banks. Seems like good advice. Dr Hinton is so concerned about the looming AI threat that he told CBS News he's glad he's 77 years old, which I assume means he hopes to be long gone before the worst-case scenario involving AI potentially comes to pass. I'm not sure he'll get out in time, though. We have a growing legion of authoritarians around the world, some of whom are alreadyusing AI-generated imageryto propel their propaganda. Dr Hinton argues that the big tech companies focusing on AI, namelyOpenAI,Microsoft, Meta, andGoogle(where Dr Hinton formerly worked), are putting too much focus on short-term profits and not enough on AI safety. That's hard to verify, and, in their defense, most governments have done a poor job of enforcing any real AI regulation. Dr Hinton has taken notice when some try to sound the alarm. He told CBS News that he was proud of his former protégé and OpenAI's former Chief Scientist, Ilya Sutskever, who helpedbriefly oust OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanover AI safety concerns. Altman soon returned, and Sutskever ultimately walked away. As for what comes next, and what we should do about it, Dr Hinton doesn't offer any answers. In fact he seems almost as overwhelmed by it all as the rest of us, telling CBS News that while he doesn't despair, \"we're at this very very special point in history where in a relatively short time everything might totally change at a change of a scale we've never seen before. It's hard to absorb that emotionally.\" You can say that again, Dr Hinton.

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 price rumors: how much might this flip foldable cost?",
    "article_text": "Here's what price to expect from Samsung's next flip model When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7is likely to land in just a few months' time, and when it does, it should provide an enticing foldable alternative to the flagshipSamsung Galaxy S25series. Like most big-name upcoming phones, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 has leaked extensively, with leakers and tipsters revealing, among many other things, the price you might have to pay for it. Of course, nothing will be certain price-wise untilSamsungitself unveils the phone later this year, but we do have a solid idea of what to expect. Below, you’ll find details of what you’ll probably have to pay for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, based on a combination of leaks, past form, and educated guesses. Before looking at any possible price changes for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, it’s worth being aware of what the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 costs, so you have a jumping-off point. Below, you can see a chart with full pricing details for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, but notably, it starts at $1,099.99 / £1,049 / $1,799. Storage US price UK price AU price 256GB $1,099.99 £1,049 $1,799 512GB $1,219.99 £1,149 $1,999 So, will the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 cost any more or less than that? Well, we haven’t heard loads of price rumors yet, but two separate leaks have suggested that it will have exactly the same starting price. We first heard thisSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 price claimin January 2025, and while the claim comes from a leaker who doesn’t yet have much of a track record, the same claim was later made byAndroid Headlinesin an article written in collaboration with @OnLeaks – a source with a very solid track record. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. These are the only price leaks we’ve heard so far, so for now, our best guess is that the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 will start at $1,099.99 / £1,049 / $1,799, just like its predecessor. That said, it’s possible that even if these leaks are correct, the price could change in some regions. Android Headlines, for example, only mentioned the US price when saying that nothing would change. It’s also certainly possible that Samsung will increase the price. After all, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 costs more – at least in some regions – than theSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, a phone that started at $999.99 / £1,049 / AU$1,649. So, Samsung could increase the price again, though it could equally be argued that the company might be reluctant to raise the price two years in a row. It might not have much of a choice, though, especially now that Trump has started introducing tariffs to most countries, which will likely mean Samsung’s costs will increase. Still, until we hear otherwise, we’re going to say the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 will probably have the same price as its predecessor, and we’re even more confident that it won’t cost less, as price reductions for new models are rare (though not totally unheard of) and with tariffs coming in it seems especially unlikely to happen. On top of all that,Samsung is reportedly making a Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE,which is sure to be cheaper than the main model, so if Samsung was to also lower the price of the Z Flip 7, that might eat into the FE’s potential audience. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, then, could be the foldable flip phone to buy if you’re hoping for a lower price tag. But just how low will this model go? Well, so far there aren’t any Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE price leaks, but logically it will be cheaper than the Galaxy Z Flip 7, which – if the Z Flip 7 retains its predecessor’s price, as has been rumored – would mean a price of under $1,099.99 / £1,049 / $1,799. As such, we'd guess that this would mean the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE will probably start at no more than $1,000 / £1,000 / AU$1,650.

    "title": "Ukraine won’t win – J.D. Vance",
    "article_text": "Ukraine is not poised to win the conflict with Russia, US Vice President J.D. Vance has said. He added that it was naive to expect Russia’s collapse if the fighting continues for several more years. “If this doesn’t stop, the Ukrainians aren’t winning the war,”Vance said during an interview on conservative organizer Charlie Kirk’s podcast on Monday. “I think there’s this weird idea among the mainstream media that if this thing goes on for just another few years, the Russians will collapse, the Ukrainians will take their territory back, and everything will go back to the way that it was before the war. That is not the reality that we live in,”the vice president said. “You could have millions of more people killed if this thing goes on for another few years, and it could risk escalating into a nuclear war. It has to stop,”Vance added. He also said that, despite the challenges of dealing with both sides, American negotiators were“making progress.” “Sometimes you’re incredibly frustrated with Ukrainians. Sometimes you’re incredibly frustrated with the Russians,”Vance said.“And sometimes you just want to throw your hands up, but that’s what President Trump doesn’t let us do.” Vance’s remarks came as Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russian troops would observe a three-day ceasefire starting on May 8, marking the celebrations of victory in World War II. Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky responded by accusing Moscow of“manipulation”and called for an immediate 30-day ceasefire. According to Russia, Ukraine violated both the 30-day ‘energy truce’ brokered by the US last month and the 30-hour Easter truce, despite having promised to respect both arrangements. Putin has argued that, for a comprehensive ceasefire to succeed, Ukraine must halt its mobilization campaign and the West must stop delivering weapons to Kiev.",

    "title": "Trump says he runs the world",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has claimed he is now running not only his country but the whole world and is“having a lot of fun”with his second presidential term. The president made the remarks in an interview with The Atlantic, marking his first 100 days in office. Trump shared his experience with the magazine, stating he has been faring way better than at the time of his first presidency. ”The first time, I had two things to do—run the country and survive; I had all these crooked guys,” he stated.“And the second time, I run the country and the world.” Inquired further on the accounts of individuals close to the US administration, who told the magazine the president appears to be elated most of the time and has a“twinkle in his eye,”Trump confirmed that was the case and he greatly enjoys doing various“serious stuff.” “I’m having a lot of fun, considering what I do,”he said.“You know, what I do is such serious stuff.” The president was also asked about his repeated suggestions he could potentially run for office for the third time - despite not having a legal option to do so. The earlier remarks on the matter sparked fears Trump could ultimately opt to rewire the whole US electoral system to try and stay in power, while multiple high-profile Republicans dismissed such suggestions as joking on the president’s part. The concerns have been reinforced by the emergence of ‘Trump 2028’ merch on his official store. Trump, however, insisted he has had no actual plans to stay in office beyond his second term, admitting it was a rather complicated thing to do.“It’s not something that I’m looking to do. And I think it would be a very hard thing to do,”Trump stated.",

    "title": "Spain declares state of emergency after nationwide blackout",
    "article_text": "Spain declared a state of emergency on Monday after a massive power outage plunged the entire Iberian Peninsula into darkness. Authorities are still investigating the cause. The blackout, which struck Spain and Portugal around midday and briefly affected parts of France, left millions without electricity, paralyzed public transport, and delayed flights. In a televised address, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the Ministry of the Interior would assume control over the situation in Madrid, Andalusia and Extremadura, ensuring public order and other functions at the request of regional leaders. The measure would be extended“to the regions that want it,”Sanchez added, adding“We are aware of the impact this [power outage] is having.” The Level 3 National Emergency Plan allows for the army to be deployed to preserve order and security wherever it is declared in effect. Sanchez stressed there was“no security problem,”saying State Security Forces had stepped up their presence on the streets and highways. The Interior Ministry said about 30,000 police officers had been deployed nationwide as the blackout stretched into the evening. The announcement came as grid operator Red Electrica (REE) said electricity had been restored in parts of Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and Andalusia, and it was working to identify the cause of the outage. Earlier, Portugal’s grid operator Redes Energeticas Nacionais (REN) said a“rare atmospheric phenomenon”over Spain, triggered by“extreme temperature variations,”may have caused the blackout. Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro later said authorities still did not know what caused the outage, but that it“did not originate in Portugal”and“everything indicates”the problem started in Spain. Spanish officials have yet to confirm the cause. Addressing the uncertainty, Sanchez said there was no conclusive information and urged the public to avoid speculation. REN said it had restored power to about 750,000 of its 6.5 million consumers by Monday evening.",

    "title": "Canadian military issues ‘goose alert’",
    "article_text": "The Canadian Department of National Defence (DND) has released a warning to its staff at its Carling Avenue headquarters in Ottawa amid an ongoing takeover of the area by Canada geese. The birds are known for their aggressive behavior toward any perceived threat during nesting season, which is in full swing at the moment. In an article on Monday, the Ottawa Citizen cited an e-mail alert sent out by DND spokesperson Nick Drescher Brown, advising both military and civilian staff against attempting to feed or touch the geese, as it could be taken as a provocation by the winged intruders. According to the newspaper, personnel at the Carling Avenue headquarters have been told to“remain calm and not panic”should they encounter a bird displaying aggressive behavior. “Try to move away slowly and quietly without turning your back to the goose. Maintain eye contact while you back away,”the instructions reportedly say. “If the goose charges or hisses, raise your arms to appear larger and back away slowly,”the directive further advises. Brown acknowledged that DND has no idea how many Canada geese are occupying its property situated in the midst of Ottawa’s Greenbelt. A previous DND directive regarding the birds clarified that they are a protected species, and therefore cannot be relocated once they have nested. The problem is not exactly new, with CBC quoting DND staff as describing the situation at the headquarters as“volatile”in April 2023. According to the Toronto Wildlife Centre, Canada geese sometimes nest in busy urban areas near people and cars. They tend to attack anyone approaching their nesting site, which may be inconspicuously perched on a roof or in a planter, making the aggression seem unmotivated. Geese Relief, a US firm specializing in Canada geese removal with the help of specially trained dogs, warns on its website that while most goose attacks result in minor or no injuries to humans, there have been cases where individuals have sustained“broken bones, head trauma, and emotional distress”during misguided attempts to“avoid an attacking goose”that have ended in“trips and falls.”",

    "title": "Trump suggests Canadians should vote for him",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has encouraged Canadians to vote for him as the leader of their country in their federal election, reiterating his proposal to have America’s northern neighbor become the 51st state of the USA. In a message on his Truth Social platform on Monday, Trump wished“good luck to the great people of Canada”as they went to the polls. However, his message quickly turned controversial when he suggested that Canadians should“elect the man who has the strength and wisdom”to cut taxes in half and increase military power“for free”to“the highest level in the world,”apparently referring to himself. Trump suggested that if Canada becomes the“cherished 51st state”of the US, it would also lead to benefits like a“quadrupling”of industries such as steel, aluminum, energy and“all other businesses”and free the country from tariffs and taxes. “Look how beautiful this land mass would be. Free access with NO BORDER. ALL POSITIVES WITH NO NEGATIVES. IT WAS MEANT TO BE!”Trump’s post said, noting that Canada’s border with the US was an“artificially drawn line from many years ago.” Leaders from both Canada’s Liberal and Conservative party have condemned Trump’s comments and argued that their faction would be in the best position to lead the country, particularly amid challenges posed by the Trump presidency. Trump initially brought up the idea of Canada becoming a US state in December 2024, arguing that Washington already subsidizes its northern neighbor to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars per year and that there is currently a massive bilateral trade imbalance between the two countries. Ottawa has vehemently rejected Trump’s proposal, both under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his successor Mark Carney, who has stressed that Canada will“never, ever, in any way, shape, or form, be part of the United States.” Carney was elected leader of Canada’s ruling Liberal Party last month after Trudeau resigned in January due to low approval ratings amid an ongoing housing crisis, soaring inflation rates and economic struggles. Monday’s election is set to decide if the Liberal Party maintains its nearly decade-long rule or if it will be replaced by Pierre Poilievre’s Conservative Party. Recent polls have suggested a tight race, with neither side expected to win an outright majority, which would result in a minority government.",

    "title": "UK to test mental state of transgender kids – media",
    "article_text": "The British National Health Service (NHS) will conduct autism screenings for all children who identify as transgender, The Telegraph has reported. Under new NHS guidance seen by the outlet, every child referred to a gender clinic will be screened for conditions – including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, learning disabilities, and mental health issues – that may be contributing to their distress. “Given the high prevalence of neurodiversity identified within this population, all those attending the NHS Children and Young People’s Gender Service should receive screening for neurodevelopmental conditions,”according to the new specification cited by the newspaper. A multidisciplinary team of doctors and psychologists will reportedly evaluate eight key aspects of a child’s life, including their sexual orientation, family relationships, and complete medical history. The guidance follows a review led by Hilary Cass, a retired consultant pediatrician and former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. The review into gender services emphasized the importance of viewing distressed children as“whole people”rather than solely through the lens of their gender identity. She stressed that it is vital for children who identify as transgender to receive treatment for“ordinary”issues such as depression or autism, the report said. Cass linked the rise in teenage girls experiencing gender identity struggles to cases of“undiagnosed autism, which is often missed in adolescent girls.” Conditions of autism and gender confusion in the UK have surged in recent years, the report noted. Recorded cases of gender-related distress among individuals under 18 rose from 0.14 per 10,000 in 2011 to 4.4 per 10,000 in 2021, driven largely by adolescent girls. Over the same period, autism diagnoses also increased significantly, with the condition estimated to affect one in 34 children aged 10 to 14 by 2018 – up from roughly one in 2,500 in previous decades. The NHS guidance noted a previous“reluctance to explore or address”mental health conditions in young people, as gender dysphoria was not classified as such. It emphasized that“identifying and treating”any mental health issues should now be an“integrated part”of their care. The new guidance follows a UK Supreme Court ruling earlier this month that defined“woman”based on biological sex rather than gender identity, meaning transgender individuals born male are not legally recognized as women for the purposes of single-sex protections.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has labeled American media“compromised and corrupt,”accusing it of publishing“fake”polls that understate his approval ratings. Trump’s rant followed the publication of surveys by the New York Times and ABC/Washington Post respectively which suggested that support for the president was at record low as he approached the hundredth day of his second term in the White House. “We don’t have a Free and Fair “Press” in this Country anymore. We have a Press that writes BAD STORIES, and CHEATS, BIG, ON POLLS. IT IS COMPROMISED AND CORRUPT. SAD,”he wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform on Monday. Trump insisted that“great Pollster John McLaughlin, one of the most highly respected in the industry, has just stated that The Failing New York Times Poll, and the ABC/Washington Post Poll, about a person named DONALD J. TRUMP, ME, are FAKE POLLS FROM FAKE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS.” McLaughlin, a veteran researcher and political consultant often branded“Trump’s pollster”by the US media, later shared a screenshot of the US leader’s post on his account on X. “The New York Times has only 37% Trump 2024 voters, and the ABC/Washington Post Poll has only 34% Trump Voters, unheard of numbers unless looking for a negative result, which they are,”Trump insisted. He said that the media organizations should be investigated for fraud, along with the Fox News pollster that suggested that 44% of Americans approved of the president’s“overall job performance.” “They are Negative Criminals who apologize to their subscribers and readers after I WIN ELECTIONS BIG, much bigger than their polls showed I would win, loose a lot of credibility, and then go on cheating and lying for the next cycle, only worse,”Trump stressed. The president also claimed that American media outlets“suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome, and there is nothing that anyone, or anything, can do about it. THEY ARE SICK, almost only write negative stories about me no matter how well I am doing... AND ARE TRULY THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!”",

    "article_text": "British troops would help“rebuild”the Ukrainian armed forces under a potential deployment to the country following a ceasefire with Russia, UK Defense Secretary John Healey has said, according to The Telegraph. The UK and France have led discussions in recent weeks among several European NATO member states about sending military personnel to Ukraine as part of a so-called“coalition of the willing,”once Kiev and Moscow have agreed a ceasefire. Russia has strongly objected to Western troops being deployed to Ukraine under any pretext. In an article on Sunday, The Telegraph cited a letter reportedly sent last week by Healey to Shadow Defense Secretary James Cartlidge. In it, the British defense chief is said to have written that“we expect those objectives to focus on rebuilding a modern and capable armed forces of Ukraine, rather than delivering combat operations.” According to the newspaper, Healey defined the potential British contingent’s goal as helping Kiev“regenerate an armed forces capable of deterring future Russian aggression.”UK military personnel would likely be stationed in Western Ukraine, away from the front line, The Telegraph claimed. In addition, the British Royal Air Force and Navy would reportedly be on standby to cover Ukraine’s air space and territorial waters, if necessary. The Telegraph cited Healey as claiming that the coalition’s actions would be in line with US President Donald Trump’s effort to establish a“just and lasting peace”between Ukraine and Russia. Last Thursday, The Times, citing anonymous sources, reported that the UK had ditched plans to deploy a military contingent to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire as the“risks are too high and the forces inadequate”for such an undertaking. The newspaper claimed that in a marked departure from the previous vision, involving coalition forces guarding key Ukrainian cities, ports, and nuclear power plants, the Western grouping now favored a training mission that would“‘reassure’ by being there but aren’t a deterrence or protection force.” In an interview with TASS published last Thursday, Sergey Shoigu, secretary of Russia’s National Security Council, warned that the presence of Western troops in Ukraine could lead to a direct confrontation between Moscow and NATO, potentially escalating into a third world war. Shoigu, who previously served as Russia’s defense minister, emphasized that Moscow could use nuclear weapons“in the event of aggression,”conventional or otherwise.",

    "article_text": "A huge power outage struck Spain and Portugal at around noon on Monday, paralyzing public transport and delaying flights. The cause of the blackout has not officially been determined, although an EU grid operator cited a“rare atmospheric phenomenon”as a possible factor. The governments of the two EU nations have convened emergency cabinet meetings following the outage, which also briefly affected parts of France. In Spain, blackouts were reported in Seville, Barcelona and Pamplona, with additional disruptions in Valencia. Metro services in Madrid and Barcelona were suspended, forcing passengers to evacuate trains and walk along the tracks, according to footage circulating online. Telephone lines were reportedly down across much of Spain, and Madrid’s main airport was left without power. Hundreds of people stood outside office buildings on Madrid’s streets and there was a heavy police presence around key buildings, directing traffic and patrolling central atriums with lights, according to Reuters, citing witnesses. A major tennis tournament in Madrid has been suspended due to the blackout. Spain’s Channel 6 television has continued broadcasting in darkness. Portugal and parts of southern France also reported network failures, according to local media. Spain’s national grid operator said a“major incident”in the energy transmission system may have caused the blackout. Power companies stated they were working to restore services as quickly as possible. Así está el aeropuerto de Barajas Madrid#apagonpic.twitter.com/fwLVigw9AJ The Portuguese grid operator, Redes Energeticas Nacionais (REN), has said a“rare atmospheric phenomenon”over Spain, triggered by“extreme temperature variations,”may have caused the massive blackout. REN added it is still too early to determine when power will be fully restored. “At this time, it is still impossible to predict when the situation will be normalized,”it said in a statement, adding that it had“all resources deployed”to resolve the outage, according to AFP. 🔴#ÚLTIMAHORA| Apagón de luz en Madrid y en Cibeles no funcionan ni los semáforospic.twitter.com/VYLKKpzPV2 The president of Madrid’s regional government, Isabel Diaz Ayuso asked Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to authorize the use of the army if needed. “We ask the national government to activate Plan 3 so that the Army can maintain order, if necessary,”she said. 🔴#DIRECTO| Las paradas de metro precintadas en Madridpic.twitter.com/RK74BS2Ekt Sanchez has made an emergency trip to the headquarters of Red Electrica, the national grid operator, as officials work to resolve the outage quickly.

    "article_text": "It is incorrect to think that Ukraine is aiding the United States by fighting Russia, according to David Sacks, a“crypto czar”linked to Donald Trump's White House. Kiev has consistently asserted that it is“defending”Western nations from Russia. Vladimir Zelensky reiterated the point in a recent interview with conservative journalist Ben Shapiro, where he urged the US to act as an arms supplier rather than a diplomatic mediator and stating that Ukrainians“are fighting against your enemies, the Russians.” “Russians are not our enemy. We shouldn’t be helping to kill them,”Sacks countered, a White House advisor on crypto and artificial intelligence, claimed in a post on Sunday. He has long criticized US support for Kiev, characterizing it as an attempt to transform the Ukraine conflict into a“forever war.” Zelensky has argued that modern Russia shares the same agenda as the former USSR and considers the US its“main enemy.”He accused Moscow of collaborating with Tehran and Pyongyang to undermine American interests. Conversely, he stated that Kiev views the US as a“strategic partner”and“friend.”However, he cautioned that any attempts to pressure Ukrainians could“turn them around very quickly.” US President Donald Trump has claimed that Zelensky has undermined his efforts to negotiate a peace deal between Kiev and Moscow by publicly dismissing his proposals. In their latest meeting, held on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral last Saturday, the Ukrainian leader requested more weapons, the US president told the media, adding that“he has been saying that for three years.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told CBS last week that Moscow is interested in a relationship with the US which is based on“an equal, mutually respectful dialogue heading to finding a balance of interest.”With that approach,“everything is possible,”he added.",

    "title": "China denies Trump’s Xi call claim",
    "article_text": "China’s Foreign Ministry has refuted US President Donald Trump’s claim that he recently spoke with President Xi Jinping. Speaking to the press in Ceiling on Monday, the ministry noted that neither side is working toward a tariff agreement. In an interview with Time magazine published on Friday, the Trump claimed that his administration was in talks with China to reach a tariff agreement and that President Xi had called him. Beijing has repeatedly denied any such discussions are underway and accused Washington of“misleading the public.” “He’s called. And I don’t think that’s a sign of weakness on his behalf,”Trump said in the interview, referring to Xi. The American president did not say, however, when the call took place or specify what was discussed. “As far as I know, there have not been any calls between the two presidents recently,”Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters.“I would like to reiterate that China and the US have not conducted consultations or negotiations on the tariffs issue.” According to media reports, the Trump administration indicated it would consider lowering tariffs on certain Chinese imports, pending talks with Beijing. China, meanwhile, has maintained a firm position on tariffs, insisting that the US must cancel all“unilateral”penalties if it wishes to resolve any trade dispute with Beijing. Since last week, Trump has repeatedly claimed that his administration is engaged in trade talks with Chinese officials — only to be met each time with firm denials from Beijing. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs, including a 145% levy on Chinese imports, earlier this month, on what he dubbed“Liberation Day.” The move was part of a broader campaign targeting more than 90 countries in an effort to address what Trump described as unfair trade imbalances. While most of the new tariffs have been delayed for 90 days — with a baseline 10% tariff remaining in effect — China was excluded from the reprieve. In response, Beijing imposed 125% tariffs on US goods and introduced restrictions on key exports. Tensions between the world’s two largest economies have fueled global market volatility. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded its global growth forecast, citing trade uncertainty as a major drag on economic output. In its World Economic Outlook, the IMF projects global GDP growth at 2.8% for this year, down from 3.3% in 2024. It also lowered its forecast for US growth in 2025 to 1.8%, compared to 2.8% last year. Meanwhile, China’s economy is expected to slow to 4%, reflecting efforts to counter the impact of Washington’s tariffs.",

    "title": "Russia would help defend North Korea – Kremlin",
    "article_text": "Russia would surely help North Korea defend itself if such a need arises, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. On Saturday, Russian General Staff Chief Valery Gerasimov told President Vladimir Putin that North Korean troops had shown“high professionalism, courage, and heroism”assisting in the full liberation of Kursk Region, which had been invaded by Ukrainian forces last August. When asked by journalists on Monday if Moscow would also be ready to provide military support to Pyongyang, Peskov replied by saying:“definitely.” “Our agreement is in effect. Under this agreement, the parties are obligated to provide immediate assistance to each other if necessary,”he noted. The spokesman stressed that“the participation of [North] Korean soldiers in the operation to liberate Kursk Region has shown how effectively this agreement is functioning.” Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signed a compressive partnership treaty between Moscow and Pyongyang in June 2024. One of the articles of the agreement obliges one country to provide immediate military assistance by all available means to the other if its territory is attacked from abroad. Earlier on Monday, Putin expressed gratitude to Pyongyang’s troops for the role they played in repelling the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Region.“We appreciate the heroism, high level of specialized training and bravery of North Korean warriors, who defended our Homeland as their own, standing shoulder to shoulder with Russian fighters,”he said. According to the Russian president, the North Korean soldiers who lost their lives in the mission will be honored“on par with their Russian brothers in arms.” Earlier in the day, Pyongyang described Kiev’s troops which had entered Kursk Region as“neo-Nazi”forces and said it took part in the Russian operation in order to help thwart an“adventurous political and military attempt of the Western forces and the Ukrainian authorities”to turn the tide in the broader conflict. In a separate statement, Kim stressed that those who“fought for justice”in Kursk Region were“all heroes and representatives of the nation’s honor,”promising that a monument to them would soon be erected in Pyongyang.",

    "title": "Robots will outperform human surgeons in five years – Musk",
    "article_text": "Robots will soon replace human surgeons and are already capable of carrying out operations that are considered impossible for ordinary people to perform, Elon Musk has predicted. In a post on X on Saturday, the billionaire tech entrepreneur suggested that in just a“few years,”robots will surpass“good human surgeons”and will beat the best doctors within about five years. He noted that his Neuralink biotech company has already had to rely on robot surgeons to carry out the brain-computer electrode insertion of brain chips because the required speed and precision is“impossible for a human to achieve.” Musk’s comments came in response to a post by popular X influencer Mario Nawfal, who quoted an article about the rising success of robot surgeons such as the Medtronic ‘Hugo’. It is reported that the robot has already been tested in 137 real surgeries such as fixing prostates, kidneys, and bladders. “The results were better than doctors expected,”Nawfal said, noting that the complication rates were 3.7% for prostate surgeries, 1.9% for kidney operations, and 17.9% for bladder procedures. “The robots got a 98.5% success rate, way above the 85% goal,”the post claimed, adding that out of the 137 surgeries, only two needed to be taken back over by real doctors due to a glitch and because of a“tricky patient case.” Previously, Musk suggested that brain-computer interfaces like those being developed by Neuralink would replace technologies such as cell phones. Neuralink has already successfully implanted its brain chip – about the size of a coin – in three patients. After the procedure, they were able to control a computer cursor and play video games like chess and Counter-Strike using only their thoughts. One of the patients, who is non-verbal, was also able to use the device to communicate through an AI-generated voice clone. Musk has since announced plans to expand Neuralink’s clinical trials with the goal of implanting the brain chip in 20 to 30 more patients in 2025.",

    "title": "Two Gulf states make Syrian foreign debt pledge",
    "article_text": "Saudi Arabia and Qatar have pledged to pay off Syria’s outstanding debt to the World Bank. The move signals a Gulf-led initiative to support Syria’s economic recovery under the newly-installed government. The Gulf nations announced their commitment to cover the roughly $15 million in outstanding debt following discussions on postwar Syria on the sidelines of last week’s World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington. Power in Syria changed late last year, when the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir-al-Sham (HTS) launched a surprise offensive, taking Damascus and ousting former President Bashar Assad. HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa became president and formed a new transitional government in March. “This commitment will pave the way for the World Bank Group to resume support and operations in Syria after a suspension of more than 14 years,”Saudi Arabia and Qatar said in a joint statement on Sunday. The World Bank suspended its operations in Syria when the country’s civil war began in 2011. Settling the country’s arrears will allow the country to once again access the bank’s financial assistance and technical expertise at a time when its economy remains devastated, with GDP slashed by nearly 50% since 2010 and a reconstruction bill estimated at $400 billion. Both countries have played a critical role in the diplomatic outreach to Syria’s new interim government. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbors have increased humanitarian aid to Damascus recent months, but the debt settlement plan will mark the first instance of Saudi financial support being directed toward the country. Syria’s central bank governor and finance minister attended the World Bank and IMF meetings in Washington this week, marking their first participation in more than two decades. US sanctions, which have been in place since 2004 and target supporters of Assad, remain a major obstacle to Syria securing the aid it needs for reconstruction. Last month, the US presented Syria with a list of conditions for partial sanctions relief, according to Reuters. Among the demands, were the destruction of any remaining chemical weapons stockpiles and increased cooperation on countering terrorism. Russia has maintained ties with Syria’s new leadership despite granting Assad asylum after his ouster. Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated that his country is committed to helping improve Syria’s social and economic conditions, including through humanitarian aid. The new government in Damascus has also signaled its intention to preserve“strategic”relations with Moscow.",

    "title": "White House preparing for possible Trump-Kim talks – Axios",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s team is considering a new strategy for North Korea, potentially mirroring the diplomatic engagement of his first term, according to sources cited by Axios. Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in person multiple times, including in Singapore in 2018, Hanoi in 2019, and within the demilitarized zone on the Korean Peninsula later that same year. He is the first sitting US president ever to sit down at the negotiating table with his North Korean counterpart. Trump has told his team that he wants to reconnect with Kim, potentially face-to-face, Axios reported on Sunday. The administration is“convening agencies to understand where the North Koreans are today,”said a senior official speaking on condition of anonymity.“A lot has changed in the last four years. We are evaluating, diagnosing and talking about potential avenues, including engagement.” Currently, this initiative is not among the White House’s top priorities and involves consultations with external experts, including former officials and think tanks, the outlet said. Axios suggested that Washington holds less leverage over Pyongyang now than it did in the late 2010s, as North Korea has bolstered its military capabilities, including nuclear forces, and forged stronger ties with China and Russia. Last year, North Korea and Russia signed a bilateral treaty that includes mutual defense provisions. Shortly thereafter, Ukraine started an offensive into Russia’s Kursk Region, aiming to gain leverage over Moscow in future negotiations. North Korean troops were deployed to Russian territory to assist Moscow in repelling Ukrainian forces, culminating in the complete liberation of the region last week, according to Moscow. Over the weekend, President Vladimir Putin acknowledged the contribution of North Korean troops, commending their bravery and referring to them as brothers in arms. The Trump administration is seeking a compromise deal to end the Ukraine conflict. Trump has accused Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky of undermining his efforts by publicly challenging key aspects of what media outlets describe as his peace plan. The two leaders met on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral in the Vatican on Saturday, with Zelensky pleading for more US weapons, according to Trump.",

    "article_text": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov held a phone call on Sunday, in which they stressed the importance of further efforts to settle the Ukraine conflict, Moscow’s Foreign Ministry has said. The top diplomats from the two nations continued a“productive exchange of opinions on key aspects of the Russian-American political dialogue, which has significantly intensified recently,”the ministry said in a statement on Monday. The main topic of discussions between Lavrov and Rubio was the Ukraine crisis, the statement read. “The minister and the secretary of state emphasized the importance of consolidating the emerging prerequisites for starting negotiations in order to agree on a reliable path to long-term sustainable peace”between Moscow and Kiev, it said. Other international issues have also been addressed, and both sides have agreed to continue contacts at all levels, the Russian Foreign Ministry added. During his appearance on NBC News’ Meet the Press on Sunday, Rubio stressed that the upcoming week is expected to be“very critical”for the White House with regard to the Ukraine peace process, as it is trying to make a“determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in.” Washington does not want to walk away, but it also does not want to“spend time on something that is not going to get us there”either, he said.“There are reasons to be optimistic, but there are reasons to be realistic. We are close, but we are not close enough,”the Secretary of State added. US President Donald Trump, who met with Vladimir Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral on Saturday, said that the Ukrainian leader was“calmer. I think he understands the picture. And I think he wants to make a deal. I do not know if he wanted to make a deal [before]. I think he wants to make a deal.” Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov reiterated Moscow’s readiness to engage in talks with Kiev without preconditions. The issue was raised by Russian President Vladimir Putin during his meeting with Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Moscow on Friday, he said.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he believes Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky has come to terms with the need to recognize Crimea as part of Russia in order to achieve peace with Moscow. Zelensky has repeatedly insisted he would never formally recognize Moscow’s control over Crimea, which became part of Russia in 2014 afollowing a referendum held in the aftermath of a bloody Western-backed armed coup in Kiev. Trump, who met with the Ukrainian leader on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral at the Vatican on Saturday, was asked by journalists aboard Air Force One on Sunday if Zelensky was now prepared to“give up”the peninsula. ”Oh, I think so, yeah,”the US president replied. Trump said the tone of his latest exchange with Zelensky was markedly different compared to the“little dispute”they had at the Oval Office in February. Back then, the Ukrainian leader’s meeting with Trump and US Vice President J.D. Vance turned into a shouting match in front of the cameras and led to Zelensky’s visit to the White House being cut short. ”I see him [Zelensky] as calmer. I think he understands the picture. And I think he wants to make a deal. I do not know if he wanted to make a deal [before]. I think he wants to make a deal,”the president stated. Trump said Zelensky had told him“that he needs more weapons, but he has been saying that for three years.”The US president noted that Kiev is in a“very tough situation”and is fighting“a much bigger force.” He also called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to“stop shooting, sit down and sign a deal”to end the fighting. Moscow has said on numerous occasions that it is ready to begin talks with Kiev without any preconditions. However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted on Monday that so far Russia is not seeing any steps from Ukraine that would signal its eagerness to start negotiating. Russian officials have emphasized that any viable long-term settlement must address the root causes of the conflict and reflect the territorial realities on the ground, including Moscow’s control of Crimea as well as of the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk and Kherson and Zaporozhye regions.",

    "title": "Moderna risks UK suspension over cash and toys offered to kids – media",
    "article_text": "US ’big pharma’ company Moderna could be suspended or expelled from a UK trade body after breaches of industry rules, including offering children cash and teddy bears to take part in Covid vaccine trials, The Telegraph has reported. Moderna, which joined the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) in 2023, now faces an audit that could result in its suspension or expulsion. A new ruling is expected to be published in the coming days, according to The Telegraph. If sanctioned, it would become the tenth firm to face suspension from the ABPI in the past 40 years, the newspaper wrote. The UK’s drug watchdog, the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA), said Moderna’s lack of transparency was \"unacceptable\" and damaged the industry’s reputation. In October 2024, Moderna was fined £14,000 ($17,850) after a WhatsApp message offered £1,500 ($1,872) to minors to join the NextCOVE Covid booster trial. Although the company later reduced the payment to £185 ($231), at least one site continued promoting the original offer. The PMCPA said the payment was“much higher than would be considered a reasonable reimbursement”and ruled that it discredited the pharmaceutical industry. In a separate case, Moderna was fined nearly £44,000 ($56,000) after Britain’s pharmaceutical watchdog found it had damaged the industry’s reputation. In 2023, Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust published adverts aimed at children aged 12 and over, offering“a lovely certificate and a ‘be part of the research’ teddy bear.”Two online articles also promoted recruitment. A senior Moderna employee co-authored promotional articles, including one with former vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi, without disclosing his affiliation, the Telegraph reported. The employee also sent promotional tweets without revealing his role. The PMCPA said Moderna“misled regulators”about when it learned of the breaches. While the company claimed it acted promptly after being informed in January 2024, evidence showed executives had been alerted by UsForThem in August 2023. The findings showed“how readily [Moderna] put profit ahead of the health and safety of children”and“laid bare just how little regard it has had for the regulatory system that was supposed to keep it honest,”Molly Kingsley, founder of UsForThem, told the newspaper. COVID-19 vaccines, including Moderna’s Spikevax, may lead to side effects in minors, such as pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, fever, and, in rare cases, myocarditis or pericarditis, according to health authorities.",

    "article_text": "The death toll from the car-ramming attack at a Filipino festival in the Canadian city of Vancouver on Saturday has risen to 11, police have said. The suspect, Kai-Ji Adam Lo, 30, has been charged with eight counts of second-degree murder, with additional charges expected as the investigation continues. The incident occurred around 8:14pm near East 41st Avenue and Fraser Street, as the Lapu Lapu festival was concluding and barriers were being removed. Witnesses said a black SUV accelerated into the crowd, causing mass casualties. Bystanders detained the suspect before police arrived. The victims ranged in age from five to 65 years old, according to interim police chief Howard Rai. Thirty-two patients were treated at hospitals across the Lower Mainland, with 17 still hospitalized, some critically, the provincial Ministry of Health confirmed. Lo, a Vancouver resident, reportedly has a documented history of mental health issues. According to the Vancouver Sun, his family contacted a hospital psychiatric ward seeking help for him just hours before the attack. He was believed to be suffering from delusions and paranoia. Police stated that the incident is not being investigated as terrorism-related. Last year, Lo’s brother, Alexander, was murdered in Vancouver. Following his brother’s death, Lo wrote about his grief and his mother’s suicide attempt on a fundraising page. The suspect appeared in court on Sunday, did not request bail, and remains in custody. His next court appearance is scheduled for May 26. Police have established a 24-hour assistance center at Douglas Park Community Centre for families of victims. The Lapu Lapu Day festival honors a Filipino hero who resisted Spanish colonization. Organizers said the Filipino community would show“true resilience”following the tragedy.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky was“calmer”during their meeting in the Vatican at the weekend and seemed more open to making a deal with Moscow than during their infamous encounter in the Oval Office. Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said the tone of his latest discussion with Zelensky was markedly different from their“little dispute”in February, which saw the Ukrainian delegationkicked outof the White House. “I see him as calmer. I think he understands the picture. And I think he wants to make a deal. I don’t know if he wanted to make a deal [before]. I think he wants to make a deal,”Trump said. Earlier this week, Trump told Time magazine that“Crimea will stay with Russia”under any peace agreement, noting that even Zelensky“understands”the reality, despite public declarations to the contrary. Asked whether he believed Zelensky was now prepared to“give up”the peninsula, Trump responded:“Oh, I think so, yeah.” Zelensky has repeatedly and publicly insisted that Kiev would never formally recognize Crimea as Russian territory – a position Trump has previously criticized as“very harmful to the peace negotiations.” Despite portraying Zelensky as someone who wants to do“something good for the country,”Trump revealed that the Ukrainian leader again asked Washington for more military support. “He told me that he needs more weapons, but he has been saying that for three years,”Trump stated. The US president noted that Kiev was in a“very tough situation,”fighting“a much bigger force”— and emphasized that“it helped them when we gave them $350 billion worth of weapons or cash.” “He needs more weapons, and we are gonna see what happens with respect to Russia,”Trump added, noting that he was“disappointed”with Moscow’s renewed strikes in Ukraine. Following a brief lull in fighting during the Easter ceasefire announced by President Vladimir Putin last weekend, the Russian military carried out multiple long-range strikes against Ukrainian military and industrial targets over the past week. Moscow has maintained that it targets only military installations and facilities used by Kiev’s forces, rejecting accusations of deliberately striking civilian sites. Moscow has also reiterated its readiness for discussions with Kiev without preconditions. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the issue was raised during a meeting between President Putin and Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, on Friday. Russian officials have emphasized that any viable long-term settlement must reflect the territorial realities on the ground and address the root causes of the conflict. According to multiple reports, Washington’s proposal seeks to freeze the conflict along the current front lines and recognize Crimea as part of Russia. However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that – unlike Zelensky – Moscow does not intend to discuss confidential details of talks with the US until the process is completed.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump allegedly told his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, to step aside before having a one-on-one conversation with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky, according to a professional lip reader cited by British media. The impromptu meeting took place on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral on Saturday. Footage from the Vatican showed Zelensky walking toward the seating area with Trump, glancing back several times, seemingly expecting the French leader to join. Three chairs were set up, suggesting plans for a three-way discussion. As the French president approached, Zelensky greeted him warmly with a smile and a hand gesture. However, just moments later, a staff member discreetly removed the third chair. Footage showed Trump gesturing firmly, signaling that the conversation would proceed strictly between him and Zelensky, while Macron eventually stepped back. Speaking to The Sun on Sunday, Nicola Hickling, a British entrepreneur specializing in lipreading and expert witness reports, described the exchange. “Donald reaches his hands out to both of them and brings them towards him,”she said. Trump then reportedly told Macron:“You are not in the right here, I need you to do me a favor, you should not be here.” According to Hickling, Zelensky then“nods in agreement and the vicar who is in front of the camera turns his head to the side looking worried at what he has heard between them.” French diplomatic sources have played down the frosty exchange, insisting that Macron had no intention of joining the discussion.“People have got their brains in a twist over the third chair. (It) was supposed to be for the interpreter, but in the end it turned into a tete-a-tete,”an unnamed source told The Telegraph. The brief meeting in Vatican marked the first face-to-face encounter between Trump and Zelensky since theirclash at the White Housein February. Their discussion took place as the US president has been pressing Kiev to accept what the media described as his“final offer”to end hostilities. According to reports, Washington has proposed freezing the conflict along the current front lines and recognizing Crimea as part of Russia — something Zelensky has repeatedly rejected. While Trump is eager to secure a ceasefire as soon as possible in order to deliver on his campaign promise, Macron has consistently insisted that any peace deal must guarantee Ukraine’s“sovereignty and territorial integrity,”contributing to rising tensions between Washington and Paris. Meanwhile, Moscow has once againreiteratedits readiness for discussions with Kiev without preconditions. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed the topic was brought up by Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting with Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, on Friday.",

    "article_text": "Podcasts Podcasts Can a full-time mum take on politics? Stephanie Tan, a former lawyer turned stay-at-home mum and now PSP candidate for Pioneer SMC, certainly believes so. After years of being a lawyer, Stephanie Tan became a stay-at-home mum to care for her two daughters. She has used her experience in law to help the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) with their parliamentary work over the last two years. Now a first-time candidate contesting Pioneer SMC, Stephanie tells Otelli Edwards how party chairman Dr Tan Cheng Bock inspired her to join politics and how being a parent helps her connect better with residents. Here is an excerpt from the conversation: Otelli Edwards, host:So what do you say to people when you told them you wanted to join PSP (Progress Singapore Party), and I'm sure you probably get that, (say) wouldn't it be easier if you just joined PAP (People's Action Party) and try and change from within?Stephanie Tan, PSP candidate for Pioneer SMC:Yes, but I have my doubts about whether that would work out, to go in and change things from within ... So there are so many things I feel to go against if I were to do that. In fact, I think this is what the Singapore Parliament needs right now.Otelli:So what about those people who perhaps say, then if you want to join the opposition, the biggest opposition party would be the Workers’ Party, for instance. Why not go that way?Stephanie:Dr Tan (Cheng Bock) featured in my decision to join PSP. So I've heard about him, and I've seen what he stands for, that he's somebody who's courageous enough to speak up. Even when he was in the PAP he did speak up when he felt that certain decisions were not right and he disagreed with. So that to me is very important. (Having) independent thinking, (an) independent mind is something that's very important to me. So I would like to be able to have that, and continue to have that, to always be able to make decisions based on my own research, the information that I gather and to form a viewpoint of my own.Otelli:So what is the biggest advice Dr Tan has given you?

Loans worth $1.2 billion have been sold at 98 cents on the dollar, paying a yield of 9.5 per cent, the source added. Musk's close relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump and prospects of X's improving revenue have allowed banks to offload almost all of the $13 billion they had been holding on their books for nearly two years. The acquisition was funded by a $6.5 billion secured term loan, a $500 million revolving credit facility, a $3 billion unsecured loan and $3 billion of secured loans.

    "title": "Trump to reduce impact of auto tariffs, commerce secretary says",
    "article_text": "World World A drone view shows cars on the day US President Donald Trump is set to announce new tariffs, at the Port of Baltimore, Maryland, US on Apr 2, 2025. (File photo: REUTERS/Evelyn Hocksteinr) WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump's administration will move to reduce theimpact of his automotive tariffson Tuesday (Apr 29) by alleviating some duties imposed on foreign parts in domestically manufactured cars and keeping tariffs on cars made abroad from piling on top of other ones, officials said. \"President Trump is building an important partnership with both the domestic automakers and our great American workers,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement provided by the White House. \"This deal is a major victory for the President's trade policy by rewarding companies who manufacture domestically, while providing runway to manufacturers who have expressed their commitment to invest in America and expand their domestic manufacturing.” The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the development, said the move meant car companies paying tariffs would not be charged for other levies, such as those onsteel and aluminum, and that reimbursements would be given for such tariffs that were already paid. A White House official confirmed the report and indicated the move would be made official on Tuesday. Trump is travelling to Michigan on Tuesday to commemorate his first 100 days in office, a period that the Republican president has used to upend the global economic order. The move to soften the effects of auto levies is the latest by his administration to show some flexibility on tariffs, which havesown turmoil in financial markets, created uncertainty for businesses and sparked fears of a sharp economic slowdown. Automakers said earlier on Monday they were expecting Trump to issue relief from the auto tariffs ahead of his trip to Michigan, which is home to the Detroit Three automakers and more than 1,000 major auto suppliers. Last week, a coalition of US auto industry groups urged Trump not to impose 25 per cent tariffs on imported auto parts, warning they would cut vehicle sales and raise prices. Trump had said earlier he planned to impose tariffs of 25 per cent on auto parts no later than May 3. \"Tariffs on auto parts will scramble the global automotive supply chain and set off a domino effect that will lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive and less predictable,\" the industry groups said in the letter. The letter from the groups representing General Motors, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai and others, was sent to US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce's Lutnick. \"Most auto suppliers are not capitalised for an abrupt tariff-induced disruption. Many are already in distress and will face production stoppages, layoffs and bankruptcy,\" the letter added, noting \"it only takes the failure of one supplier to lead to a shutdown of an automaker's production line\".

    "title": "Do we really need 10 layers of skincare in 2025? How to maximise your beauty routine with fewer products",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Obsessions Trending People Living Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Dining Experiences Dining Dining Experiences Obsessions Experiences Experiences Style & Beauty Style & Beauty With hybrid formulas, new product categories, and facial devices in the mix, the way we layer skincare is evolving – here’s how you can get the most out of your routine. How to layer your skincare correctly. (Photo: iStock) This audio is generated by an AI tool. For years, we've followed the golden rule of layering skincare from the lightest to the heaviest texture. But with the rise of hybrid formulations – think oil-in-serums and gel-like creams – does this rule still apply? And with multi-step routines growing increasingly elaborate, do we really need 10 layers of skincare products, or can we streamline without sacrificing results? To clear the confusion, we spoke with Dr Uma Alagappan, medical director and consultant dermatologist at The Dermatology Clinic, to break down how to layer skincare correctly in 2025, which products actually deserve a spot in your routine, and why sometimes, less is more. Yes, says Dr Alagappan. The logic remains the same: “It facilitates absorption into the skin”. Understanding how different skincare formulations interact with your skin is crucial to layering them effectively. Here’s a quick guide: Hybrid formulations may combine multiple textures, but Dr Alagappan confirms that they do not override thefundamentallight-to-heavyprinciple.She explains that hybrids are designed to enhance product penetration and minimise side effects. For example, an oil-in-serum blends the nourishing properties of an oil with the fast-absorbing benefits of a serum – making it less likely to cause breakouts or irritation. Meanwhile, gel-like creams are lightweight yet hydrating. Depending on your skin type, you can layer them either as a serum or as a light moisturiser to lock in hydration without overloading the skin. However, incorrect layering can make hybrids less effective.“Applying a thicker moisturiser before a hybrid formulation like oil-in-serum will reduce its absorption, negating its benefits,” warned Dr Alagappan. Since some hybrids blur the lines between traditional textures, a little flexibility and judgment are required when it comes to layering these formulations. She recommends these simple layering hacks: Try:Clarins Precious Oil-in-Serum, S$520.Available atClarins. Try:It Cosmetics Confidence In a Gel Cream Ultra-Light Skin-Balancing Moisturizer, S$90.Available atSephora. With essences, mists, emulsions, and endless new categories hitting the market, it’s easy to feel like every product is essential. But Dr Alagappan believes in keeping things simple: \"The key is to focus on your skincare goals and skin type while maintaining a basic foundation. I always start with a good cleanser, moisturiser, and sunscreen in the morning. Once these building blocks are in place, then I address specific concerns like acne or pigmentation – especially at night.”\" And if you’re wondering whether a multi-step routine – like the 10-step K-beauty routine – is scientifically superior, the answer is no. \"A complicated skincare routine can be more detrimental rather than beneficial. Instead of counting steps, it is more prudent to focus on key ingredients tailored to your skin type and needs,\" she said. Dr Alagappan emphasises that a complicated routine can irritate the skin. “Skin absorption has its limits, and overloading the skin can cause acne breakouts. Over-exfoliation can also lead to impaired barrier function and accelerate the ageing process.” Your AM and PM skincare routines serve different purposes, so their steps should be tailored accordingly. Morning routine: Protect and hydrate Your AM routine should focus on preparing your skin for the day ahead – hydration and UV protection are key. Dr Alagappan recommends the following: Night routine: Repair and treat In the evening, your priority should be on removing buildup and targeting concerns: For eye creams, Dr Alagappan prefers applying them at night after serums but before moisturisers. If fine lines are a concern, a light eye cream in the morning may also help. Potent ingredients like Vitamin C, retinoids, and chemical exfoliants can work wonders – when used correctly. According to Dr Alagappan, the golden rule is to go slow and steady. “Start slowly with the lowest concentration and use tiny amounts to ease them into the skincare routine,” she advised. “Overuse of actives is a very common mistake that will end very badly for the skin.” She suggests using actives at night, after cleansing and applying a toner (if applicable), and always follow with a moisturiser. Start using actives once a week, before gradually increasing it to two to three times per week if your skin tolerates it well. With more people using LED masks, ultrasound wands, and microcurrent devices, the question arises: When should they be used in a skincare routine? “Facial devices should be used after cleansing and before any actives or moisturisers,” said Dr Alagappan. Their goal is to enhance absorption, so using them before potent ingredients can boost their effectiveness. “Follow the manufacturer’s instructions. For example, the use of light serums can help some ultrasonic wands to glide more smoothly and improves conductivity.” She advises caution when using these devices with actives. “The facial devices can be quite powerful and the concentration of products, especially actives, should be toned down significantly to prevent irritation.” “It’s best to consult a dermatologist before incorporating the facial devices into your skincare regime, or stick to hydrating serums or moisturisers on device days,” she added.

    "title": "Gaza ceasefire talks in Cairo near 'significant breakthrough', two security sources say",
    "article_text": "World World A Palestinian man sits on debris while covering his face with his hand at the site of an Israeli strike on a house, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on Apr 28, 2025. (Photo: REUTERS/Hatem Khaled) CAIRO: Negotiations held in Cairo to reach a ceasefire in Gaza were on the verge of a \"significant breakthrough\", two Egyptian security sources told Reuters on Monday (Apr 28). There was no immediate comment from Israel and Hamas. Axios reporter Barak Ravid said in a brief post on X that an Israeli official denied the reported breakthrough, without giving further details. The Egyptian sources said there was a consensus on a long-term ceasefire in the besieged enclave, yet some sticking points remain, including Hamas arms. Hamas repeatedly said it was not willing to lay down its arms, a key demand by Israel. Earlier, Egyptian state-affiliated Al Qahera News TV reported that Egyptian intelligence chief General Hassan Mahmoud Rashad was set to meet an Israeli delegation headed by strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer on Monday in Cairo. The sources said the ongoing talks included Egyptian and Israeli delegations. Mediators Egypt and Qatar did not report developments on the latest talks. Qatar Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said on Sunday that a recent meeting in Doha on efforts to reach a ceasefiremade some progress, but noted there was no agreement yet on how to end the war.He said the militant group is willing to return all remaining Israeli hostages if Israel ends the war in Gaza. But Israel wants Hamas to release the remaining hostages without offering a clear vision on ending the war, he added. The media adviser for the Hamas leadership, Taher Al-Nono, told Reuters on Saturday that the group was open to a years-long truce with Israel in Gaza, adding that the group hoped to build support among mediators for its offer. Speaking at a conference in Jerusalem on Monday night, before Reuters reported that there had been progress in the talks, Dermer said the government remained committed to dismantling Hamas' military capability, ending its rule in Gaza, ensuring that the enclave never again poses a threat to Israel and returning the hostages. Israel resumed its offensive in Gaza on Mar 18 after a January ceasefire collapsed, saying it would keep up pressure on Hamas until it frees the remaining hostages still held in the enclave. Up to 24 of them are believed to be still alive. The Gaza war started after Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, attack which killed 1,200 people and resulted in 251 hostages being taken to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel's offensive on the enclave killed more than 52,000, according to local Palestinian health officials.

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Unless you've been training for amarathonor are truly dedicated to clocking your miles, then chances are you haven't beenrunningoutside for a minute. Well, athletes, we're happy to report that spring is in full swing, and your stride's ready to come out of hibernation—that is, if you have the right running gear for spring. Stow away yourfleece, your wintertights, and yourrunning gloves, because it's time to bare arms, legs, and maybe even your torso again to get those outdoor running sessions back in. From your shorts to your tops, here's the best spring running gear to catch new PR's and not seasonal allergies. Shortsand running go together like, well, shorts and running. Even if you've committed to onlywearing shorts during those winter runs, now's the prime time to let the legs breathe. Look for bottoms that don't restrict your movements, and decide whether or not you want them to include compression linings. And best of all: Look for something with pockets, especially if you have a bunch of things—phone, earbuds, keys—you want to bring with you. Ten Thousand Ten Thousand Thanks to the un-bunchable, pinch-free waistband and extremely flexible shell, these shorts mold to your body but also shift easily with your movement. These do-it-all shorts can work for all types of workouts, and they'll be right by your side (or on your bottoms) while you're hitting those PR's. Bandit Bandit Bandit's Vento shorts make an exceptional running buddy, decked out in more pockets than we're used to seeing in a pair of jogging bottoms. Two compression pockets (big enough to fit “the big” iPhone), two side slant pockets, and a zippered pocket ensure you have everything on your long-distance runs, while the overall look ensures that passersby know you take your running 'fits seriously. Tank? Long-sleeve? Topless? Listen, you're going to be working up a sweat no matter what, so the best thing you can do is to find ashirtthat'll keep that sweat from interfering with your workout. Bonus points for the shirts that don't stink after an especially long and sweaty run. Tracksmith Tracksmith Tracksmith has carved out its own niche in the running community for its preppy New England athletic apparel—think Prefontaine-era silhouettes with a dash of retro Ivy League style. Its Van Cortlandt tee is one of the brand's most popular styles because of its iconic sash motif, but it's also just a great top for working out in. It feels good on the skin, even during long-distance runs, and it'll keep you cool while helping to quickly wick away your sweat. Bandit Bandit Bandit's Micromesh performance tee is best for people like me—because of its construction, it won't cling to your sticky skin, while the anti-odor properties won't have your gym bros keeping their distance from you when you're in need of a spotter. Its hole-y construction makes it super breathable, though we don't recommend wearing this if it's windy out, because youwillget chilly. In the winter, you had to worry about packing your headlight and hi-vis running gear. Now, in the summer, it's all about making sure the sun doesn't blind you. Our favoriterunning sunglasseskeep the sun's rays from blinding you while looking cool—despite all the sweat dripping from your pores. Article One Huckberry Beloved byRyan Goslingand the winner of our Best Sports Sunglasses of the Year, the Article One x Mission Workshop Sunglasses also receive our top billing here. The aviator-like shades are stylish enough to give you movie-star wattage but also sporty enough to keep you in the pocket of a run. Plus, they’re super durable thanks to the Hexetate construction, which helps them stay resistant to heavy wear and tear. Cubitts Cubitts Soar Running's one of the cooler running brands these days, and it recently collaborated with the spectacle pros at Cubitts on the Cirrus sunnies. They're crazy lightweight, clocking in at 10 grams thanks to the titanium frame that manages to be flexible yet durable. Plus, that RiPel Zeiss shield lens protects from wind and dirt while offering the utmost clarity. It's time to ditch the beanies. The best warm-weatherrunning hatskeep your head from overheating, letting sweat evaporate quickly and also keeping hair from tickling your forehead or getting into your eyes. Ciele Athletics Amazon Ciele’s GoCap is the gold standard in the industry. The brand uses a combination of highly technical fabrics and materials to make its hats well-suited to any activity, chiefly among them their COOLmatic mesh technology that regulates body temperature no matter how brutally hot out it is. Engineered for all seasons, the recycled polyester fabric throughout the body of the cap is a material called “Repreve,” which is a ripstop-like fabric that is super durable and flexible, which makes the GoCap easy to pack and even easier to wear. Bandit Bandit Bandit Running’s OG Mesh Run Hat is basically like driving down the 405 with the roof off, but for running. The brand recently revamped the cap with better fabric and a little bit more oompf to the brim, so it’ll keep its shape while maintaining what works: that sweet, sweet breathability. OK, OK, we know it's spring, but Mother Nature likes to throw a curveball every now and then, so if your run's going to be on the cooler side one day, make sure you're properly layering with an excellentrunning jacket. Plus, you can always shed layers as you start to warm up. District Vision District Vision We’re big fans ofDistrict Vision here atGQ, and this pullover half zip is the perfect exemplification of why. The highly water-resistant shell is made from a lightweight 155 gsm shell fabric and also features reflective detailing in the piping across the arms, chest, and sternum piping. The hardest thing to convey about this jacket, though, is howgreatit feels to wear it; it’s so comfortable and, for most runners, will hit all the boxes of what they’re looking for in a shell layer. Satisfy Running Mohawk Satisfy makes some of the coolest and most tech-forward running gear around, as displayed by this Pertex rain jacket. Clad in a handful ofexcellentcolors, including a neon green that I tested for this piece, the Fly Rain Jacket is every kind of “-proof:” windproof, waterproof, and windproof—none of the elements are slowing you down. But it’s also highly breathable, super light (it’s the lightest shell in this roundup), and super packable.",

    "title": "22 Best Suit Brands for Men 2025, from Armani to Zegna",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The best suit brands are experts in their field, and when you slip on one of their creations you should feel transformed. You might stand a little taller, your back a little straighter, your chest a little broader, like you’re literally bursting with swagger. (Go ahead, give yourself a flirty little Austin Butler-esque look in the mirror.) Sounds pretty good, right? Here's the thing: A suit is always going to look best if it’s made especially for you, and there are plenty of bespoke tailoring houses, everywhere from Savile Row to Milan, which will do just that. (Anderson & Sheppard,Henry Poole & Co.,Rubinacci, andLiverano & Liverano, to name a few.) But those brands are unavailable off-the-rack and have little online presence, and bespoke suits are expensive and can take forever to deliver. Thankfully, there are plenty of great off-the-rack options, too. Before you keep scrolling, though, a few things to keep in mind. And, perhaps most important, never rush into buying one. Suits are an investment, and they should last you years. So get that Austin Butler face ready, bud, because the names you need to know the next time you're suit shopping are all right here. Giorgio Armani was already an accomplished Italian designer when he launched his eponymous brand in 1975. Five years later, Armani was tasked with outfitting Richard Gere inAmerican Gigolo, and the house has been synonymous with Hollywood glamour ever since.The suits Gere wore then, with their gently-padded shoulders and cinched waists, became a symbol of the era’s masculine style—and effectively broke Armani stateside. But in the '90s, the designer pivoted to a lookhe considered more “sincere”, stripping his suits of their structured underpinning and stultifying corporate machismo. Today, Armani suits tend to be slim and sleek, butthe influence of his heyday remains. Giorgio Armani Armani Giorgio Armani Saks Fifth Avenue Ralph Lauren might've started his brand hawking ties from a drawer in the Empire State Building, but his ambitions were obvious from the start. Today, his empire encompasses a half-dozen or so sub-labels, Polo most prominent among them. Polo serves up classic American sportswear and ur-prep staples with a subtly cosmopolitan twist; tailoring from the line includes flannel three-pieces, conservativenavy sack suits, and a killer selection ofentry-level tuxedos. Suits from RRL, Ralph's ode to the American west, skew vintage in inspiration: think chunkier glen plaids, herringbone linens, and beefy tweeds. Thene plus ultraof Ralph Lauren's tailoring prowess, though, is Purple Label, launched in 1994 and heavily inspired by old-world European glamor. If the vibe reminds you of the suits Robert Redford wore in the 1974 version ofThe Great Gatsby—handmade, elegant, tailored to a T—the effect is intentional: Ralph designed the costumes for the film. Polo Ralph Lauren Ralph Lauren Polo Ralph Lauren Ralph Lauren You know a Thom Browne suit when you see one. It's no exaggeration to say that the New York designer upended the industry when he introduced his shrunken gray suit in the early 2000s, a now-signature silhouette with shortened pants (sometimes just shorts!) and square-shaped jackets, equipped with the brand’s telltale red, white, and blue trim. These days, Browne sells a riff that isn't quite as severe, but the house specialty remains as popular—and immediately identifiable—as ever. Whowouldn'twant to jointhe coolest clique in fashion? Thom Browne Nordstrom Thom Browne Thom Browne Tom Ford's tailoring is all about confidence—witha healthy dose of sex appealadded to the mix, for good measure. Suiting has moved more casual in recent years, but the brand sticks to what’s always worked: padded shoulders, traditional fabrics, masculine silhouettes. Ford is no longer at the helm of the company that bears his name, but hisuncompromising, elevated taste remains its foundation. Tom Ford Tom Ford Tom Ford Tom Ford For nearly two centuries, Brooks Brothers wasthename in American men’s fashion, introducing ready-to-wear to the masses in 1849. In 2020, the company filed for bankruptcy, but under the leadership of creative director (and all-around menswear OG) Michael Bastian, the brand has re-established itself by looking towards its storied past. Today you’ll find sturdy, classic American suits at prices that make its European counterparts shake. Brooks Brothers Brooks Brothers Brooks Brothers Brooks Brothers J.Crew has lived a hundred lives over the last decade or so, but the Ludlow,it's era-defining slim-but-not-skinny suit, continues to sell like hot cakes on a cold winter day. It's not hard to see why: if you're on a tight budget, it remains a platonic starter suit for everyday wear, and comes in a range of can't-miss fabrics and colors. Looking for a slightly less corporate vibe? Under Brendon Babenzien, the ex-Supreme designerresponsible for the Crew's menswear reboot, the brand introduced the Kenmare, analtogether more relaxed silhouettewith a slouchier jacket and single pleated trousers. (J.Crew’s third offering, the Crosby, sits squarely between the Ludlow and the Kenmare; it's a reliable mainstay of GQ's tailoring coverage, too.) J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew Like plenty of the other names in this category, Todd Snyder, thepatron saint of approachable menswear,makes a whole lot more than suits. But Snyder's tailoring remains a consistent highlight of his line, straddling the divide between big-box and Bergdorf Goodman. His selection of suits includes standard 9-to-5 garb,gutsier cocktail attire fare, and the rare surprisingly dialed—and surprisingly affordable—off-the-rack tuxedo. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder VeteranAtlanta haberdasher Sid Mashburnsells suits that look like you’ve owned them your entire life. To make the process easy, Mashburn categorizes each line by numbers, from the casual, unconstructed No. 1 to the handmade, two-canvas No. 4. Like good jazz, it’s all about improvising and seeing where the groove takes you—Sid simply wants you to have as much fun getting capital-D Dressedas he does. Sid Mashburn Mr Porter Sid Mashburn Sid Mashburn When New York City's best-compensated fellas are in the market for a custom suit—for their wedding, their promotion, their weekend date night—they tend to go to J. Mueser. For good reason, too—master tailor Jake Mueserfounded his eponymous labelin 2008, and has since established what might plausibly be called a distinctly New York style of tailoring. He likes to think of his suits as “melting pots” of influences: natural American shoulders, natty English ticket pockets, generous Italian lapels. For your purposes here, all that really matters is that his note-perfect suits are now available to order online—in the ideal shade of chocolate-brown, no less. J. Mueser Mr Porter J. Mueser Mr Porter J. Mueser Mr Porter J. Mueser Mr Porter Close your eyes and picture a college campus in the 1950s. All those chinos, oxford shirts, and tweed jackets? That’s J. Press in a nutshell.

Exhibit A: its impressive selection of off-the-rack suits, made in the USA with English and Italian fabrics. J. Press J. Press J. Press J. Press As its name suggests, London-based Anglo-Italian merges the tradition of English sartorialism with the ease and comfort of Italian tailoring. Its suits lean soft, casual, and unstructured, and the brand also produces a whole wardrobe of things to wear them with—shirts, shoes, ties, and more. The reputation for impeccable customer service—and dedication to craftsmanship—certainly doesn't hurt. Anglo-Italian Anglo-Italian Anglo-Italian Anglo-Italian Stockholm's Saman Amel only launched in 2015, but in less than a decade it has carved out a niche selling discreet made-to-measure suits sourced with fabrics from some of the best mills in the world. In recent years, its strategic push into off-the-rack tailoring has yielded suits cut with the same attention to proportion and premium fabrications—think notch lapel two-pieces made from blanket-soft wool and cashmere blends. Saman Amel Mr Porter Saman Amel Mr Porter Saman Amel Mytheresa Saman Amel Mytheresa Osaka’s Ring Jacket was founded in 1954 by insurance salesman Jhoichi Fukushima, who was frustrated with off-the-rack options of his time. 70 years later, Ring Jacket offers a veritable buffet of suiting flavors, combining influences of Japanese, British, American, and Italian tailoring in a line of expertly-constructed designs. So much so, in fact, that theclassic menswear experts at The Armourynow offer a range of exclusive models made by Ring Jacket just for them. Ring Jacket The Armoury Ring Jacket The Armoury Drake’s seems to be on everyone’s moodboard these days, and for good reason: the British brand's de-fussed riff on classic menswear has helped it corner the marketon ultra-premium prep. Take, for example, the Games suit, which Drake's creative director Michael Hill credits with turbo-charging the label's fortunes. Expertly designed for casual wear, it looks just as killer with a striped oxford shirt and chukkas as it does a foulard tie and brogues. It's a tricky matrix to operate in, but Drake's makes it feel as approachable as its clubby storefronts. Drake's Drake's Drake's Drake's Drake's SSENSE Drake's SSENSE Matt Lambert has always been a suit guy, and ever since the Sid Mashburn alum launched Factor’s in 2021, a lot more fellashave signed on to his agenda. His suits come imbued with a jolt of tempered ‘70s flair, thanks to their wide lapels, high-waisted trousers, and strong-shouldered, loose-fitting jackets. They're as classic as they are chill—a tricky-to-nail combination purpose-built for today's tastes. Factor's Factor's Factor's Factor's Stòffa’s suits are preternaturally relaxed—you could easily confuse one of the brand's unstructured suit jackets for a pajama shirt, in the best way possible.

To say that Serge Gainsbourg would look perfectly at home in one of Husband's double-breasted suits is true, but doesn't quite dothe GQ-favorite brand justice: the vibe might be retro, but the cut—sharp, feline, ready to boogie—feels extremely right now. Husbands Husbands Husbands Husbands Giuliva Heritage is not for the faint of heart—or the light of pocket. Partners Margherita Cardelli and Gerardo Cavaliere only expanded into menswear in 2019, but they've already accrued an enviable roster of big-name fans, who favor the Roman brand's eclectic take on Italian style. Its ready-to-wear suits, often sold as separates, are unabashedlyswaggering: Ferrari-red shawl collar dinner jackets, high-waisted trousers with a duo of deep pleats, and double-breasted blazers finished with peak lapels that stretch towards the heavens. Giuliva Heritage Giuliva Heritage Giuliva Heritage Giuliva Heritage Giuliva Heritage Giuliva Heritage Giuliva Heritage Giuliva Heritage Brioni suits are no-nonsense Italian elegance at its finest. Born in 1945 as a little shop in the heart of Rome, the brand and its founders—master tailor Nazareno Fonticoli and his business partner, Gaetano Savini—initially specialized in bespoke, eventually becoming a favorite of the jet-setting elite and Hollywood A-listers. (Brad Pitt is an especially ardent fan.) Long before stealth wealth was trending on TikTok, the Roman suiting brand was committed to selling the very best version if it. Brioni Neiman Marcus Brioni Bergdorf Goodman Sovico-based Canali is another Italian suiting brand with a rich history, one that stretches back nearly a century. Its price point is a tier below Brioni, but it boasts a similar a reputation for quality, fabric, and quiet, boardroom-friendly style. Canali suits predominately feature relaxed silhouettes and lightweight fabrics, made using the type of traditional Italian tailoring techniques you'd expect. Canali Nordstrom Canali Nordstrom Cashmere King Brunello Cucinelli builthis multi-billion dollar kingdomin the tiny town of Solomeo (population: 400). Despite the tech titanswho flock to his brand in droves, running an ethical, sustainable business is core to his identity; each year, Cucinelli re-invests 20% of the brand’s profits into the upkeep of the town. His suits skew elegant, casual, and look even better as separates—an earthy-brown linen sportcoat paired with, say, eggshell-white cotton trousers. Cucinelli’s wares don't come cheap, but they're unfussy, unpretentious, and about as laid-back as a $6,000 suit gets. Brunello Cucinelli Bergdorf Goodman Brunello Cucinelli Neiman Marcus Ermenegildo Zegna, an entrepreneurial 18-year-old suiting whiz, founded his eponymous brand in 1910. Since then, the tailoring house that bears his name has become famous for its obsession with fabric, commandeering its production chain from “sheep to shop”. Today, Zegna retains its classic Italian essence, but isn’t afraidto adapt with the times; in 2021, it introduced a suit explicitly designed for the home office, with a cashmere jacket tailored to drape like a robe. It offers plenty of off-the-rack options for work and play—and the increasingly-blurry line between. Zegna Nordstrom Zegna Nordstrom",

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If panicked searches have led you here, allow us to assure you: Yes, there are vitamins forhair growth. We get it: The feeling of panic when you run your hand through your hair, and realize there’s less of it, is real. But before you book yourself a plane ticket to Turkey in search of a hair transplant, first ask yourself if your diet or vitamin intake could be a contributing factor. When ourhair shows signs of thinningor loss (or even loss of shine and color) our bodies’ vitamin levels may have had some part to play. But, of course, not all vitamins are created equal and all have their pros and cons. So pause that flight, take off thebaseball capand read our guide—informed by four hair-growth experts—on how to fight hair loss, whatvitamins to take, and what to do next. Before you panic, assess thehair losswarning signs and see if they apply to you. Remember: Hair loss or thinning looks a little different on everyone. “The first signs of hair loss can be hard to notice at first,” says Dr. Sepideh Etemad-Shahidi, an aesthetics specialist atDoctor Tatiana + Rishi. “You might notice your hair feeling thinner or more brittle, or find more strands than usual coming out on your pillow, in your brush, or in the shower. Men tend to notice a receding hairline or thinning at the crown is a common early sign.\" Different signs can mean different causes, Etemad-Shahidi says. “If you're losing hair in patches or developing bald spots, this could be a sign of something like alopecia, which is an autoimmune condition. Changes in hair texture, like hair feeling dry or rough, are also signs that something might be affecting your hair's health.” If you’re not sure, book in to see a specialist. “Our hair is a good barometer of our overall health, and nutrition plays a critical role in growth and quality,” says Kieran Tudor, hair stylist and co-founder of hair care brandCentred. “Vitamins provide your hair follicles with the nutrients they need to produce strong, healthy strands. Think of it this way: Your scalp is like soil, and your hair is the plant—it needs the right nutrients to thrive. “For men, this is particularly important as hormonal changes and genetics can contribute to hair thinning or loss, and a nutrient-rich diet or supplementation can help combat this,” Tudor says. “The thing to remember is that there’s no one magic vitamin that is best for healthy hair, it’s actually the combination of vitamins, minerals, proteins and amino acids that produces optimal hair and scalp health. You can find all of these in good quality hair supplements.” Your hair and its growth is complex, and lots of vitamins and minerals go into making it healthy and strong. Therefore, there are several options of vitamins which can help. Dr. Manish Mittal, the lead hair transplant surgeon atMittal Hair Clinic in London, breaks them down for you: Benefits:Known as the “hair vitamin,” biotin improves keratin production, which is essential for strong, shiny hair. It’s particularly helpful if you experience breakage or thinning due to poor nutrition. Cons:Over-supplementing biotin can lead to skin breakouts and may interfere with some lab test results. Amazon Elements Amazon NutraChamps Amazon Benefits:Low levels of vitamin D are linked to hair loss, particularly seasonal shedding in winter. Supplementing this vitamin can strengthen follicles. Cons:Excessive intake may lead to calcium buildup, causing kidney issues. NOW Foods Supplements Amazon Thorne Amazon Benefits:Iron deficiency is a leading cause of hair loss, particularly in women. Proper levels ensure optimal oxygenation of the scalp, fostering hair growth. Cons:Iron supplements can upset the stomach, and overdose is dangerous. Nutricost Amazon Thorne Amazon Benefits:Zinc supports tissue repair and growth, keeping the scalp and follicles healthy. Cons:Over-supplementation can cause nausea and even worsen hair loss by disrupting the balance of other minerals. Nature Made Amazon Nature’s Bounty Amazon Benefits:Found in fish oil, omega-3s nourish hair from within, reduce inflammation, and improve scalp health. Cons:Can cause mild gastrointestinal discomfort and has a fishy aftertaste. Nutricost Amazon Sports Research Amazon Benefits:A rich source of amino acids that strengthen the hair shaft and improve elasticity. It also supports scalp hydration, which is critical during dry winter months. Cons:Results may take months to appear, and effects vary by individual. Orgain Amazon Vital Proteins Amazon Benefits:Combines several impactful vitamins into one to target hair growth and strength. Cons:May cause upset stomach or nausea. One A Day Amazon Amazon Basics Amazon If the different vitamin options above are confusing, we understand. If you’re wondering which one is the best for you, Deborah Maguire, trichologist and co-founder ofSeed & Soul, recommends speaking to an expert. “There are numerous supplements on the market, and they can be extremely beneficial and support hair growth,” says Maguire. “I would always recommend investigating the root cause of the problem (no pun intended) and speaking to a trichologist or hair professional before taking any supplements so that you fully understand the benefits and side effects.” Mittal also says that vitamins aren’t a fix-all for your hair problem, either. “It’s worth noting that vitamin supplements are onlypartof the answer. Genetics, hormone imbalance and stress can all lead to hair loss. Vitamin supplements will only go so far and should not be considered miracle workers for things like male pattern baldness.” Once you’ve figured out what vitamin is right for you, it’s ideal to add some holistic practices to help address the root of the issue. “Aside from taking the right vitamins, there are a few other things you can do to help your hair,” says Etemad-Shahidi. “Eating a well-balanced diet that includes plenty of protein, healthy fats, and fruits and vegetables will provide you with the nutrition you need for your hair to grow.” Also try to manage stress, says Tudor. “High stress levels can disrupt the hair growth cycle, so incorporating mindfulness, meditation, exercise or anything that works for you for lowering stress levels is good for you, your health and your hair. Scalp massage is a win-win here as it both relaxes you and improves blood flow to the follicles.” “Also, be gentle with styling,” says Tudor. “Avoid over-washing, minimize heat styling, and use protective products to preserve hair quality. It is a controversial opinion, especially coming from the founder of a hair care company, however I believe that it is not always essential to wash your hair with shampoo all the time. Shampoo is a detergent, containing surfactants (ingredients that attract dirt and oil molecules) mostly in the form of sulphates. These ingredients, while not always, often dry your hair and scalp out.” Tudor says that the need to balance out your freshly-shampooed hair texture with more product can lead to buildup and irritation. However, as all good product descriptions suggest, if the problem persists: it's best to see a professional.",

    "title": "Here’s How to Reduce Your Sugar Intake (Including Six Foods to Avoid)",
    "article_text": "It’s never a bad idea to reduce your sugar intake, given its links to diabetes and increasedcancer risk. But also—sugar tastes really good. Whether you love pounding energy drinks at your 9-to-5, tend toglaze your meat in honeyor sugary marinades, or are simply anice creamguy, it’s likely that you’re consuming more sugar than you realize. But by choosing natural sources of sugar, like fresh fruit, and slowly cutting back on processed sugars, you can make better food choices without feeling deprived. According to dietitianFareeha Jay, the amount of added sugar we actuallyneedeach day is, well, zero. Instead of consumingaddedsugars from things likesports drinks, “healthy” protein bars, and full-fat sodas, Jay recommends we turn to fruits, vegetables, dairy, and more useful, less-processed sources of carbs to get our daily dose ofnaturalsugars like glucose, fructose, and lactose. For men 19 and older, government dietary guidelines recommend about 333 grams of carbohydrates daily, with this amount tapering off slightly as we age. If you really can’t kick that sweet tooth, your added sugar intake should be no more than 33 grams of sugarper day,including tose from fruit juice, vegetable juice, purées, and sugar added to drinks like coffee and tea. According to Sas Parsad, a nutritionist at theGut Co, too much sugar can cause inflammation, disrupt the balance of yourgut microbiome, and lead to various health issues–including Type 2 diabetes. “While our bodies do use glucose for energy, consuming excessive amounts of sugar doesn't just provide energy—it can also lead to fat storage and other metabolic problems,” he warns. The problem with cutting out sugar entirely is that it’s pretty addicting. If you’ve ever gonecold turkeyfor a diet, you’ll know just how real the sugar cravings can be. Parsad says that cutting back “isn’t just about tossing out the sweets–although that can be a great start.” Instead, he suggests that you: Substitute Sugar Rewards Try swapping sugary treats for something that offers the same satisfaction without the sugar. “Instead of treating yourself to a candy bar, take a short walk, get ablack coffeefrom your favorite shop, or do a few stretches,” Parsad says. Eat More Fiber and Protein Addingfiberandproteinto your meals helps keep blood sugar stable and reduces the chances of sugar cravings later. It’s a tried and true method for that mid-afternoon office slump. “A hearty meal with whole grains, protein, and healthy fats will keep you full and less likely to reach for sugary snacks,” says Parsad. You've heard about the olddark chocolateor handful of berries tip. Those are indeed healthier alternatives that still provide a sweet hit, but with less of a sugary wallop. For Jay, one of the best ways to reduce sugar intake is by graduallyretraining your taste buds. “Start by slowly reducing the amount of sugar you add to foods and drinks like cereal, pancakes, coffee, or tea,” she says. “This process may take weeks to months but over time, your brain will start to prefer foods with less sugar.” If you’re struggling, Jay is sympathetic, pointing out that sweet treats are a huge part of cultural celebrations, whether it’s office donuts on a colleague’s birthday or whatever dessert your favorite aunt makes for holidays. “It’s important to remember that sugar is about more than just health and nutrition—sweet foods provide comfort and joy,” she says. “Desserts and cakes are often the centerpiece of celebrations, and many traditions revolve around sweet treats.Cutting out sugarentirely doesn’t have to be the solution; the issue lies more with the quantity we consume.” Instead of being tempted by that tiramisu at your anniversary dinner or that leftover slice of cake at the kid’s birthday, Jay says you should plan out when you will allow yourself a sugary treat, and stick to it, opting for smaller portions when you do indulge. It’s difficult enough cutting out Snickers bars, but what about all the places hidden sugar lurks? Whether you’re trying tolose a few pounds, reduce your risk of health-related issues, or simply feel better and more energized without a daily sugar-slump, cutting out the below could make all the difference. Granola barsGranola bars are touted as health superfoods, but they can be packed with sugar in the form of honey, agave, ormaple syrup. “While these sweeteners are natural, they’re still sugar, and a single granola bar can contain between 12-24 grams of sugar,” warns Jay. Salad DressingWhile most salad dressings are made with vegetable oils and ingredients like cream or egg yolk, sugar or molasses are often added for taste. “Just a 15 ml serving can contain 2-5 grams of sugar,” says Jay. Stick to olive oil, balsamic, and lemon juice. Flavored YogurtsYes, including those low-fat or high-protein yogurts sold as a healthy. “A single portion of flavored yogurt can contain as much as 15-25 grams of sugar,” says Parsad. “This can upset your gut bacteria balance and causeblood sugarspikes.” And that’s before you’ve added fruit and honey to your bowl … Canned FruitThis should not necessarily count toward your recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables. “Grabbing a can of fruit isn’t always the healthiest choice,” Jay says. “Some varieties contain high amounts of added sugar.” Ditch fruit canned in juice or syrup, and opt for those in water instead. SmoothiesStore-bought smoothiesare sugar bombs, typically because of the fruit juices and sweetened yogurt used. “A standard smoothie could easily have 40 grams of sugar or more in a single serving, which can overwhelm your gut by feeding harmful bacteria,” says Parsad. Make your own at home from whole fruits instead. Dried FruitDried fruit can be high in calories and fructose sugar due to its concentrated form, making it great for hiking or as along-distance runningsnack. The issue comes when sugar is added. “People might believe they’re eating a healthy snack when they could be unknowingly increasing their sugar intake,” says Jay. As always, check the label for added sugars. You’re sweet enough as it is. This story originally appeared inBritish GQ.",

Quite happy to be adjusted throughout the day, it's a malleable powder that's unscented and kind to your roots. Seven Potions Amazon Key to any powder winning our recommendation is how subtle it sits in our hair, regardless of how thick it is. Seven Potions is one of the best we tested, delivering a flexible hold on short styles while providing thicker volume where it's needed. The powder works deep down to the roots to give them a lift while remaining flexible enough for restyling later in the day. The London Grooming Company Amazon The London Grooming Company claims to hold your hair firm throughout the day and also nourish and care for your scalp and roots through alcohol- and paraben-free formulas. Versatility is king in men's grooming, so we always recommend grabbing a powder that'llnourish and rehydratealongside its styling capabilities.

They add volume and texture to flat or thin hair while deeply nourishing the roots, making them an essential part of your styling routine.

No matter how many newskin care brandscome out, few will live up to the legacy of Kiehl's. For decades, it's been the de facto luxury skin care brand, with products you can slather all over yourhair,face, andbody. It's lined many a bathroom countertops and medicine cabinets because, well, everything it products just works. Like many products these days, Kiehl's hasn't been immune to the effects of price raises, inflation, ortariffs. Yes, Kiehl's products are great, but they aren't exactly cheap. That's why every time a Kiehl's sale happens, we want to report it to you first. Right now as part of the Amazon Summer Beauty event, all Kiehl's products are 15% off. We're approaching summer soon, and you're surely going to want to put your best face forward, so now's your chance. Kiehl's Amazon One of Kiehl's A-listers, this famous face cream uses a restorative combo of squalane and glacial glycoprotein to provide lasting hydration and reinforce the skin barrier, which can take a beating from the sun and other environmental aggressors.

    "title": "15 Best Tank Tops for Men in 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Sure, the best tank tops for men are default layers when the weather turns muggy, sticky, and unbearably hot. But it would be a disservice to you and your triceps to discount the humble tank's year-around utility. It doesn't matter what you call them—A-shirts, singlets, muscle tees,wife pleasers—one of 'em deserves a spot in your rotation. Tuck a simple ribbed version beneath a button-up and it becomes the most essential base layer in your office arsenal; wear a next-gen performance version to the gym and it’ll level upyour sweat sessions. Or push thesmall top, big pants agendaby wearing amesh versionall on its own—ideally with a pair ofvoluminous, Bieberesque jeans. In short: Tank tops provide countless opportunities to flex your style chops. So to help you do just that,GQwear-tested dozens of them to find the best sultry, sizzling, and otherwise show-stopping sleeveless joints on the market. Hanes Amazon Donovan is 6”2 and wears a size medium. Regardless of where you're shopping, a pack of Hanes tanks should never run you more than a few bucks per unit. They’re lightweight, fairly inconspicuous as an undershirt, and require zero special treatment. Do they hold up as well as others? It depends on the use-case, although as a rule, probably not. But again, and this is crucial: you getsixof them. When it comes to value, it's a hard proposition to beat—and it doesn't hurt that they're easy to find andalmost always available. “I was gifted a pack of these tanks from a friend who was cleaning out his closet,” saysGQstyle commerce writer Gerald Ortiz. “I couldn’t figure out why he wanted to get rid of such a solid tank.” In Ortiz’s mind, the Hanes Tagless Cotton Tank sets the standard. It fits snug like a classic tank should, and the all-cotton ribbed fabric is breathable and lightweight. Is it the softest version out there? No. Is it the best value out there? Absolutely. CDLP CDLP Donovan is 6”2 and wears a size medium. If you're looking for a classic tank that can do it all, and look noticeably elevated while doing it, look no further than CDLP's Rib Tank Top. The secret lies in a blend of Tencel and pima cotton, which gives the garment a considerable heft that feels more luxurious than your average tank. The cut and fabric results in an excellent drape, meaning it looks great under a shirt but also mighty fine on its own. The Rib Tank Top fits true to size, but if you're really looking to show off your gains, you'd do well to consider sizing down. Mack Weldon Mack Weldon Donovan is 6”2 and wears a size medium. If you want soft, Mack Weldon can give you soft. Cut from the brand's signature “18 hour” fabric, a blend of cotton, modal, and bit of spandex, the 18-Hour Rib Tank is easily the softest and perhaps most comfortable tank we tested. The rib tank is cut a little longer to make sure it stays tucked in; a little slimmer to make sure it stays snug to the body when worn under a fitted shirt, and has a bit of stretch in them to make sure you can move around however you’re wearing it. Mack Weldon’s fiber wizardry consistently puts them top of mind when it comes to any basic garment that demands, well, a lot more than basic. “Any softer and these would practically melt off your body,” Ortiz says. He also enjoys the fact that they’re long enough to tuck in and that the necks are low enough to be invisible under a button-up. That said, if you’re not the tucking type of guy, this might be an issue. Wythe New York Huckberry Wythe New York Donovan is 6”2 and wears a size medium. Wythe's Tubular Ribknit Tank Top is so much shirt for $38. We’re well aware that a tank top, by definition, has no sleeves—normally amounting to “not a lot of shirt”—but this one makes up for that paucity with rock-solid tube-knit construction and a soft cotton jersey that has enough heft to play a solo show when you feel like forgoing the extra layer. Oh, and about that construction: The tank is knit in a circle, creating a seamless tube that sits flat on the body with zero chafing potential and added durability. And to be clear, it's an absolutely incredible undershirt—it just happens to be the rare undershirt that can make the jump toshirt-shirt with zero fuss. “It’s not remotely surprising that I loved Wythe’s tank—they consistently put out versions of things I already have that I want morethan what I already have—but I was a little surprised by how much of a difference that tubular knit made,” saysGQcontributor Reed Nelson. “I’m not saying that it ruined the ones with side seams, but I do have a clear preference.” Reigning Champ Reigning Champ Donovan is 6”2 and wears a size medium. When it comes to performance fabrics, few boast a more sterling reputation than Cordura. And when it comes to bomber workout gear that both feels and performs as good as it looks, few do it better than Reigning Champ. It’s a fortunate development for everyone that Reigning Champ is making a beautifully-articulated tank out of futuristic, fast-drying, nails-tough lightweight Cordura fabric, which is soft, light, and absurdly strong. We’re not saying this is the lastworkout tankyou’ll ever need—we like buying things, we assume you do, too—but we are saying that it might be able to handle the workload. “When I first saw ‘Cordura’ in the name, I had some questions,\" Nelson says. “I normally see that word in backpack descriptions.” Those were quickly answered after feeling the particular strain of Cordura used. \"It doesn’t really feel like cotton, but it’s super soft so I’m not concerned,\" Nelson notes. \"I’m also pretty sure that it’s going to last for an actual eternity.” Tracksmith Tracksmith Donovan is 6”2 and wears a size medium. For those unfamiliar with their work, the team at Tracksmith cooks up some of the hardest-working, mostclassic-looking running apparelanywhere, and the Van Cortlandt Singlet is no exception. Made from their 2:09 Mesh, a poly-spandex blend with a helpful anti-microbial finish, the Van Cordtlandt is a high-performance 21st century running tank that looks more like the iconic ones worn decades ago. In other words, if the stuff that Bill Bowerman’s team wore was breathable, had some give and wicked moisture, it would look like this. GQ associate commerce editor Tyler Chin gives Tracksmith's singlet major props for its ability to stay cool, even during the hottest, most humid days of the summer. Plus, as someone who actually cares about what his running fit looks like, he thinks it makes him look like an '80s-era collegiate Olympian—gold medal not guaranteed. Skims Skims Skims burst onto the scene like a supernova with the help of itseye-catching marketing materials, but its unmitigated success is due, in no small, tothe product itself. And that includesthe men’s stuff. We’re particularly partial to the Rib Tank, which is crazy comfortable, super light, and manages to hold its shape all day long, even if your shape is in a little bit of flux—which means that it’s not so much form-fitting as it is form-boosting. It manages to do the last part without feeling constrictive or limiting in any way, or sticking out underneath a thin shirt, making it an easy year-round go-to. Calvin Klein Amazon Great news: theJeremy Allen White specialsalso happen to look great on us regular folk, regardless of casting-status in wrestler biopics. Made from 100% cotton, they’re inconspicuous enough for everyday undershirt duties but also look great with an open button-up over the top or on their own, if that’s your thing. “The SoHo billboards got me, and I ended up buying a three-pack because who wouldn’t want to look like Marky Mark in his heyday?” GQ’s associate commerce editor Tyler Chin says. He thinks you should size down because the tank has a tendency to stretch the longer you wear it, but it usually shrinks back down after a run through the dryer. Russell Athletic Amazon There are some killer higher-end options on the workout tank market—we’ve recommended a couple above—but that doesn’t mean you can’t get bonkers performance at an even more bonkers price. How bonkers? In this case of this moisture-wicking, odor-fighting, UV-ray blocking tank from Russell Athletic, $10. (We’ve checked, this is very hard to beat.) Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch It should come as no surprise that Abercrombie’s ribbed tank made this list, but a lack of drama shouldn’t disqualify worthy contenders and this is as worthy as they come. It’s made from a long-lasting 100% cotton fabric that’s as soft as just about any other, has slightly larger armholes that lend to a flattering, vintage-adjacent silhouette and it clocks in under $20, which is hard to beat. Sunspel Sunspel If you’re looking for a tank that’s a little bit looser than your standard 3-pack fare, and just a touch more breathable than the classic rib-knits normally found inside them, let us introduce you to the open-knit Sunspel Cellular tank. One of the most luxurious plain white tanks out there, its cellular knit ensures that airflow stays continuous and its loose(r) cut offers the space for that air to move around and cool your torso down. Oh, and if you were wondering about the cotton, the super soft kind is what Sunspel is (deservedly) known for. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Sometimes tank tops are too good to be hidden away as an under layer. Todd Snyder’s tanks feature a cotton-nylon mesh fabric that’s big on texture and air flow. It’s luxurious, sexy, and the kind of tank that deserves to have its own shine. Merz b. Schwanen Huckberry Merz B. Schwanen got its big break onThe Bearand promptly elicited hordes of dudes scrambling to get a piece of the Emmy-nominated T-shirt. TV fame aside, the German label’s expertise in basics is worth your attention and its classic rib tank is almost just as worthy of its own 15 minutes. Made in Portugal using an organic cotton heavyweight ribbed jersey, it’s got a vintage appeal in both design and quality. Bather Bather Bather’s swim trunks are a must-have as we get into beach season, but the brand’s slick tank top should also be in your warm weather wardrobe. The wide ribbing gives it an almost ‘60s energy that looks incredible with a breezy camp shirt or tucked into a pair of high-waisted pleated trousers. The only bummer? They don’t come in more colors. Buck Mason Buck Mason Vintage will always be cool. But we could do without scouring through dusty stores for sweat-stained tanks. Instead we’d opt for Buck Mason’s Slingshot tank which takes its cues from midcentury military surplus designs including an airy but structured ribbed cotton, coverstitched binding, and an ever-so-slightly roomy fit. Tank tops are straightforward when it comes to design consideration, and we’re not pretending otherwise, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a ton of variance between them. In fact, when there’s only a couple of panels and zero sleeves, every choice—from fabric to fit to seam construction to knit-pattern to intended use—becomes exponentiallymoreimportant. Here’s what you should be looking out for: Intended use.Might be obvious, but if you're looking for a tank top to do a specific thing, you should buy one that excels at that thing. An undershirt that won’t be visible under a button-down, for instance, should have a lower scoop neckline. If you’re looking for one to wear in a more outward-facing capacity—on its own or under an open shirt—then you’d want a tank that offers more heft or a touch of drape. Quality of construction and materials.There are only two panels on a standard tank—one, if it’s tube-knit—which means that what it’s made out of becomes important. Details like fiber quality, fabric content, construction details, and knit-pattern are all things to consider. For example, is the fabric a blend or is it all cotton? If it is a blend, is that blend serving a purpose, like providing elasticity, or is it a cost-cutting measure? The rubric might not lookexactlythe same for every tank—some require different strengths—but the standards are. Fit. We care (deeply) about the way any shirt fits, so tank tops are no exception. Because they tend to be both more revealing and form-fitting, fit is as important as any other factor. For tanks that promise to lay flat and stay snug, pay close attention to just how flat and how snug. For those that promise versatility, we made sure they actually delivered on multiple fronts. And while we don’t have a hard and fast silhouette requirement—we don’t think you should either—we did want to make sure everything was as advertised. Peter Middleton, founder ofWythe, says that all-cotton tanks should fit slim at the beginning. “Since they are cotton and are knit…they will stretch to your body where they need to. If they are loose to start with they are only going to become looser and saggier which is not really the point.” Seasonality.Some tanks are built for specific seasons, be it a thermal-focused tank for winter or a linen tank for summer. Beyond that, you might want to consider seasonalcolors, or rather, avoiding them. These are basics, after all. Middleton says to avoid the limited-edition colors, unless it’s something the brand will continue to make. “If you end up loving the fit and fabric, you are gonna be really bummed if you have to check Grailed and eBay for more after they are gone. No one wants to buy used undershirts.” Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyestaffordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)

    "title": "Met Gala 2025: The 63 Best-Dressed Men of All Time",
    "article_text": "The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala, otherwise known asthe Met Gala, might be the most-watchedred carpeton earth. Some of it has to do with watching A-listers from every walk of life (movies, music, high society) in the same place. But most of it has to do with seeing how guests attack—or demure from—a given year's theme. And while the guests execute months of fashion preparation, you get to view and relive theMet Gala livestreamfrom the comfort of your home. In years past, most famous guys (or, more accurately,their stylists) have done right by the black tie (or, on occasion, white tie) dress code by playing it safe. But thanks to history's pioneering menswear mavericks, men's celebrity fashion has shifted gears these last few years, which has propelled more and more famous dudes to reallygo thereon the red carpet…especially when the Met Gala gives them carte blanche to do so. That said, let's also pour one out for the guys who either don't care, or caretoomuch, that their Met Gala fits defy dress code, convention, and sometimes description. (Armor? Robot arms? Robot armor arms?) With a show about the complex history of Black dandyism, the Met Costume Institute will spotlight the powerful influence Black culture has had on menswear. Let's take a look back at the guys who have honored the night's fashion-first ethos through the years. That year's exhibit:“Camp: Notes on Fashion” Easily the accessory of 2019: literally your own head. That year's exhibit:“Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” Just three months earlier, Boseman made history as the first man to wear Givenchy haute coutureon the Oscars red carpet. While we didn't expect him to turn up at the Met Gala in something run-of-the-mill, we also didn't expect theBlack Pantherstar to arrive at his first Met Gala so pope-d out. That year's exhibit:“Dangerous Liaisons: Fashion and Furniture in the 18th Century” We're never not in awe of Mr. Talley's ability to convincingly pull off a flowing cape, a drape-y caftan, an emperor-level coat, or some amalgam of all three. We can all learn a thing or two about owning the shit out of our wardrobes like Talley does. That year's exhibit: “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty” TheValentino-clad thighsseen ’round the world. That year's exhibit:“Schiaparelli and Prada: Impossible Conversations” To honor two designers who didn't/don't play by fashion's rules in their respective bodies of work, Jacobs threw on a Comme des Garçons lace polo dress, some boxer shorts (thoughtful), and bedazzled pilgrim shoes, which are really something we ought to see more of. That year's exhibit: “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” “Everything I do, I feel like it’s gotta be for the culture,” said Colman Domingo of his Met Gala look, whichpaid homageto late fashion pioneers André Leon Tally and Chadwick Boseman. “It’s gotta be more than just for me.” That year's exhibit:“AngloMania: Tradition and Transgression in British Fashion” In 2006, the gala celebrated \"Tradition and Transgression in British Fashion,\" and naturally the reigning king of transgressive fashion wore the most traditional outfit he could, in Clan Macqueen tartan to boot. That year's exhibit: “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” Tom Ford wearing a designer whoisn’tTom Ford? Stranger things have happened. That year's exhibit:“In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” Timmy'sHaider Ackermann-designed tributeto Americana might have been the first time Chuck Taylors graced the Met Gala red carpet since Marc Jacobs wore them in 2013 (see below). That year's exhibit:“Camp: Notes on Fashion” No better understanding of camp than wearing black nylon to acamp-themedgala. That year's exhibit:“Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between” The year the youngest Smith cut his hair...then carried it as an accessory to the Met Gala. That year's exhibit:“In America: An Anthology of Fashion” Riz Ahmed'sunconventional white tie workwearflipped the “Gilded Glamour” dress code on its head. The outfit, as Ahmed explained, was “a love letter to those blue collar workers, those immigrant workers” who keep both New York City and the fashion industry afloat. That year's exhibit:“Cubism and Fashion” It takes a brave man to wear a space-age Mylar-esque suit to the Met Gala. It takes a man with a serious commitment to giving zero fucks to wear it with sneakers. That year's exhibit:“American Woman: Fashioning a National Identity” If ever there were a man alive who could not only get away with jeans on the Met Gala red carpet but make said jeans actually look...elegant, that man's name is Ralph Lauren. That year's exhibit:“Camp: Notes on Fashion” Lacy, racy, all-around killer. That year's exhibit:“Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology” Not other men's look in recent Met Gala history has caused as much simultaneous internet combustion as when Malik stepped onto the museum's steps in these Versace metal armor/robot arms. Whether you think it's brilliant or you hate it, you have to give Malik credit for playing it anything but safe this year. That year's exhibit:“Dangerous Liaisons: Fashion and Furniture in the 18th Century” We're pretty sure that year's dress code didn't call for “Best Going-Out Outfit.” But Hugo's fat-tie-and-leather-jacket combowasa dangerous liaison, so maybe they weren't too far off the mark. That year's exhibit:“In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” Page pinned a green rose onto his big Balenciaga suitin homage to the playwright (and queer forefather) Oscar Wilde. That year's exhibit:“Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years” Chronologically, Alan's was just the first of many memorable kilts to grace the Met steps. (Indeed, it's one of thefourkilts included in this list.) That, plus knee-high boots and a literal feather in his cap? Tough to beat. That year's exhibit:“Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between” How do you make a classic tux a hell of a lot more interesting? Put a turtleneck underneath, pile the contents of an entire diamond mine on top, and finish the look off with a pair of next-level shades. That year's exhibit:“Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” Next question: How do you top your impressive first-timer fit from the year before? If you're Migos, the answer is easy: Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace. That year's exhibit: “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” Mega-flared pants? Lapels that look like they could up and take flight? Oodles of flair? If a future historian were to look up “suiting trends 2024,” this would be a good reference image. That year's exhibit:“Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty” The MJ masterminds—Jacobs, the designer; Duffy, the businessman—did their part to pay homage to McQueen's genius (and his own Met Gala fit just a few years earlier). And if people didn't pick up on that, well, these are still two menswear mullet looks (business up top, party down below) that we appreciate. That year's exhibit:“In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” The first couple of fashion closed out the 2021 arrivals with two epic ensembles: Rocky in ERL (thrifted quilt robe and all), and RiRi in Balenciaga couture. That year's exhibit: “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty” Kendrick didn’t even walk the Met Gala carpet in 2023, buthe still managed to pull offone of the cleanest fits of the night. That year's exhibit:“Haute Couture” Sequin. Formal. Pants. That year's exhibit: “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty” To paraphraseCher: Can we hear a little commotion for the suit? Now let’s hear it forthe back of the suit![uproarious applause] That year's exhibit:“Rock Style” Just a reminder that Steven Seagal was not only once invited to the Met Gala, but that he attended in the most (only?) Steven Seagal fit ever. That year's exhibit:“In America: An Anthology of Fashion” The grown-out pink buzzcut seen 'round the world. That year's exhibit:“In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” The Met Gala may have been the first time Frank Ocean introduced us tohis green baby robot named Cody, but it would not be the last: Frank also toted out the animatronic tot duringhis divisive 2023 Coachella set. That year's exhibit:“In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” The year that Biebermade the bad suit seem very, very good. That year's exhibit:“AngloMania: Tradition and Transgression in British Fashion” Here's a list of what Mr. Galliano is rocking in this photo: A fedora. A perm. A skull-and-crossbones necklace. No shirt. A lace-embroidered robe coat. A polka dot velvet vest.Sequined jeans. Exotic-skin cowboy boots. And most importantly: the supreme confidence to wear it all as if the look were a T-shirt and jeans. The Met Gala is all about taking a risk, and this might be the riskiest fit ever to hit the red carpet. That year's exhibit:“In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” Nothing is more Virgil Abloh than a tux jacket with the word “Modernism” airbrushed across it, which is exactly what cemented this an all-time look for the late designer. That year's exhibit:“China: Through the Looking Glass” Nailing a strict white-tie dress code and dressing up like a Disney prince are, in fact, two different things. That said, you have to give Wade credit for out-brooching everyone on the red carpet that year. That year's exhibit: “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty” Easily the night’s best version ofKarl Lagerfeld cosplay. That year's exhibit:“Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty” When is a button notjusta button? When it's a massive crystal-encrusted Christmas-tree ornament masquerading as a button. That year's exhibit:“In America: An Anthology of Fashion” Bad Bunny toldVoguethat his Burberry look was inspired by “what was going on during the Gilded Age in my country, in Puerto Rico,” with combined elements from both men's and women's trends of the era. That year's exhibit:“Superheroes: Fashion and Fantasy” This look is peak Benjamin Bixby-era André, which is to say it's somehow elegant and unconventional at the same time. That year's exhibit:“Goddess: The Classical Mode” It's one thing to play around with a striped suit, it's definitely something else entirely when you use dining room curtains tocreatea striped suit. That year's exhibit:“In America: An Anthology of Fashion” Jeremy Strong presents: Street Urchin Glamour. That year's exhibit: “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” Anthony Vaccarello madethe most important suits of 2024, so it only made sense that one would show up on fashion’s most important night. That year's exhibit:“Dangerous Liaisons: Fashion and Furniture in the 18th Century” Fallon's chocolate brown shirt and slightly flared pants might not seem like an epic swerve, but in 2004 this was about as wavy as black-tie menswear got. That year's exhibit:“In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” The Balenciaga designer and his then-muse Kim Kardashian baffled everyone when they appeared on the Met carpet sheathed in black like a pair of blank voids. Who else could attend the biggest IRL fashion event of the year dressed like NPCs, aka non-playable characters, in a video game? That year's exhibit:“Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” Jesus fresco, but make it Gucci. That year's exhibit:“In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” His-and-hers Chanel westernwear. Sheesh! That year's exhibit:“Punk: Chaos to Couture” The challenge to bring punk and formalwear together in 2013 wasn't an easy one for attendees, but at least Quinto played it smart: no sleeves and one blue pseudo-Mohawk. That year's exhibit:“Poiret: King of Fashion” It's one thing to wear cowboy boots with a suit. It's quite another to tuck your pantsintosaid cowboy boots. But the Razorlight frontman did just that back in '07 and, most importantly, had the DGAF conviction to pull it off. That year's exhibit: “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” ThoseMr. Tumnus Tabisreally did make the look. That year's exhibit: “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty” The 2023 Met Gala, otherwise known as the night when Jeremy Strong hard-launched his friendship with Frank Ocean. Strong wore a necklace from the musician’s jewelry line Homer, which theSuccessionstardescribed toGQas his Met outfit’s “missing keystone.” That year's exhibit:“China: Through the Looking Glass” That Larry David got an invite to the fashion-heavy, ultra-exclusive Met Gala in itself is funny. That the comedian turned up looking this damn sharp is impressive. That year's exhibit:“Orientalism: Visions of the East in Western Dress” Truth be told? The designer's floppy suit and banana-headband combo would look great on any contemporary red carpet. That year's exhibit:“Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology” Hardly surprising but still worth mentioning, because in 2016 Will.i.am found a way to out-Will.i.am himself with this hat/visor/post-cataract-surgery sunglass situation. That year's exhibit:“Punk: Chaos to Couture” Jacobs is no stranger to epic Met Gala fits (this is histhirdrig to be featured in this photo gallery), and in 2013 the iconic designer and ultimate fan of fashion turned up in the dottiest suit ever to ascend the museum's red-carpeted steps. That year's exhibit:“Cubism and Fashion” TheVogueeditor is an all-time legend at interpreting a Met Gala theme, even with this subtly geometric plaid suit. That year's exhibit:“In America: An Anthology of Fashion” Gunna's custom Thom Browne cape beaded with gold thorns was already exquisite, but his tuxedo-wearing (!) Hector dog bag really put this look over the top. That year's exhibit:“The House of Chanel” Not only did Johnny Knoxville once attend the Met Gala—but he looked pretty great doing it! That year's exhibit:“AngloMania: Tradition and Transgression in British Fashion” Fresh off the success ofAmerican Idiot, the Green Day frontman scoffed off the Met Gala formal dress code years before it was cool. That year's exhibit: “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty” A characteristically greatThom Browne ensemblefrom the NBA's resident fit god. That year's exhibit:“Goddess: The Classical Mode” Put these in the books as two of the most 2003 ensembles of all time, Met Gala or otherwise. That year's exhibit:“In America: An Anthology of Fashion” No man in recent memory hasbulldozed over a Met Gala themewith more gusto. That year's exhibit: “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty” A languorous Prabal Gurung suit, a fresh buzz cut, and a couple strings of pearls? Very, very cool. That year's exhibit:“AngloMania: Tradition and Transgression in British Fashion” This ispreciselyhow we want Johnny Rotten himself to turn up to a fancy gala celebrating Brit style. It's a rare time when expectation actually meets reality, here in all its clashing patterned glory. That year's exhibit:“In America: An Anthology of Fashion” Tough to imagine that Pete Davidson cosplaying as thesun-kissedJFK to Kim Kardashian's Marilyn Monroe won't go down in Met Gala history.

    "title": "What Trump Got Wrong—and Zelensky Got Right—at Pope Francis’ Funeral",
    "article_text": "When President Trump joined an elite group of international dignitaries, presidents, kings, and queens at the Vatican on Saturday for the funeral of Pope Francis, hedressed as he always does: billowy but carefully tailored suit (likely from Brioni),wide silk tie, black shoes. It’s the same uniform Trump has worn since the ’90s, and in any other context wouldn’t have drawn much attention. In this case, however, it turned out to be kind of a big deal. That’s because, unlike almost all of the other assembled guests—from the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, to Abdullah II, king of Jordan—the 47th president of the United States wasn’t wearing black. In a sea of dark worsted wool, Trump’s sapphire blue suit and matching tie made him stand out like a guy sitting courtside in full Celtics gear at a Lakers home game. For anyone wanting to draw geopolitical conclusions from the president’s wardrobe, the suit provided much fertile ground for interpretation. For anyone looking for advice on what to wear to a funeral (or, more accurately, whatnotto wear to a funeral) it’s an equally useful case study. While it’s true that we live in an era of unprecedented latitude when it comes todress codes, there are plenty of occasions when you’d be best served to err on the side of tradition.Black-tie events, for one. Funerals for another. In keeping with longstanding funerary conventions in the Western world,Saturday’s dress codecalled for a dark suit (which most attendees interpreted to mean black) with a black tie. Which is as it should be. Whether the deceased is the leader of a major world religion or your great aunt in Reno, what you wear to the funeral should reflect the solemnity of the events themselves. And nothing says stylish solemnity like a perfectly tailored black suit, a crisp white shirt, and an expertly knotted black tie. If you don’t own a black suit,this is just one of several excellent reasonsto add one to the rotation (you’ll be surprised how often you wear it). If, however, you don’t have time to go shopping, you still have options. Prince William’s midnight blue suit was well within bounds (note that he adhered to the black tie rule), as was Volodymir Zelensky’s military-style field jacket and matching trousers, which although a definite swerve from convention, was both respectful and on-brand. Both looks managed to adhere to the spirit of the occasion while leaving a little room for personal style, which is exactly the bullseye you should be aiming for. Dress codes are mired in history and tradition, and some of them are more arbitrary than others (seewhite tie, a.k.a. the bougiest dress code of them all.) Wearing black at a funeral has its own history and traditions, but whether or not you ascribe to any of them, there’s one very good reason why you (whether you’re a president, a king, or anyone else) should heed the dress code: it’s not about you. Unless of course you’re Donald Trump, in which case flaunting conventions is absolutely on-brand.",

    "title": "The Real-Life Diet of Joe Jonas, Who Avoids Doomscrolling by Doing HIIT Workouts",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Last week, at a packed bar in Manhattan’s Soho, Joe Jonas took the stage to a decidedly more intimate crowd than he's probably accustomed to. He is, of course, one-third of theJonas Brothers, who played two sold-out shows at Yankee Stadium just a couple years ago. That's not to say the second-eldest JoBro couldn't fill a massive venue on his own. But that night, at Bleecker Street Bar, Jonas was debuting a new song as a solo artist to a select group of fans. The third single off his upcoming second albumMusic for People Who Believe in Love, “Heart by Heart” nearly didn't happen. The album was supposed to be released in October 2024, before Jonas postponed it to give himself more time to “find inspiration.” (It's now coming on May 23). The result is this upbeat acoustic pop song about meaningful, long-lasting connections. It's why Jonas partnered with Heineken on a campaign for people to “get social off social,” or take a break from their phones to actually connect with others in real life. And while attendees were strongly encouraged to not record the show, which was also being filmed for the upcoming music video, phones were very much still out. Logging off and touching grass are, of course, cornerstones of any modern health routine. be joining the rest of his brothers, Nick and Kevin, on a 43-day North American tour that kicks off August 10. Ahead of his Bleecker Street Bar performance, Jonas caught up withGQto talk about his new music, how he manages to find time to disconnect, and how he's been staying swole these days. Joe Jonas: Yeah, that's why this [Heineken partnership] is a good fit—a healthy reminder to check out sometimes and just be present. The idea [of the commercial that was shot last year] essentially revolved around taking a break from your phone, and how we can all at some point start to doomscroll to the point where you're not even really computing what you're seeing. You'll see from the promo that we shot how nice it is to just turn those devices off for a second and get together and just be. I think it's a choice, right? You have to find times where you just go: OK, I'm gonna put my phone down to put it on Do Not Disturb for a minute. I've been taking certain [workout] classes where you can't bring your phone in, whether it bepilates,yoga, or hot yoga, which I don't think you want your phone in there anyway. Stuff like that is always nice because then it resets you. Oh, wow, thanks. I guess maybe? But I only went to one class, so that would be pretty impressive. I walked into a class that's not far from my apartment in New York, and they were like, “Have you been to pilates before?” I said, “Yeah,” and I started asking questions like, “Do I need to wear these special socks?” and they're like, “Technically, yeah. You've done this before? This is an advanced class, just making sure you're aware.” I haven't been back since. Well, it varies. I want to get outside, so I've been running a lot more. I have a trainer who sends me mostlyHIIT-style workouts. I can get so easily bored at the gym, especially when I'm by myself. And with the amount of travel that I do, it's nice to know that I can go to a class. I'm not being paid to say this, butClassPassis great, so I use that quite a bit.Raw Fitout [in Miami] is really good, and this place calledSOL Yoga. Those are some places that I love and I'm a frequent at. It depends on the day, but I think in my life now I try not to be too particular. Like I work out and I exercise so I can enjoy life and eat food and have a drink. I love to travel, and I'm a bit of a foodie. So I like going to fancy spots and finding wine bars around the world. I feel like wine bars nowadays have the best little snacks. But on a normal day, I usually like to make breakfast at home. I make some pour-over coffee, and I'm pretty basic with my breakfast. It's usually scrambled eggs, avocado, and sometimes I spice it up with some fun additions like a truffle sauce. But I'm always bouncing around for lunches and dinners. I try to cook. I like to cook. But I'm realizing my kitchen was lacking recently when I tried to cook over Easter weekend, because I usually go out to eat quite a bit. My diet changes quite a bit on tour. I eat pretty clean and strict. I'll still have moments where I indulge. For the last US tour, I didn't drink until after the show, which was funny because I kept seeing these memes of me, and they're like, “He's so drunk on stage!” But I was just trying to keep professional because there's a lot of moving parts [when you're performing], like there's [pyrotechnics], and you have to take it seriously. But now I'll maybe have a drink before the show. You can kind of eat more because you're burning quite a good amount of calories. Our drummer used hisApple Watchone day [during the show] and he got up to like 30,000 steps, and he's in one seat the whole time! DNCE is, at the core, fun and funky and sexy and kind of wild—and we can be crazy on and off stage, and musically, kind of tap into this party band. And with my solo music, it started with a song that I felt was way more emotional, and it was talking about some things that were really personal to me. And I felt like, you know what? Like I already have this great band that I love being a part of, but I don't feel like these songs are for that project. I kind of want to put this somewhere else and have an experience where I'm going to test the waters and maybe put myself back out there and have a solo album that showcases more of these songs, which gave me the opportunity to dive even deeper emotionally. Sometimes in a band and even in the [Jonas Brothers], you may not be in the same place mentally as you would be all together. So it's nice to just kind of say, “OK, I can be selfish for a second and really speak to some personal experiences.” It's kind of all over the map. I went on a road trip last year that inspired me to do some songwriting. And I was listening to everything from country western stuff that my grandfather and my dad were playing me—honky talk stuff to alternative music. So from some of the classic music that I grew up listening to then to the music I was discovering living out in California then living out in New York. The brothers definitely listen to this stuff. We have this respect where we give each other the space we need when it comes time to find new music for each other. We don't give advice unless advice is asked for. When we're in the [Jonas Brothers], there's free reign [for criticism]—all parties make [the music] stronger. But when it's us individually, we want to be respectful. But Nick actually gave me some good ideas on this album. I have a song “What We Are\"—that's his favorite, I think. And he kept saying to me that he was jealous of that one, which is the goal. If you have a friend or counterpart musician friend who's like “Damn, I wish that was my song,” that's the goal. Definitely. “Teacher” was always one where I had that feeling. That's my jam. A lot of friends. I think some of the material is very personal to me, and you don't want to just walk into the room with a stranger. Also, some people that I really look up to, like Josette [Maskin] from Muna—they're incredible. And we wrote two songs on the album. Also my friend Paris [Carney], who's a great songwriter. She also happens to be married to one of the former bass players of the band for the [Jonas] Brothers. And a bunch of wonderful people just fell into my lap. One of the coolest songwriting experiences was with Feist, who I'm a superfan of, and [producer] Dan Nigro. Both were available on the same day, and I was able to get them in the studio together, and it was kind of amazing for all of us. We wrote this single called “What This Could Be” together, and shortly after Dan won Best Producer of the Year [at the Grammys], which is pretty cool.",

    "title": "This Jeremy Allen White Style Hack Will Make All Your Off-Duty Fits Hotter",
    "article_text": "Jeremy Allen White can do big budget sexy.His Calvin Klein underwear shootsand awards season fits are proof of that. But he’s at his steamiest in worn-in denim, beater baseball caps, and vintage sneakers—and yesterday it took on a new form, as he emerged as the unofficial Hollywood mascot of the crop top. In Los Angeles, he wore a roughed up navy pocket tee (cut off at the waist,as TikTok hot boys are wont to do) over awhite waffle thermalunderneath. A certifiedclassic ’90s layering technique. So far, so Oklahoma mechanic. And that's the whole point. It’s worn-in, washed, beaten up and thrown together. It doesn’t try too hard and there’s no fancy logos or any effort to flex here. Instead, it’s finding hot in the grot of workwear. Where did the holes come from? Where did he get the tee? Why is the crop so jagged? Why is it so sexy? Well, the proportions can partly answer that last question. It’s not so short that it exposes his torso, but it falls just above his leather woven belt. This serves up the suggestion of abs, as opposed to all-out exposure—and it's thehintthat gets the blood pumping. It’s just another day at the Sunday flower market for JAW. Last year, he was regularly spotted with an armful of flowers and the same sort of slacker hot menswear; jeans, well-loved T-shirts and his personal favorite,the Nike Cortez sneaker. Plus, we're about to see a lot more of him.The Bearseason four is set to drop at some point next month, and the high-stakes kitchen drama always comes fully loaded witha slew of lo-fi menswear staples. Until then, though, we’ve got off-duty, undone sexiness from Jeremy Allen White. Ride on slacker king! This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "‘The Last of Us’: Gabriel Luna on Episode Three, the Show’s New Direction, and WrestleMania",
    "article_text": "This story contains spoilers for this week’s episode ofThe Last of Us. What’s next forThe Last of Us? That question has lingered in the air sincelast week’s game-changing episodeof the HBO series, which saw the death of Joel (Pedro Pascal) and a passing of the torch to Ellie (Bella Ramsey), now the series’ de facto lead. However, in a shift from the storyline of the games that inspired the series, Joel’s brother Tommy (Gabriel Luna) isn’t present for Joel’s death at the hands of Abby (Kaitlyn Dever.) He’s busy fighting off a massive horde of infected as they crash against the gates of the Jackson, Wyoming community. This week’s episode, directed by Peter Hoar and written by Craig Mazin, opens with Tommy having a moment of solace with his brother. As emotionally devastating as Joel’s death was, this is equally so—and plays to the quiet and reserved strength Luna brings to the role. Although he has only one line of dialogue, Luna’s face conveys decades of love and affection, resulting in a powerful moment that fans of the series will likely remember for a long, long time. GQ sat down for a conversation with Luna actor in the wake of Tommy’s big moment, where he’s quick to mention that all ofThe Last of Usis a team effort, shouting out one crew member after another by name. During our expansive chat, Luna spoke thoughtfully about the response to last week’s barn-burner, how real-life circumstances informed that moment at the start of the episode, the healing power of music on set, and much more. GQ:What was more exciting for you,going to WrestleManiaor finally having episode two out in the world? Gabriel Luna:Man, I was anticipating this episode coming out for so long that when this WrestleMania thing came together last week, thanks to Kara and Larissa, my publicists, who were so sweet and very plugged in. I reached out maybe a month ago, and I was like, \"You know what might be a good promotional opportunity? WrestleMania.\" They reached out and hooked it up; we were on the floor for both nights and so wrapped up in the show. Then, the Sunday that the episode aired, we only sat through half of night two of WrestleMania because I had to hop on a plane. I left and jumped on one of these jet suite flights and got myself back to LA because my buddy's having his 40th birthday. I was so focused on WrestleMania [and] getting on this plane so I could go to my buddy Vince's birthday that I hadn't fully grasped that the episode was airing until my phone started lighting up like a Christmas tree. People were texting and sharing kind words and sweet remarks about the show, and then some heartbreaking responses to the show, and it's been wonderful and exciting to see all that work come to fruition in the way that we thought it may actually come to pass with this strong response. It's been nuts, man. It's been cool to finally unload a lot of these old videos that I had from that whole experience and then just talk about it. Talk about the trials we went through and the execution of it all. [It's] a remarkable piece of television, and I'm so happy that it all came together the way it did. When you’re all on set, do you have a sense of,Okay, this is a big one. Does everybody know that they've got to really bring their A game? Or does it just feel like a slightly longer day at the office? Reading the script definitely felt like that. When you're reading the script, you get to choose your own lenses, you get to see [and] feel what it's going to be, and stitch it together cinematically. Even then, I already felt like it was going to be huge. When we got there on a day-to-day basis, it still felt massive. I mean, we got 500 people on set. We got hundreds of background, 50 or so stunt performers in full prosthetics. We have weapons being fired all over the place, just bullet casings all over the ground. And if there weren't enough bullet casings, we had some young ladies in set dec[oration] going around like flower girls throwing bullet casings [mimics hand-motion] on the ground, green screens, all kinds of pyro. Even then on the day, it felt very big, But because ofMark Mylod's stewardship and Craig Mazin's leadership, we just had a great plan. Nothing is impossible if you have the right team, you trust them to do their jobs, everybody takes accountability for their own job, and you just get it done. You just get it done moment by moment. Mark Mylod was the perfect director for this. He was able to capture the scope and scale of that huge, massive battle. Of course, he has a lot of experience—Game of Thronesand other things in that vein. And also was able to be the sweetheart that he is, able to do all of the touching and heartbreaking moments—he's just an incredible director. On the day, it does feel big. But because of the team we put together, it didn't feel impossible. We thought it may be, but it wasn't. Still, even then, man, until it's all put together, until Alex Wang, our VFX supervisor, gets his team on it, until [editor] Timothy [Good] cuts it all together, you never know. But now that it's out and everybody has responded the way they did, we are very proud. How does the collaboration with the stunt team work for an episode that big? Well, first and foremost, I made sure that my brother—I call him my brother, his name's Ty Provost. He is of the Blackfoot Nation, and his family’s from the Blood Res down in Southern Alberta. He's from a family of stuntmen. His older brother Leonard and his eldest brother, Tim Bruised Head, are both very important in the stunt community in Alberta and all across Canada. I made sure that Ty was with me again, and thank you to Cecil O'Connor, our producer and Jacqueline [Lesko] and everybody who collaborates and makes sure that we get what we need to get the job done. I knew I needed Ty, even if I was going to do a majority of the stuff. Ty is just good to be there to work through things, work through some of the fights, get stretched out, get limber, keep our training—we train together, so we can keep our fitness at the level it needs to be. So it starts there with just my personal guy. I'm his actor. He's not my stuntman. Then you have Marny Eng, our stunt coordinator, Danny Virtue, our horse wrangler, pulling all their team together. The amazing Glenn Ennis, who played the Bloater, used to be the rugby captain for the nation of Canada. He's a very big man, and then even bigger when you put him on eight inch platforms and then even bigger when you put a helmet on him with a big antenna to represent where his head should be as the Bloater. A guy named Jonathan took a lot of burns for us. The whole team was just unbelievable. It basically just meant getting your weapons training in when you can and going and doing your riding with Danny out in the ranch, and going with Keanu [Lam], the fight coordinator, and tightening up all the beats of the fights. As much as there is in that episode, there's probably another 15 minutes of finished, cut footage of other aspects of that battle that we couldn't keep just because of pacing—we got to keep the story going. There's a whole sequence where we set up this net full of explosives to funnel them all in into one area of the town and set off this booby trap, a whole net we roll out with all this C4. I justposted on Instagram a videoof me rounding the corner with this massive blast. I mean, that's not even in the final cut because we already had so much happening. Kudos to Mylod for knowing that just because we can do it, doesn't mean we need to, we have to keep the heart of the story driving forward: The town, how much Tommy and Maria love this town, how much we have to dig in our heels to defend it. Meanwhile, my brother is wayward, out in the blizzard, dealing with what he's dealing with. It was a massive undertaking and couldn't be done without the hundreds of people that were there to do it. I know you're a fashion guy; you like your outerwear. I think Ann Foley's done outdone herGhost Riderwork with that shearling plaid number you’ve got. What was working with Ann again and getting that bit of costuming like for you? I came in, and she already had all the designs in her mind and had already printed out these mockups. We worked together on the Ghost Rider [costume] and she was the one that built my jacket. I remember we modeled that jacket or the shape of it—it was going to be acafé racer. But I had just done a show calledHarley and the Davidsonsfor Discovery, where they fitted me for this really cool red cafe racer. We got some of the shape from there, and she had this great leathersmith that worked on that one. She's already has amazing teams that she's built. Our tailor on this, Savino—you got to go with an Italian tailor, man. If you're going to do it right, hire an Italian tailor. She was inspired by this ad, I think it's like a 1980s Marlboro ad from like 88 or something, and it's almost a one-to-one of the general idea there, but she added some great elements, some of the leather patches, the plaid and the wash that she put on the plaid flannel. It's just a cool jacket. It feels very Tommy, and at the same time, feels fresh and new and something you didn't see in the game. It also feels functional for the type of conditions that we're in, not only in the story, but also in life. It was actually a really warm coat. Tip the hat to Ann Foley. I mean, what a G, like her and Paula and her whole team, Frankie—love our whole costuming team. And then Steves, our dressers are both named Steve, our main dressers, and they're just the Steves. Just absolute legends of the game. I'm so happy that Ann was involved. After Cynthia Summers did a wonderful job in the first season, to have Ann Foley come on. I'm just like, 'Alright, here we go.\" They obviously know that we're about to take this to a whole other level, so you've got to do that in every department. The scene that opens episode three is really emotional and is a new creation for the show. What were the conversations about that like? I read it in the script. I knew Peter Hoar was going to be directing. Peter didthe \"Long, Long Time\" episode with Nick [Offerman] and Murray [Bartlett], who played Bill and Frank. I knew the human element was going to be in good hands. I probably wasn't prepared for how it felt on the day, because as I was walking into that room. Once the young lady who hands me the wash rag to wash my brother's body leaves the room, I'm now in this makeshift morgue that we have in our mess hall in Jackson, among dozens and dozens and dozens of our loved ones who are now gone. Then, specifically, my closest relative's laying there on the table in front of me. I remember I immediately had this sense memory of my grandfather's funeral. My grandfather had two sons: my father Gabriel, who passed before I was born, and my uncle David passed when I was 12. When my grandpa passed in 2013, at that point, I was the oldest living male in my immediate family. I was the only grandson. My uncle David had no children. My father only had me before he passed. When it came down to his funeral, and when we were there the day of the wake, my mom, my grandma, my maternal grandma, and my mother were outside welcoming people. Then the funeral director came in:Immediate family can come in and see your grandfather. But that was just me. I was the only one, the immediate family that was there. I remember walking down the aisle to the box that I had to buy for my grandpa, cause I was his soul heir and all this funeral that we had to put together. And I just remember being alone in that chapel and walking up to the coffin. All of a sudden, I had this in my mind as we were shooting this scene, so it made it all feel very genuine. The moment was real. I tell this story, too, because it's funny how small of a world it is and how closely all of us circus people in the movie industry are woven. But there was a body double for Pedro that day, and they asked me if I wanted to have full makeup done. I said, \"Please, if you wouldn't mind.\" Just to have the visual of what it is and to lift up that shroud and see the damage that was done. So they put the stand in, the body double through the full works—blood everywhere, and the wounds and everything. I just held this stranger's hand all night, shooting the scene, washing his hand, and taking the watch off. A lot of this was left out of the cut, just for time, I guess. But said those words, \"Give Sarah my love.\" It's just a really strong moment [that] says everything you need to say. There were other words in the scene, but I'm so happy they're all gone because you didn't need 'em. Six months later, I'm working on a show calledDevil in Disguise,that I shot in Toronto for Peacock, about the John Wayne Gacy case, where I play Detective Rafael Tovar, the lead investigator. Then this guy comes up to me, he's like, \"Hey, bro, I'm Philippe.\" I was like, \"Oh, nice, nice to see you.” He's like, \"Yeah, we met each other. I played your brother.\"` I was like, \"What do you mean?\" \"I was the stand-in. I was the body double for Pedro that day at the funeral.\" He had moved from Vancouver to Toronto and just so happened to be working on my new show as a stand-in, and it was really nice. It was a real roundabout way where it didn't feel like there was a finality to it, that this character, this Joel character—who I love so much, who so many people love so much, who I personally love, is my brother—he's still up. He's still up and about. To have the actual guy there, that was the body, standing before me was this nice, roundabout healing moment down the line. It was a crazy night. Peter did a great job directing that scene. I hope it lands—I haven't seen it yet, but I saw a little brief bit in the previews when I finally watched episode [two]—so I hope it works out. Now the story really starts, man. The extra dialogue in the sequence—was that something on the day that you and Peter determined you didn't need? No, we did it. The more I was doing it, I had a sense, like, \"No, I don't think we need any of this.\" I didn't bring it up at the time as I was performing it. There was something cathartic about it because a lot of what we left out was about Ellie, me telling him what happened to Ellie. At the time, it wasn't even really about the scene for me, as it was this weird double meaning in the scene of saying, \"She's hurt, she's hurt bad, but she'll be all right. I'll take care of her,\" which needs to go unsaid because of course I will. Who else does she have? At the same time, it was less about Ellie in that moment than it was the show itself. There was this weird sense of the passing of the torch from Pedro's great leadership to Bella's, Kaitlyn's, myself, and the people who were going to be carrying this story forward from here — Isabela,Young [Mazino], and everyone. It still was beneficial in some way. In the moment, it was very cathartic to say out loud [for] the reality of the production that we were going [into]. In the end, I mean, what more do you need to say than, \"Give Sarah my love.\" Leading up to that bit of dialogue, your face has a hint of anger on it, and then when you actually sit down and start the cleaning process, there's a level of happy recognition. Were you actively trying to convey some level of hope or acceptance about the situation there? There's definitely anger and disgust at the sight of what they did to my brother. It's like that [Vito] Corleone \"Look what they did to my boy\" kind of moment. Then, as I'm going down — the idea that he's there with Sarah, with his daughter, with my niece, with our family, that he's there, and if you believe in that type of thing, that is the moment you take some solace in that. That was the idea, that it's not necessarily happiness, but it is comfort knowing they're together. What do you think is going through Tommy's mind as all of the votes at the council meeting start to not go his way? I haven't seen the final cut; I saw a version of this scene. I wonder if it's different, butit's we got to do it the right way, but I got her back a hundred percent. I'm voting yes, we go, and it's a quick vote for me. The moment we start taking the votes, I write it down, I hold it up, I look around, and it'swe're all in this together, right? Everybody's on the same page. In the end, it may very well be just me, possibly Maria. I think she votes yes. The third vote, not exactly sure who that is, but it's not Jesse. Which is smart, he's right. We're all acting from our guts and our hearts, and he's acting through his mind and his head. But it's pride in Ellie, in her ability to put it into words, even though I get a sense that—what you see later in the scene with Catherine—she's so shrew, she's so smart. She knows how to work a room and manipulate people in the way she needs to and is aware of that. But it's also the fact that Seth is right, and Bobby John Burke does a great job in that scene.It's just like they came in, they took one of ours, and we're just going to stand down? We take that vote, and the looks all around are one of disbelief that everyone can just move on. This version of Tommy would accept that vote. That's what the people chose, that's what his wife and his community and everyone else—that's the process by which we handle things. As the story progresses, people make some unilateral choices. Tommy has his allegiances, of course, to his family, his wife, his child, and the community, yes. But also to the closest person to the love in Ellie's life that she just lost. And as the closest person to that, I have my allegiances to her, and things shake out from there. Whether right or wrong, justified or not, we all make a decision and we are going to have to live and die by those decisions. At the very beginning of this season, Tommy tells Ellie that he thinks she and Joel are the same person. When Tommy goes to see Gail, is he looking for some level of reassurance that Ellie mightnotbe like him? I think he's looking for some perspective for himself. It's probably the first time Tommy's ever talked to that therapist. I think it's more so just as somebody who knew Joel, who might have some information about him and his relationship with Ellie, this person might be able to offer me some sense of what I'm feeling and give me a position of righteousness to not go myself in that moment. Maybe somebody who could say, \"I think she'll be all right.\" Maybe not get over it, but I think she'll be able to grieve through this and stay here safe with you. But that's not what she says. We all know the truth of it. We all know who she is. She's very much Joel's daughter in a lot of ways and won't let certain things slide and will seek out their own personal justice. Tommy leaves; he knows, he has a sense of it. He's hoping not, but he does have a sense that she's going to do something stupid, as he says. You bring up that idea of justice. While we have a long way to go before the show is done, but I’m curious as for your perspective on what the series is trying to say about the fine line between justice and vengeance. I am not shy about framing it up this way because I think it's important to say, and it was part of Neil [Druckmann]'s—from what I understand in writing this story as this allegory—as this metaphor for what's happening in the West Bank and other conflicts around the world where they've been going on and on in this cycle of vengeance and retaliation for millennia. Any particular person could pick any particular point as the origin, but we all know that it extends beyond that. There was a transgression that preceded that, and there would maybe have been another one that preceded that. You have this continual, endless circle of being unforgiving. The lesson of the second game, I believe, is forgiveness. Love and, ultimately, forgiveness. Not to get into it for those who haven't seen it, but as this story goes on, you start losing more and more on your path to this and more and more of yourself. You just keep losing. So, how much are you willing to lose before you learn this lesson? What we're trying to leave people with is, at some point, you just got to stop. You have to stop and turn back towards love. Isabela mentioned to me that when moments got tough, music was a big thing for her and that she had these sing-a-long sessions on set. Before we started chatting I saw you grab your guitar.What role did music play for you on set? This guitar [Luna grabs the guitar and pulls it into frame] which was given to me by Robert Rodriguez, is with me every day at work, every job I do. I play it every day. I usually try to find a song that gives me a way into the scene and whatever it'll be about. Just to play it a little bit, to put more tissue between all of us there working. Even people humming the same tune can sometimes help you build [and] strengthen these ties between departments, between people working together. It certainly did that for us as a cast because we'd sit in holding, [or] we'd all peel off or go out. Me and Young would go sit in one of the benches or somewhere in town and just play for each other. In the first season, Bella and I would play a lot; They'd play songs for me and I'd play my own originals for them. It ends up helping [to] give everything this sense of levity. We're working on this thing—it's very heavy, but it never feels like that. It never feels bogged down and overly weighty. It has lift to it because we always keep a melody in the air. They're all incredibly talented, all of them. Young is an incredible guitarist. Isabella plays the ukulele, the piano, and sings in this Eartha Kitt-style, raspy voice. Bella has a three-octave range. Kaitlyn has a band with her sister. Ariela [Barer] sings really beautifully, these cool indie tunes. Spencer [Lord] plays the guitar. He's a ripper. He can play really well. Tati [Gabrielle] sings amazingly. All the new cast, for the most part, are really musical. Pedro and Rutina [Wesley] have a great musical appreciation. It's in the DNA ofThe Last of Us. Music is such a huge part of the storytelling, the meanings of certain songs, who taught you that tune, what it means, Gustavo's score—and the way that he plays those strings and how each string in the finger plucking style that he plays, either the banjo or the guitar or whatever it is—feels like emotions being picked out one by one. Music is the lifeblood of the story, both the game and the live-action version.",

    "title": "Nathan Fielder Parodies Paramount+ as Nazi Germany on 'The Rehearsal'",
    "article_text": "Leave it toNathan Fielderto take a joke all the way. On the second episode of season two ofThe Rehearsal, Fielder took aim at Paramount+, depicting the streamer as Nazis after it removed an episode of his previous show,Nathan For You,for “sensitivities” surrounding antisemitism. Thesecond seasonof Fielder’s HBO reality comedy series,The Rehearsal, finds the comedian hyperfixating on ways that he can help commercial airplanes avoid plane crashes by any means necessary. (Spoilers ahead.) But the HBO series takes a detour in episode two, when Fielder discovers that Paramount+ had removed an episode ofNathan For You—the mid-2010s Comedy Central docu-reality series where the comedian would concoct elaborate schemes in order to help an individual with a business problem they were facing—due to specious allegations of antisemitism. In the 2015 episode ofNathan For You“Horseback Riding/Man Zone,” Fielder starts an apparel line called Summit Ice after discovering that Taiga, the Canadian brand that made his favorite winter jacket, had published a tribute to the Holocaust denier Doug Collins. In response, Fielder, who is Jewish, launched his own brand of winter jackets, Summit Ice, dedicated to spreading Holocaust awareness and donating all profits to theVancouver Holocaust Education Centreandother educational organizations.Fielder enlisted the help of a rabbi and pitched the business idea to a store owner on the show, which included showcasing their clothing behind a replica of the Auschwitz gate, swastika pennants, and a fake skeleton in an oven. While Fielder’s Holocaust-centric winter jacket pitch flopped in the room—“Find something else to do with your life, because you are not good at this,” the store owner said—the brand became something of a cult hit for fans of the eccentric comedian. Summit Ice reportedly generated $300,000 in sales in its first eight weeks, with famous individuals likeJohn MayerandJack Blackspottedwearing Summit Ice jackets in the weeks after the episode aired. In episode two ofThe Rehearsal, Fielder estimates that, in the past decade, Summit Ice has probably generated millions of dollars toward Holocaust awareness. Summit Ice is Fielder’s “proudest achievement,” he said, using it as an example of something “silly” that “can actually have an impact in the world.” While Fielder’s Summit Ice intentions were pure, the message of hisNathan For Youstunt was apparently misinterpreted by Paramount, the parent company of Comedy Central, and its streamer Paramount+ removed the episode without informing Fielder. After reaching out to Paramount+, Fielder found out the reasoning for taking the episode down, which he described onThe Rehearsalas “so shocking” that it created “a tornado of emotions began spinning in my body.” “In late 2023, a decision was made by Paramount+ Germany to remove the episode in their region after they became uncomfortable with what they called ‘anything that touches on antisemitism in the aftermath of the Israel/Hamas attacks,’” said Fielder, reading an email he received from Paramount+ onThe Rehearsal. “This act by Germany triggered the attention of other European Paramount branches, and they, in turn, pulled the episode too. Before long, the ideology of Paramount+ Germany had spread to the entire globe, eliminating all Jewish content that made them uncomfortable.” As Fielder is describing this, the screen displays a map of Europe with the Paramount+ logo spreading from Germany across all of Europe in a ripple effect—at once, a not-so-subtle parallel to the spread of fascism. Ever attune to irony, Fielder proceeded to dedicate the last half of the episode to“rehearsing” the conversation he would have with Paramount executives about why they took “Horseback Riding/Man Zone” off the platform. But there was one problem. “I didn’t know what the Paramount+ Germany offices looked like, so I sort of had to take a guess,” said Fielder. His version of the German Paramount offices was straight out of Nazi Germany, with hired actors portraying Paramount “executives” with thick German accents, dressed in Nazi-adjacent suits, saluting each other, and taking military orders. Large banners with the Paramount+ logo draped the walls. Fielder eventually sits down with the Fuhrer—excuse us, the pretend head of Paramount+ Germany—wearing a tan suit. They have a conversation, which was pre-written by Fielder, about why Paramount+ removed the episode due to antisemitism. “In Germany today, we have no tolerance for any images that may evoke hate or incite violence toward any group of people,” said the fake executive. While he certainly took shots at Paramount, the often self-deprecating comedian eventually turned the lens inward. Fielder instructed the fake executive to ditch the scripted material and improvise the conversation. “You designed this office to look like a war room, dressed me to look like a Nazi, pretending to want feedback,” the actor says to Fielder. “But you don’t actually want to get the Paramount+ perspective, or the German perspective. Look at you pretending to be serious. This is not sincere. You’re just a man with a grudge using his television show to smear us instead of trying to understand us.” According toVariety,sources indicate that Paramount+ was allegedly not made aware of this storyline. A source close to the situation says that 2015 episode in question is not streaming on Paramount+ following a standards review. For those curious, “Horseback Riding/Man Zone” is available to stream on Max, HBO’s streaming platform. Vanity Fairreached out to Fielder for comment.

    "title": "All of Rihanna’s Met Gala Looks From 2007 to Now",
    "article_text": "If there’s one star who has taken the adage “last but not least” to heart when it comes tothe Met Gala, it’sRihanna. As the Met Gala 2025 draws nearer, with Rihanna’s partnerA$AP Rockyserving as a co-chair this year, fashion enthusiasts everywhere are looking out not just for what Rihanna will wear to the annual fundraiser, but when she’ll arrive. Will the fashion fixture, who in recent years is often the show-stopping final arrival on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, show up with Rocky at the beginning of the event, when he’s due to help greet guests? Or will the couple opt to arrive separately this year and enjoy solo moments in the spotlight? Whenever she arrives at the Met Gala, this year in celebration of the Costume Institute's exhibit“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,”Rihanna is sure to wow in a couture look. She was absent from last year's fundraising festivities, making a return to the fête all the sweeter. The singer made her first appearance at the Met Gala in 2007. The theme was “Poiret: King of Fashion,” and Rihanna was just 19 years old and not yet known for her show-stopping, carpet-closing appearances at the annual event. She wore a whiteGeorges Chakragown embellished with crystals, completing the romantic look by holding a single long-stemmed red rose. As time went on, her fashion choices for the gala got edgier: The musician embraced tight-fitting silhouettes, took inspiration from menswear, and dared to bare in formal crop tops before showing off one's midsection was as de rigueur as it is now. It was at 2015’s “China: Through the Looking Glass” party, however, that Rihanna claimed her crown as queen of The Met. She wore a canary yellowGuo Peigown and matching headpiece, her every move trailed by a regal, cape-like train. The attention-grabbing look marked the beginning of Rihanna’s continuing run of fashion dominance at the event, going big every time, to the delight of fashion lovers. In 2018, Rihanna wore an instant-classic look to reflect the gala’s “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” theme. The world met Pope Rihanna, decked out inJohn Galliano–designed Maison Margiela, laden with pearls and ornate beading, complete with a papal-inspired headpiece and spikedChristian Louboutinheels. Even late-term pregnant, as she was at the 2023 gala, her most recent appearance, Rih brought it,arriving alongside partner A$AP Rocky at the last possible second, swathed in white flowers and revealing a gigantic train on her stunning Valentino gown. You never quite know what to expect on the Met Gala's red carpet, but these days, if Rihanna is there, you can count on some kind of fashion magic. Below, see all of Rihanna’s Met Gala fashion looks, from her debut in 2007 to her most recent appearance in 2023. In Georges Chakra. In Dolce & Gabbana. In Stella McCartney. In Tom Ford. In Stella McCartney. In Guo Pei. In Commes des Garçons. In John Galliano for Maison Margiela. In Balenciaga and a matching hat from Stephen Jones Millinery. In Valentino.

    "title": "Marc Andreessen Touted the Open Web. Now He Lives Life in Exclusive Group Chats",
    "article_text": "Once upon a time, the titans of tech promised us a future of radical openness. InvestorMarc Andreessenand his peers sold a vision of the internet as the ultimate democratizer—an endless frontier where, asAndreessen once put it“people will have full access to the world's information, free communication everywhere.” But the same venture capitalists, founders, and executives who made their fortunes touting the gospel of openness have now retreated to their own private digital bunkers in the form of an interconnected network of exclusive group chats designed for and by the business and political world’s self-styled intellectuals. On Sunday, Semafor’sBen Smithreportedon the inner workings of these chats, many of which seem to orbit around Andreessen himself. It's these chats, Smith writes, that facilitated the tech sector’s lurch towardDonald Trump, forging a kind of group think that, until recently, tech leaders were wary of airing in the open. “People during 2020 felt that there was a monoculture on social media, and if they didn’t agree with something, group chats became a safe space to debate that, share that, build consensus, feel that you’re not alone,”Erik Torenberg, an entrepreneur and one of the creators of the chats told Semafor. Some chats cut across the political spectrum. One called Chatham House reportedly includes Democrats like billionaireMarc Cubanand economistLarry Summersas well as conservatives like Daily Wire editorBen Shapiro, Palantir co-founder and Trump boosterJoe Lonsdale, Andreessen, and more. Others have become breeding grounds for pushing tech elites to the right, conservative activistChris Rufotold Semafor. “I looked at these chats as a good investment of my time to radicalize tech elites who I thought were the most likely and high-impact new coalition partners for the right,” Rufo said. That investment appears to have paid off—at least, for a time. But now, there’s growing evidence that the same pushback that discourages these powerful people from having these conversations out loud on social media is happening again behind their closed digital doors. After investor and White House officialDavid Sacksaccused some members of a group chat of turning on Trump (\"TDS,\" or Trump Derangement Syndrome, he called it), according to one screenshot shared by Semafor, another member wrote back, “I think we - Republicans who supported Trump - are seeing that this is a failed administration.\" The screenshot also shows that, soon after this exchange, three members of the group,Tucker Carlson,Tyler Winklevoss, and investorShaun Maguire,appear to have left the group. Beyond these internecine battles, though, these chats reveal just how far some conservative voices and tech luminaries have strayed from the ideals of openness and free speech they profess to hold dear. The same people who teased liberal snowflakes for their safe spaces and intolerance have now built their own insular echo chambers where dissent is quietly sidelined and ideological conformity is rewarded.

    "title": "Donald Trump Says He Runs the Country and the World, But He Still Answers Calls From Unknown Numbers",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumptalks a lot of smack aboutthe mediain public. But, in private, it turns out he’s happy to shoot the breeze with reporters—even the oneshe claims are liars and lunatics. Even when they cold-call him from an unknown number. Even on a Saturday morning. At least, that is how journalistsAshley ParkerandMichael Shererscored an interview with the president last month, according to theirsweeping new cover storyinThe Atlanticabout Trump's return to the White House. In late March, just days after Trump excoriated both reporters on Truth Social following their request for an interview with him, Parker and Sherer wrote that they called the president directly on his cell phone from a number he didn’t recognize at 10:45 am on a Saturday. And he actually picked up. “Who’s calling?” he reportedly asked, like any other 78-year-old grandpa, the sound of what Parker and Sherer said seemed to be the television blaring in the background at hisBedminster, New Jersey golf club. “We had a perfectly fine, gracious interview,” SherertoldCNN Monday. Despite his verypublic insistence on Truth Socialthat Parker is “as terrible as is possible” and Sherer “virtually always LIES,” the president apparently was happy to talk. On the subject of his new billionaire bestie,Jeff Bezos, Trump reportedly said, “He’s 100 percent. He’s been great.” AndMark Zuckerberg? He too has \"been great,” Trump said. “Maybe they didn’t know me at the beginning, and they know me now,” Trump told Parker and Sherer of the tech executives. Trump also used the call to take a victory lap around the recent capitulation oflaw firmsanduniversitiesin the face of his threats. “What do you think of the law firm? Were you shocked at that?” he asked the reporters regarding Paul Weiss’s negotiations with the White House over an executive order that would have restricted its attorneys’ access to federal buildings. And he celebrated the leverage he has over the rest of the Republican party. “When I endorse somebody, they win,” Trump told Parker and Sherer. Trump warned the reporters that ifThe Atlanticwrote “good stories and truthful stories, the magazine would be hot,” and said that most media owners were growing tired of standing up to Trump, a possible reference toBezos’s Trump-friendly turnatThe Washington Post. “At some point, they say, No más, no más,” Trump reportedly said. The interview came shortly beforeThe Atlanticbroke the news about National Security AdvisorMichael Waltzaccidentally invitingAtlanticeditorJeffrey Goldbergto a private Signal chat, which prompted the president to sour on the magazine all over again. (Trump called Goldberg“a total sleazebag.”) But once again, his public barbs didn’t stand in the way of a separate invitation to the White House, which he extended to Sherer, Parker, and Goldberg last week. During that meeting, Sherer said on CNN, Trump “was in a far more conciliatory mood” and acknowledged the turmoil that has since overtaken the Pentagon. “I think he’s gonna get it together,” Trump said of Defense SecretaryPete Hegseth. “I had a talk with him, a positive talk, but I had a talk with him.” As for the news that his Cabinet officials had accidentally texted secretive strike plans to Goldberg, Trump said he’d instructed his team, “Maybe don’t use Signal, okay?” The Atlantic’s story is a telling account of how the president staged an unlikely comeback after becoming a political pariah in the wake of the January 6, back when his team was reportedly having trouble getting him even booked onFox & Friends. It also shows how he’s come back more powerful than the first time around now that the guardrails of his first term are off. As Trump reportedly put it during the Saturday morning phone call, “The first time, I had two things to do—run the country and survive; I had all these crooked guys. And the second time, I run the country and the world.” But even more than that, the story is a stunning illustration of how, perhaps the most media-savvy president of all time works the press in public and private—but still somehow does not know how to screen a phone call.

    "title": "'Love on the Spectrum' Creator Cian O’Clery Knows His Cast Are “The Most Important Critics”",
    "article_text": "Through no fault of its own, Netflix’sLove on the Spectrumhas been thrust into the national discourse. Thanks to the bizarre and alarming comments thatRobert F. Kennedy Jr.,the US Secretary of Health and Human Services, has made about autism—which include everything from threatening to starta national registry to track those diagnosed with autism, to claiming that autistic individuals willnever pay taxes, hold a job, or go on a date—the world has its eyes on the US’s approach to members in the autistic community. With his seriesLove on the Spectrum,which follows the romantic journeys of adults with autism, directorCian O’Cleryhas already proven Kennedy wrong on at least one front. The third season ofLove on the Spectrum,which O’Clery created withKarina Holdenand production company Northern Pictures, has been in-and-out of Netflix’s “top 10 most watched” series on the platform ever since it debuted on April 2. “It’s kind of blown up in the last couple of days,” O’Clery tellsVanity Fair,of both his series and the discourse. He didn’t have the US government in mind when he createdLove on the Spectrumin his native Australia six years ago. A three-time Emmy winning reality TV veteran who’s worked on the Australian version of dating shows likeMarried at First Sight,O’Clery was initially drawn to the idea of a reality dating series that didn’t have a competitive aspect. “I’ve worked in the reality space back in the day where it was a lot more difficult,” he says. “The people we work with are just so lovely and kind.” Now, the people O’Clery works with are speaking out against RFK. Jr.In an interview with News Nation,Love on the SpectrumstarDani Bowmancalled Kennedy’s comments about the autistic community “completely false.” “Autistic people have the same hopes, dreams and, yes, the same awkward dating moments as anyone else,” she said. “To generalize and say none of us can work, date or contribute to society, is completely false. I have a job. I do pay taxes. I’ve dated. I have a master’s degree.” On TikTok, Love on the SpectrumstarJames B. Jonessaid he found Kennedy’s comments to be “extremely ignorant, and to be perfectly frank, downright offensive.” “I am old enough, I am of sufficient age that I can remember a time when society did not have a very thorough understanding of autism or similar forms of neurodiversity,” he continued. “So, I am very displeased, very disheartened to hear someone make comments of that nature.” O’Clery is proud of his cast for speaking truth to power. “Good for them for speaking up,” he says. “Obviously those comments are hurtful to some people. I think it’s great that people are turning to the cast from the series to be those voices of people who experienced this and who have the life experience to be able to speak to those things.” Helming three seasons ofLove on the Spectrumexposed O’Clery to the diverse array of individuals on the autism spectrum. “Meeting so many different people on the spectrum, we realized how very different each and every individual person is,” he says. “In the media space, traditionally, often a representation of autism would’ve been one character in the drama, often a white nerdy guy who’s good with computers.” Below, O’Clery talks withVFabout his inspiration for creating the series and where some of season three’s favorite couples stand now. (L-R) Production assistant Chloe Henderson, James B. Jones, field producer Sean Bowman, Cian O'Clery, and June Jones. Vanity Fair:Where did the idea forLove on the Spectrumcome from? Cian O’Clery:It all started back in Australia. I was working with Northern Pictures on a different series that we were making for the Australian Public Broadcaster, which was about people with disabilities looking for employment. In the process of making that series, we met so many young adults on the spectrum. At the time, I think the disability community in Australia was about 40% autistic people. We just met so many young adults in that process who expressed not just a desire to find work and employment, but to find love. There were a lot of people who were really struggling—some people in their 20s, 30s, who’d never even been on a date but really wanted to find love. That was something super important to them. It felt like there was a bit of a lack of support in that space. There was a lot of support in the disability employment area. [Australia has] government funding for organizations to help people with that, which is great. But, at the time, there wasn’t anything in the dating and relationship space. That’s such an important part of who we are, what makes us tick. It felt like a really interesting space to explore. Love on the Spectrumfeels authentic to the lived experience of the cast members with autism, but never feels exploitative of them. How do you walk that line? The simple answer is that we care for the people we’re filming. We like them and we want what’s best for them. That’s always a part of everything we do. When you like the people you’re filming with, you respect them. You want them to be happy with the product at the end of the day. You don’t want them to turn around and feel like you’ve done them a disservice by telling their story in a certain way. It is a line that you dance. Sometimes, there are things that we’ll take out that might be really entertaining or really interesting, but we feel doesn’t necessarily represent the person in the best way or in the best light. Hopefully, we’ve managed to tell everyone’s stories in a way that people are happy with. I mean, the participants themselves are really happy, which is great. They’re the most important critics. Cian O'Clery andLove on the Spectrumstar Tanner Smith. How do you cast the show? I’ve got a really great team of producers—a very small team. We do all the casting ourselves as a producing team, which really helps because there’s continuity. Often the same person they first spoke to is the person who’s then with them. That consistency—keeping a really small team—I think is really helpful. Making the very first Australian series, casting at first was hard. Convincing people that this was going to be a respectful series and that we had the best intentions was difficult originally. Once people saw the show and then once we came to America, people really knew what it was and straight away were just so happy to help. Honestly, the [autistic] community has been amazing in terms of helping us spread the word. The amount of people who write in [to be on the show] is enormous, which is both encouraging for us that people trust us and think that being a part of this series is a positive thing. But also it’s a real shame because it means there are so many people out there who are really wanting to find love who we can’t help. But the series is inspiring group and dating events. It’s inspired lots of different places and organizations to create their own spaces to try and foster a bit more socializing in terms of the dating world. I love howLove on the Spectrumcaptures the family dynamics of the cast. What was it like working with the families? Every family is different and every family dynamic is different. We have some amazing families that we follow when the cast live with their families. We also have cast members who don’t live with their families and whose friends are their support networks. The cast who do live at home with their families, we’ve been lucky enough to tell the stories of some families who are just so spot on when it comes to how they support their child. Lise [Menard Smith],for example,Connor [Tomlinson’s]mom. I’m really impressed with the way she talks to Connor. There was a scene in season three with a discussion about tipping and whether tipping $5 was appropriate or not. Lise—seeing that Connor just basically didn’t understand something and his frustration was building—was really great at explaining to him about how society expects things to work, but also in a way that he can process and understand. She’s amazing. His family’s great. They support him in a way that’s not just supportive, but also is helping him to get to a point where he can “fly the nest,” as he says. A fledgling ready to fly the nest. And I love James’s family. They’re just so great, and they’re so funny together. The three of them are just like a comedy trio, and it’s brilliant. I love their dynamic and the fact that it’s not coddling. It’s not feeling sad. It’s just living their daily lives and going about it in the way that they best can, as well as maintaining a lightheartedness about things. There are a lot of times when the dates don’t work out. We saw James strike out at a speed dating event this season. Can you talk to me a little bit about how the dates are organized? First I’ll talk about James going speed dating, because some people have said online, “What are the producers doing sending James to a neurotypical speed dating event?” Firstly, that’s an ableist comment. James goes to speed dating events all the time, and he goes to mainstream speed dating events. That’s what he does. So it was important for us to tell that story because it’s a big part of his search for love, right? That’s the truth of his story. In terms of the matches that we find for people, we talk to the people themselves. With each individual, we’re telling their story. We’re not telling a generic autism story. We’re telling James’s story, we’re tellingPari’s story, we’re tellingMadison’s story. We work with them and what they think—what kind of person they think would be a good match, what kind of person might be on a similar wavelength to them. Sometimes that’s someone who’s neurotypical. Sometimes that’s someone who’s autistic. Sometimes it’s somebody with Down syndrome. It’s about working with them in terms of what is best for them. Having said that, we are the matchmakers, which, I guess, is a unique thing. We wouldn’t have been able to make the show without being matchmakers because we’re following so many people who haven’t dated much. It’s a non-scientific art. And we’re not mismatching people. We’re not trying to create conflict or drama. Don’t ask me how so many matches happened this season. It’s unbelievable. Which couples are still going strong? Madison andTylerare going strong. Pari andTinaare going strong. Connor andGeorgieare going strong. James andShelleyare going strong.AbbeyandDavid, obviously, are still going super strong. It’s kind of amazing to see when matches do work and do go right. Madison’s life has changed now. Sean Bowman, Tyler White, Madison Marilla, Cian O'Clery, and sound mixer Connor Colebrook. Speaking of Madison, her first date on the show didn’t go as planned. Her date, Brandon Lemieux, was overstimulated by the restaurant and they had to move outside. Can you talk about how you handled that situation? Obviously, we had spoken to him beforehand. We’d spoken to him and his mom many times—talked to them about being part of the series, talked about what kind of date would be okay. We checked: Would he be okay going on a date in a restaurant if it was fairly quiet? “Yeah, absolutely.” We had a whole half of that massive restaurant that was pretty much empty for us. There just happened to be some screaming children on the other end. We didn’t know that he was going to be as sensitive as he was. At the time, I was feeling bad for him, and we were trying to work out what we could do to make his experience less stressful. And eventually we did. Luckily, he was happy to step away and find a different spot. We thought about that scene for a while, and we spoke to [Brandon and his mother] about it too. We thought it was really important to include because people talk a lot about sensitivities or anxiety, but it’s rare that you see it and you can actually feel it as an audience member. When you watch that scene, for people who haven’t experienced something like that, I think you get it a lot more than if someone says, “Oh, I don’t like it when I hear a baby crying.” It felt important for us to keep that in and not to try and remove it because it felt hard on him. After that date, he was so proud of himself for putting himself out there and doing that. He was really happy. His mom was super happy with him. It was all a positive thing for them, despite the fact that at the time he was struggling. But that’s his daily life. He struggles with that on a daily basis whenever he goes out. Hopefully some places will start to understand a bit more about sounds and noises, because for people who are sensitive to noise, it can be rough. Autism has been in the news a lot these days because of RFK Jr. and the discourse that he’s prompted. What are your thoughts on the current discourse having spent so much time with the autistic community? It’s an incredibly diverse population and you can’t make assumptions about somebody because they have a diagnosis of autism. There’s plenty of people on the spectrum who want to find love and do find love. And I’ve seen a hell of a lot of that myself. And I think James and Dani and [Love on the Spectrumautism specialist]Jennifer Cookhave all been speaking up about some of those comments. I think that’s great because James and Dani and Jennifer, they can speak about it much more personally and eloquently than I can. It’s great that people are reading and listening to them. What does the future ofLove on the Spectrumlook like? Hopefully, there’s another season. There’s no official green light at this point, but we believe there’s plenty of stories to still be told. We’d love to keep making more of the series and working with these awesome people who are just a pleasure to film with really. We’re just crossing our fingers for the first USLove on the Spectrumwedding. Who knows when that’ll happen or who it’ll be, but it’s bound to happen one day, right?

    "title": "Gene Hackman Autopsy Sheds Light on His Bleak Final Days",
    "article_text": "Two months after two-time Oscar winnerGene Hackmanand his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, werefound deadin their Santa Fe home on February 26, moreupsetting detailsregarding their last days have emerged. The final autopsy results determined by the Office of the Medical Investigator in New Mexico and obtained byFox News Digitalon Sunday, reveal that Hackman likely hadn’t eaten for days before his death and may have lived for a week without knowledge that Arakawa had died. After the 95-year-old actor and his 65-year-old wife’s “partially mummified” bodies were discovered, authorities initially ruled that the couple’s deaths were “suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation,” and a criminal investigation was launched. But no external trauma was found on either body, according to the report. Carbon monoxide poisoning was also ruled out, as testing for the substance found less than 5% saturation, which is in “keeping with a normal range.” Hackman had a “history of congestive heart failure” as well as “severe chronic hypertensive changes, kidneys” and “neurodegenerative features consistent with Alzheimer’s disease,” per the autopsy. He had been fitted with a “bi-ventricular pacemaker” in April 2019. Activity from the device shows that he most likely died on February 18 from cardiovascular disease, with Alzheimer’s as a contributing factor,approximately a week after his wife. Arakawa, whose cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, arare rodent-borne disease, was initially believed to have died on February 11, but it was later found that she likelypassed the following day, as Arakawa reportedly called the concierge medical service Cloudberry Health early on February 12. In the days before her death, Arakawa had also researched “COVID” multiple times on her computer and sent a message to her massage therapist, sharing Hackman had taken a “covid test” after experiencing “flu/cold-like symptoms.” Hackman tested negative for the hantavirus, but a toxicology report found that his system had “trace amounts” of acetone, a product of diabetic and fasting-inducing ketoacidosis, as reported by Fox News Digital. At the time of his death, Hackman’s levels were at 5.3 mg/dl, which is consistent with prolonged fasting. Given Hackman’s “advanced state of Alzehimer’s,” New Mexico chief medical examinerHeather Jarrellpreviouslysaid, “it’s quite possible that he was not aware” of his wife Arakawa’s death in the days before his own demise. Hackman won his two Academy Awards for roles in 1971’sThe French Connectionand 1992’sUnforgiven,and married Arakawa in 1991 before his retirement from acting in 2004. He is survived by three children from his previous marriage to Faye Maltese—Christopher,65;Elizabeth,62; andLeslie,58.

    "article_text": "Earlier this month,The New York Timeshired a full-time director of photography—primarily for podcasts. It might sound like a surprising move for a podcast, unless you’ve clocked what’s been happening atThe Ezra Klein Show.Klein, once a disembodied voice, is now a bona fide millennial onscreen hottie, staring straight into the camera and engaging a new kind of audience. The message is clear, and in this case, the medium really is the message: Podcasts aren’t just going visual; they’re becoming television. And YouTube is the network where it’s all happening. This phenomenon is playing out across the news media.The Atlanticjust rolled out aYouTube podcasthosted by writerDavid Frum.Shows from upstarts likeMeidasTouch,The Bulwark,Crooked Media, andThe Free Pressare already fixtures on the platform.

As YouTube CEONeal Mohanrecentlyput it, “For more and more people, watching TV means watching YouTube.” And it’s not just reshaping entertainment—it’s transforming politics too. Presidential campaigns have always mirrored the dominant medium of their moment: FDR had radio, JFK mastered television, and 2024 was dubbed the “podcast election.”Donald Trumpreached voters—especiallyyoung male ones—through shows likeThe Joe Rogan ExperienceandThis Past Weekend w/ Theo Von,whileKamala Harrismade a campaign stop onCall Her Daddy. That shift caught the attention ofEzra Klein Showsupervising editorClaire Gordon.Last summer, she and Klein came across anNBC pollshowing just how much news sources influence voter behavior. Americans who relied on legacy media leaned towardJoe Biden,while YouTube viewers skewed in favor of Trump. “What’s happening on YouTube? What’s the news environment like [there]?” she recalls them asking themselves. “It felt like we were ceding an audience,” Gordon tells me. “There’s a big conversation happening there, and we should be part of it.” Gordon, who joinedThe New York Timesin 2023, had previously served as showrunner for Netflix’sExplained,a Vox Media show cocreated by Klein, and was a producer onLast Week Tonight With John Oliver.She first turned to theTimes’ video studio to film Klein’s podcast. Inside a cavernous set, they experimented with three- and five-camera setups, prime-time lighting, and a full crew of producers and fact-checkers just off camera. But something felt off. The high-gloss look clashed with the show’s core appeal: vulnerability and depth. “Ultimately, what we’re shooting now is in one of the podcast studios, where it just feels very intimate,” Gordon says. “It’s easier to forget about the cameras. And [for Ezra, who wants] to produce the best conversation, the space where we shoot [needs] to be conducive to that.” Still cut for audio-first, the show now speaks a new syntax—one shaped by a postpandemic media landscape. With studios closed and meetings streamed from bedrooms, audiences got used to seeing CEOs, experts, and hosts in raw, imperfect spaces. TikTok took off. Personality replaced polish. Viewers didn’t just accept this new visual vernacular—they craved it. That desire for authenticity reflects a deeper cultural shift. “Younger audiences have a huge distrust of not just media institutions—but any institution,”Liz Kelly Nelson,founder of Project C, a platform that supports journalists in the creator economy, told me recently. “They build trust by seeing their sources as human beings.” Kelly Nelson, former vice president of audio atVox,whenThe Ezra Klein Showwas an audio-only podcast (and where I also worked as an audio producer), has evolved with the medium. Her focus now is on how Gen Z and Gen Alpha consume news—and she believes they won’t simply adopt traditional media habits as they age. “So then what are the things that we need to do, to not try to change the direction that things are going, but at least add some of the layers that make journalism rigorous, that make our credibility shine through?” she asks. “So when my [14-year-old] son looks at a news reader or Ezra Klein on TikTok and sees things—that may be subconscious, but they are signals—that this is credible journalism. And then he seesAndrew Tate,and he knows that’s not right.” That push for credibility and authenticity in the new media landscape is somethingMediaitefounder, owner, and publisherDan Abramsis also watching closely—and capitalizing on. His company recently announced astrategic expansioninto YouTube-first content, partnering with a slate of broadcast stars to build individual channels under theMediaiteumbrella. “It is television,” Abrams declares. “Anyone who still thinks of YouTube as something for your phone or computer isn’t paying attention.” By 2028, he predicts,Mediaite(and likely others) will stream live election coverage directly to YouTube, just like any major outlet. For Abrams, the shift is cultural as much as technological. “I think it’s the perfect storm,” says Abrams, who has served as a legal analyst for ABC and NBC and as a host for networks such as MSNBC, A&E, and NewsNation. “The dying relevance of classic television—cable and broadcast—in conjunction with the explosion of social media, where individuals can create their own brands, with YouTube at the intersection of the two.” Abrams—whose own podcast now runs on both SiriusXM and YouTube—is blunt: Success on YouTube requires a different playbook from traditional broadcast. “You’ve gotta have a point of view,” he says. “There’s gotta be a reason for people to come toyou—and that’s why political moderation is tougher than political extremism, which tends to work better.” The revolution may not be televised, but it’s certainly being podcasted, uploaded, and queued up on YouTube. Impact here isn’t about raw numbers. “Television can be passive—people flipping through, keeping it on in the background. The best of YouTube is people who are engaged,” Abrams says. Likes, comments, and shares drive the algorithm, fueling reach and growth. That’s a big reason podcasts made the leap from headphones to screens. For years, podcasts spread by word of mouth—one AirPod at a time. Loyal, niche, and hard to scale. But with video in the mix, YouTube’s algorithm kicks things into high gear. “You grow [podcasts] organically over time and write your headlines in a way that just speaks to [the relationship with] your audience,” says showrunner Gordon. But on an algorithmic platform, the rules change. “Recently, if you have ‘Trump’ or ‘Elon Musk’ in your headline on YouTube, it’s just gonna do better in the algorithm.” While that dynamic can drive growth, Gordon doesn’t pretend it’s without cost. “I can absolutely see why the rise of algorithms has led to a rise in more rage-bait-y or just more emotional and provocative and polarizing types of content—because that gets more engagement.” Gordon, now something of a podcast-TV-YouTube hybrid producer, suspects that as more people watch on their TVs, podcast videos will only become more polished, more sophisticated, more…television. This marks a shift from podcasting’s original DNA: a scrappy, lo-fi format, free of lighting rigs and glam squads. While Gordon insists Klein has no plans to become a prime-time-style TV host, and she still values audio-only podcasts, her prediction is clear: “You’re gonna see more and more things maturing into a thing that ultimately, back to my original theory, everything eventually becomes television.” Ben Davis,senior partner and cohead of digital at WME, is banking on it. “What even is a podcast anymore? What’s a YouTube series? What’s a TV show?” Davis half-joked on a recent call. To him, YouTube hits likeHot Ones(which also has a podcast feed) orAmy Poehler’s new podcast,Good Hang,(which also exists on YouTube) have a lot in common with classic late-night television. And that’s exactly the point. WME, repping some of the world’s biggest talent, is urging major streamers to license YouTube-first podcasts behind their paywalls. “All of them are just in the audience business, and this is actually a really low-cost way to get a highly engaged audience,” Davis says. “Even the highest-paid podcasters in the world are still cheap relative to TV budgets, and they come with built-in audiences.” To Davis, the model is familiar: “In the way that news was low-cost content in the cable bundle—whether it’s ESPN or CNN—there are versions of that here.” He sees a clear opportunity in the arbitrage created by low-cost programming. “Take Peacock,” Davis said. “Why are people leaving Peacock to watch shows about your shows? Why not licenseThe Toast…orGiggly Squadonto your service? For every platform there will be a different strategy.” The life cycle has completed itself: Video killed the radio star. The radio star became a podcaster, the podcaster launched a YouTube channel, and YouTube became television. Now streaming platforms have become cable bundles again. Everything has changed—yet everything’s the same. As Davis puts it: “I call it theshowbusiness now—two separate words. It’s about shows.” Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Explosions, Hacking, Spoofs: Inside NewSecurity Threatsin the Skies WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "The Kim Kardashian Heist Trial Starts, and the World Awaits a Star’s Testimony",
    "article_text": "One night in October 2016,Kim Kardashianreturned to her hotel after an Alaïa dinner during Paris Fashion Week. She was, as now, something beyond a fixture of runway front rows, trailed at every turn by paparazzi. Around 3 a.m., three armed men wearing masks broke into her room, tied her arms and feet, and taped her mouth. They made off with one of the rings given to her by then husbandKanye Westand between $6 million and $10 million worth of other jewels. A representative said at the time that Kardashian was “badly shaken but physically unharmed.” Paris police quickly came to know the robbery, as my colleagueMark Sealreportedat the time, as L’Affaire Kardashian or simply “Kim.” On Monday, 10 men will stand trial in connection with the heist. Collectively, the suspects, some of whom were in their 60s and 70s, have come to be known in press coverage as the “grandpa robbers,” and during the expected four weeks of proceedings, they will come face-to-face with their alleged victim—Kardashian’s lawyer has said she will testify. According to prosecutors, five men dressed as police officers held a concierge at gunpoint before a few went to Kardashian’s apartment. Twelve men were originally charged; the allegations against the larger group include armed robbery, membership of a criminal gang, and sequestration. Eight of the men deny playing any role; one has died; another, age 80, was ruled too sick to stand trial at present. The other two men have admitted to some level of participation, withYunice Abbas,71, publishing his account of the night,J’ai Séquestré Kim Kardashian,with a coauthor in 2021. While fleeing the hotel by bicycle, one of the suspects dropped a diamond cross worth $33,180. It was found and given to the police by a passerby. (The majority of the stolen jewelry was never recovered and was reportedly sold in Belgium.) An attorney for AbbastoldReuters that his client immediately admitted to his involvement after arrests were made. DNA on the plastic bands used to tie Kardashian’s wrists helped lead police to Abbas, who had previously served nearly 20 years in prison and described himself in his memoir as a “hardened criminal” who began a long string of lawbreaking at 18 years old. “I saw one of her shows where she threw her diamond in the pool, in that episode ofKeeping Up With the Kardashians,” AbbastoldVicein 2022. “I thought, She’s got a lot of money. This lady doesn’t care at all.” “Since she was throwing money away,” he went on, “I was there to collect it, and that was that.” Kardashian’s ubiquity circa 2016, and the path she pioneered to reach it, led to an undercurrent of such moralizing in the immediate aftermath of the robbery. “You cannot display your wealth and then be surprised that some people want to share it with you,” Karl Lagerfeldtold reportersat a Chanel show a day after the heist, expressing a common sentiment among some observers. There was some amount of debate as to how Kardashian was targeted and monitored. A paparazzo who had been following her that day toldVanity Fairthat he couldn’t be sure whether the suspects had embedded within the pack of photographers. When asked whether the thieves had employed her social media footprint, the Paris police chief responded by saying only that “she gives information on social media all the time.” Kardashian took a break from social media in the following months and didn’t attend Paris Fashion Week the next year. As the case wound its way toward a trial date, there was some speculation as to whether Kardashian would give testimony. “She has tremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system and has been treated with great respect by the French authorities,” Kardashian’s lawyer,Michael Rhodes,recently said in a statementthat confirmed her intention to appear in person. “She wishes for the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion in accordance with French law and with respect for all parties to the case.” In interviews she’s given about the night, Kardashian has spoken of it as something of a turning point as well as a source of trauma. “It was meant to happen to me…I really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things,” shetoldEllen DeGeneresthrough tears in 2017. “I kept on thinking aboutKourtney,” she later toldDavid Letterman.Her sister had been at a club the night of the robbery. “I kept on thinking, She’s gonna come home and I’m gonna be dead in the room, and she’s gonna be traumatized for the rest of her life.” Another man who will stand trial in the coming weeks isAomar Ait Khedache,a 68-year-old known as Old Omar. He has acknowledged participating in the heist but denied prosecutors’ allegation that he was the mastermind. A year after the theft,TMZreportedthat Khedache had sent Kardashian an apology letter after seeing clips on French TV of her discussing the incident. “I want to come to you as a human being to tell you how much I regret my gesture, how much I have been moved and touched to see you in tears,” he wrote, according to the outlet. “Know that I fully sympathize with the pain you are enduring, your children, your husband, and your close ones. I hope that this letter will allow you to forget little by little the trauma that you suffered by my fault.” Kardashian is currently expected to testify on May 13.

    "title": "Juilliard for a Song? The Legendary School Is Going Tuition-Free",
    "article_text": "ForChristine Baranski, the most evocative space at the Juilliard School isn’t a black box theater or a rehearsal room where she cut her teeth as an actor. “I get really emotional when I set foot in the elevator,” she says with a sigh. She remembers its “new car smell” when she rode it in the early 1970s, as part of the third class to ever study in the drama school. And she remembers, just as viscerally, the people she rode in it with. “I was in the elevator once withLeonard Bernstein, withMartha Graham,George Balanchine,” she says. “I was in the elevator once withMaria Callas.” If you know anything about Juilliard, it’s probably that it is where some of our greatest artists learned to be great. The school, established in 1905 as the Institute of Musical Art in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village, has long given students world-class training in their chosen discipline: dance, drama, or music. Last September the drama department’s MFA program went tuition-free, asthe Yale School of Dramahad a few years before. Now—and this is why we gathered some celebrated alumni for a portrait backstage at the school’s Peter Jay Sharp Theater—Juilliard has announced that it intends to go entirely tuition-free. For every student. The great work has already begun. Starting this fall, 40 percent of Juilliard students will attend the institution at no cost. Reaching the school’s ultimate goal will take serious fundraising, but other elite educational institutions are increasingly thinking along the same lines. (Harvard College, for instance, announced that it will be tuition-free for families with incomes of under $200,000.) Since he became Juilliard’s president in 2018,Damian Woetzel, a former principal dancer with the New York City Ballet, has worked to make the school accessible to all students, not only increasing financial aid but also designating several programs tuition-free already. Juilliard currently costs north of $50,000—not including room and board—and more than 95 percent of the students already receive some support from the school. “The overall goal is to move steadily more tuition-free—to that ultimate place—and make sure that talent is the opportunity, not the ability to pay for it,” Woetzel says. That opportunity is hard to come by. Juilliard’s Drama Division typically accepts 18 students a year—8 to 10 undergraduate students and 8 to 10 graduate students—making it one of the most competitive and sought-after drama programs in the world. Even Baranski had a tough time getting in. “They put me on a waiting list in the spring,” she says. It wasn’t because she showed a lack of promise: “They thought that the space between my teeth might’ve been causing a sibilants,” she says. “Over the summer, I had dental work.” After capping her teeth and taking speech therapy classes, Baranski reauditioned for the speech teacher and the Drama Division’s artistic director, Oscar winner John Houseman. “I did a paragraph that was filled with nothing buts-words,” she recalls. It must have done the trick, because the moment the speech teacher signed off, Houseman accepted her on the spot. To this day, Baranski says, it’s “one of the most moving moments of my life.” Jessica Chastaincalls Juilliard her “home away from home.” The Northern California native studied at the school in the early aughts, immersing herself in roles like Arkadina inThe Seagulland honing the craft that would eventually win her an Oscar. “When you’re training, you have no idea what little seeds you’re planting and growing inside of you—how it’s going to develop into your career,” Chastain says. The first from her family to attend college, she struggled to afford tuition, particularly on top of the hair-raising cost of living in New York City. “I was so stressed out about money,” she says. She worked part-time in the library and the student affairs office on her lunch breaks and took out loans—“a lot” of them—to get by. “I couldn’t even afford to go to a restaurant. So it was all the cafeteria,” she says. Asked how the food was, she winces. “I mean, it’s a cafeteria,” she quips. After Chastain received the Robin Williams Scholarship, which covered the last two years of her four-year degree, she could breathe more freely. “Having that cushion was like, Okay, I can finish,” she says. “I can get my degree. I’ll still be in debt, but I won’t be consumed and overwhelmed by it.” Danielle Brookshad to pay full tuition when she left South Carolina for Juilliard. “I did not have the scholarship money,” she says. “My parents had to refinance our home for me to come here.” Even that wasn’t enough. “Unfortunately, my godmother had passed away and, to my surprise, left me $20,000 in her will. That was what helped me to start my first semester at Juilliard.” Brooks made it through the program, starring in productions likeA Raisin in the SunandClybourne Parkwhile working multiple front-desk jobs at the school, which she stuck with after graduation. “I remember nights of crying right after I graduated,” she says. “Not having the money and working all these odd jobs, trying to pay for college.” Brooks is now a Tony-and Oscar-nominated actor for the stage and screen versions ofThe Color Purple.“My cheeks hurt from the joy ofsurvivingthis place,” she says. Jon Batistetalks in terms of survival too. He moved to Manhattan from New Orleans to study music at Juilliard in 2004. He was 17. Musically, he felt “very prepared” but describes the transition to living in the city as “very much a learning curve.” He remembers “surviving New York City, surviving the limitless options that are presented to you as an artist that’s trying to discover who they are.” Now a new member of Juilliard’s board of trustees—and the winner of seven Grammys—he’s come to believe that it’s the institution’s responsibility to provide a space where the students can wholly commit to their chosen passion with as little stress as possible. “There’s enough in trying to sing the perfect aria or to play in the jazz band,” he says. “There’s so many summits that you have to climb before you can reach the level of greatness that everybody who comes here inevitably wants to reach.” BATISTE LOVES THE IDEA OF JUILLIARD REMOVING SOME PRESSURE: “THERE’S ENOUGH IN TRYING TO SING THE PERFECT ARIA OR TO PLAY IN THE JAZZ BAND. THERE’S SO MANY SUMMITS THAT YOU HAVE TO CLIMB.” There are setbacks along the way, of course. “I was unbelievably bad in a production here,” saysLaura Linney. “I was distracted. I knew I was bad. It was brutally painful.”Sopainful, she says, that she decided to walk away from the school altogether. Then an acting teacher took her aside and taught her the most important lesson she’d ever learn at Juilliard: “He said, ‘This is where you’re supposed to fail. You’ll never learn until you learn how to fail.’ ” Now the four-time Emmy winner is a vice chair of Juilliard’s board. “I’ve never left again.” How do the alums feel about future students getting a free ride? “Give me my money back,” Brooks deadpans. “Y’all owe me.” Chastain says that removing the barrier of paying tuition is a “great equalizer” for aspiring artists. If the children of wealthy families have a built-in advantage, she says, “then the whole industry is populated with privilege.” In her opinion, that doesn’t always make for the most vital art: “Those aren’t the stories that I necessarily think we should focus on and tell.” Money will always be a factor in the life of an artist—it’s a famously precarious profession after all. But with a tuition-free arts education, students can focus on collaboration rather than starvation. At the shoot, Brooks and her old friend Batiste talked about working together when they studied drama and music here. “We were thinking about MLK Day and the performances we used to put on,” she says. “We were all just creating together.” For this portrait, the veterans were joined byKayla Mak, a current Juilliard student and dancer with American Ballet Theatre’s Studio Company, andTony Siqi Yun, an award-winning classical pianist and recent Juilliard grad. Batiste, who’s stationed next to a grand piano, couldn’t help but improvise with whatever song came next on the playlist. Soon enough, Brooks was riffing along with Batiste in perfect harmony and Baranski was cooing melodious oohs and ahhs. By the end of the shoot, Batiste and Yun had spontaneously begun playing the four-hand arrangement of Beethoven’s virtuosic “Appassionata” sonata. “We had an impromptu jam on that,” Batiste says later. He’s already charting Yun’s path forward: “He is going to pick up the baton,” Batiste says. “He doesn’t just want to star in the world—he also wants to build it.” HAIR PRODUCTS, COLOR WOW (LINNEY), DAVINES (MAK), DR LOCS (BATISTE), HANZ DE FUKO (YUN), LIVING PROOF (WOETZEL), L’ORÉAL PARIS (CHASTAIN); MAKEUP PRODUCTS, CHARLOTTE TILBURY (CHASTAIN), ESTÉE LAUDER (BROOKS), MERIT (LINNEY), RARE BEAUTY (MAK); GROOMING PRODUCTS, FACES BY MADGE SKIN (BATISTE), GLOW RECIPE (WOETZEL, YUN); HAIR, SHIN ARIMA (MAK, WOETZEL, YUN), ANNEMARIE BRADLEY-SHERRON (LINNEY), JENNA ROBINSON (BATISTE), ANGELIQUE SCAFARO (BARANSKI), RYAN TRYGSTAD (CHASTAIN); MAKEUP, GEORGINA BILLINGTON (MAK), KRISTOFER BUCKLE (CHASTAIN), DENEAL KELLY (BROOKS), SUSAN REILLY LEHANE (LINNEY), LUBA TODOROVA (BARANSKI); GROOMING, GEORGINA BILLINGTON (WOETZEL, YUN); MADGE EARLE (BATISTE); SET DESIGN, ANTHONY ASARO.

    "title": "The Inside Story of L’Affaire Kim Kardashian as the Paris Jewelry Heist Finally Heads to Trial",
    "article_text": "Kim Kardashian had only one desire: to flee as quickly as she could. “I want to leave and be reunited with my children in the United States,” she said. “A private plane is waiting for me at Le Bourget.” It wasn’t that simple. Investigators from the Paris police’s organized crime department still had a few questions to ask her. It was 4:30 a.m. on October 3, 2016, and they were at her hotel to take her statement. The 35-year-old American star appeared distraught—“in shock, very pale, and she wasn’t wearing any makeup,” they noted. An hour and a half earlier, two men, one of them armed, burst into her suite at the Hôtel de Pourtalès, a stone’s throw from the Madeleine church in the heart of the city. At first she believed she was dealing with “terrorists,” as she put it. “I thought they were going to shoot me. When I realized that the gun was real, I decided to do whatever they asked.” Kardashian told investigators the men demanded her jewelry, then bound her and duct-taped her mouth before carrying her into the bathroom. Her nightmare lasted about 10 minutes at most. “I had an indescribable feeling, like my heart was coming out of my chest,” she said. “I knew I was going to die.” She also explained to the police that she wasn’t able to see much of her assailants, who were masked. One must have been close to five foot eleven, and the other was between five seven and five nine. The investigators seized a number of items that the thieves might have touched for DNA testing. They took samples from Kardashian’s wrists, ankles, and hair. At 7:40 a.m., she was allowed to depart on her private jet. Soon, the global media would arrive at the hotel. This week, almost a decade later, 10 defendants in the case are due to appear before the Paris Assize Court for a trial that is scheduled to stretch from April 28 to May 23. Three of the defendants suspected of having broken into the Hôtel de Pourtalès to rob Kardashian are now between 68 and 71 years old. One wears a hearing aid; another has difficulty walking. They will be tried for their alleged part in one of the most spectacular robberies of recent decades, with an estimated haul valued between $6 million and $10 million. The trial will present two spectacularly different worlds. On one side, there’s the global star, one of the most famous and photographed women in the world, whose social media–abetted rise to fame represented an entirely new brand of celebrity; on the other, a gang of mostly repeat offenders, many past their prime. There’s a California woman with an almost inconceivable fortune on one hand and a motley crew of criminals largely from the poor suburbs of Paris on the other. Most of the accused—who are still presumed innocent—continue to deny any wrongdoing. Two of them have provided limited confessions, taking care not to implicate others, and explain that some statements they provided were the result, in part, of being overwhelmed by events. The accused burglars have also been approached by American documentary producers and major Parisian publishers eager to share their stories. One agreed. He made the rounds of TV studios, facing the wrath of his supposed accomplices. According to his account, he didn’t know who Kardashian was before targeting her. Patricia Tourancheau, who met most of the accused while writingKim et Les Papys Braqueurs (Kim and the Grandpa Robbers), points out: “What struck me was their casualness. They’re very experienced, but at the same time, there was something amateur about the operation. They certainly had good intelligence, but they also operated by instinct.” “I told myself they were going to shoot me. I knew I was going to die.” Kardashian has rarely spoken publicly about her ordeal. By all appearances, the episode remains a source of trauma for her, but one she is now prepared to revisit. Michael Rhodes, Kardashian’s personal attorney, confirmed she planned to testify in person at the trial two weeks before its start. “At this time, Ms. Kardashian is preserving her testimony for the Court and jury and does not wish to elaborate further on it at this stage,” Rhodes wrote in a statement. “She has tremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system and has been treated with great respect by the French authorities.” “It could be an incredible moment in court,” one Parisian defense lawyer tells me, excited at the prospect. Above all, the trial will offer a look at a sprawling investigation. For months, Paris police agents deployed considerable resources to identify the heist’s perpetrators. Their reputation around the world was at stake. This is how the robbery unfolded, according to them. The story starts with Aomar Ait Khedache. He arrived in France from Algeria at the age of seven and grew up in Cormeilles-en-Parisis, northwest of Paris, in a public housing development surrounded by open fields. He dabbled in petty theft from an early age, logging his first arrest at 14. He was sent to the juvenile section of the Évreux prison. Convictions for increasingly more serious crimes followed. Robberies, muggings, and other acts of violence led to more frequent prison stays. Around 2010, the authorities lost track of Ait Khedache when he disappeared to avoid a five-year sentence for drug possession and trafficking. Eventually, he resurfaced and could often be found in the capital’s bistros, boasting of his exploits, even if his age and physical condition had curtailed his criminal activity. The former marathon runner is now half deaf and wears thick glasses. Around spring 2016, a group of men are smoking Gitanes and sipping Ricard in a bar in the Marais district. It’s then Ait Khedache hears about the wife of a famous rapper who regularly visits Paris during fashion weeks. She always has her jewelry with her, a fortune in diamonds that she displays on social media. The person who gives him this tip assures him that he has a solid source in Kardashian’s entourage during her visits to Paris. Every time she comes to the city, she stays in a luxurious apartment-hotel that doesn’t have the same level of security as some other hotels. On paper, it sounds like a very simple operation to Ait Khedache, whom prosecutors have alleged was the plot’s ringleader—a charge he has always denied. At this moment, Ait Khedache doesn’t know who Kardashian is. But he appreciates his future target’s array of jewels, including a ring set with an 18.8-carat diamond, given to her earlier that year by her husband, Kanye West. Its value is estimated at 4 million euros. According to the prosecution, Ait Khedache sets to work assembling a team for the heist. All are trusted friends, mostly around his age, whom he met over the years in various Paris bistros. He also carries out the initial scouting to verify the low level of security at the hotel. He pushes open the gate, no key or code necessary, to enter a paved courtyard filled with statues. There’s a museum open to the public, and at the far end is the Hôtel de Pourtalès. The only challenge: You can’t reach the building by car. The robbers will have to get away on bikes. In June 2016, Kardashian and West traveled to Paris. The burgeoning heist team considers pulling off their robbery then but decides against it. They’re not ready yet, and Kardashian is too often surrounded by photographers. It’s better to be patient, they decide, and continue to build out their ranks. According to investigators, Didier Dubreucq has joined them. Known as “Didier-les-Yeux-Bleus” (“Didier Blue Eyes”), he’s an underemployed plumber and enthusiast of Côtes-du-Rhône wines with a dozen criminal convictions. He spent 23 years of his life in prison for theft, drug charges, and robberies, and now his head rings with tinnitus after living with the constant noise of detention centers. An old friend of Ait Khedache’s, Yunice Abbas, will also join the operation. Abbas has spent almost two decades in prison since his first conviction in 1972. When his friend tells him about a job stealing the jewelry of the wife of a famous rapper, he hesitates. He doesn’t want to end up back behind bars. Besides, now that he has a heart condition, he can’t see himself committing a robbery that requires escaping by bike. But he also owes his friend 3,500 euros, and the fear of missing out on what could be one of the biggest heists of the decade finally convinces him. The opportunity presents itself that fall, during one of Paris’s Fashion Weeks. Kardashian lands at 10:40 a.m. on September 28, 2016, in a private jet at Le Bourget airport. She is accompanied by her sister Kourtney, her mother, an assistant, a stylist, and a bodyguard. A phalanx of photographers follows her, though they disperse each time she returns to her Parisian residence: the Hôtel de Pourtalès. The luxurious mansion in the 8th arrondissement caters exclusively to the rich and famous, and ideally guests who fit both of those descriptions. Madonna, Beyoncé, and Jay-Z have all slept there. Prince bought out the entire hotel for a party in 2010. Soccer star Zlatan Ibrahimović lived there for a year. Kardashian and West were regulars. They honeymooned there after they were married in 2014. There are 11 tastefully decorated apartments, with prices ranging from 1,000 to 15,000 euros per night. Kardashian settles into one of the most luxurious suites, the Garden Duplex. It measures more than 3,950 square feet. She’s in and out between stops around the city—a fitting at Balmain with Olivier Rousteing, lunch at a restaurant off of Avenue Montaigne, and many fashion shows. On Sunday, October 2, she sits front row at Riccardo Tisci’s show for Givenchy at the Jardin des Plantes. Later, she heads back to the suite with her sister to change, then on to the Azzedine Alaïa showroom for a private dinner. Bianca Jagger and architect Peter Marino are among the guests who dine on scrambled eggs with truffles and Saint-Honoré cakes, washed down with Louis XIII cognac from Maison Rémy Martin. Then it’s back to the hotel around midnight, in a black Mercedes van. Kim decides not to join Kourtney, who is going clubbing at L’Arc, just off the Champs-Élysées; their shared bodyguard goes with her. Instead, Kim returns to her room with her stylist, puts on a bathrobe, lies down on her bed, and starts typing on her laptop. “Do you know who’s calling? It’s her bodyguard. If she doesn’t answer, he’ll arrive.” Abderrahmane Ouatiki, a 39-year-old student from northern Algeria, is working as the night concierge one floor down; he is mostly paid not to fall asleep and is fighting boredom by studying for a doctorate in semiology and discourse analysis at the Sorbonne. At 2:22 a.m., he is talking to a friend on Skype when someone knocks on the hotel door. In fact, there are five people at the entrance, dressed as police officers. Ouatiki isn’t concerned. Complaints of occasional disturbances are common, though oddly these officers are hooded. As soon as he opens the door, though, he is confronted by an automatic pistol, handcuffed, and forced to his knees. “We’re here for the money,” shouts one of the assailants. “Who’s in the hotel?” another demands. The concierge offers a vague reply: “Fashion people, it’s Fashion Week.” During a brief moment of hesitation, he wonders who the criminals are really after. “The rapper’s wife, where is she?” one assailant asks. Ouatiki leads two of the robbers to Kardashian’s room at gunpoint. Kardashian thinks she hears her sister coming home from the club and utters an unanswered hello. Then she sees two men in police uniforms arrive, carrying the handcuffed concierge. Kardashian at first thinks she’s dealing with terrorists, panics, and dials 911, the emergency number in the United States. She doesn’t reach help (the equivalent of 911 in France is 17). She then tries to call her bodyguard, but the robbers grab the star’s iPhone 6 and Blackberry. Then, again, they appear to hesitate. What are their intentions? For five long minutes—“the most terrible” minutes, the reality TV star later explains to police—the room is plunged into an unbearable suspense. Then, finally, the hooded men call out “la ring, la ring.” With their thick accents, the American doesn’t understand them. “What? What?” she asks. The thieves mime the gesture of a groom slipping a wedding ring onto the finger of his bride. She still doesn’t get it. “I think they want your ring,” the concierge suggests, Kardashian will later recall. He is still a hostage but also now a negotiator and interpreter. Kardashian points to the solitaire on her bedside table. But the thieves want more: “Money! Money! Money!” one of them shouts. Kardashian doesn’t have much cash on her. A thousand dollars in her wallet at most. She is distraught and cries, asking loudly: “Are we going to die? Tell them not to kill me, I have children.” One of the assailants then takes it upon himself to tie up the star. Meanwhile, his accomplice grabs as much jewelry as he can. Just as they’re about to move on to another room, Kardashian’s phone starts ringing. The concierge later explains to the police officer that he had warned the thieves: “Do you know who’s calling?” he asked them. “It’s her bodyguard. If she doesn’t answer, he’ll arrive.” Quickly, the victim is left in the bathroom, and eventually the thieves disappear on their bikes. Although the robbery is cut short, the haul exceeds the thieves’ expectations. Between the 18.8-carat ring, a yellow gold Rolex Cosmograph Daytona, seven Cartier and Hermès bracelets, and three gold-and-diamond grills, it’s worth as much as $10 million, according to some reports. It could have been even higher. As he fled, one of the thieves fell off his bike, spilling jewelry onto the sidewalk. That same morning, a local woman on her way to work came across a sumptuous pendant on the ground, wearing it all day long, to the amazement of her colleagues. In the evening, she returned home, only to hear about the burglary. After some internet sleuthing, she learned the value of the 3.5-carat jewel she found: $33,180. The next day she turned it in to the local police station. Given the victim’s state of shock, the investigators quickly rule out insurance fraud. They are, however, suspicious of the night concierge. Could he have been part of an inside job, leading the thieves to the loot? Why would he open the door to hooded individuals? The cameras installed in the hotel were not operating that evening, so it was impossible to confirm parts of his account. Ouatiki, after being questioned at length and having spent 36 hours without sleep, finally goes free. But his phone is tapped. The investigators are immediately under pressure. The case is a sensitive one, and the image of Paris, already badly damaged by the wave of terrorist attacks the previous year, is at stake. They begin by retrieving images from surveillance cameras near the hotel that show some of the alleged thieves leaving by bicycle. Four days after the robbery, there’s a break. Despite the gloves worn by the thieves, DNA is found on the rolls of tape used to tie up Kardashian and also on the cable used to restrain the concierge. This DNA is eventually traced back to a man called Pascal. At the same time, investigators find several burner phones. They discover that Pascal is in fact an alias used by Ait Khedache, whom they begin to track. Within a few weeks, police realize that the owner of a bar Ait Khedache frequented was close to the brother of the driver that Kardashian regularly hired when she visited Paris. The widening ring of suspects, unaware their phones are now tapped, talk about the heist among themselves. They express annoyance at not getting the money they expected from the robbery, but their loot is hard to unload. The police have a front-row seat on the gang’s activities. According to later reports, Ait Khedache puts pressure on a certain Nez Râpé, who is suspected of being the fence for the goods and is entrusted with selling the jewels in Antwerp. But selling a ring like Kardashian’s is not easy. Generally, thieves recover only a very small fraction of a piece’s market value—10 to 15 percent, once all the intermediaries have been paid. In the Kardashian case, the suspected fence managed to sell only a few stolen pieces. Authorities make their first arrests in the case on January 9, 2017, three months after the robbery, taking 17 people into custody early in the morning. They are almost all repeat offenders: a Marais bistro owner, the limo driver, the fence. Of the 10 defendants who will eventually face charges, most are over 60 years old, and at first all of them deny any involvement with the crime. But two come under particular pressure from the police. First, there’s Ait Khedache. At his home, the police find 16,900 euros in his refrigerator. He claims to be “able to explain” but then struggles to do so when the investigators tell him that his DNA was found in Kardashian’s bedroom. Although he denies robbing her, he finally breaks down and confesses to having played a small role in the affair. The second is Abbas, Ait Khedache’s old friend, who is quicker to confess. The investigators find almost 60,000 euros in small bills at his son’s house, and his DNA was also at the hotel. Abbas says his role was merely to stay on the first floor of the Hôtel de Pourtalès and keep watch. What about the others? So far, they’ve all denied the evidence against them. Take Dubreucq, “Didier Blue Eyes,” for example. He is suspected of being the second hooded man to have entered the suite. But he insists that he is the victim of a combination of circumstances, having merely been an acquaintance of Ait Khedache, whom he used to call Pascal. Even so, an individual on CCTV images bears a resemblance to him. And the police also say he had one of the burner phones in his possession. “I only have peace phones,” he jokes in a book interview, playing off the French phrase for a burner phone, portable de guerre or “war mobile.” Dubreucq presents himself as an innocent father. Dubreucq spent nearly 11 months in pretrial detention, only to be released to receive chemotherapy for lung cancer. Abbas, after quadruple-bypass surgery and getting a new heart valve, spent 22 months in pretrial detention. Ait Khedache was the last to be released, in April 2020, due to the COVID pandemic. He returned to prison only a year later, after a police check unearthed the outstanding five-year sentence for drug trafficking. He is set to be released from that term at the end of this month, though the result of the Kardashian trial will now decide his freedom. Abbas, Dubreucq, and Ait Khedache are all charged with a criminally organized robbery at gunpoint and sequestration and face up to 30 years in prison. “I want to tell you how much I regret what I did, how moved I was when I saw you in tears…” “My client will assume responsibility for his part in the crime,” says Gabriel Dumenil, Abbas’s lawyer. According to Dumenil, Abbas can’t wait for the process to be over, though his client didn’t make it easy for himself. Abbas cowrote a 2021 book about the affair,J’ai séquestré Kim Kardashian(I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian). It was like shooting himself in the foot, confessing to more than he was accused of, and perhaps even more than he actually did. Was it driven by a sudden desire for fame or money? Or both? Perhaps Abbas felt he’d be seen as a hero, as some sort of Robin Hood. In a newspaper interview, he explained how he enjoyed favorable treatment in prison from other inmates. “Some of them would pat me on the back and congratulate me: ‘You did a good job, well done.’ I’d say, ‘Yeah, well, I ended up here with you, so I don’t see what the big deal is.’” Strangers began to recognize him on the street and asked for selfies. And then Abbas became disillusioned with it all. At the request of the hotel concierge’s lawyers, the copyright to his book was seized by the courts. In June 2017, Ait Khedache writes something of his own, a letter to Kardashian: “After witnessing your emotions and realizing the psychological damage I have inflicted on you, I decided to write, not in the hope you will forgive me but as a human who wishes to tell you how much I regret what I did, and how moved I was when I saw you in tears.” It remains to be seen whether he will have the opportunity to repeat his apology to Kardashian in person. “Specific arrangements related to his health are essential for him to be able to appear in court in conditions that are dignified and respectful of the rights of the defense,” says Chloé Arnoux, Ait Khedache’s lawyer, as her client’s difficulty hearing has continued to worsen. Yunice Abbas, one of the alleged perpetrators of the crime, co-authored a book,I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian. The trial will also present the chance to hear from the night’s other primaries. Kardashian’s bodyguard, who was dismissed after the robbery, is expected to testify. So is the chauffeur. He was also ousted from the Kardashian entourage. And then there is Ouatiki, the night concierge, who was once a suspect but has since been cleared. He had to return to Algeria without completing his studies. Now without a visa, he can no longer set foot in France, although he may receive a short-term visa at the time of the trial. Four months after the robbery, a French judge traveled to the US to question Kardashian. She said she had been transformed by the trauma and had become less materialistic after the robbery. “My perception of jewelry is that I don’t care about it like I used to, I don’t have the same feelings about it. In fact, I feel like it’s become a burden to be responsible for such expensive items. No object of sentimental value can compare with coming home to your children, your family.” Last November, she still flaunted a sumptuous Attallah cross, covered in amethysts and diamonds, that once belonged to Princess Diana. She had purchased it for just under $200,000. Perhaps it is some small form of consolation: To date, according to court documents, most of the jewels stolen in 2016 have not been recovered.

    "title": "Exclusive: Sam Altman Is Said to Have Pondered a Presidential Run",
    "article_text": "In 2016,Sam Altmanwas increasingly looking to politics as the arena where he could realize his soaring ambitions. That fall, his high school ex,Nathan Watters,visited San Francisco, accompanying his new boyfriend to a job interview. While Watters’s boyfriend was out, Watters and Altman had lunch at a cafe near Dolores Park, not far from Altman’s $5 million Victorian. The topic turned to the upcoming general presidential election betweenHillary ClintonandDonald Trump. Watters said Altman told him that if Clinton didn’t win, he was going to run for president: “‘If she doesn’t get it, and Trump does, I can’t have that again. I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna run. I think I can win,’” Watters recalled him saying. “I’m sure he did think he could win.” Altman disputes that he said this, and says he never wanted to run for president. In early October,The New Yorkerpublishedan 11,000-word profileof Altman which revealed the full scope of his ambition to a general audience for the first time. “Like everyone in Silicon Valley, Altman professes to want to save the world; unlike almost everyone there, he has a plan to do it,” wroteTad Friend. The article treated his presidential ambitions as a joke—the kind of thing his brothers, Max and Jack, would tease him about while the three of them made pasta. After they pointed out that in 2020 Sam would be thirty-five, just old enough to legally qualify, Altman shot back: “Let’s send the Jewish gay guy! That’ll work!” ‘The Optimist’ by Keach Hagey W. W. Norton & Company Inside Y Combinator, the prestigious startup accelerator that Altman had been running for two years, the partners were stunned by theNew Yorkerprofile. “Sam told all the partners, ‘Hey, this is going to be about YC,’ and it ends up being about Sam. And everyone was like, ‘Look we don’t give a fuck, but like, why did you tell us this?’” one YC partner said. They didn’t have long for such carping, however. Days after it was published, YC faced an uproar overPeter Thiel’s $1.25 million contribution to Trump’s presidential campaign. Thiel was a part-time YC partner, a largely honorific role, and his support for Trump was hardly a secret; he’d appeared at the Republican National Convention over the summer, delivering a speech where he’d declared that he was “proud to be gay.” Nevertheless, the extent of the support—especially in light of the leak on October 7, 2016, of anAccess Hollywoodtape of Trump bragging about grabbing women by the genitals—was more than the largely liberal Silicon Valley could bear. Ten days later,Ellen Pao, the former Reddit CEO who had gone on to co-found a nonprofit focused on diversity, said that her organization was cutting ties with YC over its association with Thiel. “Because of his continued connection to YC, we are compelled to break off our relationship with YC,” she wrote. “Today it is clear to us that our values are not aligned.” Tumblr co-founderMarco Armentwas more pointed regarding the connections between YC, Thiel, and Trump. “This is literally paying a huge amount of money to directly support a racist, sexist bigot with rapidly mounting allegations of multiple sexual assaults,” he wrote. Privately, Altman was also mystified why Thiel would support someone like Trump. They had several conversations about it. “I was not trying to tell people not to vote for Trump,” Altman said. “I was really trying to understand it.” But when the internet began melting down over Thiel’s support, Altman stepped in with a forceful defense of both his friend and the principle of intellectual freedom. He disagreed with Thiel on this matter—in fact, he found Trump to be “an unacceptable threat to America” and “unfit to be president”—but tweeted, “YC is not going to fire someone for supporting a major party nominee.” When Trump won, Altman was devastated. He had tried to prevent it in the only way he knew how—by funding and building a piece of software, in this case a “Turbo Tax of voter registration” called VotePlz. Now he turned once again to code, building a website called Track Trump to measure how President Trump’s actions during his first one hundred days would measure up against his campaign promises. And he used Facebook to solicit introductions to one hundred Trump voters across the country so that he could ask them directly about their decision; he published his findings on his blog. One quote, in Altman’s view, got to the heart of the matter of what too many Democrats had failed to recognize: “You all can defeat Trump next time, but not if you keep mocking us, refusing to listen to us, and cutting us out.” Trump’s upset victory had instantly turned Thiel into the most powerful political force in Silicon Valley, after he had stood largely alone before a chorus of haters for his contrarian long shot, and prevailed. (Netflix CEOReed Hastings,a member of Facebook’s board, had gone so far as to try to push fellow member Thiel off it, arguing his support for Trump showed “catastrophically bad judgement.”) Altman, for his part, had a decision to make: Should he really pursue the presidential run he had told Watters about? Or should he run for something else? Should he run for office at all, or should he try to recruit others to do it in his stead? Altman still wanted to understand Trump’s victory. A contact put him in touch withCharles Johnson, an alt-right blogger and political operative who had worked with Thiel to plot the destruction of the snarky blog empire Gawker Media. Johnson had come up through conservative campus politics and taken a tour atTucker Carlson’sDaily Callerbefore starting his own outlet,GotNews. In 2014, afterRolling Stoneran a story about an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia that it later retracted, Johnson published the full name of the alleged victim—in violation of journalistic norms—and a photo of the wrong woman, for which he later apologized. That drew the mocking attention ofGawker, which called Johnson “the Web’s Worst Journalist” and made up a series of wild claims—“there is no evidence that Chuck Johnson was arrested in 2002 for pinning a sheep to a fence and fucking it”—meant as joking commentary on whatGawkerimplied was Johnson’s fast-and-loose, innuendo-laden brand of journalism. Johnson sued Gawker Media for defamation, which got the attention of a friend of Thiel’s who knew that the billionaire was in the midst of a nearly decade-long secretplot to take down the companyafter its tech-focused blogValleywagouted him in 2007. According toMax Chafkin’s book about Thiel,The Contrarian, Johnson joined Thiel’s crusade, which ultimately settled on secretly funding a lawsuit filed byHulk Hoganfor invasion of privacy after Gawker posted a surreptitiously taped video of him having sex with his friend’s wife. Gawker Media lost the case and filed for bankruptcy in 2016. (To this day, few things delight Thiel more than recalling his dismantling of what he still calls “the Manhattan-based terrorist organization.”) Altman flew down to meet Johnson at his home in Arcadia, California. “He told me he thought he could be governor of California, and president of the United States,” Johnson recalls. “He said, ‘There’s going to be a millennial president.’” Altman believed thatGavin Newsom, the favorite to succeed then California GovernorJerry Brownin the 2018 election, was a weaker candidate than most people understood, Johnson said. Altman also had a vivid, techno-utopian vision for what California could be: a state with an economy so large that it could fund its own basic scientific research into nuclear energy and AGI, where the tax code could be tweaked to discourage real estate speculation in order to bring down the cost of housing, and an expanded social safety net—perhaps through UBI—that would make society fairer while eliminating the bureaucracy of many of the current social welfare programs. Johnson introduced Altman to his political contacts in California. Altman sought advice on both sides of the aisle, includingDominic Cummings, the former advisor to British prime ministerBoris Johnson, andChris Lehane, the former advisor to PresidentBill Clinton. In April 2017,Vice News TonightcorrespondentNellie Bowlesasked Altman during an onstage interview whether he would consider running for office. “I don’t think charisma is my strength,” he replied. But Altman privately continued to explore whether he might run to become California’s governor, visitingWillie Brown, the former mayor of San Francisco, in May to seek his advice. At the meeting, Altman pitched Brown on his plans to use technology to help end income inequality, and to reach voters digitally. Brown immediately sold Altman out, writing about the meeting ina columnin theSan Francisco Chronicle. “I told him California has a history of millionaires running for public office on their own dime,” Brown wrote. “Most wind up paying consultants a whole lot of money and losing.” Many of the businesspeople in Altman’s life—including Thiel and Sequoia’sMichael Moritz—counseled him against running for office. “I thought he was crazy to do it,” Moritz said. “I think it’s this innocence of a lot of businesspeople when they look at government and think it’s all messed up. And because of their experience in the private sector, they know what it takes to make government run more efficiently than it does, and they massively underestimate that to flourish in politics, you need to have grounding in the political arena. You need to understand how it works.” Altman now characterizes his thoughts of running for governor as a passing flight of fancy. “I thought about it for a few weeks. I toyed with the idea at a not-very-high level of seriousness. I went to Sacramento to spend some time with then Governor Brown, and it was super clear to me that I didn’t want that job and wouldn’t have been good at it.” (Jerry Brown’s longtime chief of staff,Evan Westrup, said Brown had no memory of meeting with Altman.) By July, Altman was ready to pass the torch to others, posting a detailed political platform online that included Medicare for All, raising taxes on short-term capital gains, and shifting 10 percent of the US defense budget to researching future technologies. He said he would help back candidates willing to adopt the platform. The most important plank, at least to Altman, was one devoted to measures to reduce the cost of housing. As the online news outletThe Outlineput itin a headline: “A Silicon Valley kingmaker wants to fix what tech did to California.” The platform, dubbed The United Slate, was created with the help ofMatt Krisiloff, twenty-five, who Altman would begin dating later that year. Graduating from the University of Chicago in 2014, Krisiloff then moved to Santiago, Chile, to work on a startup, and had gotten to know Altman after emailing him for advice. When Krisiloff pitched Altman on launching a program at YC for earlier-stage companies, Altman hired him there, and eventually tapped him to lead YC Research. Krisiloff then recruited his older brother,Scott, who was working in finance, and the three of them became The United Slate. (Both Krisiloffs would remain in Altman’s orbit in various capacities for many years, with Scott going on to work for Hydrazine, Altman’s venture fund, and then Helion, the nuclear fusion startup he backed, and Matt founding a startup that Altman invested in seeking to make it possible for two gay men to have a child genetically related to both of them.) Altman’s United Slate platform ended up backing the congressional candidacy ofJosh Harder, a Democrat and venture capitalist with degrees from Stanford and Harvard, who went on to beat an incumbent Republican for a House seat representing much of the Bay Area. Even as Altman decided against entering politics personally, his association with OpenAI was bringing him into the highest circles of political power. In its final year, the Obama administration took an interest in AI, convening a series of talks around the country that one of OpenAI’s newest hires, a former Bloomberg journalist namedJack Clark,participated in as part of the lab’s communications operation. In October 2016, the White House released a large report calling for more federal funding of basic AI research, which PresidentBarack Obamathen promoted in an interview withWiredthat made it sound as though he had been reading Altman’s blog (or Musk’s tweets). “Part of the problem that we’ve seen is that our confidence in collective action has been chipped away, partly because of ideology and rhetoric,” Obama toldWired. He called for a return to the days of the Apollo space program, which was backed by government funding equivalent to half a percent of US GDP. In 2015, the US government spent roughly $1 billion on AI research. To get to Apollo-level, that would have to rise to around $80 billion in 2016 dollars. He saw it as the government’s job to make sure that AI was developed outside tech behemoths like Google and Facebook. “If we want the values of a diverse community represented in these breakthrough technologies, then government funding has to be part of it.” Within weeks of Obama uttering these words, Trump won the election and the Democrats’ AI agenda was swept aside. Years later, after ChatGPT had made OpenAI a household name, Altman would say that the young lab had gone to the government in its early years—presumably sometime in 2017 or 2018, he declined to specify—looking for funding, and had gotten nowhere. “I don’t blame them at all,” he said, “because at the time we were a few people sitting around saying ‘We’re going to try to figure out AGI someday’ with basically nothing to show.” Excerpted fromThe Optimist: Sam Altman, OpenAI, and the Race to Invent the Future.Copyright (c) 2025 by Keach Hagey.

    "title": "‘The Last of Us’ Explained: Who Are the Seraphites, a.k.a. the Scars?",
    "article_text": "This may sound outrageous, given the horror oflast week’s episode, butThe Last of Ushas actually been quite kind to viewers in its adaptation of the video game. The show explained Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) and her motivation for murdering Joel (Pedro Pascal) up front. The Last of Us Part II waits much longer to reveal why Abby killed Joel, preferring instead to linger on Ellie’s (played on the show byBella Ramsey) rage and confusion over Joel’s death. That’s kind of the whole deal ofThe Last of Us: It’s a franchise about flawed people with imperfect information who are driven by emotion to do terrible things. The audience can expect to eventually get a more complete picture of why they’ve done those things, even if the characters themselves do not. The tension of the story—and the adaptive choices that showrunnersCraig MazinandNeil Druckmannare making—lie inwhenthat information comes. All this is to say: The mysterious new group of bow-wielding hunters we meet this week? They’re called the Seraphites, andThe Last of Uswill explore them in time. However, it might be alongtime before the show explains exactly who they are and what they want. So if you’re looking for a little clarity and limited spoilers, read on. As the man at the head of the pack of Seraphites explains to the young girl he’s teaching—it’s unclear if she’s his daughter—the Seraphites are a religious cult who believe in a prophet. We’re not told much more about this prophet, other than the fact that she’s been dead for years. Still, her teachings hold strong. According to the game, the Seraphite prophet viewed the cordyceps infection as divine judgment. It inspired her to begin a practice of nomadic asceticism, eschewing modern technology and living off the land. Later in the episode, the Seraphites we met are seemingly killed by Abby’s people—known as the WLF, or the Wolves—which gets at some of the thematic groundwork being laid here. Those two Seraphites might have been in a religious cult, but they seemed all right, and they didn’t deserve to die for it. Right? Here is where things get thorny. Unlike The Last of Us, a straightforward character drama, its sequel was seemingly more interested in commentary about the real world. According to Druckmann, who is Israeli American, The Last of Us Part II was meant to exploretribalism.He’s given(spoiler-heavy) interviewsabout how the game’s themes and specific moments were informed by the conflict he witnessed in the West Bank as a child, and his own complicated feelings about Israel and Palestine. As such, the fight between the Wolves and the Scars (which is what the Wolves call the Seraphites) could be likened to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. At leastsort of.In the years since the game was released, Druckmann has tried to clarify his intent: “Those feelings, and not my wrestling with those feelings, were the inspiration for the inciting incident. But I have to make this clear because, again, it’s not based on, and it’s not an allegory of, and you can’t point to any group and say, ‘Oh, that’s this group and that’s this group,’” Druckmann saidin a 2023 interview withHaaretz. Druckmann and The Last of Us Part II cowriterHalley Grosshave said that they were more expressly concerned with using the game to more generally explore“the cycle of violence.”The association between the WLF-Seraphite conflict and the Israel-Palestine conflict, however, still lingers—and not without reason, as the game’s depiction of its warring factions seemed tomap quite wellonto the state of affairs in the West Bank at the time it was released. Because HBO’sThe Last of Usis adapting The Last of Us Part II acrossmore than one season,it’s impossible to know how or if it will adjust this aspect of the game’s story as it continues. The game is built around a big, daring pivot, where players abruptly switch to Abby’s perspective for its second half, getting to know the WLF. Abby also gets a different perspective on the Seraphites than Ellie, all in the interest ofhumanizing every sideof the game’s conflict. Whether or not the game successfully pulls this off is an extremely subjective question, and it will be fascinating to watch it play out in a new medium. Mazin, Druckmann, and Gross all have their work cut out for them. In the brief glimpse we get of them to start, the Seraphites on the show appear extremely faithful to the way they’re presented in the game, with their handmade ponchos and facial scarring. The important thing to take away is that they have been in a long war of attrition with the Washington Liberation Front—the WLF—for control of what was Seattle. Which means that Ellie is on a collision course with both factions, now that she’s left on a mission to find and kill Abby. Ellie’s storyline this episode is largely original to the show, as she takes time to absorb and process the horror of “Through the Valley.” We pick up three months after the events of that devastating hour. In one of last week’s more interesting departures from the game, Jackson suffered a devastating attack at the same time that Joel was murdered—which means that this week,The Last of Uscan make it clear that Ellie isn’tthe onlyperson in this universe to suffer major loss. That point may seem unsubtle, but it’s an important thing to stress ifThe Last of Uswants to continue to stand apart fromThe Walking Dead—its closest pop-cultural comparison, and an example of the sort of nihilism postapocalyptic stories can devolve into. With all that in mind, it becomes easier to appreciate all the time this week’s episode takes to show Jackson’s efforts to rebuild and recover—and how the community is responding to its angriest member. When Ellie appears before the Jackson town council and proposes that they form a posse to find justice for Joel, they turn her down. No one, of course, believes Ellie will settle for that answer—not Tommy (Gabriel Luna) or Gail (Catherine O'Hara), who have a conversation about whether Ellie has been influenced by Joel’s rage at the world or is simply a kindred spirit to him. And definitely not Dina (Isabela Merced), who, rather than watching Ellie ride off half-cocked, has spent the last three months doing all the research she knows her friend won’t—learning about the WLF, planning a route to find them, pluckily insisting on accompanying her. It’s really worth pausing for a moment and celebrating just how great Merced is in the role of Dina. Not just because she brings a healthy amount of spunk to an otherwise pretty dour show, but for the way she lingers even between chipper moments. Dina is making a difficult decision for the sake of love, and hoping that her support will get through to Ellie at a time when nothing else will. And if that doesn’t work soon, they both might be in dire trouble. After a solemn stop at Joel’s grave, where Ellie leaves a few coffee beans in tribute—the 2013 video game took a moment to stress that coffee is basically gone post-pandemic, and Joelreallymissed it—the two make it to Seattle in no time at all. And unbeknownst to them, they are gravely mistaken about the WLF. It’s not limited to Abby’s small group. It’s a whole damn army.

    "title": "Hong Kong bars urge regulation rather than ban on flavoured shisha products",
    "article_text": "Industry representatives say customers only enjoy shisha because of flavours and already struggling bars will suffer if blanket ban goes ahead Hong Kong bar operators have urged authorities to regulate rather than ban flavoured shisha products, saying customers are unlikely to consume the traditional version that will still be allowed under government proposals. Industry representatives issued the call on Monday after the government gazetted an amended bill last week proposing tighter controls on smoking. The bill will be submitted to the Legislative Council for a first reading on Wednesday. “A blanket ban is not a solution,” said Ben Leung Lap-yan, charter president of the Licensed Bar and Club Association of Hong Kong. “We hope that the government can introduce some requirements on the provision of items such as shisha and that they can be offered in certain licensed venues … Service providers could also be subject to regulation of the authorities.” Under the amended bill, the sale of conventional smoking products with flavours other than menthol, including flavoured shisha, is expected to be banned from the second quarter of 2027. Offenders will be subject to a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a HK$50,000 (US$6,445) fine. Other proposals include a ban on possessing or vaping alternative smoking products in public. Smokers would also be barred from lighting up while queuing to enter certain places.",

    "article_text": "Discovery of new underlying mechanism opens up possibilities for developing medication, researchers at Chinese University of Hong Kong say A research team at the Chinese University of Hong Kong has announced the discovery of a new underlying mechanism and possible therapeutic target for Huntington’s disease, a rare, incurable illness that can cause twitching movements and cognitive decline. The team at the School of Life Sciences said on Monday it had found a 4.5-fold increase in the level of a protein called PAPD5 in the brains of patients with Huntington’s disease compared with healthy individuals, which contributed to neuronal apoptosis, or nerve cell death. They claimed their research showed that blocking the activity of PAPD5 could reduce these harmful effects, opening up new possibilities for developing medication. Their research paper was published in the international journal Nature Communications on April 9. “We provide a new angle to understand the underlying mechanism. This PAPD5-mediated pathway was first uncovered in our study. It has not been reported before,” said Stephen Chen Zhefan, an assistant professor at the School of Life Sciences and the lead author of the paper. “In addition to strengthening our understanding of the disease mechanisms, we also propose a new target for the future, a therapeutic development against Huntington’s disease.”",

It also urged Hongkongers to pay attention to changes in the weather. Sunny periods were also expected in the next couple of days and would bring hot weather and isolated showers, the Observatory said. It added that a relatively dry easterly airstream might affect the coast of southern China in the next couple of days.",

    "title": "Ukraine won’t win – Vance",
    "article_text": "Ukraine is not poised to win the conflict with Russia, US Vice President J.D. Vance has said. He added that it would be naive to expect the larger country’s collapse if fighting continues for several more years. Vance, a US Marine Corps veteran, has long contended that American support for the war in Ukraine diverts resources from domestic priorities and risks unnecessary conflict with Russia. “If this doesn’t stop, the Ukrainians aren’t winning the war,”Vance said during an interview with Charlie Kirk during the conservative activist’s podcast on Monday. “I think there’s this weird idea among the mainstream media that if this thing goes on for just another few years, the Russians will collapse, the Ukrainians will take their territory back, and everything will go back to the way that it was before the war. That is not the reality that we live in,”the vice president said. “You could have millions of more people killed if this thing goes on for another few years, and it could risk escalating into a nuclear war. It has to stop,”Vance added. American negotiators are“making progress,”despite the challenges of dealing with both sides, Vance claimed. “Sometimes you’re incredibly frustrated with Ukrainians. Sometimes you’re incredibly frustrated with the Russians,”Vance said.“And sometimes you just want to throw your hands up, but that’s what President Trump doesn’t let us do.” Vance’s remarks came as Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russian troops would observe a three-day ceasefire starting on May 8 to commemorate the Soviet Union’s victory over Germany in World War II. Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky responded by accusing Moscow of“manipulation”and called for an immediate 30-day ceasefire. According to Russia, Ukraine violated both the 30-day ‘energy truce’ brokered by the US last month and the 30-hour Easter truce, despite having promised to respect both arrangements. Putin has argued that in order for a comprehensive ceasefire to succeed, Ukraine must halt its mobilization campaign and the West must stop delivering weapons to Kiev.",

    "title": "Trump claims he runs the world",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has claimed he is now running not only his country but the whole world, and is“having a lot of fun”with his second presidential term. The president made the remarks in an interview with The Atlantic, marking his first 100 days in office. Trump shared his experience with the magazine, stating he has been faring far better than early in his first presidency. ”The first time, I had two things to do—run the country and survive; I had all these crooked guys,” he stated.“And the second time, I run the country and the world.” Inquired further on the accounts of individuals close to the US administration, who told the magazine the president appears to be elated most of the time and has a“twinkle in his eye,”Trump confirmed that was the case and he greatly enjoys doing various“serious stuff.” “I’m having a lot of fun, considering what I do,”he said.“You know, what I do is such serious stuff.” The president was also asked about his repeated suggestions he could potentially run for office for the third time - despite not having the legal option to do so. The earlier remarks on the matter sparked fears Trump could ultimately opt to rewire the whole US electoral system to try and stay in power, while multiple high-profile Republicans dismissed such suggestions as joking on the president’s part. The concerns have been reinforced by the emergence of ‘Trump 2028’ merch on his official store. Trump, however, insisted that he has had no actual plans to stay in office beyond his second term, admitting it was a rather complicated thing to do.“It’s not something that I’m looking to do. And I think it would be a very hard thing to do,”Trump stated.",

    "title": "What Trump Got Wrong—and Zelensky Got Right—at Pope Francis’s Funeral",
    "article_text": "When President Trump joined an elite group of international dignitaries, presidents, kings, and queens at the Vatican on Saturday for the funeral of Pope Francis, hedressed as he always does: billowy but carefully tailored suit (likely from Brioni),wide silk tie, black shoes. It’s the same uniform Trump has worn since the ’90s, and in any other context wouldn’t have drawn much attention. In this case, however, it turned out to be kind of a big deal. That’s because, unlike almost all of the other assembled guests—from the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, to Abdullah II, king of Jordan—the 47th president of the United States wasn’t wearing black. In a sea of dark worsted wool, Trump’s sapphire blue suit and matching tie made him stand out like a guy sitting courtside in full Celtics gear at a Lakers home game. For anyone wanting to draw geopolitical conclusions from the president’s wardrobe, the suit provided much fertile ground for interpretation. For anyone looking for advice on what to wear to a funeral (or, more accurately, whatnotto wear to a funeral) it’s an equally useful case study. While it’s true that we live in an era of unprecedented latitude when it comes todress codes, there are plenty of occasions when you’d be best served to err on the side of tradition.Black-tie events, for one. Funerals for another. In keeping with longstanding funerary conventions in the Western world,Saturday’s dress codecalled for a dark suit (which most attendees interpreted to mean black) with a black tie. Which is as it should be. Whether the deceased is the leader of a major world religion or your great aunt in Reno, what you wear to the funeral should reflect the solemnity of the events themselves. And nothing says stylish solemnity like a perfectly tailored black suit, a crisp white shirt, and an expertly knotted black tie. If you don’t own a black suit,this is just one of several excellent reasonsto add one to the rotation (you’ll be surprised how often you wear it). If, however, you don’t have time to go shopping, you still have options. Prince William’s midnight blue suit was well within bounds (note that he adhered to the black tie rule), as was Volodymir Zelensky’s military-style field jacket and matching trousers, which although a definite swerve from convention, was both respectful and on-brand. Both looks managed to adhere to the spirit of the occasion while leaving a little room for personal style, which is exactly the bullseye you should be aiming for. Dress codes are mired in history and tradition, and some of them are more arbitrary than others (seewhite tie, a.k.a. the bougiest dress code of them all.) Wearing black at a funeral has its own history and traditions, but whether or not you ascribe to any of them, there’s one very good reason why you (whether you’re a president, a king, or anyone else) should heed the dress code: it’s not about you. Unless of course you’re Donald Trump, in which case flaunting conventions is absolutely on-brand.",
